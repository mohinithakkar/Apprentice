mouthful he have enough of it the bread be hard and have a bitter taste no fresh would be give until the next morning 's distribution so the commissary officer have will it this be certainly a very hard life sometimes the remembrance of former breakfast come to he such as he have call hygienic when the day after too over-heat a supper he would seat himself by a window on the ground floor of the café-anglai and be serve with a cutlet or buttered egg with asparagus tip and the butler know he taste would bring he a fine bottle of old léoville lie in its basket and which he would pour out with the greatest care the deuce take it that be a good time all the same and he would never become accustomed to this life of wretchedness and in a moment of impatience the young man throw the rest of he

hardimont be already ashamed of he action and now with a feeling of pity watch the poor devil who give proof of such a good appetite he be a tall large young fellow but badly make with feverish eye and a hospital beard and so thin that he shoulder-blade stand out beneath he well-worn cape you be very hungry he say approach the soldier as you see reply the other with he mouth full excuse I then for if i have know that you would like the bread i would not have throw it away it do not harm it reply the soldier i be not dainty no matter say the gentleman it be wrong to do so and i reproach myself but i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of I and as i have some old cognac in my can let we drink a drop together the man have finish eat the duke and he drink a mouthful of brandy the acquaintance be make what be you name ask the soldier of the line hardimont reply the duke omit he title and yours jean-victor -- i have just enter this company -- i be just out of the ambulance -- i

go to commence to be devour by hunger again -- for believe I if you will comrade but such as you see I i have be hungry all my life the word be startling especially to a sybarite who have just be longing for the kitchen of the café-anglai and the duc de hardimont look at he companion in almost terrify amazement the soldier smile sadly show he hungry wolf-like tooth as white as he sickly face and as if understanding that the other expect something further in the way of explanation or confidence : come say he suddenly cease he familiar way of speak doubtless divine that he companion belong to the rich and happy let we walk along the road to warm we foot and i will tell you thing which probably you have never hear of -- i be call jean-victor that be all for i be a foundling and my only

as pale as a wax-taper -- she die afterwards of lung trouble -- i be she favorite and would rather walk by she than play with the other child because she use to draw I to she side and lay she warm thin hand on my forehead but when i be twelve year old after my first communion there be nothing but poverty the manager put I as apprentice with a chair mender in faubourg saint-jacque that be not a trade you know it be impossible to earn one 's live at it and as proof of it the greater part of the time the master be only able to engage the poor little blind boy from the blind asylum it be there that i begin to suffer with hunger the master and mistress two old limousin -- afterwards murder be terrible miser and the bread cut in tiny piece for each meal be keep under lock and key the rest of the time you should have see the mistress at supper time serve the soup sighing at each ladleful she dish out the other apprentice two blind boy be less unhappy they be not give more than i but they could not see the reproachful look the wicked woman use to give I as she hand I my plate and then unfortunately i be always so terribly hungry be it my fault do you think i serve there for three year in a continual fit of hunger three year and one can learn the work in one month but the manager could not know everything and have no suspicion that the child be abused ah you be astonished just now when you see I take the bread out of the mud i be use to that for i have pick up enough of it and crust from the dust and when they be too hard and dry i would soak they all night in my basin i have windfall sometimes such as piece of bread nibble at the end which the child would take out of they basket and throw on the sidewalk as they come from school i use to try to prowl around there when i

always always be hungry the young duke have a kind heart and be profoundly move by this terrible story tell he by a man like himself by a soldier whose uniform make he he equal it be even fortunate for the phlegm of this dandy that the night wind dry the tear which dim he eye jean-victor say he cease in he turn by a delicate tact to speak familiarly to the foundling if we survive this dreadful war we will meet again and i hope that i may be useful to you but in the meantime as there be no bakery but the commissary and as my ration of bread be twice too large for my delicate appetite -- it be understand be it not -- we will share it like good comrade it be strong and hearty the hand-clasp which follow : then harass and worn by they frequent watch and alarm as night fall they return to the tavern where twelve soldier be sleep on the straw and throw themselves down side by side they be soon sleep soundly toward midnight jean-victor awake be hungry probably the wind have scatter the cloud and a ray of moonlight make its way into the room through a hole in the roof lighting up the handsome blonde head of the young duke who be sleep like a endymion still touch by the kindness of he comrade jean-victor be gaze at he with admiration when the sergeant of the platoon open the door and call the five man who be to relieve the sentinel of the out-post the duke be of the number but he

don juan belvidéro be entertain a prince of the house of este in those day a banquet be a marvelous affair which demand princely riches or the power of a nobleman seven pleasure-loving woman chat gaily around a table light by perfumed candle surround by admirable work of art whose white marble stand out against the wall of red stucco and contrast with the rich turkey carpet clothe in satin glitter with gold and laden with gem which sparkle only less brilliantly than they eye they all tell of passion intense but of various style like they beauty they differ neither in they word nor they idea but a expression a look a motion or a emphasis serve as a commentary unrestrained licentious melancholy or banter to they word one seem to say : my beauty have power to rekindle the frozen heart of age another : i love to repose on soft cushion and think with rapture of my adorer a third a novice at these fêtes be incline to blush at the bottom of my heart i feel compunction she seem to say i be a catholic and i fear hell but i love you so -- ah so dearly -- that i would sacrifice eternity to you the fourth empty a cup of chian wine cry : hurrah for pleasure i begin a new existence with each dawn forgetful of the past still intoxicate with the violence of yesterday 's pleasure i embrace a new life of happiness a life fill with love the woman sit next to belvidéro look at he with flash eye she be silent i should have no need to call on a bravo to kill my lover if he abandon I then she have laugh but a comfit dish of marvelous workmanship be shatter between she nervous finger when be you to be grand duke ask the sixth of the prince with a expression of murderous glee on she lip and a look of bacchanalian frenzy in she eye and when be you father go to die say the seventh laughing and throw she bouquet to don juan with maddening coquetry she be a innocent young girl who be accustom to play with sacred thing oh do not speak of it cry the young and handsome don juan there be only one immortal father in the world and unfortunately he be mine the seven woman of ferrara the friend of don juan and the prince himself give a exclamation of horror two hundred year later under loui xv well-bred person would have laugh at this sally but perhaps at the beginning of a orgy the mind have still a unusual degree of lucidity despite the heat of the candle the intensity of the emotion the gold and silver vase the fume of wine despite the vision of ravishing woman perhaps there still lurk in the depths of the heart a little of that respect for thing human and divine which struggle until the revel have drown it in flood of sparkling wine nevertheless the flower be already crush the eye be steep with drink and intoxication to quote rabelai have reach even to the sandal in the pause that follow a door open and as at the feast of balthazar god manifest himself he seem to command recognition now in the person of a old white-haired servant with unsteady gait and draw brow he enter with gloomy mien and he look seem to blight the garland the ruby cup the pyramid of fruit the brightness of the feast the glow of the astonished face and the color of the cushion dent by the white arm of the woman then he cast a pall over this folly by say in a hollow voice the solemn word : sir you father be die don juan rise make a gesture to he guest which might be translate : excuse I this do not happen every day do not the death of a parent often overtake young people thus in the fulness of life in the wild enjoyment of a orgy death be as unexpected in she caprice as a woman in she fancy but more faithful -- death have never dupe any one when don juan have close the door of the banquet hall and walk down the long corridor which be both cold and dark he compel himself to assume a mask for in thinking of he rôle of son he have cast off he merriment as he throw down he napkin the night be black the silent servant who conduct the young man to the death chamber light the way so insufficiently that death aid by the cold the silence the gloom perhaps by a reaction of intoxication be able to force some reflection into the soul of the spendthrift he examine he life and become thoughtful like a man involve in a lawsuit when he set out for the court of justice bartholomeo belvidéro the father of don juan be a old man of ninety who have devote the greater part of he life to business have travel much in oriental country he have acquire there great wealth and learn more precious he say than gold or diamond to which he no longer give more than a pass thought i value a tooth more than a ruby he use to say smile and power more than knowledge this good father love to hear don juan relate he youthful adventure and would say banteringly as he lavish money upon he : only amuse yourself my dear child never do a old man find such pleasure in watch a young man paternal love rob age of its terror in the delight of contemplate so brilliant a life at the age of sixty belvidéro have become enamored of a angel of peace and beauty don juan be the sole fruit of this late love for fifteen year the good man have mourn the loss of he dear juana he many servant and he son attribute the strange habit he have contract to this grief bartholomeo lodge himself in the most uncomfortable wing of he palace and rarely go out and even don juan could not intrude into he father 's apartment without first obtain permission if this voluntary recluse come or go in the palace or in the street of ferrara he seem to be search for something which he could not find he walk dreamily undecidedly preoccupy like a man battle with a idea or with a memory while the young man give magnificent entertainment and the palace re-echo he mirth while the horse paw the ground in the courtyard and the page quarrel at they game of dice on the stair bartholomeo eat seven ounce of bread a day and drink water if he ask for a little poultry it be merely that he might give the bone to a black spaniel he faithful companion he never complain of the noise during he illness if the blast of horn or the bark of dog interrupt he sleep he only say : ah don juan have come home never before be so untroublesome and indulgent a father to be find on this earth consequently young belvidéro accustom to treat he without ceremony have all the fault of a spoil child he attitude toward bartholomeo be like that of a capricious woman toward a elderly lover pass off a impertinence with a smile sell he good humor and submit to be love in call up the picture of he youth don juan recognize that it would be difficult to find a instance in which he father 's goodness have fail he he feel a newborn remorse while he traverse the corridor and he very nearly forgive he father for have live so long he revert to feeling of filial piety as a thief return to honesty in the prospect of enjoy a well-stolen million soon the young man pass into the high chill room of he father 's apartment after feel a moist atmosphere and breathe the heavy air and the musty odor which be give forth by old tapestry and furniture cover with dust he find himself in the antique room of the old man in front of a sick bed and near a die fire a lamp standing on a table of gothic shape shed its stream of uneven light sometimes more sometimes less strongly upon the bed and show the form of the old man in ever-varying aspect the cold air whistle through the insecure window and the snow beat with a dull sound against the pane this scene form so striking a contrast to the one which don juan have just leave that he could not help shudder he feel cold when on approach the bed a sudden flare of light cause by a gust of wind illumine he father 's face the feature be distort the skin cling tightly to the bone have a greenish tint which be make the more horrible by the whiteness of the pillow on which the old man rest draw with pain the mouth gaping and toothless give breath to sigh which the howling of the tempest take tip and draw out into a dismal wail in spite of these sign of dissolution a incredible expression of power shone in the face the eye hallowed by disease retain a singular steadiness a superior spirit be fight there with death it seem as if bartholomeo seek to kill with he die look some enemy seat at the foot of he bed this gaze fixed and cold be make the more appalling by the immobility of the head which be like a skull standing on a doctor 's table the body clearly outline by the coverlet show that the die man 's limb preserve the same rigidity all be dead except the eye there be something mechanical in the sound which come from the mouth don juan feel a certain shame at have come to the deathbed of he father with a courtesan 's bouquet on he breast bring with he the odor of a banquet and the fume of wine you be enjoy yourself cry the old man on see he son at the same moment the pure high voice of a singer who entertain the guest strengthen by the chord of the viol by which she be accompany rise above the roar of the storm and penetrate the chamber of death don juan would gladly have shut out this barbarous confirmation of he father 's word bartholomeo say : i do not grudge you you pleasure my child these word full of tenderness pained don juan who could not forgive he father for such goodness what sorrow for I father he cry poor juanino answer the die man i have always be so gentle toward you that you could not wish for my death oh cry don juan if it be possible to preserve you life by give you a part of mine -lrb-

voice weaken by this last effort i have no more desire to die than you have to give up you lady love wine horse falcon hound and money -- i can well believe it think he son kneel beside the pillow and kiss one of bartholomeo 's cadaverous hand but father he say aloud my dear father we must submit to the will of god god i be also god growl the old man do not blaspheme cry the young man see the menacing expression which be overspread he father 's feature be careful what you say for you have receive extreme unction and i should never be console if you be to die in a state of sin be you go to listen to I cry the die man gnash he toothless jaw don juan hold he peace a horrible silence reign through the dull wail of the snowstorm come again the melody of the viol and the heavenly voice faint as the dawn day the die man smile i thank you for have bring singer and music a banquet young and beautiful woman with dark lock all the pleasure of life let they remain i be about to be bear again the delirium be at its height say don juan to himself i have discover a means of resuscitation there look in the drawer of the table -- you open it by press a hidden spring near the griffin i have it father good now take out a little flask of rock crystal here it be i have spend twenty year in -- at this point the old man feel he end approach and collect all he energy to say : as soon as i have draw my last breath rub I with this water and i shall come to life again there be very little of it reply the young man bartholomeo be no longer able to speak but he could still hear and see at these word he turn he head toward don juan with a violent wrench he neck remain twist like that of a marble statue doom by the sculptor 's whim to look forever sideways he stare eye assume a hideous fixity he be dead dead in the act of lose he only he last illusion in seek a shelter in he son 's heart he have find a tomb more hollow than those which man dig for they dead he hair too have rise with horror and he tense gaze seem still to speak it be a father rise in wrath from he sepulchre to demand vengeance of god there the good man be do for exclaimed don juan intent upon take the magic crystal to the light of the lamp as a drinker examine he bottle at the end of a repast he have not see he father 's eye pale the cower dog look alternately at he dead master and at the elixir as don juan regard by turn he father and the phial the lamp throw out fitful wave of light the silence be profound the viol be mute belvidéro think he see he father move and he tremble frighten by the tense expression of the accuse eye he close they just as he would have push down a window-blind on a autumn night he stand motionless lose in a world of thought suddenly a sharp creak like that of a rusty spring break the silence don juan in he surprise almost drop the flask a perspiration colder than the steel of a dagger ooze out from he pore a cock of paint wood come forth from a clock and crow three time it be one of those ingenious invention by which the savant of that time be awaken at the hour fix for they work already the daybreak redden the casement the old timepiece be more faithful in its master 's service than don juan have be in he duty to bartholomeo this instrument be compose of wood pulley cord and wheel while he have that mechanism peculiar to man call a heart in order to run no further risk of lose the mysterious liquid the skeptical don juan replace it in the drawer of the little gothic table at this solemn moment he hear a tumult in the corridor there be confuse voice stifle laughter light footstep the rustle of silk in short the noise of a merry troop try to collect itself in some sort of order the door open and the prince the seven woman the friend of don juan and the singer appear in the fantastic disorder of dancer overtake by the morning when the sun dispute the paling light of the candle they come to offer the young heir the conventional condolence oh oh be poor don juan really take this death seriously say the prince in la brambillum 's ear well he father be a very good man she reply nevertheless don juan 's nocturnal meditation have print so strike a expression upon he face that it command silence the man stop motionless the woman whose lip have be parch with wine throw themselves on they knee and begin to pray don juan could not help shudder as he see this splendor this joy laughter song beauty life personify do homage thus to death but in this adorable italy religion and revelry be on such good term that religion be a sort of debauch and debauch religion the prince press don juan 's hand affectionately then all the figure have give expression to the same look half-sympathy half-indifference the phantasmagoria disappear leave the chamber empty it be indeed a faithful image of life go down the stair the prince say to la rivabarellum : heigho who would have think don juan a mere boaster of impiety he love he father after all do you notice the black dog ask la brambilla he be immensely rich now sigh bianca cavatolinus what be that to I cry the proud veronese she who have break the comfit dish what be that to you exclaim the duke with he ducat he be as much a prince as i be at first don juan sway by a thousand thought waver toward many different resolution after have ascertain the amount of the wealth amass by he father he return in the evening to the death chamber he soul puff up with a horrible egoism in the apartment he find all the servant of the household busy in collect the ornament for the bed of state on which feu monseigneur would lie to-morrow -- a curious spectacle which all ferrara would come to admire don juan make a sign and the servant stop at once speechless and tremble leave I alone he say in a altered voice and do not return until i go out again when the step of the old servant who be the last to leave have die away on the stone flooring don juan lock the door hastily and sure that he be alone exclaim : now let we try the body of bartholomeo lay on a long table to hide the revolting spectacle of a corpse whose extreme decrepitude and thinness make it look like a skeleton the embalmer have draw a sheet over the body which cover all but the head this mummy-like figure be lay out in the middle of the room and the linen naturally cling outline the form vaguely but show its stiff bony thinness the face already have large purple spot which show the urgency of complete the embalming despite the skepticism with which don juan be arm he tremble as he uncork the magic phial of crystal when he stand close to the head he shake so that he be oblige to pause for a moment but this young man have allow himself to be corrupt by the custom of a dissolute court a idea worthy of the duke of urbino come to he and give he a courage which be spur on by lively curiosity it seem as if the demon have whisper the word which resound in he heart : bathe a eye he take a piece of linen and after have moisten it sparingly with the precious liquid he pass it gently over the right eyelid of the corpse the eye open ah say don juan grip the flask in he hand as we clutch in we dream the branch by which we be suspend over a precipice he see a eye full of life a child 's eye in a death 's head the liquid eye of youth in which the light tremble protect by beautiful black lash it scintillate like one of those solitary light which traveler see in lonely place on winter evening it seem as if the glowing eye would pierce don juan it think accuse condemn threaten judge speak -- it cry it snap at he there be the most tender supplication a royal anger then the love of a young girl implore mercy of she executioner finally the awful look that a man cast upon he fellow-man on he way to the scaffold so much life shone in this fragment of life that don juan recoil in terror he walk up and down the room not daring to look at the eye which stare back at he from the ceiling and from the hanging the room be sow with point full of fire of life of intelligence everywhere gleam eye which shriek at he he might have live a hundred year longer he cry involuntarily when lead in front of he father by some diabolical influence he contemplate the luminous spark suddenly the intelligent eye close and then open again abruptly as if assent if a voice have cry yes don juan could not have be more startled what be to be do he think he have the courage to try to close this white eyelid but he effort be in vain shall i crush it out perhaps that would be parricide he ask himself yes say the eye by means of a ironical wink ah cry don juan there be sorcery in it he approach the eye to crush it a large tear roll down the hollow cheek of the corpse and fall on belvidéro 's hand it be scalding he cry sit down this struggle have exhaust he as if like jacob he have battle with a angel at last he arise say : so long as there be no blood -- then collect all the courage need for the cowardly act he crush out the eye press it in with the linen without look at it a deep moan startling and terrible be hear it be the poor spaniel who die with a howl could he have be in the secret don juan wonder survey the faithful animal don juan be consider a dutiful son he raise a monument of white marble over he father 's tomb and employ the most prominent artist of the time to carve the figure he be not altogether at ease until the statue of he father kneel before religion impose its enormous weight on the grave in which he have bury the only regret that have ever touch he heart and that only in moment of physical depression on make a inventory of the immense wealth amass by the old orientalist don juan become avaricious have he not two human life in which he should need money he deep search gaze penetrate the principle of social life and he understand the world all the better because he view it across a tomb he analyze man and thing that he might have do at once with the past represent by history with the present express by the law and with the future reveal by religion he take soul and matter throw they into a crucible and find nothing there and from that time forth he become don juan master of the illusion of life he throw himself -- young and beautiful -- into life despise the world but seize the world he happiness could never be of that bourgeois type which be satisfy by boil beef by a welcome warming-pan in winter a lamp at night and new slipper at each quarter he grasp existence as a monkey seize a nut peel off the coarse shell to enjoy the savory kernel the poetry and sublime transport of human passion touch no higher than he instep he never make the mistake of those strong man who imagine that little soul believe in the great venture to exchange noble thought of the future for the small coin of we idea of life he might like they have walk with he foot on earth and he head among the cloud but he prefer to sit at he ease and sear with he kiss the lip of more than one tender fresh and sweet woman like death wherever he pass he devour all without scruple demand a passionate oriental love and easily win pleasure loving only woman in woman he soul find its natural trend in irony when he inamorata mount to the sky in a ecstasy of bliss don juan follow serious unreserved sincere as a german student but he say i while he lady love in she folly say we he know admirably how to yield himself to a woman 's influence he be always clever enough to make she believe that he tremble like a college youth who ask he first partner at a ball : do you like dancing but he could also be terrible when necessary he could draw he sword and destroy skilled soldier there be banter in he simplicity and laughter in he tear for he could weep as well as any woman who say to she husband : give I a carriage or i shall pine to death for merchant the world mean a bale of goods or a quantity of circulate note for most young man it be a woman for some woman it be a man for certain nature it be society a set of people a position a city for don juan the universe be himself noble fascinating and a model of grace he fasten he bark to every bank but he allow himself to be carry only where he wish to go the more he see the more skeptical he become probe human nature he soon guess that courage be rashness prudence cowardice generosity shrewd calculation justice a crime delicacy pusillanimity honesty policy and by a singular fatality he perceive that the person who be really honest delicate just generous prudent and courageous receive no consideration at the hand of they fellow what a cheerless jest he cry it do not come from a god and then renounce a better world he show no mark of respect to holy thing and regard the marble saint in the church merely as work of art he understand the mechanism of human society and never offend too much against the current prejudice for the executioner have more power than he but he bent the social law to he will with the grace and wit that be so well display in he scene with m dimanche he be in short the embodiment of molière 's don juan goethe 's faust byron 's manfred and maturin 's melmoth -- grand picture draw by the greatest genius of europe and to which neither the harmony of mozart nor the lyric strain of rossinus be lack terrible picture in which the power of evil exist in man be immortalize and which be repeat from one century to another whether the type come to parley with mankind by incarnate itself in mirabeau or be content to work in silence like bonaparte or to goad on the universe by sarcasm like the divine rabelai or again to laugh at man instead of insulting thing like maréchal de richelieu or still better perhaps if it mock both man and thing like we most celebrated ambassador but the deep genius of don juan incorporate in advance all these he play with everything he life be a mockery which embrace man thing institution idea as for eternity he have chat for half a hour with pope julius ii and at the end of the conversation he say laughing : if it be absolutely necessary to choose i should rather believe in god than in the devil power combine with goodness have always more possibility than the spirit of evil yes but god want one to do penance in this world be you always think of you indulgence reply belvidéro well i have a whole existence in reserve to repent the fault of my first life oh if that be you idea of old age cry the pope you be in danger of be canonize after you elevation to the papacy one may expect anything and then they go to watch the workman engage in build the huge basilica consecrate to st peter st peter be the genius who give we we double power say the pope to don juan and he deserve this monument but sometimes at night i fancy that a deluge will pass a sponge over all this and it will need to be begin over again don juan and the pope laugh they understand each other a fool would have go next day to amuse himself with julius ii at raphael 's house or in the delightful villa madama but belvidéro go to see he officiate in he pontifical capacity in order to convince himself of he suspicion under the influence of wine dellum rovere would have be capable of forget himself and criticise the apocalypse when don juan reach the age of sixty he go to live in spain there in he old age he marry a young and charming andalusian but he be intentionally neither a good father nor a good husband he have observe that we be never so tenderly love as by the woman to whom we scarcely give a thought doña elvira piously rear by a old aunt in the heart of andalusium in a castle several league from san luca be all devotion and meekness don juan see that this young girl be a woman to make a long fight with a passion before yield to it so he hope to keep from she any love but he until after he death it be a serious jest a game of chess which he have reserve for he old age warn by he father 's mistake he determine to make the most trifling act of he old age contribute to the success of the drama which be to take place at he deathbed therefore the greater part of he wealth lay bury in the cellar of he palace at ferrara whither he seldom go the rest of he fortune be invest in a life annuity so that he wife and child might be interested in keep he alive this be a species of cleverness which he father should have practice but this machiavellian scheme be unnecessary in he case young philippe belvidéro he son grow up a spaniard as conscientiously religious as he father be impious on the principle of the proverb : a miserly father a spendthrift son the abbot of san luca be select by don juan to direct the conscience of the duchess of belvidéro and of philippe this ecclesiastic be a holy man of fine carriage well proportion with beautiful black eye and a head like tiberius he be wearied with fast pale and worn and continually battle with temptation like all recluse the old nobleman still hope perhaps to be able to kill a monk before finish he first lease of life but whether the abbot be as clever as don juan or whether doña elvira have more prudence or virtue than spain usually accord to woman don juan be oblige to pass he last day like a country parson without scandal sometimes he take pleasure in find he wife and son remiss in they religious duty and insist imperiously that they should fulfil all the obligation impose upon the faithful by the court of rome he be never so happy as when listen to the gallant abbot of san luca doña elvira and philippe engage in argue a case of conscience nevertheless despite the great care which the lord of belvidéro bestow upon he person the day of decrepitude arrive with this age of pain come cry of helplessness cry make the more piteous by the remembrance of he impetuous youth and he ripe maturity this man for whom the last jest in the farce be to make other believe in the law and principle at which he scoff be compel to close he eye at night upon a uncertainty this model of good breeding this duke spirit in a orgy this brilliant courtier gracious toward woman whose heart he have wring as a peasant bend a willow wand this man of genius have a obstinate cough a troublesome sciatica and a cruel gout he see he tooth leave he as at the end of a evening the fairest best dress woman depart one by one leave the ballroom desert and empty he bold hand tremble he graceful limb totter and then one night apoplexy turn its hooked and icy finger around he throat from this fateful day he become morose and harsh he accuse he wife and son of be insincere in they devotion charge that they touching and gentle care be shower upon he so tenderly only because he money be all invest elvira and philippe shed bitter tear and redouble they caress to this malicious old man whose broken voice would become affectionate to say : my friend my dear wife you will forgive I will you not i torment you sometimes ah great god how canst thou make use of I thus to prove these two angelic creature i who should be they joy be they bane it be thus that he hold they at he bedside make they forget whole month of impatience and cruelty by one hour in which he display to they the new treasure of he favor and a false tenderness it be a paternal system which succeed infinitely better than that which he father have formerly employ toward he finally he reach such a state of illness that maneuver like those of a small boat enter a dangerous canal be necessary in order to pus he to bed then the day of death come this brilliant and skeptical man whose intellect only be leave unimpaired by the general decay live between a doctor and a confessor he two antipathy but he be jovial with they be there not a bright light

evening that don juan feel the approach of death the spanish sky be gloriously clear the orange tree perfumed the air and the star cast a fresh glowing light nature seem to give pledge of he resurrection a pious and obedient son regard he with love and respect about eleven o'clock he signify he wish to be leave alone with this sincere be philippe he begin in a voice so tender and affectionate that the young man tremble and weep with happiness for he father have never say philippe like this before listen to I my son continue the die man i have be a great sinner and all my life i have think about death formerly i be the friend of the great pope julius ii this illustrious pontiff fear that the excessive excitability of my feeling would cause I to commit some deadly sin at the moment of my death after i have receive the bless ointment he make I a present of a flask of holy water that gush forth from a rock in the desert i keep the secret of the theft of the church 's treasure but i be authorize to reveal the mystery to my son ` in articulo mortis ' you will find the flask in the drawer of the gothic table which always stand at my bedside the precious crystal may be of service to you also my dearest philippe will you swear to I by you eternal salvation that you will carry out my order faithfully philippe look at he father don juan be too well verse in human expression not to know that he could die peacefully in perfect faith in such a look as he father have die in despair at he own expression you deserve a different father continue don juan i must acknowledge that when the estimable abbot of san luca be administer the viaticum ' i be think of the incompatibility of two so wide-spreading power as that of the devil and that of god oh father and i say to myself that when satan make he peace he will be a great idiot if he do not bargain for the pardon of he follower this think haunt I so my child i shall go to hell if you do not carry out my wish oh tell they to I at once father as soon as i have close my eye reply don juan and that may be in a few minute you must take my body still warm and lay it on a table in the middle of the room then put out the lamp -- the light of the star will be sufficient you must take off my clothes and while you recite ` pater ' and ` aves ' and uplift you soul to god you must moisten my eye my lip all my head first and then my body with this holy water but my dear son the power of god be great you must not be astonish at anything at this point don juan feel the approach of death add in a terrible voice : be careful of the flask then he die gently in the arm of he son whose tear fall upon he ironical and sallow face it be nearly midnight when don philippe belvidéro place he father 's corpse on the table after kiss the stern forehead and the gray hair he put out the lamp the soft ray of the moonlight which cast fantastic reflection over the scenery allow the pious philippe to discern he father 's body dimly as something white in the midst of the darkness the young man moisten a cloth in the liquid and then deep in prayer he faithfully anoint the revered head the silence be intense then he hear indescribable rustling but he attribute they to the wind among the tree-top when he have bath the right arm he feel himself rudely seize at the back of the neck by a arm young and vigorous -- the arm of he father he give a piercing cry and drop the phial which fall on the floor and break the liquid flow out the whole household rush in bear torch the cry have arouse and frighten they as if the trumpet of the last judgment have shake the world the room be crowd with people the tremble throng see don philippe fainting but hold up by the powerful arm of he father which clutch he neck then they see a supernatural sight the head of don juan young and beautiful as a antinoüs a head with black hair brilliant eye and crimson lip a head that move in a blood-curdling manner without be able to stir the skeleton to which it belong a old servant cry : a miracle and all the spaniard repeat : a miracle too pious to admit the possibility of magic doña elvira send for the abbot of san luca when the priest see the miracle with he own eye he resolve to profit by it like a man of sense and like a abbot who ask nothing better than to increase he revenue declare that don juan must inevitably be canonize he appoint he monastery for the ceremony of the apotheosis the monastery he say should henceforth be call san juan de luca at these word the head make a facetious grimace the taste of the spaniard for this sort of solemnity be so well know that it should not be difficult to imagine the religious spectacle with which the abbey of san luca celebrate the translation of the bless don juan belvidéro in its church a few day after the death of this illustrious nobleman the miracle of he partial resurrection have be so thoroughly spread from village to village throughout a circle of more than fifty league round san luca that it be as good as a play to see the curious people on the road they come from all side draw by the prospect of a te deum chant by the light of burn torch the ancient mosque of the monastery of san luca a wonderful building erect by the moor which for three hundred year have resound with the name of jesus christ instead of allah could not hold the

silver the gallery the moorish fretwork the most delicate feature of this delicate carve be all reveal in the dazzling brightness like the fantastic figure which be form in a glowing fire it be a sea of light surmount at the end of the church by the gilded choir where the high altar rise in glory which rival the rise sun but the magnificence of the golden lamp the silver candlestick the banner the

voice pure and high ecstatic woman 's voice blended with the deep sonorous tone of the man thousand of voice so powerful that they drown the organ in spite of the bellowing of its pipe the shrill note

adoration the superior man mock those who compliment he and compliment those whom he mock in the depths of he heart when the abbot bow low before the altar chant : ` sancte johannes ora pro nobis ' he

the priest rush to the assistance of they chief imbecile now say that there be a god cry the voice just as the abbot expire the age for love by paul bourget when i submit the plan of my inquiry upon the age for love to the editor-in-chief of the boulevard the highest type of french literary paper he seem astonished that a idea so journalistic -- that be he word -- should have be evolve from the brain of he most recent acquisition i have be with he two week and it be my first contribution give I some detail my dear labarthe he say in a somewhat less insolent manner than be he wont after listen to I for a few moment he continue : that be good you will go and interview certain man and woman first upon the age at which one love the most next upon the age when one be most love be that you idea and now to whom will you go first i have prepare a list i reply and take from my pocket a sheet of paper i have jot down the name of a number of celebrity whom i propose to interview on this all-important question and i begin to read over my list it contain two ex-government official a general a dominican father four actress two café-concert singer four actor two financier two lawyer a surgeon and a lot of literary celebrity at some of the name my chief would nod he approval at other he would say curtly with a affectation of american manners bad strike it off until i come to the name i have keep for the last that of pierre fauchery the famous novelist strike that off he say shrug he shoulder he be not on good term with we and yet i suggest be there any one whose opinion would be of greater interest to read man as well as to woman i have even think of begin with he the devil you have interrupt the editor-in-chief it be one of fauchery 's principle not to see any reporter i have send he ten if i have one and he have show they all the door the boulevard do not relish such treatment so we have give he some pretty hard hit nevertheless i will have a interview with fauchery for the boulevard be my reply i be sure of it if you succeed he reply i 'll raise you salary that man make I tired with he scorn of newspaper notoriety he must take he share of it like the rest but you will not succeed what make you think you can permit I to tell you my reason later in forty-eight hour you will see whether i have succeed or not go and do not spare the fellow decidedly i have make some progress as a journalist even in my two week ' apprenticeship if i could permit pascal to speak in this way of the man i most admire among live writer since that not far-distant time when tire of be poor i have make up my mind to cast my lot with the multitude in paris i have try to lay aside my old self as lizard do they skin and i have almost succeed in a former time a former time that be but yesterday i know -- for in a drawer full of poem drama and half-finished tale i have proof of it -- that there have once exist a certain jule labarthe who have come to pari with the hope of become a great man that person believe in literature with a capital l in the ideal another capital in glory a third capital he be now dead and bury would he some day he position assure begin to write once more from pure love of he art possibly but for the moment i know only the energetic practical labarthe who have join the procession with the idea of get into the front rank and of obtain as soon as possible a income of thirty thousand franc a year what would it matter to this second individual if that vile pascal should boast of have steal a march on the most delicate the most powerful of the heir of balzac since i the new labarthe be capable of look forward to a operation which require about as much delicacy as some of the performance of my editor-in-chief i have as a matter of fact a sure means of obtain the interview it be this : when i be young and simple i have send some verse and story to pierre fauchery the same verse and story the refusal of which by four editor have finally make I decide to enter the field of journalism the great writer be travel at this time but he have reply to I i have respond by a letter to which he again reply this time with a invitation to call upon he i go i do not find he i go again i do not find he that time then a sort of timidity prevent my return to the charge so i have never meet he he know I only as the young elium of my two epistle this be what i count upon to extort from he the favor of a interview which he certainly would refuse to a mere newspaper man my plan be simple to present myself at he house to be receive to conceal my real occupation to sketch vaguely a subject for a novel in which there should occur a discussion upon the age for love to make he talk and then when he should discover he conversation in print -- here i begin to feel some remorse but i stifle it with the terrible phrase the struggle for life and also by the recollection of numerous example cull from the firm with which i now have the honor of be connect the morning after i have have this very literary conversation with my honorable director i ring at the door of the small house in the rue desbordes-valmore where pierre fauchery live in a retired corner of passy have take up my pen to tell a plain unvarnished tale i do not see how i can conceal the wretched feeling of pleasure which as i ring the bell warm my heart at the thought of the good joke i be about to play on the owner of this peaceful abode even after make up one 's mind to the sacrifice i have decide upon there be always leave a trace of envy for those who have triumph in the melancholy struggle for literary supremacy it be a real disappointment to I when the servant reply ill-humoredly that m fauchery be not in paris i ask when he would return the servant do not know i ask for he address the servant do not know that poor lion who think he have secure anonymity for he holiday a half-hour later i have discover that he be stay for the present at the château de proby near nemor i have merely have to make inquiry of he publisher two hour later i buy my ticket at the gare de lyon for the little town choose by balzac as the scene for he delicious story of ursule mirouet i take a travel bag and be prepare to spend the night there in case i fail to see the master that afternoon i have decide to make sure of he the next morning exactly seven hour after the servant faithful to he trust have declare that he do not know where he master be stay i be stand in the hall of the château wait for my card to be send up i have take care to write on it a reminder of we conversation of the year before and this time after a ten-minute wait in the hall during which i notice with singular curiosity and _ malice _ two very elegant and very pretty young woman go out for a walk i be admit to he presence aha i say to myself this then be the secret of he exile the interview promise well the novelist receive I in a cosy little room with a window opening onto the park already begin to turn yellow with the advance autumn a wood fire burn in the fireplace and light up the wall which be hang with flowered cretonne and on which could be distinguish several color english print represent cross-country ride and the jump of hedge here be the worldly environment with which fauchery be so often reproach but the book and papers that litter the table bear witness that the present occupant of this charming retreat remain a substantial man of letter he habit of constant work be still further attest by he face which i admit give I all at once a feeling of remorse for the trick i be about to play he if i have find he the snobbish pretender whom the weekly newspaper be in the habit of ridicule it would have be a delight to outwit he diplomacy but no i see as he put down he pen to receive I a man about fifty-seven year old with a face that bear the mark of reflection eye tire from sleeplessness a brow heavy with thought who say as he point to a easy chair you will excuse I my dear confrère for keep you wait i he dear confrère ah if he have know you see and he point to the page still wet with ink that man can not be free from the slavery of furnish copy one have less facility at my age than at yours now let we speak of yourself how do you happen to be at nemor what have you be do since the story and the verse you be kind enough to send I it be vain to try to sacrifice once for all one 's youthful ideal when a man have love literature as i love it at twenty he can not be satisfy at twenty-six to give up he early passion even at the bidding of implacable necessity so pierre fauchery remember my poor verse he have actually read my story he allusion prove it could i tell he at such a moment that since the creation of those first work i have despair of myself and that i have change my gun to the other shoulder the image of the boulevard office rise suddenly before I i hear the voice of the editor-in-chief say interview fauchery you will never accomplish that so faithful to my self-imposed rôle i reply i have retire to nemor to work upon a novel call the age for love and it be on this subject that i wish to consult you my dear master it seem to I -- it may possibly have be a illusion -- that at the announcement of the so-called title of my so-called novel a smile and a shadow flit over fauchery 's eye and mouth a vision of the two young woman i have meet in the hall come back to I be the author of so many great masterpiece of analysis about to live a new book before write it i have no time to answer this question for with a glance at a onyx vase contain some cigarette of turkish tobacco he offer I one light one himself and begin first to question then to reply to I i listen while he think aloud and have almost forget my machiavellian combination so keen be my relish of the joyous intimacy of this communion with a mind i have passionately love in he work he be the first of the great writer of we day whom i have thus approach on something like term of intimacy as we talk i observe the strange similarity between he speak and he written word i admire the charming simplicity with which he abandon himself to the pleasure of imagination he superabundant intelligence the liveliness of he impression and he total absence of arrogance and of pose there be no such thing as a age for love he say in substance because the man capable of loving -- in the complex and modern sense of love as a sort of ideal exaltation -- never cease to love i will go further he never cease to love the same person you know the experiment that a contemporary physiologist try with a series of portrait to determine in what the indefinable resemblance call family likeness consist he take photograph of twenty person of the same blood then he photograph these photograph on the same plate one over the other in this way he discover the common feature which determine the type well i be convince that if we could try a similar experiment and photograph one upon another the picture of the different woman whom the same man have love or think he have love in the course of he life we should discover that all these woman resemble one another the most inconsistent have cherish one and the same be through five or six or even twenty different embodiment the main point be to find out at what age they have meet the woman who approach nearest to the one whose image they have constantly bear within themselves for they that would be the age for love the age for be love he continue the deepest of all the passion i have ever know a man to inspire be in the case of one of my master a poet and he be sixty year old at the time it be true that he still hold himself as erect as a young man he come and go with a step as light as yours he converse like rivarol he compose verse as beautiful as de vigny 's he be besides very poor very lonely and very unhappy have lose one after another he wife and he child you remember the word of shakespeare 's moor : ` she love I for the danger i have pass and i love she that she do pity they ' so it be that this great artist inspire in a beautiful noble and wealthy young russian woman a devotion so passionate that because of he she never marry she find a way to take care of he day and night in spite of he family during he last illness and at the present time have buy from he heir all of the poet 's personal belongings she keep the apartment where he live just as it be at the time of he death that be year ago in she case she find in a man three time she own age the person who correspond to a certain ideal which she carry in she heart look at goethe at lamartine and at many other to depict feeling on this high plane you must give up the process of minute and insignificant observation which be the bane of the artist of to-day in order that a sixty-year-old lover should appear neither ridiculous nor odious you must apply to he what the elder corneille so proudly say of himself in he line to the marquise : ` cependant j' be quelque charme qui sont assez eclatant pour n'avoir pas trop d'alarmes de ces ravages du temp ' have the courage to analyze great emotion to create character who shall be lofty and true the whole art of the analytical novel lie there as he speak the master have such a light of intellectual certainty in he eye that to I he seem the embodiment of one of those great character he have be urge I to describe it make I feel that the theory of this man himself almost a sexagenarian that at any age one may inspire love be not unreasonable the contrast between the world of idea in which he move and the atmosphere of the literary shop in which for the last few month i have be stifle be too strong the dream of my youth be realize in this man whose gift remain unimpaired after the production of thirty volume and whose face grow old be a living illustration of the beautiful saying : since we must wear out let we wear out nobly he slender figure bespoke the austerity of long hour of work he firm mouth show he decision of character he brow with its deep furrow have the paleness of the paper over which he so often bent and yet the refinement of he hand so well care for the sober elegance of he dress and a aristocratic air that be natural to he show that the finer professional virtue have be cultivate in the midst of a life of frivolous temptation these temptation have be no more of a disturbance to he ethical and spiritual nature than the academic honor the financial success the numerous edition that have be he withal he be a awfully good fellow for after have talk at great length with I he end by say since you be stay in nemor i hope to see you often and to-day i can not let you go without present you to my hostess what could i say this be the way in which a mere reporter on the boulevard find himself install at a five-o'clock tea-table in the salon of a château where surely no newspaper man have ever before set foot and be present as a young poet and novelist of the future to the old marquise de proby whose guest the master be this amiable white-haired dowager question I upon my alleged work and i reply equivocally with blush which the good lady must have attribute to bashful timidity then as though some evil genius have conspire to multiply the witness of my bad conduct the two young woman whom i have see go out return in the midst of my unlooked-for visit ah my interview with this student of femininity upon the age for love be about to have a living commentary how it would illumine he word to hear he converse with these new arrival one be a young girl of possibly twenty -- a russian if i rightly understand the name she be rather tall with a long face light up by two very gentle black eye singular in they fire and intensity she bear a striking resemblance to the portrait attribute to froncium in the salon carré of the louvre which go by the name of the man in black because the color of he clothes and he mantle about she mouth and nostril be that same subdue nervousness that same restrained feverishness which give to the portrait its striking quality i have not be there a quarter of a hour before i have guess from the way she watch and listen to fauchery what a passionate interest the old master inspire in she when he speak she pay rapt attention when she speak to he i feel she voice shiver if i may use the word and he he glorious writer surfeit with triumph exhaust by he labor seem as soon as he feel the radiance of she glance of ingenuous idolatry to recover that vivacity that elasticity of impression which be the sovereign grace of youthful lover i understand now why he cite goethe and the young girl of marienbad say i to myself with a laugh as my hire carriage speed on toward nemor he be think of himself he be in love with that child and she be in love with he we shall hear of he marry she there be a wedding that will call forth copy and when pascal hear that i witness the courtship -- but just now i must think of my interview will not fauchery be surprise to read it day after to-morrow in he paper but do he read the papers it may not be right but what harm will it do he besides it be a part of the struggle for life it be by such reasoning i remember the reasoning of a man determine to arrive that i try to lull to sleep the inward voice that cry you have no right to put on paper to give to the public what this noble writer say to you suppose that he be receive a poet not a reporter but i hear also the voice of my chief say you will never succeed and this second voice i be ashamed to confess triumph over the other with all the more ease because i be oblige to do something to kill time i reach nemor too late for the train which would have bring I back to pari about dinner time at the old inn they give I a room which be clean and quiet a good place to write so i spend the evening until bedtime compose the first of the article which be to form my inquiry i scribble away under the vivid impression of the afternoon my power as well as my nerve spur by a touch of remorse yes i scribble four page which would have be no disgrace to the journal des goncourt that exquisite manual of the perfect reporter it be all there my journey my arrival at the chateau a sketch of the quaint eighteenth century building with its fringe of tree and its well-kept walk the master 's room the master himself and he conversation the tea at the end and the smile of the old novelist in the midst of a circle of admirer old and young it lack only a few closing line i will add these in the morning i think and go to bed with a feeling of duty perform such be the nature of a writer under the form of a interview i have do and i know it the best work of my life what happen while we sleep be there unknown to we a secret and irresistible ferment of idea while we sens be close to the impression of the outside world certain it be that on awakening i be apt to find myself in a state of mind very different from that in which i go to sleep i have not be awake ten minute before the image of pierre fauchery come up before I and at the same time the thought that i have take a base advantage of the kindness of he reception of I become quite unbearable i feel a passionate longing to see he again to ask he pardon for my deception i wish to tell he who i be with what purpose i have go to he and that i regret it but there be no need of a confession it would be enough to destroy the page i have write the night before with this idea i arise before tear they up i reread they and then -- any writer will understand I -- and then they seem to I so brilliant that i do not tear they up fauchery be so intelligent so generous be the thought that cross my mind what be there in this interview after all to offend he nothing absolutely nothing even if i should go to he again this very morning tell he my story and that upon the success of my little inquiry my whole future as a journalist might depend when he find that i have have five year of poverty and hard work without accomplish anything and that i have have to go onto a paper in order to earn the very bread i eat he would pardon I he would pity I and he would say publish you interview yes but what if he should forbid my publish it but no he would not do that i pass the morning in consider my latest plan a certain shyness make it very painful to I but it might at the same time conciliate my delicate scruple my amour-propre as a ambitious chronicler and the interest of my pocket-book i know that pascal have the name of be very generous with a interview article if it please he and besides have he not promise I a reward if i succeed with fauchery in short i have decide to try my experiment when after a hasty breakfast i see on step into the carriage i have have the night before a victorium with coat-of-arm drive rapidly past and be stun at recognize fauchery himself apparently lose in a gloomy revery that be in singular contrast to he high spirit of the night before a small trunk on the coachman 's seat be a sufficient indication that he be go to the station the train for paris leave in twelve minute time enough for I to pack my thing pell-mell into my valise and hurriedly to pay my bill the same carriage which be to have take I to the château de proby carry I to the station at full speed and when the train leave i be seat in a empty compartment opposite the famous writer who be say to I you too desert nemor like I you work best in paris the conversation begin in this way might easily have lead to the confession i have resolve to make but in the presence of my unexpected companion i be seize with a unconquerable shyness moreover he inspire I with a curiosity which be quite equal to my shyness any number of circumstance from a telegram from a sick relative to the most commonplace matter of business might have explain he sudden departure from the château where i have leave he so comfortably install the night before but that the expression of he face should have change as it have that in eighteen hour he should have become the careworn discourage be he now seem when i have leave he so pleased with life so happy so assiduous in he attention to that pretty girl mademoiselle de russaie who love he and whom he seem to love be a mystery which take complete possession of I this time without any underlie professional motive he be to give I the key before we reach pari at any rate i shall always believe that part of he conversation be in a indirect way a confidence he be still unstrung by the unexpected incident which have cause both he hasty departure and the sudden metamorphosis in what he himself if he have be write would have call he intimate heaven the story he tell I be per sfogarsus as bayle love to say he idea be that i would not discover the real hero i shall always believe that it be he own story under another name and i love to believe it because it be so exactly he way of look at thing it be apropo of the suppose subject of my novel -- oh irony -- apropo of the real subject of my interview that he begin i have be think about we conversation and about you book and i be afraid that i express myself badly yesterday when i say that one may love and be love at any age i ought to have add that sometimes this love come too late it come when one no longer have the right to prove to the loved one how much she be love except by love 's sacrifice i should like to share with you a human document as they say to-day which be in itself a drama with a dénouement but i must ask you not to use it for the secret be not my own with the assurance of my discretion he go on : i have a friend a companion of my own age who when he be twenty have love a young girl he be poor she be rich she family separate they the girl marry some one else and almost immediately afterward she die my friend live some day you will know for yourself that it be almost as true to say that one recover from all thing as that there be nothing which do not leave its scar i have be the confidant of he serious passion and i become the confidant of the various affair that follow that first ineffaceable disappointment he feel he inspire other love he taste other joy he endure other sorrow and yet when we be alone and when we touch upon those confidence that come from the heart 's depths the girl who be the ideal of he twentieth year reappear in he word how many time he have say to I ` in other i have always look for she and as i have never find she i have never truly love any one but she ' and have she love he i interrupted he do not think so reply fauchery at least she have never tell he so well you must now imagine my friend at my age or almost there you must picture he grow gray tired of life and convinced that he have at last discover the secret of peace at this time he meet while visit some relative in a country house a mere girl of twenty who be the image the haunting image of she whom he have hope to marry thirty year before it be one of those strange resemblance which extend from the color of the eye to the ` timbre ' of the voice from the smile to the think from the gesture to the finest feeling of the heart i could not in a few disjointed phrase describe to you the strange emotion of my friend it would take page and page to make you understand the tenderness both present and at the same time retrospective for the dead through the live the hypnotic condition of the soul which do not know where dream and memory end and present feeling begin the daily commingling of the most unreal thing in the world the phantom of a lose love with the freshest the most actual the most irresistibly naïve and spontaneous thing in it a young girl she come she go she laugh she sing you go about with she in the intimacy of country life and at she side walk one long dead after two week of almost careless abandon to the dangerous delight of this inward agitation imagine my friend enter by chance one morning one of the less frequented room of the house a gallery where among other picture hang a portrait of himself paint when he be twenty-five he approach the portrait abstractedly there have be a fire in the room so that a slight moisture dim the glass which protect the pastel and on this glass because of this moisture he see distinctly the trace of two lip which have be place upon the eye of the portrait two small delicate lip the sight of which make he heart beat he leave the gallery question a servant who tell he that no one but the young woman he have in mind have be in the room that morning what then i ask as he pause my friend return to the gallery look once more at the adorable imprint of the most innocent the most passionate of caress a mirror hang near by where he could compare he present with he former face the man he be with the man he have be he never tell I and i never ask what he feeling be at that moment do he feel that he be too culpable to have inspire a passion in a young girl whom he would have be a fool almost a criminal to marry do he comprehend that through he age which be so apparent it be he youth which this child love do he remember with a keenness that be all too sad that other who have never give he a kiss like that at a time when he might have return it i only know that he leave the same day determine never again to see one whom he could no longer love as he have love the other with the hope the purity the soul of a man of twenty a few hour after this conversation i find myself once more in the office of the boulevard seat in pascal 's den and he be say already have you accomplish you interview with pierre fauchery he would not even receive I i reply boldly what do i tell you he sneer shrug he big shoulder we 'll get even with he on he next volume but you know labarthe as long as you continue to have that innocent look about you you can not expect to succeed in newspaper work i bear with the ill-humor of my chief what would he have say if he have know that i have in my pocket a interview and in my head a anecdote which be material for a most successful story and he have never have either the interview or the story since then i have make my way in the line where he say i should fail i have lose my innocent look and i earn my thirty thousand franc a year and more i have never have the same pleasure in the printing of the most profitable the most brilliant article that i have in consign to oblivion the sheet relate my visit to nemor i often think that i have not serve the cause of letter as i want to since with all my laborious work i have never write a book and yet when i recall the irresistible impulse of respect which prevent I from commit toward a dearly love master a most profitable but infamous indiscretion i say to myself if you have not serve the cause of letter you have not betray it and this be the reason now that fauchery be no longer of this world that it seem to I that the time have come for I to relate my first interview there be none of which i be more proud mateo falcone by prosper merimee on leave porto-vecchio from the northwest and direct he step towards the interior of the island the traveller will notice that the land rise rapidly and after three hour ' walking over tortuous path obstruct by great mass of rock and sometimes cut by ravine he will find himself on the border of a great mâquis the mâquis be the domain of the corsican shepherd and of those who be at variance with justice it must be know that in order to save himself the trouble of manure he field the corsican husbandman set fire to a piece of woodland if the flame spread farther than be necessary so much the worse in any case he be certain of a good crop from the land fertilize by the ash of the tree which grow upon it he gather only the head of he grain leave the straw which it would be unnecessary labor to cut in the follow spring the root that have remain in the earth without be destroy send up they tuft of sprout which in a few year reach a height of seven or eight foot it be this kind of tangled thicket that be call a mâquis they be make up of different kind of tree and shrub so crowded and mingle together at the caprice of nature that only with a axe in hand can a man open a passage through they and mâquis be frequently see so thick and bushy that the wild sheep themselves can not penetrate they if you have kill a man go into the mâquis of porto-vecchio with a good gun and plenty of powder and ball you can live there in safety do not forget a brown cloak furnish with a hood which will serve you for both cover and mattress the shepherd will give you chestnut milk and cheese and you will have nothing to fear from justice nor the relative of the dead except when it be necessary for you to descend to the city to replenish you ammunition when i be in corsica in 18 -- mateo falcone have he house half a league from this mâquis he be rich enough for that country living in noble style -- that be to say do nothing -- on the income from he flock which the shepherd who be a kind of nomad lead to pasture here and there on the mountain when i see he two year after the event that i be about to relate he appear to I to be about fifty year old or more picture to yourself a man small but robust with curly hair black as jet a aquiline nose thin lip large restless eye and a complexion the color of tan leather he skill as a marksman be consider extraordinary even in he country where good shot be so common for example mateo would never fire at a sheep with buckshot but at a hundred and twenty pace he would drop it with a ball in the head or shoulder as he choose he use he arm as easily at night as during the day i be tell this feat of he skill which will perhaps seem impossible to those who have not travel in corsica a light candle be place at eighty pace behind a paper transparency about the size of a plate he would take aim then the candle would be extinguish and at the end of a moment in the most complete darkness he would fire and hit the paper three time out of four with such a transcendent accomplishment mateo falcone have acquire a great reputation he be say to be as good a friend as he be a dangerous enemy accommodate and charitable he live at peace with all the world in the district of porto-vecchio but it be say of he that in corte where he have marry he wife he have disembarrass

civic official -rrb- when he be suddenly interrupt in he meditation by the firing of a musket he get up and turn to that side of the plain whence the noise come other shot follow fire at irregular interval and each time nearer at last in the path which lead from the plain to mateo 's house appear a man wear the pointed hat of the mountaineer beard cover with rag and drag himself along with difficulty by the support of he gun he have just receive a wound in he thigh this man be a outlaw who have go to the town by night to buy powder have fall on the way into a ambuscade of corsican light-infantry after a vigorous defense he be fortunate in make he retreat closely follow and firing from rock to rock but he be only a little in advance of the soldier and he wound prevent he from

tolerably ingenious savage place a cat and she kitten on the pile that it might not appear to have be recently disturb then notice the trace of blood on the path near the house he cover they carefully with dust and that do he again stretch himself out in the sun with the greatest tranquillity a few moment afterwards six man in brown uniform with yellow collar and command by a adjutant be before mateo 's door this adjutant be a distant relative of falcone 's -lrb- in corsica the degree of relationship be follow much further than elsewhere -rrb- he name be tiodoro gamba he be a active man much

that fortunato 's eye sparkle at the sight of it say hold the watch by the end of its steel chain : rascal you would like to have such a watch as that hung around you neck would not you and to walk in the street of porto-vecchio proud as a peacock people would ask you what time it be and you would say : ` look at my watch ' when i be grow up my uncle the caporal will give I a watch yes but you uncle 's little boy have one already not so fine as this either but then he be younger than you the child sigh well would you like this watch little cousin fortunato cast sidelong glance at the watch

while and have the appearance of say to its master how cruel you joke be however the adjutant seem in earnest in offer he watch fortunato do not reach out he hand for it but say with a bitter smile : why do you make fun of I good god i be not make fun of you only tell I where gianetto be and the watch be yours fortunato smile incredulously and fix he black eye on those of the adjutant try to read there the faith he ought to have have in he word may i lose my epaulette cry the adjutant if i do not give you the watch on this condition these comrade be witness i can not deny it while speak he gradually hold the watch nearer till it almost touch the child 's pale face which plainly show the struggle that be go on in he soul between covetousness and respect for hospitality he breast swell with emotion he seem about to suffocate meanwhile the watch be slowly sway and turn sometimes brushing against he cheek finally he right hand be gradually stretch toward it the end of he finger touch it then its whole weight be in he hand the adjutant still keep hold of the chain the face be light blue the case newly burnish in the sunlight it seem to be all on fire the temptation be too great fortunato raise he left hand and point over he shoulder with he thumb at the hay against which he be recline the adjutant understand he at once he drop the end of the chain and fortunato feel himself the sole possessor of the watch he spring up with the agility of a deer and stand ten foot from the pile which the soldier begin at once to overturn there be a movement in the hay and a bloody man with a poignard in he hand appear he try to rise to he foot but he stiffened leg would not permit it and he fall the adjutant at once grapple with he and take away he stiletto he be immediately secure notwithstanding he resistance gianetto lie on the earth and bind like a fagot turn he head towards fortunato who have approach son of -- say he with more contempt than anger the child throw he the silver piece which he have receive feeling that he no longer deserve it but the outlaw pay no attention to the movement and with great coolness say to the adjutant : my dear gamba i can not walk you

suddenly appear at a turn in the path that lead to the mâquis the woman be stagger under the weight of a enormous sack of chestnut while she husband be saunter along carry one gun in he hand while another be sling across he shoulder for it be unworthy of a man to carry other burden than he arm at the sight of the soldier mateo 's first thought be that they have come to arrest he but why this thought have he then some quarrel with justice no he enjoy a good reputation he be say to have a particularly good name but he be a corsican and a highlander and there be few corsican highlander who in scrutinize they memory can not find some peccadillo such as a gun-shot dagger-thrust or similar trifle mateo more than other have a clear conscience for more than ten year he have not pointed he carbine at a man but he be always prudent and put himself into a position to make a good defense if necessary wife say he to giuseppa put down the sack and hold yourself ready she obey at once he give she the gun that be sling across he shoulder which would have bother he and cock the one he hold in he hand advance slowly towards the house walking among the tree that border the road ready at the least hostile demonstration to hide behind the largest whence he could fire from under cover he wife follow closely behind hold he reserve weapon and he cartridge-box the duty of a good housekeeper in case of a fight be to load she husband 's carbine on the other side the adjutant be greatly trouble to see mateo advance in this manner with cautious step he carbine raise and he finger on the trigger if by chance think he mateo should be relate to gianetto or if he should be he friend and wish to defend he the contents of he two gun would arrive amongst we as certainly as a letter in the post and if he should see I notwithstanding the relationship in this perplexity he take a bold step it be to advance alone towards mateo and tell he of the affair while accost he as a old acquaintance but the short space that separate he from mateo seem terribly long hello old comrade cry he how do you do my good fellow it be i gamba you cousin without answer a word mateo stop and in proportion as the other speak slowly raise the muzzle of he gun so that it be point upward when the adjutant join he good-day brother say the adjutant hold out he hand it be a long time since i have see you good-day

little mortified he kill one of my soldier and not content with that break caporal chardon 's arm but that matter little he be only a frenchman then too he be so well hide that the devil could not have find he without my little cousin fortunato i should never have discover he fortunato cry mateo fortunato repeat giuseppa yes gianetto be hide under the hay-pile yonder but my little cousin show I the trick i shall tell he uncle the caporal that he may send he a fine present for he trouble both he name and yours will be in the report that i shall send to the attorney-general malediction say mateo in a low voice they have rejoin the detachment gianetto be already lie on the litter ready to set out when he see mateo and gamba in company he smile a strange smile then turn he head towards the door of the house he spit on the sill say : house of a traitor only a man determine to die would dare pronounce the word traitor to falcone a good blow with the stiletto which there would be no need of repeat would have immediately pay the insult however mateo make no other movement than to place he hand on he forehead like a man who be daze fortunato have go into the house when he father arrive but now he reappear with a bowl of milk which he hand with downcast eye to gianetto get away from I cry the outlaw in a loud voice then turn to one of the soldier he say : comrade give I a drink the soldier place he gourd in he hand and the prisoner drink the water hand to he by a man with whom he have just exchange bullet he then ask they to tie he hand across he breast instead of behind he back i like say he to lie at my ease they hasten to satisfy he then the adjutant give the signal to start say adieu to mateo who do not respond and descend with rapid step towards the plain nearly ten minute elapse before mateo speak the child look with restless eye now at he mother now at he father who be lean on he gun and gaze at he with a expression of concentrated rage you begin well say mateo at last with a calm voice but frightful to one who know the man oh father cry the boy burst into tear and make a forward movement as if to throw himself on he knee but mateo cry away from I the little fellow stop and sob immovable a few foot from he father giuseppa draw near she have just discover the watch-chain the end of which be hang out of fortunato 's jacket who give you

christian i shall have a mass say for he have my son-in-law tiodoro bianchus send for to come and live with we the mirror by catulle mende there be once a kingdom where mirror be unknown they have all be break and reduce to fragment by order of the queen and if the tiniest bit of looking-glass have be find in any house she would not have hesitate to put all the inmate to death with the most frightful torture now for the secret of this extraordinary caprice the queen be dreadfully ugly and she do not wish to be expose to the risk of meet she own image and know herself to be hideous it be a consolation to know that other woman at least could not see that they be pretty you may imagine that the young girl of the country be not at all satisfied what be the use of be beautiful if you could not admire yourself they might have use the brook and lake for mirror but the queen have foresee that and have hide all of they under closely join flagstone water be draw from well so deep that it be impossible to see the liquid surface and shallow basin must be use instead of bucket because in the latter there might be reflection such a dismal state of affair especially for the pretty coquette who be no more rare in this country than in other the queen have no compassion be well content that she subject should suffer as much annoyance from the lack of a mirror as she feel at the sight of one however in a suburb of the city there live a young girl call jacinta who be a little better off than the rest thanks to she sweetheart valentin for if someone think you be beautiful and lose no chance to tell you so he be almost as good as a mirror tell I the truth she would say what be the color of my eye they be like dewy forget-me-not and my skin be not quite black you know that you forehead be whiter than freshly fall snow and you cheek be like blush rose how about my lip cherry be pale beside they and my tooth if you please grain of rice be not as white but my ear should i be ashamed of they yes if you would be ashamed of two little pink shell among you pretty curl and so on endlessly she delight he still more charm for he word come from the depth of he heart and she have the pleasure of hearing herself praise he the delight of see she so they love grow more deep and tender every hour and the day that he ask she to marry he she blush certainly but it be not with anger but unluckily the news of they happiness reach the wicked queen whose only pleasure be to torment other and jacinta more than anyone else on account of she beauty a little while before the marriage jacinta be walk in the orchard one evening when a old crone approach ask for alms but suddenly jump back with a shriek as if she have step on a toad cry : heaven what do i see what be the matter my good woman what be it you see tell I the ugliest creature i ever behold then you be not look at I say jacinta with innocent vanity alas yes my poor child it be you i have be a long time on this earth but never have i meet anyone so hideous as you what be i ugly a hundred time uglier than i can tell you but my eye -- they be a sort of dirty gray but that would be nothing if you have not such a outrageous squint my complexion -- it look as if you have rub coal-dust on you forehead and cheek my mouth -- it be pale and wither like a fade flower my tooth -- if the beauty of tooth be to be large and yellow i never see any so beautiful as yours but at least my ear -- they be so big so red and so misshapen under you coarse elf-lock that they be revolting i be not pretty myself but i should die of shame if mine be like they after this last blow the old witch have repeat what the queen have teach she hobble off with a harsh croak of laughter leave poor jacinta dissolve in tear prone on the ground beneath the apple-tree \* \* \* \* \* nothing could divert she mind from she grief i be ugly -- i be ugly she repeat constantly it be in vain that valentin assure and reassure she with the most solemn oath let I alone you be lie out of pity i understand it all now you never love I you be only sorry for I the beggar woman have no interest in deceive I it be only too true -- i be ugly i do not see how you can endure the sight of I to undeceive she he bring people from far and near every man declare that jacinta be create to delight the eye even the woman say as much though they be less enthusiastic but the poor child persist in she conviction that she be a repulsive object and when valentin press she to name they wedding-day -- i you wife cry she never i love you too dearly to burden you with a be so hideous as i be you can fancy the despair of the poor fellow so sincerely in love he throw himself on he knee he pray he supplicate she answer still that she be too ugly to marry he what be he to do the only way to give the lie to the old woman and prove the truth to jacinta be to put a mirror before she but there be no such thing in the kingdom and so great be the terror inspire by the queen that no workman dare make one well i shall go to court say the lover in despair harsh as we mistress be she can not fail to be move by the tear and the beauty of

discover a thousand difference where other man see nothing but uniformity one day as he be walk near a little wood he see one of the queen 's eunuch run toward he follow by several officer who appear to be in great perplexity and who run to and fro like man distract eagerly search for something they have lose of great value young man say the first eunuch hast thou see the queen 's dog it be a female reply zadig thou art in the right return the first eunuch it be a very small she spaniel add zadig she have lately whelp she limp on the left forefoot and have very long ear thou hast see she say the first eunuch quite out of breath no reply zadig i have not see she nor do i so much as know that the queen have a dog exactly at the same time by one of the common freak of fortune the finest horse in the king 's stable have escape from the jockey in the plain of babylon the principal huntsman and all the other officer run after he with as much eagerness and anxiety as the first eunuch have do after the spaniel the principal huntsman address himself to zadig and ask he if he have not see the king 's horse passing by he be the fleetest horse in the king 's stable reply zadig he be five foot high with very small hoof and a tail three foot and a half in length the stud on he bit be gold of twenty-three carat and he shoe be silver of eleven pennyweight what way do he take where be he demand the chief huntsman i have not see he reply zadig and never hear talk of he before the principal huntsman and the first eunuch never doubt but that zadig have steal the king 's horse and the queen 's spaniel they therefore have he conduct before the assembly of the grand desterham who condemn he to the knout and to spend the rest of he day in siberium hardly be the sentence pass when the horse and the spaniel be both find the judge be reduce to the disagreeable necessity of reverse they sentence but they condemn zadig to pay four hundred ounce of gold for have say that he have not see what he have see this fine he be oblige to pay after which he be permit to plead he cause before the counsel of the grand desterham when he speak to the following effect : ye star of justice abyss of science mirror of truth who have the weight of lead the hardness of iron the splendor of the diamond and many property of gold : since i be permit to speak before this August assembly i swear to you by oramade that i have never see the queen 's respectable spaniel nor the sacred horse of the king of king the truth of the matter be as follow : i be walk toward the little wood where i afterwards meet the venerable eunuch and the most illustrious chief huntsman i observe on the sand the trace of a animal and could easily perceive they to be those of a little dog the light and long furrow impressed on little eminence of sand between the mark of the paw plainly discover that it be a female whose dug be hang down and that therefore she must have whelp a few day before other trace of a different kind that always appear to have gently brush the surface of the sand near the mark of the forefoot show I that she have very long ear and as i remark that there be always a slighter impression make on the sand by one foot than the other three i find that the spaniel of we August queen be a little lame if i may be allow the expression with regard to the horse of the king of king you will be please to know that walk in the lane of this wood i observe the mark of a horse 's shoe all at equal distance this must be a horse say i to myself that gallop excellently the dust on the tree in the road that be but seven foot wide be a little brush off at the distance of three foot and a half from the middle of the road this horse say i have a tail three foot and a half long which be whisk to the right and leave have sweep away the dust i observe under the tree that form a arbor five foot in height that the leaf of the branch be newly fall from whence i infer that the horse have touch they and that he must therefore be five foot high as to he bit it must be gold of twenty-three carat for he have rub its boss against a stone which i know to be a touchstone and which i have try in a word from the mark make by he shoe on flint of another kind i conclude that he be shoe with silver eleven denier fine all the judge admire zadig for he acute and profound discernment the news of this speech be carry even to the king and queen nothing be talk of but zadig in the antechamber the chamber and the cabinet and though many of the magus be of opinion that he ought to be burn as a sorcerer the king order he officer to restore he the four hundred ounce of gold which he have be oblige to pay the register the attorney and bailiff go to he house with great formality to carry he back he four hundred ounce they only retain three hundred and ninety-eight of they to defray the expense of justice and they servant demand they fee zadig saw how extremely dangerous it sometimes be to appear too know and therefore resolve that on the next occasion of the like nature he would not tell what he have see such a opportunity soon offer a prisoner of state make he escape and pass under the window of zadig 's house zadig be examine and make no answer but it be prove that he have look at the prisoner from this window for this crime he be condemn to pay five hundred ounce of gold and accord to the polite custom of babylon he thank he judge for they indulgence great god say he to himself what a misfortune it be to walk in a wood through which the queen 's spaniel or the king 's horse have pass how dangerous to look out at a window and how difficult to be happy in this life the envious man zadig resolve to comfort himself by philosophy and friendship for the evil he have suffer from fortune he have in the suburb of babylon a house elegantly furnish in which he assemble all the art and all the pleasure worthy the pursuit of a gentleman in the morning he library be open to the learn in the evening he table be surround by good company but he soon find what very dangerous guest these man of letter be a warm dispute arise on one of zoroaster 's law which forbid the eating of a griffin why say some of they prohibit the eating of a griffin if there be no such a animal in nature there must necessarily be such a animal say the other since zoroaster forbid we to eat it zadig would fain have reconcile they by say if there be no griffin we can not possibly eat they and thus either way we shall obey zoroaster a learn man who have compose thirteen volume on the property of the griffin and be besides the chief theurgite hasten away to accuse zadig before one of the principal magus name yebor the greatest blockhead and therefore the greatest fanatic among the chaldean this man would have impale zadig to do honor to the sun and would then have recite the breviary of zoroaster with greater satisfaction the friend cador -lrb- a friend be better than a hundred priest -rrb- go to yebor and say to he long live the sun and the griffin beware of punish zadig he be a saint he have griffin in he inner court and do not eat they and he accuser be a heretic who dare to maintain that rabbit have cloven foot and be not unclean well say yebor shake he bald pate we must impale zadig for have think contemptuously of griffin and the other for have speak disrespectfully of rabbit cador hush up the affair by means of a maid of honor with whom he have a love affair and who have great interest in the college of the magus nobody be impale this levity occasion a great murmuring among some of the doctor who from thence predict the fall of babylon upon what do happiness depend say zadig i be persecute by everything in the world even on account of being that have no existence he curse those man of learning and resolve for the future to live with none but good company he assemble at he house the most worthy man and the most beautiful lady of babylon he give they delicious supper often precede by concert of music and always animated by polite conversation from which he know how to banish that affectation of wit which be the surest method of prevent it entirely and of spoil the pleasure of the most agreeable society neither the choice of he friend nor that of the dish be make by vanity for in everything he prefer the substance to the shadow and by these means he procure that real respect to which he do not aspire opposite to he house live one arimaze a man whose deform countenance be but a faint picture of he still more deform mind he heart be a mixture of malice pride and envy have never be able to succeed in any of he undertaking he revenge himself on all around he by load they with the blackest calumny rich as he be he find it difficult to procure a set of flatterer the rattle of the chariot that enter zadig 's court in the evening fill he with uneasiness the sound of he praise enraged he still more he sometimes go to zadig 's house and sit down at table without be desire where he spoil all the pleasure of the company as the harpy be say to infect the viand they touch it happen that one day he take it in he head to give a entertainment to a lady who instead of accept it go to sup with zadig at another time as he be talk with zadig at court a minister of state come up to they and invite zadig to supper without invite arimaze the most implacable hatred have seldom a more solid foundation this man who in babylon be call the envious resolve to ruin zadig because he be call the happy the opportunity of do mischief occur a hundred time in a day and that of do good but once a year as sayeth the wise zoroaster the envious man go to see zadig who be walk in he garden with two friend and a lady to whom he say many gallant thing without any other intention than that of say they the conversation turn upon a war which the king have just bring to a happy conclusion against the prince of hircanium he vassal zadig who have signalize he courage in this short war bestow great praise on the king but greater still on the lady he take out he pocket-book and write four line extempore which he give to this amiable person to read he friend beg they might see they but modesty or rather a well-regulated self love would not allow he to grant they request he know that extemporary verse be never approve of by any but by the person in whose honor they be write he therefore tear in two the leaf on which he have write they and throw both the piece into a thicket of rose-bush where the rest of the company seek for they in vain a slight shower fall soon after oblige they to return to the house the envious man who stay in the garden continue the search till at last he find a piece of the leaf it have be tear in such a manner that each half of a line form a complete sense and even a verse of a shorter measure but what be still more surprising these short verse be find to contain the most injurious reflection on the king they run thus : to flagrant crime he crown he owe to peaceful time the worst of foe the envious man be now happy for the first time of he life he have it in he power to ruin a person of virtue and merit fill with this fiendlike joy he find mean to convey to the king the satire write by the hand of zadig who together with the lady and he two friend be throw into prison he trial be soon finish without he be permit to speak for himself as he be go to receive he sentence the envious man throw himself in he way and tell he with a loud voice that he verse be good for nothing zadig do not value himself on be a good poet but it fill he with inexpressible concern to find that he be condemn for high treason and that the fair lady and he two friend be confine in prison for a crime of which they be not guilty he be not allow to speak because he write speak for he such be the law of babylon accordingly he be conduct to the place of execution through a immense crowd of spectator who dare not venture to express they pity for he but who carefully examine he countenance to see if he die with a good grace he relation alone be inconsolable for they could not succeed to he estate three-fourth of he wealth be confiscate into the king 's treasury and the other fourth be give to the envious man just as he be prepare for death the king 's parrot fly from its cage and alight on a rosebush in zadig 's garden a peach have be drive thither by the wind from a neighbor tree and have fall on a piece of the write leaf of the pocketbook to which it stick the bird carry off the peach and the paper and lay they on the king 's knee the king take up the paper with great eagerness and read the word which form no sense and seem to be the ending of verse he love poetry and there be always some mercy to be expect from a prince of that disposition the adventure of the parrot set he a-think the queen who remember what have be write on the piece of zadig 's pocketbook cause it to be bring they compare the two piece together and find they to tally exactly they then read the verse as zadig have write they tyrant be prone to flagrant crime to clemency he crown he owe to concord and to peaceful time love only be the worst of foe the king give immediate order that zadig should be bring before he and that he two friend and the lady should be set at liberty zadig fall prostrate on the ground before the king and queen humbly beg they pardon for have make such bad verse and speak with so much propriety wit and good sense that they majesty desire they might see he again he do himself that honor and insinuate himself still farther into they good grace they give he all the wealth of the envious man but zadig restore he back the whole of it and this instance of generosity give no other pleasure to the envious man than that of have preserve he estate the king 's esteem for zadig increase every day he admit he into all he party of pleasure and consult he in all affair of state from that time the queen begin to regard he with a eye of tenderness that might one day prove dangerous to herself to the king she August comfort to zadig and to the kingdom in general zadig now begin to think that happiness be not so unattainable as he have formerly imagine the generous the time now arrive for celebrate a grand festival which return every five year it be a custom in babylon solemnly to declare at the end of every five year which of the citizen have perform the most generous action the grandee and the magus be the judge the first satrap who be charge with the government

not mention the greatness of soul with which zadig have restore the envious man he fortune because it be not judge to be a action worthy of dispute the prize he first present a judge who have make a citizen lose a considerable cause by a mistake for which after all he be not accountable have give he the whole of he own estate which be just equal to what the other have lose he next produce a young man who be desperately in love with a lady whom he be go to marry have yield she up to he friend whose passion for she have almost bring he to the brink of the grave and at the same time have give he the lady 's fortune he afterwards produce a soldier who in the war of hircanium have give a still more noble instance of generosity a party of the enemy have seize he mistress he fight in she defense with great intrepidity at that very instant he be inform that another party at the distance of a few pace be carry off he mother he therefore leave he mistress with tear in he eye and fly to the

admiration the judge who have give he estate to he client the lover who have resign he mistress to a friend and the soldier who have prefer the safety of he mother to that of he mistress receive the king 's present and see they name enrol in the catalogue of generous man zadig have the cup and the king acquire the reputation of a good prince which he do not long enjoy the day be celebrate by

law but no one feel the weight of he dignity he never check the deliberation of the diran and every vizier might give he opinion without the fear of incur the minister 's displeasure when he give judgment it be not he that give it it be the law the rigor of which however whenever it be too severe he always take care to soften and when law be want the equity of he decision be such as might easily have make they pass for those of zoroaster it be to he that the nation be indebted for this grand principle to wit that it be better to run the risk of spare the guilty than to condemn the innocent he imagine that law be make as well to secure the people from the suffering of injury as to restrain they from the commission of crime he chief talent consist in discover the truth which all man seek to obscure this great talent he put in practice from the very beginning of he administration a famous merchant of babylon who die in the indy divide he estate equally between he two son after

utmost suspense and perturbation zadig jump into the temple with he foot join together and afterwards prove in a eloquent discourse that the sovereign of heaven and earth who accept not the person of man make no distinction between the right and leave foot the envious man and he wife allege that he discourse be not figurative enough and that he do not make the rock and mountain to dance with sufficient agility he be dry say they and void of genius : he do not make the flea to fly and star to fall nor the sun to melt wax he have not the true oriental style zadig contented himself with have the style of reason all the world favor he not because he be in the right road or follow the dictate of reason or be a man of real merit but because he be prime vizier he terminate with the same happy address the grand difference between the white and the black magus the former maintain that it be the height of impiety to pray to god with the face turn toward the east in winter the latter assert that god abhor the prayer of those who turn toward the west in summer zadig decree that every man should be allow to turn as he please thus he find out the happy secret of finish all affair whether of a private or a public nature in the morning the rest of the day he employ in superintend and promote the embellishment of babylon he exhibit tragedy that draw tear from the eye of the spectator and comedy that shake they side with laughter a custom which have long be disused and which he good taste now induce he to revive he never affect to be more know in the polite art than the artist

when he give audience as when he sit in judgment he do not know to what to attribute this absence of mind and that be he only sorrow he have a dream in which he imagine that he lay himself down upon a heap of dry herb among which there be many prickly one that give he great uneasiness and that he afterwards repose himself on a soft bed of rose from which there spring a serpent that wound he to the heart with its sharp and venomed tongue alas say he i have long lain on these dry and prickly herb i be now on the bed of rose but what shall be the serpent jealousy zadig 's calamity spring even from he happiness and especially from he merit he every day converse with the king and astarte he August comfort the charm of he conversation be greatly heighten by that desire of please which be to the mind what dress be to beauty he youth and graceful appearance insensibly make a impression on astarte which she do not at first perceive she passion grow and flourish in the bosom of innocence without

woman who be always sure to improve on she praise and thus everything contribute to pierce she heart with a dart of which she do not seem to be sensible she make several present to zadig which discover a greater spirit of gallantry than she imagine she intend to speak to he only as a queen satisfy with he service and she expression be sometimes those of a woman in love astarte be much more beautiful than that semira who have such a strong aversion to one-eyed man or that other woman who have resolve to cut off she husband 's nose she unreserved familiarity she tender expression at which she begin to blush and she eye which though she endeavor to divert they to other object be always fix upon he inspired zadig with a passion that fill he with astonishment he struggle hard to get the better of it he call to he aid the precept of philosophy which have always stand he in stead but from thence though he could derive the light of knowledge he could procure no remedy to cure the disorder of he lovesick heart duty gratitude and violate majesty present themselves to he mind as so many avenge god he struggle he conquer but this victory which he be oblige to purchase afresh every moment cost he many sigh and tear he no longer dare to speak to the queen with that sweet and charming familiarity which have be so agreeable to they both he countenance be cover with a cloud he conversation be constrain and incoherent he eye be fix on the ground and when in spite of all he endeavor to the contrary they encounter those of the queen they find they bath in tear and dart arrow of flame they seem to say we adore each other and yet be afraid to love we both burn with a fire which we both condemn zadig leave the royal presence full of perplexity and despair and have he heart oppress with a burden which he be no longer able to bear in the violence of he perturbation he involuntarily betray the secret to he friend cador in the same manner as a man who have long support the fit of a cruel disease discover he pain by a cry extort from he by a more severe fit and by the cold sweat that cover he brow i have already discover say cador the sentiment which thou wouldst fain conceal from thyself the symptom by which the passion show themselves be certain and infallible judge my dear zadig since i have read thy heart whether the king will not discover something in it that may give he offense he have no other fault but that of be the most jealous man in the world thou canst resist the violence of thy passion with greater fortitude than the queen because thou art a philosopher and because thou art zadig astarte be a woman : she suffer she eye to speak with so much the more imprudence as she do not as yet think herself guilty conscious of she innocence she unhappily neglect those external appearance which be so necessary i shall tremble for she so long as she have nothing wherewithal to reproach herself be ye both of one mind ye might easily deceive the whole world a grow passion which we endeavor to suppress discover itself in spite of all we effort to the contrary but love when gratify be easily conceal zadig tremble at the proposal of betray the king he benefactor and never be he more faithful to he prince than when guilty of a involuntary crime against he meanwhile the queen mention the name of zadig so frequently and with such a blushing

illustrious fugitive arrive on the side of a hill from whence he could take a view of babylon turn he eye toward the queen 's palace and faint away at the sight nor do he recover he sens but to shed a torrent of tear and to wish for death at length after he thought have be long engross in lament the unhappy fate of the loveliest woman and the greatest queen in the world he for a moment turn he view on himself and cry : what then be human life o virtue how hast thou serve I two woman have basely deceive I and now a third who be innocent and more beautiful than both the other be go to be put to death whatever good i have do have be to I a continual source of calamity and affliction and i have only be raise to the height of grandeur to be tumble down the most horrid precipice of misfortune fill with these gloomy reflection he eye overspread with the veil of grief he countenance cover with the paleness of death and he soul plunge in a abyss of the blackest despair he continue he journey toward egypt the woman beat zadig direct he course by the star the constellation of orion and the splendid dog star guide he step toward the pole of cassiopeium he admire those vast globe of light which appear to we eye but as so many little spark while the earth which in reality be only a imperceptible point in nature appear to we fond imagination as something so grand and noble he then represent to himself the human species as it really be as a parcel of insect devour one another on a little atom of clay this true image seem to annihilate he misfortune by make he sensible of the nothingness of he own being and of that of babylon he soul launch out into infinity and detach from the sens contemplate the immutable order of the universe but when afterwards return to himself and enter into he own heart he consider that astarte have perhaps die for he the universe vanish from he sight and he behold nothing in the whole compass of nature but astarte expire and zadig unhappy while he thus alternately give up he mind to this flux and reflux of sublime philosophy and intolerable grief he advance toward the frontier of egypt and he faithful domestic be already in the first village in search of a lodging upon reach the village zadig generously take the part of a woman attack by she jealous lover the combat grow so fierce that zadig slew the lover the egyptian be then just and humane the people conduct zadig to the town house they first of all order he wound to be dress and then examine he and he servant apart in order to discover the truth they find that zadig be

inhabitant and he person as well as that of the companion of he journey be expose to sale in the marketplace a arabian merchant name setoc make the purchase but as the servant be fitter for labor than the master he be sell at a higher price there be no comparison between the two man thus zadig become a slave subordinate to he own servant they be link together by a chain fasten to they foot and in this condition they follow the arabian merchant to he house by the way zadig comfort he servant and exhort he to patience but he could not help make accord to he usual custom some reflection on human life i see say he that the unhappiness of my fate have a influence on thine hitherto everything have turn out to I in a most unaccountable manner i have be condemn to pay a fine for have see the mark

near the desert of oreb the journey be long and painful setoc set a much greater value on the servant than the master because the former be more expert in load the camel and all the little mark of distinction be show to he a camel have die within two day ' journey of oreb he burden be divide and lay on the back of the servant and zadig have he share among the rest setoc laugh to see all he slave walk with they body inclined zadig take the liberty to explain to he the cause and inform he of the law of the balance the merchant be astonished and begin to regard he with other eye zadig find he have raise he curiosity increase it still further by acquaint he with many thing that related to commerce the specific gravity of metal and commodity under a equal bulk the property of several

in this cottage where i have no other resource than fishing and yet i can not catch a single fish oh my net no more will i throw thee into the water i will throw myself in thy place so say he arise and advance forward in the attitude of a man ready to throw himself into the river and thus to finish he life what say zadig to himself be there man as wretched as i he eagerness to save the fisherman 's life be as this reflection he run to he stop he and speak to he with a tender and compassionate air it be commonly suppose that we be less miserable when we have companion in we misery this accord to zoroaster do not proceed from _ malice _ but necessity we feel ourselves insensibly draw to a unhappy person as to one like ourselves the joy of the happy would be a insult but two man in distress be like two slender tree which mutually support each other fortify themselves against the storm why say zadig to the fisherman dost thou sink under thy misfortune because reply he i see no means of relief i be the most considerable man in the village of derlback near babylon and with the assistance of my wife i make the best cream cheese in the empire queen astarte and the famous minister zadig

he friend wait for I at he house go perhaps thou wilt not always be unhappy oh powerful oromaze continue he thou employest I to comfort this man whom wilt thou employ to give I consolation so say he give the fisherman half the money he have bring from arabia the fisherman strike with surprise and ravish with joy kiss the foot of the friend of cador and say thou art surely a angel send from heaven to save I meanwhile zadig continue to make fresh inquiry and to shed tear what my lord cry the fisherman art thou then so unhappy thou who bestowest favor a hundred time more unhappy than thou art

they be then present with water to wash they hand in a golden basin adorn with emerald and ruby at last they be conduct to bed in a beautiful apartment and in the morning a domestic bring each of they

the guilty secret by paul de kock nathalie de hauteville be twenty-two year old and have be a widow for three year she be one of the prettiest woman in paris she large dark eye shine with remarkable brilliancy and she unite the sparkling vivacity of a italian and the depth of feeling of a spaniard to the grace which always distinguish a parisian bear and breed consider herself too young to be entirely alone she have long ago invite m d'ablaincourt a old uncle of hers to come and live with she m d'ablaincourt be a old bachelor he have never love anything in this world but himself he be a egotist too lazy to do any one a ill turn but at the same time too selfish to do any one a kindness unless it would tend directly to he own advantage and yet with a air of complaisance as if he desire nothing so much as the comfort of those around he he consent to he niece 's proposal in the hope that she would do many little kind office for he which would add materially to he comfort m d'ablaincourt accompany he niece when she resume she place in society but sometimes when he feel inclined to stay at home he would say to she : my dear nathalie i be afraid you will not be much amuse this evening they will only play card besides i do not think any of you friend will be there of course i be ready to take you if you wish to go and nathalie who have great confidence in all she uncle say would stay at home in the same manner m d'ablaincourt who be a great gourmand say to he niece : my dear you know that i be not at all fond of eat and be satisfy with the simplest fare but i must tell you that you cook put too much salt in everything it be very unwholesome so they change the cook again the garden be out of order the tree before the old gentleman 's window must be cut down because they shade would doubtless cause a dampness in the house prejudicial to nathalie 's health or the surrey be to be change for a landau nathalie be a coquette accustom to charm she listen with smile to the numerous protestation of admiration which she receive she send all who aspire to she hand to she uncle say : before i give you any hope i must know my uncle 's opinion it be likely that nathalie would have answer differently if she have ever feel a real preference for any one but heretofore she seem to have prefer she liberty the old uncle for he part be now master in he niece 's house be very anxious for she to remain as she be a nephew might be somewhat less submissive than nathalie therefore he never fail to discover some great fault in each of those who seek a alliance with the pretty widow besides he egotism and he epicureanism the dear uncle have another passion -- to play backgammon the game amuse he very much but the difficulty be to find any one to play with if by accident any of nathalie 's visitor understand it there be no escape from a long siege with the old gentleman but most people prefer card in order to please she uncle nathalie try to learn this game but it be almost impossible she could not give she attention to one thing for so long a time she uncle scold nathalie give up in despair it be only for you own amusement that i wish to teach it to you say the good m d'ablaincourt thing be at this crisis when at a ball one evening nathalie be introduce to a m d'apremont a captain in the navy nathalie raise she eye expect to see a great sailor with a wooden leg and a bandage over one eye when to she great surprise she behold a man of about thirty tall and finely form with two sound leg and two good eye armand d'apremont have enter the navy

as yet however he be a single man and moreover have always laugh at love but when he see nathalie he opinion undergo a change for the first time in he life he regret that he have never learn to dance and he keep he eye fix on she constantly he attention to the young widow soon become a subject of general conversation and at last the report reach the ear of m d'ablaincourt when nathalie mention one evening that she expect the captain to spend the evening with she the old man grow almost angry nathalie say he you act entirely without consult I i have hear that the captain be very rude and unpolished in he manners to be sure i have only see he stand behind you chair but he have never even ask after my health i only speak for you interest as you be so giddy nathalie beg she uncle 's pardon and even offer not to receive the captain 's visit but this he forbear to require -- secretly resolve not to allow these visit to become too frequent but how frail be all human resolution -- overturn by the merest trifle in this case the game of backgammon be the unconscious cause of nathalie 's become mme d'apremont the captain be a excellent hand at backgammon when the uncle hear this he propose a game and the captain who understand that it be important to gain the uncle 's favor readily accede this do not please nathalie she prefer that he should be occupy with herself when all the company be go she turn to she uncle say : you be right uncle after all i do not admire the captain 's manners i see now that i should not have invite he on the contrary niece he be a very well-behaved man i have invite he to come here very often and play backgammon with I -- that be to pay he address to you nathalie saw that the captain have gain she uncle 's heart and she forgive he for have be less attentive to she he soon come again and thanks to the backgammon increase in favor with the uncle he soon captivate the heart of the pretty widow also one morning nathalie come blush to she uncle the captain have ask I to marry he what do you advise I to do he reflect for a few moment if she refuse he d'apremont will come here no longer and then no more backgammon but if she marry he he will be here always and i shall have my game and the answer be : you have better marry he nathalie love armand but she would not yield too easily she send for the captain if you really love I --

detest the smell of tobacco and i will not have a husband who smoke armand sigh and promise the first month of they marriage pass smoothly but sometimes armand become thoughtful restless and grave after some time these fit of sadness become more frequent what be the matter ask nathalie one day on see he stamp with impatience why be you so irritable nothing -- nothing at all reply the captain as if ashamed of he ill humor tell I nathalie insist have i displeased you in anything the captain assure she that he have no reason to be anything but delighted with she conduct on all occasion and for a time he be all right then soon he be worse than before nathalie be distressed beyond measure she impart she anxiety to she uncle who reply : yes my dear i know what you mean i have often remark it myself at backgammon he be very inattentive and often pass he hand over he forehead and start up as if something agitate he and one day when he old habit of impatience and irritability reappear more marked than ever the captain say to he wife : my dear a evening walk will do I a world of good a old sailor like myself can not bear to sit around the house after dinner nevertheless if you have any objection -- oh no what objection can i have he go out and continue to do so day after day at the same hour invariably he return in the best of good humor nathalie be now unhappy indeed he love some other woman perhaps she think and he must see she every day oh how wretched i be but i must let he know that he perfidy be discover no i will wait until i shall have some certain proof wherewith to

seek a separation but my dear niece -- my dear uncle you who be so good and oblige grant I this one favor i be sure there be some woman in the secret m d'ablaincourt wish to prevent a rupture between he niece and nephew which would interfere very much with the quiet peaceable life which he lead at they house he pretend to follow armand but come back very soon say he have lose sight of he but in what direction do he go sometimes one way and sometimes another but always alone so you suspicion be unfounded be assure he only walk for exercise but nathalie be not to be dupe in this way she send

to she uncle say : uncle he love I he be only smoking but hereafter he be to smoke at home i can arrange it all say d'ablaincourt he shall smoke while he play backgammon in that way think the old man i shall be sure of my game jean monette by eugene francoi vidocq at the time when i first become commissary of police my arrondissement be in that part of pari which include the rue st antoine -- a street which have a great number of court alley and culs-de-sac issue from it in all direction the house in these alley and court be for the most part inhabit by wretch waver betwixt the last shade of poverty and actual starvation ready to take part in any disturbance or assist in any act of rapine or violence in one of these alley there live at that time a man name jean monette who be tolerably well stricken in year but still a hearty man he be a widower and with a only daughter occupy a floor au quatrième in one of the court people say he have be in business and grow rich but that he have not the heart to spend he money which year after year accumulate and would make a splendid fortune for he daughter at he death with this advantage emma who be really a handsome girl do not want for suitor and think that be a heiress she might wait till she really feel a reciprocal passion for some one and not throw herself away upon the first tolerable match that present itself it be on a Sunday the first in the month of June that emma have as a especial treat obtain sufficient money from she father for a excursion with some friend to see the fountain of versaille it be a beautiful day and the basin be throng around with thousand and thousand of person look from the variety of they dress more like the color of a splendid rainbow than aught besides and when at four o'clock triton and he satellite throw up they immense volume of water all be wonder astonishment and delight but none be more delighted than emma to whom the scene be quite new and then it be so pleasant to have find a gentleman who could explain everything and everybody point out the duke of this and the count that and the other lion of pari besides such a agreeable and well-dressed man it be really quite condescending in he to notice they and then toward evening he would insist they should all go home together in a fiacre and that he alone should pay all the expense and when with a gentle pressure of the hand and a low whisper he beg she to say where he might come and throw himself at she foot she think she feeling be different to what they have ever be before but how could she give she address -- tell so dash a man that she live in such a place no she could not do that but she would meet he at the jardin d'eté next Sunday evening and dance with no one else all night she meet he on the Sunday and again and again until she father begin to suspect from she frequent absence of a evening -- which be formerly a unusual circumstance with she -- that something must be wrong the old man love he money but he love he daughter more she be the only link in life that keep together the chain of he affection he have be passionately fond of he wife and when she die emma have fill up the void in he heart they be all save he money that he have ever love the world have cry out against he as a hard-hearted rapacious man and he in return despise the world he be therefore much grieve at she conduct and question emma as to where she frequent visit lead she but could only obtain for answer that she be not aware she have be absent so much as to give he uneasiness this be unsatisfactory and so confirm the old man in he suspicion that he determine to have he daughter watch this he effect through the means of a ancien amus then in the profession of what he call a inspector though he enemy -lrb- and all man have such -rrb- call he a mouchard or spy however by whatever name he call himself or other call he he understand he business and so effectually watch the young lady that he discover she frequent absence to be for the purpose of meet a man who after walk some distance with she manage despite the inspector 's boast ability to give he the slip this naturally puzzle he and so it would any man in he situation fancy the feeling of one of the government 's employee in the argus line of business a man renown for he success in almost all the arduous and intricate affair that have be commit to he care to find himself baffle in a paltry private intrigue and one which he have merely undertake for the sake of friendship for a second time he try the plan of fancy himself to be well pay think this would stimulate he dormant energy know well that a thing do for friendship 's sake be always badly do but even here he fail he watch they to a certain corner but before he could get around it they be nowhere to be see this be not to be bear it be set he at defiance should he call in the assistance of a brother in the line no that would be to acknowledge himself beat and the disgrace he could not bear -- he honor be concerned and he would achieve it single handed but then it be very perplexing the man to he experienced eye seem not as he have do to emma a dash gentleman but more like a foul bird in fine feather something must be wrong and he must find it out -- but then again come that confound question how he would go and consult old monette -- he could perhaps suggest something and muse on the strangeness of the adventure he walk slowly toward the house of the old man to hold a council with he on the situation on the road he attention be attract by a disturbance in the street and mingle with the crowd in hope of seize some of he enemy exercise they illegal function on whom the whole weight of he official vengeance might fall he for the time forget he adventure the crowd have be draw together by a difference of opinion between two gentleman of the vehicular profession respect some right of way and after all the usual expression of esteem common

sound and soon pronounce mean a great deal for first it mean that he have make a great discovery secondly that he be not now astonish because he have not succeed before in he watchfulness thirdly -- but perhaps the two mention may be sufficient for turn sharply round he make the greatest haste to reach monette and inform he this time of the result of he espionage after a long prelude state how fortunate monette be to have such a friend as himself a man who know everybody and everything he proceed to inform he of the please intelligence that he daughter be in the habit of meeting and go to some place -lrb- he forget to say where -rrb- with the most desperate and abandoned character in paris -- one who be so extremely dexterous in all he scheme that the police though perfectly aware of

tell she the information he have receive wisely withhold the means from which he knowledge come say that he know she have that moment part from a man who would lead she to the brink of destruction and then cast she off like a child 's broken play-thing he beg nay he beseech she with tear in he eye to promise she would never again see he emma be thunderstruck not only at the accuracy of she father 's information but at hear such a character of one whom she have paint as perfection 's self and call to she aid those never-failing woman 's argument a copious flood of tear fall on she father 's

the time if it be possible to forget the object of she affection and think if she could but see he once more to bid he a long and last farewell she might in time wear out he remembrance from she heart but in order to do that she must see he once more and have make up she mind that this interview would be a essential requisite to the desire end she take counsel with herself how it be to be accomplish there be only one great obstacle present itself to she view which be that she could not get out now woman 's invention never fail they when they have set they heart upon any desire object and it occur to she that although she could not get out yet it be not quite so apparent that he could not get in and this point be settle it be no very difficult matter to persuade the old woman who occasionally assist she in the household arrangement to be the bearer of a short note purport to say that she father have be unwell for the last few day usually retire early to rest and that if she

to disappoint any one and he immediately communicate he plan to two of he confederate promise they a good share of the booty and also the girl herself if either of they feel that way incline as a reward for they assistance he plan be very well manage and would have go on exceedingly well but for one small accident which happen through the officious interference of the inspector who the moment he have discover who the lothario be have take all the step he could to catch he and gain the honor of have catch so accomplish a gentleman he rightly judge that it would not be long before he would

pit be deeper than usual mechanically i approach the grave at the bottom the water have gather in a pool my foot slip i come within a inch of fall in my hair stand on end the rain have drench I to the skin i shudder and hasten into the laboratory it be as i have say a abandon chapel my eye search -- i know not why -- to discover if some trace of the holy purpose to which the edifice have once be devote do not still adhere to the wall or to the altar but the wall be bare the altar empty i strike a light and deposit the candle on the operating-table on which lay scatter a miscellaneous assortment of the strange instrument i employ i sit down and fall into a reverie i thought of the poor queen whom i have see in she beauty glory and happiness yesterday cart to the scaffold pursue by the execration of a people to-day lie headless on the common sinner ' bier -- she who have sleep beneath the gilded canopy of the throne of the tuilery and st cloud as i sit thus absorb in gloomy meditation wind and rain without redouble in fury the rain-drop dash against the window-pane the storm sweep with melancholy moan through the branch of the tree anon there mingle with the violence of the element the sound of wheel it be the executioner 's red hearse with its ghastly freight from the place de la révolution the door of the little chapel be push ajar and two man drench with rain enter carry a sack between they there m ledru say the guillotinier there be what you heart long for be in no hurry this night we 'll leave you to enjoy they society alone order be not to cover they up till to-morrow and so they 'll not take cold with a horrible laugh the two executioner deposit the sack in a corner near the former altar right in front of I thereupon they saunter out leave open the door which swing furiously on its hinge till my candle flash and flare in the fierce draft i hear they unharness the horse lock the cemetery and go away i be strangely impel to go with they but a indefinable power fetter I in my place i could not repress a shudder i have no fear but the violence of the storm the splashing of the rain the whistle sound of the lash branch the shrill vibration of the atmosphere which make my candle tremble -- all this fill I with a vague terror that begin at the root of my hair and communicate itself to every part of my body suddenly i fancied i hear a voice a voice at once soft and plaintive a voice within the chapel pronounce the name of albert i be startle albert but one person in all the world address I by that name slowly i direct my weep eye around the chapel which though small be not completely light by the feeble ray of the candle leave the nook and angle in darkness and my look remain fix on the blood-soaked sack near the altar with its hideous contents at this moment the same voice repeat the same name only it sound fainter and more plaintive albert i bolt out of my chair freeze with horror the voice seem to proceed from the sack i touch myself to make sure that i be awake then i walk toward the sack with my arm extend before I but stark and stare with horror i thrust my hand into it then it seem to I as if two lip still warm press a kiss upon my finger i have reach that stage of boundless terror where the excess of fear turn into the audacity of despair i seize the head and collapse in my chair place it in front of I then i give vent to a fearful scream this head with its lip still warm with the eye half close be the head of solange i think i should go mad three time i call : solange solange solange at the third time she open she eye and look at I tear trickle down she cheek then a moist glow dart from she eye as if the soul be pass and the eye close never to open again i spring to my foot a rave maniac i want to fly i knock against the table it fall the candle be extinguish the head roll upon the floor and i fall prostrate as if a terrible fever have stricken I down -- a icy-shudder convulse I and with a deep sigh i swoon the follow morning at six the grave-digger find I cold as the flagstone on which i lay solange betray by she father 's letter have be arrest the same day condemn and execute the head that have call I the eye that have look at I be the head the eye of solange the bird in the letter-box by rene bazin nothing can describe the peace that surround the country parsonage the parish be small moderately honest prosperous and be use to the old priest who have rule it for thirty year the town end at the parsonage and there begin meadow which slope down to the river and be fill in summer with the perfume of flower and all the music of the earth behind the great house a kitchen-garden encroach on the meadow the first ray of the sun be for it and so be the last here the cherry ripen in may and the currant often earlier and a week before assumption usually you could not pass within a hundred foot without breathing among the hedge the heavy odor of the melon but you must not think that the abbé of st philémon be a gourmand he have reach the age when appetite be only a memory he shoulder be bent he face be wrinkle he have two little gray eye one of which could not see any longer and he be so deaf in one ear that if you happen to be on that side you just have to get round on the other mercy no he do not eat all the fruit in he orchard the boy get they share -- and a big share -- but the biggest share by all odds be eat by the bird -- the blackbird who live there very comfortably all the year and sing in return the best they could the oriole pretty bird of passage who help they in summer and the sparrow and the warbler of every variety and the tomtit swarm of they with feather as thick as you finger and they hang on the branch and peck at a grape or scratch a pear -- veritable little beast of prey whose only thank you be a shrill cry like a saw even to they old age have make the abbé of st philémon indulgent the beast can not correct they fault he use to say if i get angry at they for not change i would have to get angry with a good many of my parishioner and he contented himself with clap he hand together loud when he go into he orchard so he should not see too much steal then there be a spreading of wing as if all the silly flower cut off by a great wind be fly away gray and white and yellow and mottle a short flight a rustling of leaf and then quiet for five minute but what minute fancy if you can that there be not one factory in the village not a weaver or a blacksmith and that the noise of man with they horse and cattle spread over the wide distant plain melt into the whispering of the breeze and be lose mill be unknown the road be little frequent the railroad be very far away indeed if the ravager of he garden have repent for long the abbé would have fall asleep of the silence over he breviary fortunately they return be prompt a sparrow lead the way a jay follow and then the whole swarm be back at work and the abbé could walk up and down close he book or open it and murmur : they 'll not leave I a berry this year it make no difference not a bird leave he prey any more than if the good abbé have be a cone-shaped pear-tree with thick leaf balance himself on the gravel of the walk the bird know that those who complain take no action every year they build they nest around the parsonage of st philémon in greater number than anywhere else the best place be quickly take the hollow in the tree the hole in the wall the fork of the apple-tree and the elm and you could see a brown beak like the point of a sword stick out of a wisp of straw between all the rafter of the roof one year when all the place be take i suppose a tomtit in she embarrassment spy the slit of the letter-box protect by its little roof at the right of the parsonage gate she slip in be satisfy with the result of she exploration and bring the material to build a nest there be nothing she neglect that would make it warm neither the feather nor the horsehair nor the wool nor even the scale of lichen that cover old wood one morning the housekeeper come in perfectly furious carry a paper she have find it under the laurel bush at the foot of the garden look sir a paper and dirty too they be up to fine doings who philomène you miserable bird all the bird that you let stay here pretty soon they 'll be build they nest in you soup-tureen i have not but one have not they get the idea of lay they egg in you letter-box i open it because the postman ring and that do not happen every day it be full of straw and horsehair and spider ' web with

food eat it digest it and demand more that be the first period when the baby bird have not any sense but in bird it do not last long very soon they quarrel in the nest which begin to break with the fluttering of they wing then they tumble out of it and walk along the side of the box peep through the slit at the big world outside and at last they venture out the abbé of st philémon with a neighbor priest attend this pleasant garden party when the little one appear beneath the roof of the box -- two three -- together and take they flight come back start again like bee at the door of a hive he say : behold a babyhood end and a good work accomplish they be hardy and strong every one the next day during he hour of leisure after dinner the abbé come to the box with the key in he hand

window and gaze at the durance which trace its broad course amidst the dark green verdure of the valley fresh puff of wind caress my face and the murmur of the tree and river seem to call I to they i gently open my door to get out i have to pass through my uncle 's room i proceed on tip-toe fear the creaking of my thick boot might awaken the worthy man who be still slumber with a smile countenance and i tremble at the sound of the church bell toll the angelus for some day past my uncle lazare have be follow I about everywhere look sad and annoyed he would perhaps have prevent I go over there to the edge of the river and hide myself among the willow on the bank so as to watch for babet pass that tall dark girl who have come with the spring but my uncle be sleep soundly i feel something like remorse in deceive he and run away in this manner i stay for a instant and gaze on he calm countenance with its gentle expression enhance by rest and i recall to mind with feel the day when he have

my uncle would be there and i would have to lower my eye it must be so nice under the willow lie flat on one 's stomach in the fine grass i feel a languid feeling creep over I and slowly take short step hold my breath i reach the door i go downstairs and begin run like a madcap in the delightful warm may morning air the sky be quite white on the horizon with exquisitely delicate blue and pink tint the pale sun seem like a great silver lamp cast a shower of bright ray into the durance and the broad sluggish river expand lazily over the red sand extend from one end of the valley to the other like a stream of liquid metal to the west a line of low rugged hill throw slight violet streak on the pale sky i have be live in this out-of-the-way corner for ten year how often have i keep my uncle lazare wait to give I my latin lesson the worthy man want to make I learn but i be on the other side of the durance ferret out magpie discover a hill which i have not yet climb then on my return there

conquer it with my leg and i be the real landlord by right of friendship and that bit of river those two league of the durance how i love they how well we understand one another when together i know all the whim of my dear stream its anger its charming way its different feature at each hour of the day when i reach the water 's edge on that particular morning i feel something like giddiness at see it so gentle and so white it have never look so gay i slip rapidly beneath the willow to a open space where a broad patch of sunlight fall on the dark grass there i lay I down on my stomach listen watch the pathway by which babet would come through the branch oh how sound uncle lazare must be sleep i think and i extend myself at full length on the moss the sun strike gentle heat into my back whilst my breast bury in the grass be quite cool have you never examine the turf at close quarter with you eye on the blade of grass whilst i be wait for babet i pry indiscreetly into a tuft which be really a whole world in my bunch of grass there be street cross road public square entire city at the bottom of it i distinguish a great dark patch where the shoot of the previous spring be decay sadly then slender stalk be grow up stretch out bend into a multitude of elegant form and produce frail colonnade church virgin forest i see two lean insect wander in the midst of this immensity the poor child be certainly lose for they go from colonnade to colonnade from street to street in a affrighted anxious way it be just at this moment that on raise my eye i see babet 's white skirt stand out against the dark ground at the top of the pathway i recognize she print calico gown which be gray with small blue flower i sink down deeper in the grass i hear my heart thump against the earth and almost raise I with slight jerk my breast be burn now i no longer feel the freshness of the dew the young girl come nimbly down the pathway she skirt skim the ground with a swinging motion that charm I i see she at full length quite erect in she proud and happy gracefulness she have no idea i be there behind the willow she walk with a light step she run without give a think to the wind which slightly raise she gown i could distinguish she foot trot along quickly quickly and a piece of she white stocking which be perhaps as large as one 's hand and which make I blush in a manner that be alike sweet and painful oh then i see nothing else neither the durance nor the willow nor the whiteness of the sky what care i for the valley it be no longer my sweetheart i be quite indifferent to its joy and its sadness what care i for my friend the story and the tree on the hill the river could run away all at once if it like i would not have regret it and the spring i do not care a bit about the spring have it bear away the sun that warm my back its leave its ray all its may morning i should have remain there in ecstasy gaze at babet run along the pathway and swing she skirt deliciously for babet have take the valley 's place in my heart babet be the spring i have never speak to she both of we blush when we meet one another in my uncle lazare 's church i could have vow she detest I she talk on that particular day for a few minute with the woman who be wash the sound of she pearly laughter reach as far as I mingle with the loud voice of the durance then she stoop down to take a little water in the hollow of she hand but the bank be high and babet who be on the point of slip save herself by clutch the grass i give a frightful shudder which make my blood run cold i rise hastily and without feel ashamed without redden run to the young girl she cast a startled look at I then she begin to smile i bent down at the risk of fall i succeed in fill my right hand with water by keep my finger close together and i present this new sort of cup to babet ' ask she to drink the woman who be wash laugh babet confuse do not dare accept she hesitate and half turn she head away at last she make up she mind and delicately press she lip to the tip of my finger but she have wait too long all the water have run away then she burst out laugh she become a child again and i see very well that she be make fun of I i be very silly i bent forward again this time i take the water in both hand and hasten to put they to babet 's lip she drink and i feel the warm kiss from she mouth run up my arm to my breast which it fill with heat oh how my uncle must sleep i murmured to myself just as i say that i perceive a dark shadow beside I and have turn round i see my uncle lazare in person a few pace away watch babet and I as if offend he cassock appear quite white in the sun in he look i see reproach which make I feel inclined to cry babet be very much afraid she turn quite red and

only take I into the broad walk to scold I at he ease it would occupy at least a hour : breakfast would get cold and i would be unable to return to the water 's edge and dream of the warm burn that babet 's lip have leave on my hand we be in the broad walk this walk which be wide and short run beside the river it be shaded by enormous oak tree with trunk lacerate by seam stretch out they great tall branch the fine grass spread like a carpet beneath the tree and the sun riddle the foliage embroidered this carpet with a rosaceous pattern in gold in the distance all around extend raw green

understand the thought that be choke I for he feign not to notice my want of appetite as soon as i be able to rise from table i hasten to return and breathe the open air outside a fresh breeze rise from the river the dull splashing of which i hear in the distance a soft light fall from the sky the valley expand peaceful and transparent like a dark shoreless ocean there be vague sound in the air a sort of impassioned tremor like a great flap of wing pass above my head penetrate perfume rise with the cool air from the grass i have go out to see babet i know she come to the parsonage every night and i go and place myself in ambush behind a hedge i have get rid of my timidness of the morning i consider it quite natural to be wait for she there because she love I and i have to tell she of

the truth besides he never tell fib you love I you love I babet you lip this morning confide the secret very softly to my finger and i make she sit down at the foot of the hedge my memory have retain my first chat of love in its absolute innocence babet listen to I like a little sister she be no longer afraid she tell I the story of she love and there be solemn sermon ingenious avowal project without end she vow she would marry no one but I i vow to deserve she hand by labor and tenderness there be a cricket behind the hedge who accompany we chat with he chaunt of hope and all the valley whispering in the dark take pleasure in hear we talk so softly on separate we forget to kiss each other when i return to my little room it appear to I that i have leave it for at least a year that day which be so short seem a eternity of happiness it be the warmest and most sweetly-scented spring-day of my life and the remembrance of it be now like the distant falter voice of my youth ii summer when i awake at about three o'clock in the morning on that particular day i be lie on the hard ground tire out and with my face bath in perspiration the hot heavy atmosphere of a July night weigh I down my companion be sleep around I wrap in they hooded cloak they speckled the gray ground with black and the obscure plain pant i fancied i hear the heavy breathing of a slumbering multitude indistinct sound the neighing of horse the clash of arm ring out amidst the rustling silence the army have halt at about midnight and we have receive order to lie down and sleep we have be march for three day scorch by the sun and blind by dust the enemy be at length in front of we over there on those hill on the horizon at daybreak a decisive battle would be fight i have be a victim to despondency for three day i have be as if trample on without energy and without think for the future it be the excessive fatigue indeed that have just awaken I now lie on my back with my eye wide open i be think whilst gaze into the night i thought of this battle this butchery which the sun be about to light up for more than six year at the first shot in each fight i have be say good-bye to those i love the most fondly babet and uncle lazare and now barely a month before my discharge i have to say good-bye again and this time perhaps for ever then my thought soften with closed eyelid i see babet and my uncle lazare how long it be since i have kiss they i remember the day of we separation my uncle weep because he be poor and allow I to leave like that and babet in the evening have vow she would wait for I and that she would never love another i have have to quit all my master at grenoble my friend at dourgue a few letter have come from time to time to tell I they always love I and that happiness be await I in my well-beloved valley and i i be go to fight i be go to get kill i begin dream of my return i see my poor old uncle on the threshold of the parsonage extend he tremble arm and behind he be babet quite red smile through she tear i fall into they arm and kiss they seek for expression -- suddenly the beating of drum recall I to stern reality daybreak have come the gray plain expand in the morning mist the ground become full of life indistinct form appear on all side a sound that become louder and louder fill the air it be the call of bugle the gallop of horse the rumble of artillery the shout out of order war come threatening amidst my dream of tenderness i rise with difficulty it seem to I that my bone be break and that my head be about to split i hastily get my man together for i must tell you that i have win the rank of sergeant we soon receive order to bear to the left and occupy a hillock above the plain as we be about to move the sergeant-major come run along and shout : a letter for sergeant gourdon and he hand I a dirty crumpled letter which have be lie perhaps for a week in the leather bag of the post-office i have only just time to recognize the writing of my uncle lazare forward march shout the major i have to march for a few seconds i hold the poor letter in my hand devour it with my eye it burn my finger i would have give everything in the world to have sit down and weep at ease whilst read it i have to content myself with slip it under my tunic against my heart i have never experience such agony by way of consolation i say to myself what my uncle have so often repeat to I : i be in the summer of my life at the moment of the fierce struggle and it be essential that i should perform my duty bravely if i would have a peaceful and bountiful autumn but these reason exasperate I the more : this letter which have come to speak to I of happiness burnt my heart which have revolt against the folly of war and i could not even read it i be perhaps go to die without know what it contain without peruse my uncle lazare 's affectionate remark for the last time we have reach the top of the hill we be to await order there to advance the battle-field have be marvellously choose to slaughter one another at ease the immense plain expand for several league and be quite bare without a house or tree hedge and bush make slight spot on the whiteness of the ground i have never since see such a country a ocean of dust a chalky soil burst open here and there and display its tawny bowels and never either have i since witness a sky of such intense purity a July day so lovely and so warm at eight o'clock the sultry heat be already scorch we face o the splendid morning and what a sterile plain to kill and die in firing have break out with irregular crackling sound a long time since support by the solemn growl of the cannon the enemy austrian dress in white have quit the height and the plain be stud with long file of man who look to I about as big as insect one might have think it be a ant-hill in insurrection cloud of smoke hang over the battle-field at time when these cloud break asunder i perceive soldier in flight smitten with terrify panic thus there be current of fright which bear man away and outburst of shame and courage which bring they back under fire i could neither hear the cry of the wound nor see the blood flow i could only distinguish the dead which the battalion leave behind they and which resemble black patch i begin to watch the movement of the troops with curiosity irritated at the smoke which hide a good half of the show experience a sort of egotistic pleasure at the knowledge that i be in security whilst other be die at about nine o'clock we be order to advance we go down the hill at the double and proceed towards the center which be give way the regular beat of we footstep appear to I funeral-like the bravest among we pant pale and with haggard feature i have make up my mind to tell the truth at the first whistle of the bullet the battalion suddenly come to a halt tempt to fly forward forward shout the chief but we be rivet to the ground bow we head when a bullet whistle by we ear this movement be instinctive if shame have not restrain I i would have throw myself flat on my stomach in the dust before we be a huge veil of smoke which we dare not penetrate red flash pass through this smoke and shudder we still stand still but the bullet reach we soldier fall with yell the chief shout louder : forward forward the rear rank which they push on compel we to march then close we eye we make a fresh dash and enter the smoke we be seize with furious rage when the cry of halt resound we experience difficulty in come to a standstill as soon as one be motionless fear return and one feel a wish to run away firing commence we shoot in front of we without aim find some relief in discharge bullet into the smoke i remember i pull my trigger mechanically with lip firmly set together and eye wide open i be no longer afraid for to tell the truth i no longer know if i exist the only idea i have in my head be that i would continue firing until all be over my companion on the left receive a bullet full in the face and fall on I i brutally push he away wipe my cheek which he have drench with blood and i resume firing i still remember have see we colonel m de montrevert firm and erect upon he horse gaze quietly towards the enemy that man appear to I immense he have no rifle to amuse himself with and he breast be expand to its full breadth above we from time to time he look down and exclaim in a dry voice : close the rank close the rank we close we rank like sheep tread on the dead stupefied and continue firing until then the enemy have only send we bullet a dull explosion be hear and a shell carry off five of we man a battery which must have be opposite we and which we could not see have just open fire the shell strike into the middle of we almost at one spot make a sanguinary gap which we close unceasingly with the obstinacy of ferocious brute close the rank close the rank the colonel coldly repeat we be give the cannon human flesh each time a soldier be strike down i be take a step nearer death i be approach the spot where the shell be fall heavily crush the man whose turn have come to die the corpse be form heap in that place and soon the shell would strike into nothing more than a mound of mangled flesh shred of limb fly about at each fresh discharge we could no longer close the rank the soldier yell the chief themselves be move with the bayonet with the bayonet and amidst a shower of bullet the battalion rush in fury towards the shell the veil of smoke be tear asunder we perceive the enemy 's battery flame red which be firing at we from the

cattle and horse the neighing and lowing of these poor beast pierce I to the heart jacque question I with he eye he would have like to try and deliver they they agonising moan soon become lamentable and a great crack sound be hear the ox have just break down the stable door we see they pass before we bear away by the flood roll over and over in the current and they disappear amid the roar of the

jacque in agony we shall be crushed beneath the ruin let we look for board let we make a raft he say that in he excitement i would naturally have prefer a thousand time to be in the middle of the river on a few beam lash together than beneath the roof of this house which be about to fall in but where could we lay hand on the beam we require in a rage i tear the plank from the cupboard jacque break the furniture we take away the shutter every piece of wood we could reach and feel it be impossible to utilise these fragment we cast they into the middle of the room in a fury and continue

begged jacque to come near we i wish we all to die in the same embrace jacque have return to the window and suddenly he exclaim : father we be save -- come and see the sky be clear the roof of a shed tear away by the current have come to a standstill beneath we window this roof which be several yard broad be form of light beam and thatch it float and would make a capital raft i join my hand together and would have worship this wood and straw jacque jump on the roof after have firmly secure it he walk on the thatch make sure it be everywhere strong the thatch resist therefore we could adventure on it without fear oh it will carry we all very well say jacque joyfully see how little it sink into the water the difficulty will be to steer it he look around he and seize two pole drift along in the current as they pass by ah here be oar he continue you will go to the stern father and i forward and we will maneuver the raft easily there be not twelve foot of water quick quick get on board we must not lose a minute my poor babet try to smile she wrap little marie carefully up in she shawl the child have just wake up and quite alarmed maintain a silence which be break by deep sob i place a chair before the window and make babet get on the raft as i hold she in my arm i kiss she with poignant emotion feeling this kiss be the last the water be begin to pour into the room we foot be soak i be the last to embark then i undo the cord the current hurl we against the wall it require precaution and many effort to quit the farmhouse the fog have little by little dispersed it be about midnight when we leave the star be still bury in mist the moon which be almost at the edge of the horizon light up the night with a sort of wan daylight the inundation then appear to we in all its grandiose horror the valley have become a river the durance swollen to enormous proportion and wash the two hillside pass between dark mass of cultivate land and be the sole thing display life in the inanimate space bound by the horizon it thunder with a sovereign voice maintain in its anger the majesty of its colossal wave clump of tree emerge in place stain the sheet of pale water with black streak opposite we i recognize the top of the oak along the walk the current carry we towards these branch which for we be so many reef around the raft float various kind of remains piece of wood empty barrel bundle of grass the river be bear along the ruin it have make in its anger to the left we perceive the light of dourgue -- flash of lantern move about in the darkness the water could not have rise as high as the village only the low land have be submerge no doubt assistance would come we search the patch of light hang over the water it seem to we at every instant that we hear the sound of oar we have start at random as soon as the raft be in the middle of the current lose amidst the whirlpool of the river anguish of mind overtake we again we almost regret have leave the farm i sometimes turn round and gaze at the house which still remain standing present a gray aspect on the white water babet crouch down in the center of the raft in the thatch of the roof be hold little marie on she knee the child 's head against she breast to hide the horror of the river from she both be bent double lean forward in a embrace as if reduce in stature by fear jacque stand upright in the front be lean on he pole with all he weight from time to time he cast a rapid glance towards we and then silently resume he task i second he as well as i could but we effort to reach the bank remain fruitless little by little notwithstanding we pole which we bury into the mud until we nearly break they we drift into the open a force that seem to come from the depths of the water drive we away the durance be slowly take possession of we struggle bath in perspiration we have work ourselves into a passion we be fight with the river as with a living be seek to vanquish wound kill it it strain we in its giant-like arm and we pole in we hand become weapon which we thrust into its breast it roar fling its slaver into we face wriggle beneath we stroke we resist its victory with clenched tooth we would not be conquer and we have mad impulse to fall the monster to calm it with blow from we fist we go slowly towards the offing we be already at the entrance to the oak-tree walk the dark branch pierce through the water which they tear with a lamentable sound death perhaps await we there in a collision i cry out to jacque to follow the walk by cling close to the branch and it be thus that i pass for the last time in the middle of this oak-tree alley where i have walk in my youth and ripe age in the terrible darkness above the howling depth i thought of uncle lazare and see the happy day of my youth smile at I sadly the durance triumph at the end of the alley we pole no longer touch the bottom the water bear we along in its impetuous bind of victory and now it could do what it please with we we give ourselves up we go downstream with frightful rapidity great cloud dirty tattered rag hang about the sky when the moon be hide there come lugubrious obscurity then we roll in chaos enormous billow as black as ink resemble the back of fish bear we along spin we round i could no longer see either babet or the child i already feel myself die i know not how long this last run last the moon be suddenly unveil and the horizon become clear and in that light i perceive a immense black mass in front of we which block the way and towards which we be be carry with all the violence of the current we be lose we would be break there babet have stand upright she hold out little marie to I : take the child she exclaim leave I alone leave I alone jacque have already catch babet in he arm in a loud voice he say : father save the little one -- i will save mother we have come close to the black mass i think i recognize a tree the shock be terrible and the raft split in two scatter its straw and beam in the whirlpool of water i fall clasp little marie tightly to I the icy cold water bring back all my courage on rise to the surface of the river i support the child i half lay she on my neck and begin to swim laboriously if the little creature have not lose consciousness but have struggle we should both have remain at the bottom of the deep and whilst i swam i feel choke with anxiety i call jacque i try to see in the distance but i hear nothing save the roar of the water i see naught but the pale sheet of the durance jacque and babet be at the bottom she must have cling to he drag he down in a deadly strain of she arm what frightful agony i want to die i sink slowly i be go to find they beneath the black water and as soon as the flood touch little marie 's face i struggle again with impetuous anguish to get near the waterside it be thus that i abandon babet and jacque in despair at have be unable to die with they still call out to they in a husky voice the river cast I on the stone like one of those bundle of grass it leave on its way when i come to myself again i take my daughter who be open she eye in my arm day be break my winter night be at a end that terrible night which have be a accomplice in the murder of my wife and son at this moment after year of regret one last consolation remain to I i be the icy winter but i feel the approach spring stir within I as my uncle lazare say we never die i have have four season and here i be return to the spring there be my dear marie commence the everlasting joy and sorrow over again baron de trenck by clemence robert baron de trenck already have endure a year of arbitrary imprisonment in the fortress of glatz ignorant alike of the cause of he detention or the length of time which he be destine to spend in captivity during the early part of the month of September major doo aide to the governor of the prison of glatz enter the prisoner 's apartment for a domiciliary visit accompany by a adjutant and the officer of the guard it be noon the excessive heat of the die summer have grow almost unsupportable in the tower chamber where baron de trenck be confine half empty flagon be scatter among the book which litter he table but the repeat draught in which the prisoner have seek refreshment have only serve to add to he ever-increasing exasperation the major ransack every nook and corner of the prisoner 's chamber and the interior of such piece of furniture as might afford a possible hiding-place remark the annoyance which this investigation cause the baron doo say arrogantly : the general have issue he order and it be a matter of little consequence to he whether or not they displease you you attempt to escape have greatly incense he against you and i retort trenck with like hauteur be equally indifferent to you general 's displeasure i shall continue to dispose of my time as may best please I good reply the major but in you own interest you would be wiser to philosophize with you book and seek the key to the science rather than that of the fortress i do not need you advice major the baron observe with sovereign disdain you may perhaps repent later that you do not heed it you attempt to escape have anger even the king and it be impossible to say just how far he severity toward you may go but great heaven when i be deprive of my liberty without cause have i not the right to endeavor to regain it they do not see the matter in that light in berlin as a matter of fact this spirit of revolt against you sovereign only serve to greatly aggravate you crime my crime trenck exclaim tremble with anger he glance fall upon the major 's sword and the thought come to he to tear it from he side and pierce he throat with it but in the same instant it occur to he that he might rather profit by the situation pale and tremble as he be he retain sufficient self-control to modify the expression of he countenance and the tone of he voice though he glance remain fix upon the sword major he say no one can be call a criminal until he have be so adjudge by the court happily a man 's honor do not depend upon the inconsequent malicious opinion of other on the contrary blame should attach to he who condemn the accuse without a hearing no constitute power whether that of king or judge have yet convict I of any culpable action apart from the courtesy which should be observe between officer of the same rank you out of simple justice should refrain front such a accusation every one know retorted boo that you enter into relation with the enemy i great god do you not consider the pandour then as such i visit they chief solely as a relative a glass of wine share with he in he tent can hardly be construe into a dangerous alliance but you hope to inherit great riches from this relative that hope might well impel you to cross the frontier of bohemia for all time why what egregious folly what more could i hope for than that which i already possess in berlin be i a poor adventurer seek he fortune by he sword rich in my own right enjoy to the full the king 's favor attach to the court by all that satisfied pride could demand as well as by tie of the tenderest sentiment what more be there for I to covet or to seek elsewhere the major turn he head aside with a air of indifference one single fact suffice to discount everything you have say baron he reply dryly you have twice attempt to escape from the fortress a innocent man await he trial with confidence know that it can not be other than favorable the culprit alone flee trenck though quiver with blind rage continue to maintain he former attitude he feature compose he eye fix upon the major 's sword sir he say in three week on the twenty-fifth of September i shall have be a prisoner for one year you in you position may not have find the time long but to I it have drag interminably and it have be still harder for I to bear because i have not be able to count the day or hour which still separate I from justice and liberty if i know the limit set to my captivity -- no matter what it may be -- i could surely find resignation and patience to await it it be most unfortunate then say the major that no one could give you that information say rather would not reply trenck surely something of the matter must be know here you for instance major might tell I frankly what you think to be the case ah say doo assume the self-satisfied manner of a jailer it would not be proper for I to answer that you would save I from despair and revolt reply trenck warmly for i give you my word of honor that from the moment i know when my captivity be to terminate -- no matter when that may be or what my subsequent fate -- i will make no further attempt to evade it by flight and you want I to tell you -- yes interrupted trenck with a shudder yes once again i ask you doo smile maliciously as he answer : the end of you captivity why a traitor can scarcely hope for release the heat of the day the wine he have drunk overwhelming anger and he fiery blood all mount to trenck 's head incapable of further self-restraint he fling himself upon the major tear the coveted sword from he side dash out of the chamber fling the two sentinel at the door down the stair take they entire length himself at a single bind and spring into the midst of the assemble guard trenck fell upon they with he sword shower blow right and leave the blade flash snakelike in he powerful grasp the soldier fall back before the fierce onslaught have disabled four of the man the prisoner succeed in force he way past the remainder and race for the first rampart there he mount the rampart and never stop to gauge its height spring down into the moat landing upon he foot in the bottom of the dry ditch faster still he fly to the second rampart and scale it as he have do the first clamber up by means of project stone and interstice it be just past noon the sun blaze full upon the scene and every one within the prison stand astounded at the miraculous flight in which trenck seem to fairly soar through the air those of the soldier whom trenck have not overthrow pursued but with little hope of overtake he they gun be unloaded so that they be unable to shoot after he not a soldier dare to risk try to follow he by the road he have take over the rampart and moat for without that passion for liberty which lend wing to the prisoner there be no hope of any of they scale the wall without kill himself a dozen time over they be therefore compel to make use of the regular passage to the outer postern and these latter be locate at a considerable distance from the prisoner 's avenue of escape he be certain at the pace he be maintain to gain at least a half-hour 's start over he pursuer once beyond the wall of the prison with the wood close by it seem as if trenck 's escape be assure beyond doubt he have now come to a narrow passageway lead to the last of the inner postern which pierce the wall here he find a sentinel on guard and the soldier spring up to confront he but a soldier to overcome be not a obstacle to stop the desperate flight of the baron he strike the man heavily in the face with he sword stunning he and send he roll in the dust once through the postern there now remain only a single palisade or stockade -- a great fence construct of iron bar and iron trellis-work which constitute the outermost barrier between the flee prisoner and liberty once over that iron palisade he have only to dash into the wood and disappear but it be ordain that trenck be not to overcome this last obstacle simple as it appear at a fatal moment he foot be catch between two bar of the palisade and he be unable to free himself while he be engage in superhuman but futile effort to release he foot the sentinel of the passage who have pick himself up run through the postern toward the palisade follow by another soldier from the garrison together they fall upon trenck overwhelming he with blow with the butt of they musket and secure he bruise and bleed he be bear back to he cell major doo inform trenck after this abortive attempt to escape that he have be condemn to one year 's imprisonment only that year be within three week of expire when the infamous major who be a italian goad the unfortunate young man into open defiance of he sovereign 's mandate he pardon be at once annul and he confinement now become most rigorous another plot head by three officer and several soldier of the guard who be friendly to trenck be discover at the last moment -- in time for the conspirator themselves to escape to bohemia but under circumstance which prevent baron de trenck from accompany they this also serve to increase the hardship of the prisoner 's lot and he now find himself deprive of the former companionship of he friend and surround by stranger the one familiar face remain be that of lieutenant bach a danish officer a braggart swordsman and ruffler who have always be hostile to he but despite he isolation the energy and strength of trenck 's character be only augmented by he misfortune and he never cease to plot for he deliverance week pass without any fruitful event occur in the life of the prisoner yet help be to come to he from a source from which he could never have expect it but before that fortuitous result be destine to take place -- in fact as preliminary to its achievement -- he be destine to be a actor in the most remarkable scene that ever have be record in the annals of prison life and in one of the strangest duel of modern time one day trenck have cast himself fully clothe upon he bed in order to obtain a change of position in he cramped place of confinement lieutenant bach be on duty as he guard the young baron have retain in prison the proud and haughty demeanor which have formerly bring upon he so much censure at court lieutenant bach 's countenance also bear the imprint of incarnate pride the two exchange from time to time glance of insolence for the rest they remain silently smoking side by side trenck be the first to break the silence for prisoner grasp every opportunity for conversation and at any price it appear to I you hand be wound lieutenant trenck say have you find another opportunity to cross sword lieutenant schell it seem to I look somewhat obliquely at I reply the dane therefore i indulge he in a pass or two direct against he right arm such a delicate youth and so mild-mannered be you not ashamed what could i do there be no one else at hand nevertheless he seem to have wound you yes accidentally though without know what he do the fact then of have be expel from two regiment for you highhanded act and finally transfer to the garrison of the fortress of glatz as punishment have not cure you of you fire-eating propensity when a man have the reputation of be the best swordsman in prussium he value that title somewhat more than you military rank which any clumsy fool can obtain you the best swordsman exclaim trenck conclude he remark with a ironical puff of smoke i flatter myself that such be the case retort bach emit in turn a great cloud of tobacco-smoke if i be free say trenck i might perhaps prove to you in short order that such be not the case do you claim to be my master at that art i flatter myself that such be the case that we shall soon see cry bach flush with rage how can we i be disarm and a prisoner ah yes you make you claim out of sheer boastfulness because you think we can not put it to the test truly lieutenant set I at liberty and i swear to you that on the other side of the frontier we will put we skill to the test as freely as you like well i be unwilling to wait for that we will fight here baron trenck in this room after you assertion i must either humble you arrogance or lose my reputation i shall be glad to know how you propose to do so ah you talk of bohemia because that country be far away as for I i prefer this one because it afford a immediate opportunity to put the matter to the test i should ask nothing better if it be not impossible impossible you shall see if it be bach spring up a old door support by a couple of bench have be place in the chamber for a table he hammer at the worm-eaten wood and knock off a strip which he split in half one of these substitute for rapier he give to trenck retain the other himself and both place themselves on guard after the first few pass trenck send he adversary 's make-shift sword fly through space and with he own he meet the lieutenant full in the chest touché he cry heaven it be true growl bach but i 'll have my revenge he go out hastily trenck watch he in utter amazement and he be even more astounded when a instant later he see bach return with a couple of sword which he draw out from beneath he uniform now he say to trenck it be for you to show what you can do with good steel you risk return the baron smile calmly you risk over and above the danger of be wound lose that absolute superiority in matter of the sword of which you be so proud defend yourself braggart shout bach show you skill instead of talk about it he fling himself furiously upon trenck the latter seem only to trifle lightly with he weapon at first parry he thrust and then press the attack in turn wound bach severely in the arm the lieutenant 's weapon clatter upon the floor for a instant he pause immovable overcome by amazement then a irresistible admiration -- a supreme tenderness invade he soul he fling himself weep in trenck 's arm exclaim : you be my master then draw away from the prisoner he contemplate he with the same enthusiasm but more reflectively and observe : yes baron you far exceed I in the use of the sword you be the greatest duelist of the day and a man of you caliber must not remain longer in prison the baron be somewhat take by surprise at this but with he usual presence of mind he immediately set himself to derive such profit as he might from he guardian 's extravagant access of affection yes my dear bach he reply yes i should be free for the reason you mention and by every right but where be the man who will assist I to escape from these wall here baron say the lieutenant you shall regain you freedom as surely as my name be bach oh i believe in you my worthy friend cry trenck you will keep you word wait resume bach reflectively you can not leave the citadel without the assistance of a officer i should compromise you at every step you have just see what a hot-tempered scatterbrain i be but i have in mind one who admire you profoundly you shall know who he be tonight and together we will set you at liberty bach do in fact redeem he promise he introduce lieutenant schell who be to be trenck 's companion during they arduous flight into bohemia into the prisoner 's cell and himself obtain leave of absence for the purpose of secure fund for he fellow conspirator the plot be discover before he return and schell warn of this by one of the governor 's adjutant hasten the day of they flight in scale the first rampart schell fall and sprain he ankle so severely that he could not use it but trenck be equal to all emergency he would not abandon he companion he place he across he shoulder and thus burden climb the outer barrier and wander all night in the bitter cold flee through the snow to escape he pursuer in the morning by a clever ruse he secure two horse and thus mount he and he companion succeed in reach bohemia trenck direct he course toward brandenburg where he sister dwelt near the prussian and bohemian frontier in the castle of waldau for he count upon she assistance to enable he to settle in a foreign land where he would be safe the two friend reduce shortly to the direst poverty part with they horse and all but the most necessary wear apparel even now though in bohemia they be not free from pursuit impel one night through hunger and cold to throw themselves upon the bounty of a inn-keeper they find in he a loyal and true friend the worthy host reveal to they the true identity of four suppose travel merchant who have that day accost they on the road and follow they to the inn these man be in fact emissary from the fortress of glatz who have attempt to bribe he to betray the fugitive into they hand for they be swear to capture trenck and he companion and return they dead or alive to the enraged governor of the fortress in the morning the four prussian the carriage the driver and the horse set forth and soon disappear in the distance two hour later the fugitive fortify by a good breakfast take they departure from the ezenstochow inn leave behind they a man whom they at least esteem as the greatest honor to mankind the traveler hasten toward dankow they choose the most direct route and tramp along in the open without a thought of the infamous spy who might already be on they track they arrive at nightfall at they destination however without further hindrance the next day they set out for parsemachus in bohemia they start early and a day in the open together with a night 's sleep have almost obliterate the memory of they adventure at the inn the cold be intense the day be gray with heavy cloud that no longer promised rain but which shroud the country with a pall of gloom the wind swirl and howl and though the two friend struggle to keep they few thin garment draw closely about they they still search the horizon hopefully think of the journey 's end and the peaceful existence which await they to they right the aspect of the countryside have alter somewhat great wooded stretch spread away into the distance while to the leave all be yet free and open they have go about half a mile past the first clump of tree when they notice through the sway branch by the roadside a motionless object around which several man busy themselves with every step they gain a clearer impression of the nature of this obstacle until at last a expression of half-mockery half-anger overspread they feature now god forgive I exclaimed schell finally but that be the infernal brown travel carriage from the inn may the devil take I rejoin trenck if i delay or flee a step from those miserable rascal and they stride sturdily onward as soon as they be within speak distance one of the prussian a big man in a furred cap believe they to be wholly unsuspicious call to they : my dear sir in heaven 's name come help we we carriage have be overturn and it be impossible to get it out of this rut the friend have reach a angle of the road where a few withered tree branch alone separate they from the other they perceive the brown body of the carriage half open like a huge rat-trap and beside it the forbid face of they would-be captor trenck launch these word through the intervene screen of branch : go to the devil miserable scoundrel that you be and may you remain there then swift as a arrow he speed toward the open field to the left of the highroad feign flight the carriage which have be overturn solely for the purpose of mislead they be soon right and the driver lash he horse forward in pursuit of the fugitive the four prussian accompany he with draw pistol when they be almost within reach distance of they prey they raise they pistol and shout : surrender rascal or you be dead man this be what trenck desire he wheel about and discharge he pistol send a bullet through the first prussian 's breast stretch he dead upon the spot at the same moment schell fire but he assailant return the shot and wound he trenck again discharge he pistol twice in succession then as one of the prussian who be apparently still uninjured take to flight across the plain he speed furiously after he the pursuit continue some two or three hundred pace the prussian as if impel by some irresistible force whirl around and trenck catch sight of he blanched countenance and blood-stained linen one of the shot have strike he instantly trenck put a end to the half-finished task with a sword thrust but the time waste on the prussian have cost he dear return hastily to the field of action he perceive schell struggle in the grasp of the two remain prussian wound as he be he have be unable to cope single-handed with they and be rapidly be bear toward the carriage courage schell trenck shout i be come at the sound of he friend 's voice schell feel himself save by a supreme effort he succeed in release himself from he captor frantic with rage and disappointment the prussian again advance to the attack upon the two wretched fugitive but trenck 's blood be up he make a furious onslaught upon they with he sword drive they back step by step to they carriage into which they finally tumble shout to the driver in frantic haste to whip up he horse as the carriage dash away the friend draw long breath of relief and wipe away the blood and powder stain from they heated brow careless of they suffering these iron-hearted man merely congratulate each other upon they victory ah it be well end schell exclaim trenck and i rejoice that we have have this opportunity to chastise the miserable traitor but you be wound my poor schell it be nothing the lieutenant reply carelessly merely a wound in the throat and i think another in the head this be the last attempt for a considerable time to regain possession of trenck 's person but the two friend suffer greatly from hardship and be make to feel more than once the cruelty of prussian oppression even trenck 's sister instigate thereto by she husband who fear to incur the displeasure of frederick the great refuse the poor fugitive shelter money or as much as a crust of bread and this after trenck have jeopardize he liberty by return to prussian soil in order to meet she it be at this period when starvation stare the exile in the face that trenck meet the russian general liewen a relative of trenck 's mother who offer the baron a captaincy in the tobolsk dragoon and furnish he with the money necessary for he equipment trenck and schell be now compel to part the latter journey to italy to rejoin relative there the baron to go to russia where he be to attain the highest eminence of grandeur baron de trenck on he journey to russium pass through danzig which be at that time neutral territory border upon the confines of prussium here he delay for a time in the hope of meeting with

five or six year marcel have be engage upon the famous painting which he say be mean to represent the passage of the red sea and for five or six year this masterpiece in color have be obstinately refuse by the jury indeed from its constant journey back and forth from the artist 's studio to the musée and from the musée to the studio the painting know the road so well that one need only to set it on roller and it would have be quite capable of reach the louvre alone marcel who have repaint the picture ten time and minutely go over it from top to bottom vow that only a personal hostility on the part of the member of the jury could account for the ostracism which annually turn he away from the salon and in he idle moment he have compose in honor of those watch-dog of the institute a little dictionary of insult with illustration of a savage irony this collection gain celebrity and enjoy among the studio and in the ecole des beaux-art the same sort of popular success as that achieve by the immortal complaint of giovannus bellinus painter by appointment to the grand sultan of the turk every dauber in paris have a copy store away in he memory for a long time marcel have not allow himself to be discourage by the emphatic refusal which greet he at each exposition he be comfortably settle in he opinion that he picture be in a modest way the companion piece long await by the wedding of cana that gigantic masterpiece whose dazzling splendor the dust of three century have not dim accordingly each year at the time of the salon marcel send he picture to be examine by the jury only in order to throw the examiner off the track and if possible to make they abandon the policy of exclusion which they seem to have adopt toward the passage of the red sea marcel without in any way disturb the general scheme of he picture modify certain detail and change its title for instance on one occasion it arrive before the jury under the name of the passage of the rubicon but pharaoh poorly disguise under caesar 's mantle be recognize and repulse with all the honor that be he due the following year marcel spread over the level plane of he picture a layer of white represent snow plant a pine-tree in one corner and clothing a egyptian as a grenadier of the imperial guard rechristen the painting the passage of the beresina the jury which on that very day have polish its spectacles on the lining of its illustrious coat be not in any way take in by this new ruse it recognize perfectly well the persistent painting above all by a big brute of a horse of many color which be rear out of one of the wave of the red sea the coat of that horse have serve marcel for all he experiment in color and in private conversation he call it he synoptic table of fine tone because he have reproduce in they play of light and shade all possible combination of color but once again insensible to this detail the jury seem scarcely able to find blackball enough to emphasize they refusal of the passage of the beresina very well say marcel no more than i expect next year i shall send it back under the title of ` passage des panoramas ' that will be one on they -- on they -- on they they they sing the musician schaunard fitting the word to a new air he have be compose -- a terrible air noisy as a gamut of thunderclap and the accompaniment to which be a terror to every piano in the neighborhood how could they refuse that picture without have every drop of the vermilion in my red sea rise up in they face and cover they with shame murmur marcel as he gaze at the painting when one think that it contain a good hundred crown ' worth of paint and a million of genius not to speak of the fair day of my youth fast grow bald as my hat but they shall never have the last word until my die breath i shall keep on send they my painting i want to have it engrave upon they memory that be certainly the surest way of ever get it engrave say gustave colline in a plaintive voice add to himself : that be a good one that be -- really a good one i must get that off the next time i be ask out marcel continue he imprecation which schaunard continue to set to music oh they will not accept I say marcel ah the government pay they board they give they the cross solely for the one purpose of refuse I once a year on the 1st of march i see they idea clearly now -- i see it perfectly clearly they be try to drive I to break my brush they hope perhaps by refuse my red sea to make I throw myself out of the window in despair but they know very little of the human heart if they expect to catch I with such a clumsy trick i shall no longer wait for the time of the annual salon begin with to-day my work become the canvas of damocle eternally suspend over they existence from now on i be go to send it once a week to each one of they at they home in the bosom of they family in the full heart of they private life it shall trouble they domestic joy it shall make they think that they wine be sour they dinner burn they wife bad-tempered they will very soon become insane and will have to be put in strait-jacket when they go to the institute on the day when there be meeting that idea please

increase to the verge of delirium the four friend go forth from this splendid feast as intoxicated as on a day of vintage they inebriety come near bearing deplorable fruit for marcel because as he pass the shop of he tailor at two o'clock in the morning he absolutely insist upon awaken he creditor in order to give he on account the one hundred and fifty franc that he have just receive but a gleam of reason still awake in the brain of colline hold back the artist from the brink of this precipice a week after this festivity marcel learn in what gallery he picture have find a place pass along the faubourg saint-honoré he stop in the midst of a crowd that seem to be stare at a sign newly place above a shop this sign be none other than marcel 's painting which have be sell by medici to a dealer in provision only the passage of the red sea have once again undergo a modification and bear a new title a steamboat have be add to it and it be now call in the port of marseille a flattering ovation arise among the crowd when they discover the picture and marcel turn away delighted with this triumph and murmur softly : the voice of the people be the voice of god the woman and the cat by marcel prevost yes say we old friend tribourdeaux a man of culture and a philosopher which be a combination rarely find among army surgeon yes the supernatural be everywhere it surround we and hem we in and permeate we if science pursue it it take flight and can not be grasp we intellect resemble those ancestor of ours who clear a few acre of forest whenever they approach the limit of they clearing they hear low growl and see gleaming eye everywhere circle they about i myself have have the sensation of have approach the limit of the unknown several time in my life and on one occasion in particular a young lady present interrupted he : doctor you be evidently die to tell we a story come now begin the doctor bow no i be not in the least anxious i assure you i tell this story as seldom as possible for it disturb those who hear it and it disturb I also however if you wish it here it be : in 1863 i be a young physician station at orléans in that patrician city full of aristocratic old residence it be difficult to find bachelor apartment and as i like both plenty of air and plenty of room i take up my lodging on the first floor of a large building situate just outside the city near saint-euverte it have be originally construct to serve as the warehouse and also as the dwelling of a manufacturer of rug in course of time the manufacturer have fail and this big barrack that he have build fall out of repair through lack of tenant have be sell for a song with all its furnishings the purchaser hope to make a future profit out of he purchase for the city be grow in that direction and as a matter of fact i believe that at the present time the house be include within the city limit when i take up my quarter there however the mansion stand alone on the verge of the open country at the end of a straggle street on which a few stray house produce at dusk the impression of a jaw from which most of the tooth have fall out i lease one-half of the first floor a apartment of four room for my bedroom and my study i take the two that front on the street in the third room i set up some shelf for my wardrobe and the other room i leave empty this make a very comfortable lodge for I and i have for a sort of promenade a broad balcony that run along the entire front of the building or rather one-half of the balcony since it be divide into two part -lrb- please note this carefully -rrb- by a fan of ironwork over which however one could easily climb i have be live there for about two month when one night in July on return to my room i see with a good deal of surprise a light shine through the window of the other apartment on the same floor which i have suppose to be uninhabited the effect of this light be extraordinary it light up with a pale yet perfectly distinct reflection part of the balcony the street below and a bit of the neighbor field i think to myself ` aha i have a neighbor the idea indeed be not altogether agreeable for i have be rather proud of my exclusive proprietorship on reach my bedroom i pass noiselessly out upon the balcony but already the light have be extinguish so i go back into my room and sit down to read for a hour or two from time to time i seem to hear about I as though within the wall light footstep but after finish my book i go to bed and speedily fall asleep about midnight i suddenly awake with a curious feeling that something be stand beside I i raise myself in bed light a candle and this be what i saw in the middle of the room stand a immense cat gaze upon I with phosphorescent eye and with its back slightly arch it be a magnificent angora with long fur and a fluffy tail and of a remarkable color -- exactly like that of the yellow silk that one see in cocoon -- so that as the light gleam upon its coat the animal seem to be make of gold it slowly move toward I on its velvety paw softly rub its sinuous body against my leg i lean over to stroke it and it permit my caress purr and finally leap upon my knee i notice then that it be a female cat quite young and that she seem disposed to permit I to pet she as long as ever i would finally however i put she down upon the floor and try to induce she to leave the room but she leap away from I and hide herself somewhere among the furniture though as soon as i have blow out my candle she jump upon my bed be sleepy however i do not molest she but drop off into a doze and the next morning when i awake in broad daylight i could find no sign of the animal at all truly the human brain be a very delicate instrument and one that be easily throw out of gear before i proceed just sum up for yourselve the fact that i have mention : a light see and presently extinguish in a apartment suppose to be uninhabited and a cat of a remarkable color which appear and disappear in a way that be slightly mysterious now there be not anything very strange about that be there very well imagine now that these unimportant fact be repeat day after day and under the same condition throughout a whole week and then believe I they become of importance enough to impress the mind of a man who be live all alone and to produce in he a slight disquietude such as i speak of in commence my story and such as be always cause when one approach the sphere of the unknown the human mind be so form that it always unconsciously apply the principle of the causa sufficien for every series of fact that be identical it demand a cause a law and a vague dismay seize upon it when it be unable to guess this cause and to trace out this law i be no coward but i have often study the manifestation of fear in other from its most puerile form in child up to its most tragic phase in madman i know that it be feed and nourish by uncertainty although when one actually set himself to investigate the cause this fear be often transform into simple curiosity i make up my mind therefore to ferret out the truth i question my caretaker and find that he know nothing about my neighbor every morning a old woman come to look after the neighbor apartment my caretaker have try to question she but either she be completely deaf or else she be unwilling to give he any information for she have refuse to answer a single word nevertheless i be able to explain satisfactorily the first thing that i have note -- that be to say the sudden extinction of the light at the moment when i enter the house i have observe that the window next to mine be cover only by long lace curtain and as the two balcony be connect my neighbor whether man or woman have no doubt a wish to prevent any indiscreet inquisitiveness on my part and therefore have always put out the light on hearing I come in to verify this supposition i try a very simple experiment which succeed perfectly i have a cold supper bring in one day about noon by my servant and that evening i do not go out when darkness come on i take my station near the window presently i see the balcony shine with the light that stream through the window of the neighbor apartment at once i slip quietly out upon my balcony and step softly over the ironwork that separate the two part although i know that i be expose myself to a positive danger either of fall and break my neck or of find myself face to face with a man i experience no perturbation reach the light window without have make the slightest noise i find it partly open its curtain which for I be quite transparent since i be on the dark side of the window make I wholly invisible to any one who should look toward the window from the interior of the room i see a vast chamber furnish quite elegantly though it be obviously out of repair and light by a lamp suspend from the ceiling at the end of the room be a low sofa upon which be recline a woman who seem to I to be both young and pretty she loosen hair fall over she shoulder in a rain of gold she be look at herself in a hand mirror pat herself pass she arm over she lip and twist about she supple body with a curiously feline grace every movement that she make cause she long hair to ripple in glisten undulation as i gazed upon she i confess that i feel a little troubled especially when all of a sudden the young girl 's eye be fix upon I -- strange eye eye of a phosphorescent green that gleam like the flame of a lamp i be sure that i be invisible be on the dark side of a curtained window that be simple enough yet nevertheless i feel that i be see the girl in fact utter a cry and then turn and bury she face in the sofa-pillows i raise the window rush into the room toward the sofa and lean over the face that she be hide as i do so be really very remorseful i begin to excuse and to accuse myself call myself all sort of name and beg pardon for my indiscretion i say that i deserve to be drive from she presence but beg not to be send away without at least a word of pardon for a long time i plead thus without success but at last she slowly turn and i see that she fair young face be stir with just the faintest suggestion of a smile when she catch a glimpse of I she murmur something of which i do not then quite get the meaning ` it be you ' she cry out ` it be you ' as she say this and as i look at she not know yet exactly what to answer i be harass by the thought : where on earth have i already see this face this look this very gesture little by little however i find my tongue and after say a few more word in apology for my unpardonable curiosity and get brief but not offended answer i take leave of she and retire through the window by which i have come go back to my own room arrive there i sit a long time by the window in the darkness charm by the face that i have see and yet singularly disquieted this woman so beautiful so amiable living so near to I who say to I ` it be you ' exactly as though she have already know I who speak so little who answer all my question with evasion excite in I a feeling of fear she have indeed tell I she name -- linda -- and that be all i try in vain to drive away the remembrance of she greenish eye which in the darkness seem still to gleam upon I and of those glint which like electric spark shone in she long hair whenever she stroke it with she hand finally however i retire for the night but scarcely be my head upon the pillow when i feel some move body descend upon my foot the cat have appear again i try to chase she away but she keep return again and again until i end by resign myself to she presence and just as before i go to sleep with this strange companion near I yet my rest be this time a troubled one and break by strange and fitful dream have you ever experience the sort of mental obsession which gradually cause the brain to be master by some single absurd idea -- a idea almost insane and one which you reason and you will alike repel but which nevertheless gradually blend itself with you thought fasten itself upon you mind and grow and grow i suffer cruelly in this way on the day that follow my strange adventure nothing new occur but in the evening go out upon the balcony i find linda standing upon she side of the iron fan we chat together for a while in the half darkness and as before i return to my room to find that in a few moment the golden cat appear leap upon my bed make a nest for herself there and remain until the morning i know now to whom the cat belong for linda have answer that very same evening on my speaking of it ` oh yes my cat do not she look exactly as though she be make of gold ' as i say nothing new have occur yet nevertheless a vague sort of terror begin little by little to master I and to develop itself in my mind at first merely as a bit of foolish fancy and then as a haunting belief that dominate my entire think so that i perpetually seem to see a thing which it be in reality quite impossible to see why it be easy enough to guess interrupted the young lady who have speak at the beginning of he story linda and the cat be the same thing tribourdeaux smile i should not have be quite so positive as that he say even then but i can not deny that this ridiculous fancy haunt I for many hour when i be endeavor to snatch a little sleep amid the insomnia that a too active brain produce yes there be moment when these two being with greenish eye sinuous movement golden hair and mysterious way seem to I to be blended into one and to be merely the double manifestation of a single entity as i say i see linda again and again but in spite of all my effort to come upon she unexpectedly i never be able to see they both at the same time i try to reason with myself to convince myself that there be nothing really inexplicable in all of this and i ridicule myself for be afraid both of a woman and of a harmless cat in truth at the end of all my reasoning i find that i be not so much afraid of the animal alone or of the woman alone but rather of a sort of quality which exist in my fancy and inspire I with a fear of something that be incorporeal -- fear of a manifestation of my own spirit fear of a vague thought which be indeed the very worst of fear i begin to be mentally disturbed after long evening spend in confidential and very unconventional chat with linda in which little by little my feeling take on the color of love i pass long day of secret torment such as incipient maniac must experience gradually a resolve begin to grow up in my mind a desire that become more and more importunate in demand a solution of this unceasing and torment doubt and the more i care for linda the more it seem absolutely necessary to push this resolve to its fulfilment i decide to kill the cat one evening before meet linda on the balcony i take out of my medical cabinet a jar of glycerin and a small bottle of hydrocyanic acid together with one of those little pencil of glass which chemist use in mix certain corrosive substance that evening for the first time linda allow I to caress she i hold she in my arm and pass my hand over she long hair which snap and crack under my touch in a succession of tiny spark as soon as i regain my room the golden cat as usual appear before I i call she to I she rub herself against I with arch back and extend tail purr the while with the greatest amiability i take the glass pencil in my hand moisten the point in the glycerin and hold it out to the animal which lick it with she long red tongue i do this three or four time but the next time i dip the pencil in the acid the cat unhesitatingly touch it with she tongue in a instant she become rigid and a moment after a frightful tetanic convulsion cause she to leap thrice into the air and then to fall upon the floor with a dreadful cry -- a cry that be truly human she be dead with the perspiration start from my forehead and with tremble hand i throw myself upon the floor beside the body that be not yet cold the start eye have a look that freeze I with horror the blacken tongue be thrust out between the tooth the limb exhibit the most remarkable contortion i muster all my courage with a violent effort of will take the animal by the paw and leave the house hurry down the silent street i proceed to the quay along the bank of the loire and on reach they throw my burden into the river until daylight i roam around the city just where i know not and not until the sky begin to grow pale and then to be flush with light do i at last have the courage to return home as i lay my hand upon the door i shiver i have a dread of find there still live as in the celebrated tale of poe the animal that i have so lately put to death but no my room be empty i fall half-fainting upon my bed and for the first time i sleep with a perfect sense of be all alone a sleep like that of a beast or of a assassin until evening come some one here interrupted breaking in upon the profound silence in which we have be listen i can guess the end linda disappear at the same time as the cat you see perfectly well reply tribourdeaux that there exist between the fact of this story a curious coincidence since you be able to guess so exactly they relation yes linda disappear they find in she apartment she dress she linen all even to the night-robe that she be to have worn that night but there be nothing that could give the slightest clue to she identity the owner of the house have let the apartment to ` mademoiselle linda concert-singer ' he know nothing more i be summon before the police magistrate i have be see on the night of she disappearance roam about with a distract air in the vicinity of the river luckily the judge know I luckily also he be a man of no ordinary intelligence i related to he privately the entire story just as i have be tell it to you he dismiss the inquiry yet i may say that very few have ever have so narrow a escape as mine from a criminal trial for several moment the silence of the company be unbroken finally a gentleman wish to relieve the tension cry out : come now doctor confess that this be really all fiction that you merely want to prevent these lady from get any sleep to-night tribourdeaux bow stiffly he face unsmiling and a little pale you may take it as you will he say gil bla and dr sangrado by alain rene le sage as i be on my way who should come across I but dr sangrado whom i have not see since the day of my master 's death i take the liberty of touch my hat he know I in a twinkling

process of digestion nevertheless easy as be they passage he be not for stop the way with too much of they and to be sure he be in the right but though he caution the maid and I against repletion in respect of solid it be make up by free permission to drink as much water as we like far from prescribe we any limit in that direction he would tell we sometimes : drink my child health consist in the pliability and moisture of the part drink water by pailful it be a universal dissolvent water liquefy all the salt be the course of the blood a little sluggish this grand principle set it forward too rapid its career be check we doctor be so orthodox on this head that though advance in year he drink nothing himself but water he define old age to be a natural consumption which dry we up and waste we away on this principle he deplore the ignorance of those who call wine old man 's milk he maintain that wine wear they out and corrode they and plead with all the force of he eloquence against that liquor fatal in common both to the young and old -- that friend with a serpent in its bosom -- that pleasure with a dagger under its girdle in spite of these fine argument at the end of a week i feel a ailment which i be blasphemous enough to saddle on the universal dissolvent and the new-fangled diet i state my symptom to my master in the hope that he would relax the rigor of he regimen and qualify my meal with a little wine but he hostility to that liquor be inflexible if you have not philosophy enough say he for pure water there be innocent infusion to strengthen the stomach against

stomach in favor of wine publish a libel on they own viscera and make they constitution a pretense for they sensuality as it would have be ungenteel in I to run riot on my entrance into the medical career i pretend thorough conviction indeed i really think there be something in it i therefore go on drinking water on the authority of celsus or to speak in scientific term i begin to drown the bile in copious drench of that unadulterated liquor and though i feel my self more out of order from day to day prejudice win the cause against experience it be evident therefore that i be in the right road to the practice of physic yet i could not always be insensible to the qualm which increase in my frame to that degree as to determine I on quit dr sangrado but he invest I with a new office which

body you be a philosopher gil bla though you have never graduate the common herd of they though they have graduate in due form and order be likely to run out the length of they tether without know they right hand from they left i thank the doctor for have so speedily enable I to serve as he deputy and by way of acknowledge he goodness promise to follow he system to the end of my career with a magnanimous indifference about the aphorism of hippocrate but that engagement be not to be take to the letter this tender attachment to water go against the grain and i have a scheme for drinking wine every day snugly among the patient i leave off wear my own suit a second time to take up one of my master 's and look like a experienced practitioner after which i bring my medical theory into play leave those it might concern to look to the event i begin on a alguazil -lrb- constable -rrb- in a pleurisy he be condemn to be bleed with the utmost rigor of the law at the same time that the system be to be replenish copiously with water next i make a lodgment in the vein of a gouty pastry-cook who roar like a lion by reason of gouty spasm i stand on no more ceremony with he blood than with that of the alguazil and lay no restriction on he taste for simple liquid my prescription bring I in twelve real -lrb- shilling -rrb- -- a incident so auspicious in my professional career that i only wish for the plague of egypt on all the hale citizen of valladolid i be no sooner at home than dr sangrado come in i talk to he about the patient i have see and pay into he hand eight real of the twelve i have receive for my prescription eight real say he as he count they mighty little for two visit but we must take thing as we find they in the spirit of take thing as he find they he lay violent hand on six of the coin give I the other two here gil bla continue he see what a foundation to build upon i make over to you the fourth of all you may bring I you will soon feather you nest my friend for by the blessing of providence there will be a great deal of ill-health this year i have reason to be content with my dividend since have determine to keep back the third part of what i recover in my round and afterward touch another fourth of the remainder then half of the whole if arithmetic be anything more than a deception would become my perquisite this inspire I with new zeal for my profession the next day as soon as i have dine i resume my medical paraphernalia and take the field once more i visit several patient on the list and treat they several complaint in one invariable routine hitherto thing have go well and no one thank heaven have rise up in rebellion against my prescription but let a physician 's cure be as extraordinary as they will some quack or other be always ready to rip up he reputation i be call in to a grocer 's son in a dropsy whom should i find there before I but a little black-looking physician by name dr cuchillo introduce by a relation of the family i bow round most profoundly but dip lowest to the personage whom i take to have be invite to a consultation with I he return my compliment with a distant air then have stare I in the face for a few seconds sir say he i beg pardon for be inquisitive i think i be acquaint with all my brethren in valladolid but i confess you physiognomy be altogether new you must have be settle but a short time in town i avowed myself a young practitioner act as yet under direction of dr sangrado i wish you joy reply he politely you be study under a great man you must doubtless have see a vast deal of sound practice young as you appear to be he speak this with so easy a assurance that i be at a loss whether he mean it seriously or be laugh at I while i be con over my reply the grocer seize on the opportunity say : gentleman i be persuade of you both be perfectly competent in you art have the goodness without ado to take the case in hand and devise some effectual means for the restoration of my son 's health thereupon the little pulse-counter set himself about review the patient 's situation and after have dilate to I on all the symptom ask I what i think the fittest method of treatment i be of opinion reply i that he should be bleed once a day and drink as much warm water as he can swallow at these word we diminutive doctor say to I with a malicious simper and so you think such a course will save the patient not a doubt of it exclaim i in a confident tone it must produce that effect because it be a certain method of cure for all distemper ask señor sangrado at that rate retort he celsus be altogether in the wrong for he contend that the readiest way to cure a dropsical subject be to let he almost die of hunger and thirst oh as for celsus interrupted i he be no oracle of mine he be as fallible as the meanest of we i often have occasion to bless myself for go contrary to he dogma i discover by you language say cuchillo the safe and sure method of practice dr sangrado instil into he pupil bleed and drenching be the extent of he resource no wonder so many worthy people be cut off under he direction no defamation interrupted i with some acrimony a member of the faculty have better not begin throw stone come come my learn doctor patient can get to the other world without bleeding and warm water and i question whether the most deadly of we have ever sign more passport than yourself if you have any crow to pluck with señor sangrado publish a attack on he he will answer you and we shall soon see who will have the best of the battle by all the saint in the calendar swear he in a transport of passion you little know whom you be talk to i have a tongue and a fist my friend and be not afraid of sangrado who with all he arrogance and affectation be but a ninny the size of the little death-dealer make I hold he anger cheap i give he a sharp retort he send back as good as i bring till at last we come to fisticuffs we have pull a few handful of hair from each other 's head before the grocer and he kinsman could part we when they have bring this about they feed I for my attendance and retain my antagonist whom they think the more skilful of the two another adventure succeed close on the heel of this i go to see a huge singer in a fever as soon as he hear I talk of warm water he show himself so adverse to this specific as to fall into a fit of swearing he abuse I in all possible shape and threaten to throw I out of the window i be in a greater hurry to get out of he house than to get in i do not choose to see any more patient that day and repair to the inn where i have agree to meet fabricio he be there first as we find ourselves in a tippling humor we drink hard and return to we employer in a pretty pickle that be to say so-so in the upper story señor sangrado be not aware of my be drunk because he take the lively gesture which accompany the relation of my quarrel with the little doctor for a effect of the agitation not yet subside after the battle besides he come in for he share in my report and feeling himself nettle by the insult of cuchillo -- you have do well gil bla say he to defend the character of we practice against this little abortion of the faculty so he take upon he to set he face against watery drench in dropsical case a ignorant fellow i maintain i do in my own person that the use of they may be reconcile to the best theory yes water be a cure for all sort of dropsy just as it be good for rheumatism and the green sickness it be excellent too in those fever where the effect be at once to parch and to chill and even miraculous in those disorder ascribe to cold thin phlegmatic and pituitous humor this opinion may appear strange to young practitioner like cuchillo but it be right orthodox in the best and soundest system so that if person of that description be capable of take a philosophical view instead of cry I down they would become my most zealous advocate in he rage he never suspect I of drink for to exasperate he still more against the little doctor i have throw into my recital some circumstance of my own addition yet engross as he be by what i have tell he he could not help take notice that i drink more water than usual that evening in fact the wine have make I very thirsty any one but sangrado would have distrust my be so very dry as to swallow down glass after glass but as for he he take it for grant in the simplicity of he heart that i have begin to acquire a relish for aqueous potation apparently gil bla say he with a gracious smile you have no longer such a dislike to water as heaven be my judge you quaff it off like nectar it be no wonder my friend i be certain you would before long take a liking to that liquor sir reply i there be a tide in the affair of man with my present light i would give all the wine in valladolid for a pint of water this answer delight the doctor who would not lose so fine a opportunity of expatiate on the excellence of water he undertake to ring the change once more in its praise not like a hirele pleader but as a enthusiast in a most worthy cause a thousand time exclaim he a thousand and a thousand time of greater value as be more innocent than all we modern tavern be those bath of age past whither the people go not shamefully to squander they fortune and expose they life by swill themselves with wine but assemble there for the decent and economical amusement of drinking warm water it be difficult to admire enough the patriotic forecast of those ancient politician who establish place of public resort where water be deal out grati to all comer and who confine wine to the shop of the apothecary that its use might be prohibit save under the direction of physician what a stroke of wisdom it be doubtless to preserve the seed of that antique frugality emblematic of the golden age that person be find to this day like you and I who drink nothing but water and be persuade they possess a prevention or a cure for every ailment provide we warm water have never boil for i have observe that water when it be boil be heavier and sit less easily on the stomach while he be hold forth thus eloquently i be in danger more than once of splitting my side with laughing but i contrived to keep my countenance nay more to chime in with the doctor 's theory i find fault with the use of wine and pity mankind for have contract a untoward relish for so pernicious a beverage then find my thirst not sufficiently allay i fill a large goblet with water and after have swill it like a horse -- come sir say i to my master let we drink plentifully of this beneficial liquor let we make those early establishment of dilution you so much regret live again in you house he clap he hand in ecstasy at these word and preach to I for a whole hour about suffer no liquid but water to pass my lip to confirm the habit i promise to drink a large quantity every evening and to keep my word with less violence to my private inclination i go to bed with a determine purpose of go to the tavern every day a fight with a cannon by victor hugo la vieuville be suddenly cut short by a cry of despair and a the same time a noise be hear wholly unlike any other sound the cry and sound come from within the vessel the captain and lieutenant rush toward the gun-deck but could not get down all the gunner be pour up in dismay something terrible have just happen one of the carronade of the battery a twenty-four pounder have break loose this be the most dangerous accident that can possibly take place on shipboard nothing more terrible can happen to a sloop of be in open sea and under full sail a cannon that break its mooring suddenly become some strange supernatural beast it be a machine transform into a monster that short mass on wheel move like a billiard-ball roll with the rolling of the ship plunge with the pitching go come stop seem to meditate start on its course again shoot like a arrow from one end of the vessel to the other whirl around slip away dodge rear bang crash kill exterminate it be a batter ram capriciously assault a wall add to this the fact that the ram be of metal the wall of wood it be matter set free one might say this eternal slave be avenge itself it seem as if the total depravity conceal in what we call inanimate thing have escape and burst forth all of a sudden it appear to lose patience and to take a strange mysterious revenge nothing more relentless than this wrath of the inanimate this enraged lump leap like a panther it have the clumsiness of a elephant the nimbleness of a mouse the obstinacy of a ox the uncertainty of the billow the zigzag of the lightning the deafness of the grave it weigh ten thousand pound and it rebound like a child 's ball it spin and then abruptly dart off at right angle and what be to be do how put a end to it a tempest cease a cyclone pass over a wind die down a broken mast can be replace a leak can be stop a fire extinguish but what will become of this enormous brute of bronze how can it be capture you can reason with a bulldog astonish a bull fascinate a boa frighten a tiger tame a lion but you have no resource against this monster a loose cannon you can not kill it it be dead and at the same time it live it live with a sinister life which come to it from the infinite the deck beneath it give it full swing it be move by the ship which be move by the sea which be move by the wind this destroyer be a toy the ship the wave the wind all play with it hence its frightful animation what be to be do with this apparatus how fetter this stupendous engine of destruction how anticipate its coming and going its return its stop its shock any one of its blow on the side of the ship may stave it in how foretell its frightful meanderings it be deal with a projectile which alter its mind which seem to have idea and change its direction every instant how check the course of what must be avoid the horrible cannon struggle advance back strike right strike leave retreat pass by disconcert expectation grind up obstacle crush man like fly all the terror of the situation be in the fluctuation of the flooring how fight a inclined plane subject to caprice the ship have so to speak in its belly a imprison thunderstorm strive to escape something like a thunderbolt rumble above a earthquake in a instant the whole crew be on foot it be the fault of the gun captain who have neglect to fasten the screw-nut of the mooring-chain and have insecurely clog the four wheel of the gun carriage this give play to the sole and the framework separate the two platform and the breech the tackle have give way so that the cannon be no longer firm on its carriage the stationary breeching which prevent recoil be not in use at this time a heavy sea strike the port the carronade insecurely fasten have recoil and break its chain and begin its terrible course over the deck to form a idea of this strange slide let one imagine a drop of water run over a glass at the moment when the fastening give way the gunner be in the battery some in group other scatter about busy with the customary work among sailor get ready for a signal for action the carronade hurl forward by the pitching of the vessel make a gap in this crowd of man and crushed four at the first blow then slide back and shoot out again as the ship roll it cut in two a fifth unfortunate and knock a piece of the battery against the larboard side with such force as to unship it this cause the cry of distress just hear all the man rush to the companion-way the gun-deck be vacate in a twinkle the enormous gun be leave alone it be give up to itself it be its own master and master of the ship it could do what it please this whole crew accustom to laugh in time of battle now tremble to describe the terror be impossible captain boisberthelot and lieutenant la vieuville although both dauntless man stop at the head of the companion-way and dumb pale and hesitate look down on the deck below some one elbow past and go down it be they passenger the peasant the man of whom they have just be speak a moment before reach the foot of the companion-way he stop the cannon be rush back and forth on the deck one might have suppose it to be the living chariot of the apocalypse the marine lantern swing overhead add a dizzy shift of light and shade to the picture the form of the cannon disappear in the violence of its course and it look now black in the light now mysteriously white in the darkness it go on in its destructive work it have already shatter four other gun and make two gap in the side of the ship fortunately above the water-line but where the water would come in in case of heavy weather it rush frantically against the framework the strong timber withstand the shock the curved shape of the wood give they great power of resistance but they creak beneath the blow of this huge club beating on all side at once with a strange sort of ubiquity the percussion of a grain of shot shake in a bottle be not swifter or more senseless the four wheel pass back and forth over the dead man cut they carve they slash they till the five corpse be a score of stump roll across the deck the head of the dead man seem to cry out stream of blood curl over the deck with the rolling of the vessel the plank damage in several place begin to gape open the whole ship be fill with the horrid noise and confusion the captain promptly recover he presence of mind and order everything that could check and impede the cannon 's mad course to be throw through the hatchway down on the gun-deck -- mattress hammock spare sail roll of cordage bag belong to the crew and bale of counterfeit assignat of which the corvette carry a large quantity -- a characteristic piece of english villainy regard as legitimate warfare but what could these rag do as nobody dare to go below to dispose of they properly they be reduce to lint in a few minute there be just sea enough to make the accident as bad as possible a tempest would have be desirable for it might have upset the cannon and with its four wheel once in the air there would be some hope of get it under control meanwhile the havoc increase there be split and fracture in the mast which be set into the framework of the keel and rise above the deck of ship like great round pillar the convulsive blow of the cannon have crack the mizzenmast and have cut into the mainmast the battery be be ruin ten piece out of thirty be disabled the breach in the side of the vessel be increase and the corvette be begin to leak the old passenger have go down to the gun-deck stand like a man of stone at the foot of the step he cast a stern glance over this scene of devastation he do not move it seem impossible to take a step forward every movement of the loose carronade threaten the ship 's destruction a few moment more and shipwreck would be inevitable they must perish or put a speedy end to the disaster some course must be decide on but what what a opponent be this carronade something must be do to stop this terrible madness -- to capture this lightning -- to overthrow this thunderbolt boisberthelot say to la vieuville : do you believe in god chevalier la vieuville reply : yes -- no sometimes during a tempest yes and in moment like this god alone can save we from this say boisberthelot everybody be silent let the carronade continue its horrible din outside the wave beat against the ship respond with they blow to the shock of the cannon it be like two hammer alternate suddenly in the midst of this inaccessible ring where the escape cannon be leap a man be see to appear with a iron bar in he hand he be the author of the catastrophe the captain of the gun guilty of criminal carelessness and the cause of the accident the master of the carronade have do the mischief he be anxious to repair it he have seize the iron bar in one hand a tiller-rope with a slip-noose in the other and jump down the hatchway to the gun-deck then begin a awful sight a titanic scene the contest between gun and gunner the battle of matter and intelligence the duel between man and the inanimate the man station himself in a corner and with bar and rope in he two hand he lean against one of the rider brace himself on he leg which seem two steel post and livid calm tragic as if root to the deck he wait he wait for the cannon to pass by he the gunner know he gun and it seem to he as if the gun ought to know he he have live long with it how many time he have thrust he hand into its mouth it be he own familiar monster he begin to speak to it as if it be he dog come he say perhaps he love it he seem to wish it to come to he but to come to he be to come upon he and then he would be lose how could he avoid be crush that be the question all look on in terror not a breast breathe freely unless perhaps that of the old man who be alone in the battery with the two contestant a stern witness he might be crushed himself by the cannon he do not stir beneath they the sea blindly direct the contest at the moment when the gunner accept this frightful hand-to-hand conflict challenge the cannon some chance rock of the sea cause the carronade to remain for a instant motionless and as if stupefy come now say the man it seem to listen suddenly it leap toward he the man dodge the blow the battle begin battle unprecedented frailty struggle against the invulnerable the gladiator of flesh attack the beast of brass on one side brute force on the other a human soul all this be take place in semi-darkness it be like the shadowy vision of a miracle a soul -- strange to say one would have think the cannon also have a soul but a soul full of hatred and rage this sightless thing seem to have eye the monster appear to lie in wait for the man one would have at least believe that there be craft in this mass it also choose its time it be a strange gigantic insect of metal have or seem to have the will of a demon for a moment this colossal locust would beat against the low ceiling overhead then it would come down on its four wheel like a tiger on its four paw and begin to run at the man he supple nimble expert writhe away like a adder from all these lightning movement he avoid a collision but the blow which he parry fall against the vessel and continue they work of destruction a end of broken chain be leave hang to the carronade this chain have in some strange way become twisted about the screw of the cascabel one end of the chain be fasten to the gun-carriage the other left loose whirl desperately about the cannon make all its blow more dangerous the screw hold it in a firm grip add a thong to a battering-ram make a terrible whirlwind around the cannon a iron lash in a brazen hand this chain complicate the contest however the man go on fight occasionally it be the man who attack the cannon he would creep along the side of the vessel bar and rope in hand and the cannon as if it understand and as though suspect some snare would flee away the man bent on victory pursue it such thing can not long continue the cannon seem to say to itself all of a sudden come now make a end of it and it stop one feel that the crisis be at hand the cannon as if in suspense seem to have or really have -- for to all it be a living be -- a ferocious malice prepense it make a sudden quick dash at the gunner the gunner spring out of the way let it pass by and cry out to it with a laugh try it again the cannon as if enraged smash a carronade on the port side then again seize by the invisible sling which control it it be hurl to the starboard side at the man who make he escape three carronade give way under the blow of the cannon then as if blind and not know what more to do it turn its back on the man roll from stern to bow injure the stern and make a breach in the planking of the prow the man take refuge at the foot of the step not far from the old man who be look on the gunner hold he iron bar in rest the cannon seem to notice it and without take the trouble to turn around slide back on the man swift as the blow of a axe the man drive against the side of the ship be lose the whole crew cry out with horror but the old passenger till this moment motionless dart forth more quickly than any of this wildly swift rapidity he seize a package of counterfeit assignat and at the risk of be crushed succeed in throw it between the wheel of the carronade this decisive and perilous movement could not have be make with more exactness and precision by a man train in all the exercise describe in durosel 's manual of gun practice at sea the package have the effect of a clog a pebble may stop a log the branch of a tree turn aside a avalanche the carronade stumble the gunner take advantage of this critical opportunity plunge he iron bar between the spoke of one of the hind wheel the cannon stop it lean forward the man use the bar as a lever hold it in equilibrium the heavy mass be overthrow with the crash of a fall bell and the man rush with all he might drip with perspiration pass the slipnoose around the bronze neck of the subdue monster it be end the man have conquer the ant have control over the mastodon the pygmy have take the thunderbolt prisoner the mariner and sailor clap they hand the whole crew rush forward with cable and chain and in a instant the cannon be secure the gunner salute the passenger sir he say you have save my life the old man have resume he impassive attitude and make no reply the man have conquer but the cannon might be say to have conquer as well immediate shipwreck have be avoid but the corvette be not save the damage to the vessel seem beyond repair there be five breach in she side one very large in the bow twenty of the thirty carronade lay useless in they frame the one which have just be capture and chained again be disabled the screw of the cascabel be spring and consequently level the gun make impossible the battery be reduce to nine piece the ship be leak it be necessary to repair the damages at once and to work the pump the gun-deck now that one could look over it be frightful to behold the inside of a infuriate elephant 's cage would not be more completely demolish however great might be the necessity of escape observation the necessity of immediate safety be still more imperative to the corvette they have be oblige to light up the deck with lantern hang here and there on the side however all the while this tragic play be go on the crew be absorb by a question of life and death and they be wholly ignorant of what be take place outside the vessel the fog have grow thicker the weather have change the wind have work its pleasure with the ship they be out of they course with jersey and guernsey close at hand further to the south than they ought to have be and in the midst of a heavy sea great billow kiss the gaping wound of the vessel -- kiss full of danger the rock of the sea threaten destruction the breeze have become a gale a squall a tempest perhaps be brew it be impossible to see four wave ahead while the crew be hastily repair the damages to the gun-deck stop the leak and put in place the gun which have be uninjured in the disaster the old passenger have go on deck again he stand with he back against the mainmast he have not notice a proceeding which have take place on the vessel the chevalier de la vieuville have draw up the marine in line on both side of the mainmast and at the sound of the boatswain 's whistle the sailor form in line standing on the yard the count de boisberthelot approach the passenger behind the captain walk a man haggard out of breath he dress disorder but still with a look of satisfaction on he face it be the gunner who have just show himself so skilful in subdue monster and who have gain the mastery over the cannon the count give the military salute to the old man in peasant 's dress and say to he : general there be the man the gunner remain stand with downcast eye in military attitude the count de boisberthelot continue : general in consideration of what this man have do do you not think there be something due he from he commander i think so say the old man please give you order reply boisberthelot it be for you to give they you be the captain but you be the general reply boisberthelot the old man look at the gunner come forward he say the gunner approach the old man turn toward the count de boisberthelot take off the cross of saint-loui from the captain 's coat and fasten it on the gunner 's jacket hurrah cry the sailor the mariner present arm and the old passenger point to the dazzled gunner add : now have this man shoot dismay succeed the cheer then in the midst of the death-like stillness the old man raise he voice and say : carelessness have compromise this vessel at this very hour it be perhaps lose to be at sea be to be in front of the enemy a ship make a voyage be a army wage war the tempest be conceal but it be at hand the whole sea be a ambuscade death be the penalty of any misdemeanor commit in the face of the enemy no fault be reparable courage should be reward and negligence punish these word fall one after another slowly solemnly in a sort of inexorable metre like the blow of a axe upon a oak and the man look at the soldier add : let it be do the man on whose jacket hang the shine cross of saint-louis bow he head at a signal from count de boisberthelot two sailor go below and come back bring the hammock-shroud the chaplain who since they sail have be at prayer in the officer ' quarter accompany the two sailor a sergeant detach twelve marine from the line and arrange they in two file six by six the gunner without utter a word place himself between the two file the chaplain crucifix in hand advance and stand beside he march say the sergeant the platoon march with slow step to the bow of the vessel the two sailor carry the shroud follow a gloomy silence fall over the vessel a hurricane howl in the distance a few moment later a light flash a report sound through the darkness then all be still and the sound of a body fall into the sea be hear the old passenger still lean against the mainmast have cross he arm and be bury in thought boisberthelot point to he with the forefinger of he left hand and say to la vieuville in a low voice : la vendée have a head tonton by a cheneviere there be man who seem bear to be soldier they have the face the bear the gesture the quality of mind but there be other who have be force to become so in spite of themselves and of the rebellion of reason and the heart through a rash deed a disappointment in love or simply because they destiny demand it be son of soldier and gentleman such be the case of my friend captain robert de x -- and i say to he one summer evening under the great tree of he terrace which be wash by the green and sluggish marne : yes old fellow you be sensitive what the deuce would you have do on a campaign where you be oblige to shoot to strike down with a sabre and to kill and then too you have never fight except against the arab and that be quite another thing he smile a little sadly he handsome mouth with its blond mustache be almost like that of a youth he blue eye be dreamy for a instant then little by little he begin to confide to I he thought he recollection and all that be mystic and poetic in he soldier 's heart you know we be soldier in my family we have a marshal of france and two officer who die on the field of honor i have perhaps obey a law of heredity i believe rather that my imagination have carry I away i see war through my reverie of epic poetry in my fancy i dwelt only upon the intoxication of victory the triumphant flourish of trumpet and woman throw flower to the victor and then i love the sonorous word of the great captain the dramatic representation of martial glory my father be in the third regiment of zouave the one which be hew in piece at reichshofen in the niedervald and which in 1859 at palestro make that famous charge against the austrian and hurl they into the great canal it be superb without they the italian division would have be lose victor emmanuel march with the zouave after this affair while still deeply move not by fear but with admiration for this regiment of demon and hero he embrace they old colonel and declare that he would be proud be he not a king to join the regiment then the zouave acclaimed he corporal of the third and for a long time on the anniversary festival of st palestro when the roll be call they shout ` corporal of the first squad in the first company of the first battalion victor emmanuel ' and a rough old sergeant solemnly respond : ` send as long into italy ' that be the way my father talk to we and by these recital a soldier be make of a dreamy child but later what a disillusion where be the poetry of battle i have never make any campaign except in africa but that have be enough for I and i believe the army surgeon be right who say to I one day : ` if instantaneous photograph could be take after a battle and million of copy make and scatter through the world there would be no more war the people would refuse to take part in it ' africa yes i have suffer there on one occasion i be send to the south six hundred kilometre from oran beyond the oasis of fignig to destroy a tribe of rebel on this expedition we have a pretty serious affair with a military chief of the great desert call bon-arredji we kill nearly all of the tribe and seize nearly fifteen hundred sheep in short it be a complete success we also capture the wife and child of the chief a dreadful thing happen at that time under my very eye a woman be flee pursue by a black mount soldier she turn around and shoot at he with a revolver the horse-soldier be furious and strike she down with one stroke of he sabre i do not have the time to interfere i dismount from my horse to take the woman up she be dead and almost decapitate i utter not one word of reproach to the turkish soldier who smile fiercely and turn back i place the poor body sadly on the sand and be go to remount my horse when i perceive a few step back behind a thicket a little girl five or six year old i recognize at once that she be a touareg of white race notwithstanding she tawny color i approach she perhaps she be not afraid of I because i be white like herself i take she on the saddle with I without resistance on she part and return slowly to the place where we be to camp for the night i expect to place she under the care of the woman whom we have take prisoner and be carry away with we but all refuse say that she be a vile little touareg belong to a race which carry misfortune with it and bring forth only traitor i be greatly embarrassed i would not abandon the child i feel somewhat responsible for the crime have be one of those who have direct the massacre i have make a orphan i must take she part one of the prisoner of the band have say to I -lrb- i understand a little of the gibberish of these people -rrb- that if i leave the little one to these woman they would kill she because she be the daughter of a touareg whom the chief have prefer to they and that they hate the pet spoil child whom he have give rich clothes and jewel what be to be do i have a wide-awake orderly a certain michel of batignolle i call he and say to he : ` take care of the little one ' ` very well captain i will take she in charge ' he then pet the child make she sociable and lead she away with he and two hour later he have manufacture a little cradle for she out of biscuit box which be use on the march for make coffin in the evening michel put she to bed in it he have christen she ` tonton ' a abbreviation of touareg in the morning the cradle be bind on a ass and behold tonton follow the column with the baggage in the convoy of the rear guard under the indulgent eye of michel this last for day and week in the evening at the halt place tonton be bring into my tent with the goat which furnish she the greater part of she meal and she inseparable friend a large chameleon capture by michel and respond or not respond to the name of achille ah well old fellow you may believe I or not but it give I pleasure to see the little one sleep in she cradle during the short night full of alarm when i feel the weariness of live the dull sadness of see my companion die one by one leave the caravan the enervation of the perpetual state of alertness always attack or be attack for week and month i with the gentle instinct of a civilized man be force to order the beheading of spy and traitor the binding of woman in chain and the kidnapping of child to raid the herd to make of myself a attilum and this have to be do without a moment of wavering and i the cold and gentle celt whom you know remain there under the scorching african sun then what repose of soul what strange meditation be mine when free at last at night in my sombre tent around which death might be prowl i could watch the little touareg save by I sleep in she cradle by the side of she chameleon lizard ridiculous be it not but go there and lead the life of a brute of a plunderer and assassin and you will see how at time you civilized imagination will wander away to take refuge from itself i could have rid myself of tonton in a oasis we meet some rebel bear a flag of truce and exchange the woman for gun and ammunition i keep the little one notwithstanding the five month of march we must make before return to tlemcen she have grow gentle be incline to be mischievous but be yield and almost affectionate with I she eat with the rest never want to sit down but run from one to another around the table she have proud little manners as if she know herself to be a daughter of the chief 's favorite obey only the officer and treat michel with a amusing scorn all this be to have a sad end one day i do not find the chameleon in the cradle though i remember to have see it there the evening before i have even take it in my hand and caress it before tonton who have just go to bed then i have give it back to she and go out accordingly i question she she take I by the hand and lead I to the camp fire show I the char skeleton of the chameleon explain to I as best she could that she have throw it in the fire because i have pet it oh woman woman and she give a horrible imitation of the lizard writhe in the midst of the flame and she smile with delighted eye i be indignant i seize she by the arm shake she a little and finish by boxing she ear my dear fellow from that day she appear not to know I tonton and i sulk we be angry however one morning as i feel the sun be go to be terrible i go myself to the baggage before the load for departure and arrange a shelter awning over the cradle then to make peace i embrace my little friend but as soon as we be on the march she furiously tear off the canvas with which i have cover the cradle michel put it all in place again and there be a new revolt in short it be necessary to yield because she want to be able to lean outside of she box under the fiery sun to look at the head of the column of which i have the command i see this on arrive at the rest place then michel bring she under my tent she have not yet fall asleep but follow with she eye all of my movement with a grave air without a smile or gleam of mischief she refuse to eat and drink the next day she be ill with sunken eye and body burning with fever when the major wish to give she medicine she refuse to take it and grind she tooth together to keep from swallow there remain still six day ' march before arrive at oran i want to give she into the care of the nun she die before i could do so very suddenly with a severe attack of meningitis she never want to see I again she be bury under a clump of african shrub near geryville in she little campaign cradle and do you know what be find in she cradle the char skeleton of the poor chameleon which have be the indirect cause of she death before leave the bivouac where she have commit she crime she have pick it out of the glowing ember and bring it into the cradle and that be why she little finger be burn since the beginning of the meningitis the major have never be able to explain the cause of these burn robert be silent for a instant then murmur : poor little one i feel remorseful if i have not give she that blow who know she would perhaps be live still my story be sad be it not ah well it be still the sweetest of my african memory war be beautiful eh and robert shrug he shoulder the last lesson by alphonse daudet i start for school very late that morning and be in great dread of a scolding especially because m hamel have say that he would question we on participle and i do not know the first word about they for a moment i thought of run away and spend the day out of door it be so warm so bright the bird be chirp at the edge of the wood and in the open field back of the saw-mill the prussian soldier be drill it be all much more tempting than the rule for participle but i have the strength to resist and hurry off to school when i pass the town hall there be a crowd in front of the bulletin-board for the last two year all we bad news have come from there -- the lost battle the draft the order of the commanding officer -- and i think to myself without stop : what can be the matter now then as i hurry by as fast as i could go the blacksmith wachter who be there with he apprentice read the bulletin call after I : do not go so fast bub you 'll get to you school in plenty of time i think he be make fun of I and reach m hamel 's little garden all out of breath usually when school begin there be a great bustle which could be hear out in the street the opening and closing of desk lesson repeat in unison very loud with we hand over we ear to understand better and the teacher 's great ruler rap on the table but now it be all so still i have count on the commotion to get to my desk without be see but of course that day everything have to be as quiet as Sunday morning through the window i see my classmate already in they place and m hamel walk up and down with he terrible iron ruler under he arm i have to open the door and go in before everybody you can imagine how i blush and how frightened i be but nothing happen m hamel see I and say very kindly : go to you place quickly little franz we be begin without you i jump over the bench and sit down at my desk not till then when i have get a little over my fright do i see that we teacher have on he beautiful green coat he frilled shirt and the little black silk cap all embroider that he never wear except on inspection and prize day besides the whole school seem so strange and solemn but the thing that surprise I most be to see on the back bench that be always empty the village people sit quietly like ourselves old hauser with he three-cornered hat the former mayor the former postmaster and several other besides everybody look sad and hauser have bring a old primer thumb at the edge and he hold it open on he knee with he great spectacles lie across the page while i be wonder about it all m hamel mount he chair and in the same grave and gentle tone which he have use to I say : my child this be the last lesson i shall give you the order have come from berlin to teach only german in the school of alsace and lorraine the new master come to-morrow this be you last french lesson i want you to be very attentive what a thunder-clap these word be to I oh the wretch that be what they have put up at the town-hall my last french lesson why i hardly know how to write i should never learn any more i must stop there then oh how sorry i be for not learn my lesson for seek bird ' egg or go slide on the saar my book that have seem such a nuisance a while ago so heavy to carry my grammar and my history of the saint be old friend now that i could not give up and m hamel too the idea that he be go away that i should never see he again make I forget all about he ruler and how cranky he be poor man it be in honor of this last lesson that he have put on he fine sunday-clothes and now i understand why the old man of the village be sit there in the back of the room it be because they be sorry too that they have not go to school more it be they way of thank we master for he forty year of faithful service and of show they respect for the country that be theirs no more while i be think of all this i hear my name call it be my turn to recite what would i not have give to be able to say that dreadful rule for the participle all through very loud and clear and without one mistake but i get mix up on the first word and stand there hold on to my desk my heart beating and not daring to look up i hear m hamel say to I : i will not scold you little franz you must feel bad enough see how it be every day we have say to ourselves : ` bah i have plenty of time i 'll learn it to-morrow ' and now you see where we have come out ah that be the great trouble with alsace she put off learn till to-morrow now those fellow out there will have the right to say to you : ` how be it you pretend to be frenchman and yet you can neither speak nor write you own language ' but you be not the worst poor little franz we have all a great deal to reproach ourselves with you parent be not anxious enough to have you learn they prefer to put you to work on a farm or at the mill so as to have a little more money and i i have be to blame also have i not often send you to water my flower instead of learn you lesson and when i want to go fishing do i not just give you a holiday then from one thing to another m hamel go on to talk of the french language say that it be the most beautiful language in the world -- the clearest the most logical that we must guard it among we and never forget it because when a people be enslave as long as they hold fast to they language it be as if they have the key to they prison then he open a grammar and read we we lesson i be amaze to see how well i understand it all he say seem so easy so easy i think too that i have never listen so carefully and that he have never explain everything with so much patience it seem almost as if the poor man want to give we all he know before go away and to put it all into we head at one stroke after the grammar we have a lesson in write that day m hamel have new copy for we write in a beautiful round hand : france alsace france alsace they look like little flag float everywhere in the school-room hang from the rod at the top of we desk you ought to have see how every one set to work and how quiet it be the only sound be the scratch of the pen over the paper once some beetle fly in but nobody pay any attention to they not even the littlest one who work right on trace they fish-hook as if that be french too on the roof the pigeon coo very low and i think to myself : will they make they sing in german even the pigeon whenever i look up from my write i see m hamel sit motionless in he chair and gaze first at one thing then at another as if he want to fix in he mind just how everything look in that little school-room fancy for forty year he have be there in the same place with he garden outside the window and he class in front of he just like that only the desk and bench have be worn smooth the walnut-tree in the garden be taller and the hop-vine that he have plant himself twine about the window to the roof how it must have break he heart to leave it all poor man to hear he sister move about in the room above pack they trunk for they must leave the country next day but he have the courage to hear every lesson to the very last after the write we have a lesson in history and then the baby chant they ba be bi bo bu down there at the back of the room old hauser have put on he spectacles and hold he primer in both hand spell the letter with they you could see that he too be cry he voice tremble with emotion and it be so funny to hear he that we all want to laugh and cry ah how well i remember it that last lesson all at once the church-clock strike twelve then the angelus at the same moment the trumpet of the prussian return from drill sound under we window m hamel stand up very pale in he chair i never see he look so tall my friend say he i -- i -- but something choke he he could not go on then he turn to the blackboard take a piece of chalk and bearing on with all he might he write as large as he could : vive la france then he stop and lean he head against the wall and without a word he make a gesture to we with he hand school be dismiss -- you may go croisille by alfred de musset i at the beginning of the reign of loui xv a young man name croisille son of a goldsmith be return from pari to havre he native town he have be intrust by he father with the transaction of some business and he trip to the great city have turn out satisfactorily the joy of bring good news cause he to walk the sixty league more gaily and briskly than be he wont for though he have a rather large sum of money in he pocket he travel on foot for pleasure he be a good-tempered fellow and not without wit but so very thoughtless and flighty that people look upon he as be rather weak-minded he doublet button awry he periwig fly to the wind he hat under he arm he follow the bank of the seine at time find enjoyment in he own thought and again indulge in snatch of song up at daybreak sup at wayside inn and always charm with this stroll of he through one of the most beautiful region of france plunder the apple-tree of normandy on he way he puzzle he brain to find rhyme -lrb- for all these rattlepate be more or less poet -rrb- and try hard to turn out a madrigal for a certain fair damsel of he native place she be no less than a daughter of a fermier-général mademoiselle godeau the pearl of havre a rich heiress and much court croisille be not receive at m godeau 's otherwise than in a casual sort of way that be to say he have sometimes himself take there article of jewelry purchase at he father 's m godeau whose somewhat vulgar surname ill-fitted he immense fortune avenge himself by he arrogance for the stigma of he birth and show himself on all occasion enormously and pitilessly rich he certainly be not the man to allow the son of a goldsmith to enter he drawing-room but as mademoiselle godeau have the most beautiful eye in the world and croisille be not ill-favored and as nothing can prevent a fine fellow from fall in love with a pretty girl croisille adore mademoiselle godeau who do not seem vexed thereat thus be he thinking of she as he turn he step toward havre and as he have never reflect seriously upon anything instead of thinking of the invincible obstacle which separate he from he lady-love he busy himself only with find a rhyme for the christian name she bear mademoiselle godeau be call julie and the rhyme be find easily enough so croisilles have reach honfleur embark with a satisfied heart he money and he madrigal in he pocket and as soon as he jump ashore run to the paternal house he find the shop close and knock again and again not without astonishment and apprehension for it be not a holiday but nobody come he call he father but in vain he go to a neighbor 's to ask what have happen instead of reply the neighbor turn away as though not wish to recognize he croisille repeat he question he learn that he father he affair have long be in a embarrassed condition have just become bankrupt and have flee to america abandon to he creditor all that he possess not realize as yet the extent of he misfortune croisille feel overwhelm by the thought that he might never again see he father it seem to he incredible that he should be thus suddenly abandon he try to force a entrance into the store but be give to understand that the official seal have be affix so he sit down on a stone and give way to he grief begin to weep piteously deaf to the consolation of those around he never cease to call he father 's name though he know he to be already far away at last he rise ashamed at see a crowd about he and in the most profound despair turn he step towards the harbor on reach the pier he walk straight before he like a man in a trance who know neither where he be go nor what be to become of he he see himself irretrievably lose possess no longer a shelter no means of rescue and of course no longer any friend alone wander on the sea-shore he feel tempt to drown himself then and there just at the moment when yield to this thought he be advance to the edge of a high cliff a old servant name jean who have serve he family for a number of year arrive on the scene ah my poor jean he exclaim you know all that have happen since i go away be it possible that my father could leave we without warn without farewell he be go answer jean but indeed not without say good-bye to you at the same time he draw from he pocket a letter which he give to he young master croisille recognize the handwriting of he father and before open the letter kiss it rapturously but it contain only a few word instead of feel he trouble soften it seem to the young man still harder to bear honorable until then and know as such the old gentleman ruin by a unforeseen disaster -lrb- the bankruptcy of a partner -rrb- have leave for he son nothing but a few commonplace word of consolation and no hope except perhaps that vague hope without aim or reason which constitute it be say the last possession one lose jean my friend you carry I in you arm say croisille when he have read the letter and you certainly be to-day the only be who love I at all it be a very sweet thing to I but a very sad one for you for as sure as my father embark there i will throw myself into the same sea which be bear he away not before you nor at once but some day i will do it for i be lose what can you do reply jean not seem to have understand but hold fast to the skirt of croisille ' coat what can you do my dear master you father be deceive he be expect money which do not come and it be no small amount either could he stay here i have see he sir as he make he fortune during the thirty year that i serve he i have see he work attend to he business the crown-piece come in one by one he be a honorable man and skilful they take a cruel advantage of he within the last few day i be still there and as fast as the crown come in i see they go out of the shop again you father pay all he could for a whole day and when he desk be empty he could not help tell I point to a drawer where but six franc remain : ` there be a hundred thousand franc there this morning ' that do not look like a rascally failure sir there be nothing in it that can dishonor you i have no more doubt of my father 's integrity answer croisille than i have of he misfortune neither do i doubt he affection but i wish i could have kiss he for what be to become of I i be not accustom to poverty i have not the necessary cleverness to build up my fortune and if i have it my father be go it take he thirty year how long would it take I to repair this disaster much longer and will he be live then certainly not he will die over there and i can not even go and find he i can join he only by die utterly distressed as croisille be he possess much religious feeling although he despondency make he wish for death he hesitate to take he life at the first word of this interview he have take hold of old jean 's arm and thus both return to the town when they have enter the street and the sea be no longer so near : it seem to I sir say jean that a good man have a right to live and that a misfortune prove nothing since you father have not kill himself thank god how can you think of die since there be no dishonor in he case and all the town know it be so what would they think of you that you feel unable to endure poverty it would be neither brave nor christian for at the very worst what be there to frighten you there be plenty of people bear poor and who have never have either mother or father to help they on i know that we be not all alike but after all nothing be impossible to god what would you do in such a case you father be not bear rich far from it -- mean no offence -- and that be perhaps what console he now if you have be here this last month it would have give you courage yes sir a man may be ruin nobody be secure from bankruptcy but you father i make bold to say have bear himself through it all like a man though he do leave we so hastily but what could he do it be not every day that a vessel start for america i accompany he to the wharf and if you have see how sad he be how he charge I to take care of you to send he news from you -- sir it be a right poor idea you have that throw the helve after the hatchet every one have he time of trial in this world and i be a soldier before i be a servant i suffer severely at the time but i be young i be of you age sir and it seem to I that providence could not have speak he last word to a young man of twenty-five why do you wish to prevent the kind god from repair the evil that have befall you give he time and all will come right if i might advise you i would say just wait two or three year and i will answer for it you will come out all right it be always easy to go out of this world why will you seize a unlucky moment while jean be thus exert himself to persuade he master the latter walk in silence and as those who suffer often do be look this way and that as though seek for something which might bind he to life as chance would have it at this juncture mademoiselle godeau the daughter of the fermier-général happen to pass with she governess the mansion in which she live be not far distant croisille see she enter it this meeting produce on he more effect than all the reasoning in the world i have say that he be rather erratic and nearly always yield to the first impulse without hesitate a instant and without explanation he suddenly leave the arm of he old servant and cross the street knock at monsieur godeau 's door ii when we try to picture to ourselves nowadays what be call a financier in time go by we invariably imagine enormous corpulence short leg a gigantic wig and a broad face with a triple chin -- and it be not without reason that we have become accustomed to form such a picture of such a personage everyone know to what great abuse the royal tax-farming lead and it seem as though there be a law of nature which render fatter than the rest of mankind those who fatten not only upon they own laziness but also upon the work of other monsieur godeau among financier be one of the most classical to be find -- that be to say one of the fattest at the present time he have the gout which be nearly as fashionable in he day as the nervous headache be in ours stretch upon a lounge he eye half-closed he be coddling himself in the coziest corner of a dainty boudoir the panel-mirror which surround he majestically duplicate on every side he enormous person bag fill with gold cover the table around he the furniture the wainscot the door the lock the mantel-piece the ceiling be gilded so be he coat i do not know but that he brain be gilded too he be calculate the issue of a little business affair which could not fail to bring he a few thousand loui and be even deign to smile over it to himself when croisille be announce the young man enter with a humble but resolute air and with every outward manifestation of that inward tumult with which we find no difficulty in credit a man who be longing to drown himself monsieur godeau be a little surprised at this unexpected visit then he think he daughter have be buy some trifle and be confirm in that think by see she appear almost at the same time with the young man he make a sign to croisille not to sit down but to speak the young lady seat herself on a sofa and croisille remain standing express himself in these term : sir my father have fail the bankruptcy of a partner have force he to suspend he payment and unable to witness he own shame he have flee to america after have pay he last sou to he creditor i be absent when all this happen i have just come back and have know of these event only two hour i be absolutely without resource and determine to die it be very probable that on leave you house i shall throw myself into the water in all probability i would already have do so if i have not chance to meet at the very moment this young lady you daughter i love she from the very depths of my heart for two year i have be in love with she and my silence until now prove better than anything else the respect i feel for she but to-day in declare my passion to you i fulfill a imperative duty and i would think i be offend god if before give myself over to death i do not come to ask you mademoiselle julie in marriage i have not the slightest hope that you will grant this request but i have to make it nevertheless for i be a good christian sir and when a good christian see himself come to such a point of misery that he can no longer suffer life he must at least to extenuate he crime exhaust all the chance which remain to he before take the final and fatal step at the beginning of this speech monsieur godeau have suppose that the young man come to borrow money and so he prudently throw he handkerchief over the bag that be lie around he prepare in advance a refusal and a polite one for he always feel some good-will toward the father of croisille but when he have hear the young man to the end and understand the purport of he visit he never doubt one moment that the poor fellow have go completely mad he be at first tempt to ring the bell and have he put out but notice he firm demeanor he determine look the fermier-général take pity on so inoffensive a case of insanity he merely tell he daughter to retire so that she might be no longer expose to hear such impropriety while croisille be speak mademoiselle godeau have blush as a peach in the month of August at she father 's bidding she retire the young man make she a profound bow which she do not seem to notice left alone with croisille monsieur godeau cough rise then drop again upon the cushion and try to assume a paternal air deliver himself to the following effect : my boy say he i be willing to believe that you be not poke fun at I but you have really lose you head i not only excuse this proceeding but i consent not to punish you for it i be sorry that you poor devil of a father have become bankrupt and have skip it be indeed very sad and i quite understand that such a misfortune should affect you brain besides i wish to do something for you so take this stool and sit down there it be useless sir answer croisille if you refuse I as i see you do i have nothing leave but to take my leave i wish you every good fortune and where be you go to write to my father and say good-bye to he eh the devil any one would swear you be speak the truth i 'll be damned if i do not think you be go to drown yourself yes sir at least i think so if my courage do not forsake I that be a bright idea fie on you how can you be such a fool sit down sir i tell you and listen to I monsieur godeau have just make a very wise reflection which be that it be never agreeable to have it say that a man whoever he may be throw himself into the water on leave you house he therefore cough once more take he snuff-box cast a careless glance upon he shirt-frill and continue : it be evident that you be nothing but a simpleton a fool a regular baby you do not know what you be say you be ruin that be what have happen to you but my dear friend all that be not enough one must reflect upon the thing of this world if you come to ask I -- well good advice for instance -- i might give it to you but what be it you be after you be in love with my daughter yes sir and i repeat to you that i be far from suppose that you can give she to I in marriage but as there be nothing in the world but that which could prevent I from die if you believe in god as i do not doubt you do you will understand the reason that bring I here whether i believe in god or not be no business of yours i do not intend to be question answer I first : where have you see my daughter in my father 's shop and in this house when i bring jewelry for mademoiselle julie who tell you she name be julie what be we come to great heaven but be she name julie or javotte do you know what be want in any one who aspire to the hand of the daughter of a fermier-général no i be completely ignorant of it unless it be to be as rich as she something more be necessary my boy you must have a name well my name be croisille you name be croisille poor wretch do you call that a name upon my soul and conscience sir it seem to I to be as good a name as godeau you be very impertinent sir and you shall rue it indeed sir do not be angry i have not the least idea of offend you if you see in what i say anything to wind you and wish to punish I for it there be no need to get angry have i not tell you that on leave here i be go straight to drown myself although m godeau have promise himself to send croisille away as gently as possible in order to avoid all scandal he prudence could not resist the vexation of he wounded pride the interview to which he have to resign himself be monstrous enough in itself it may be imagine then what he feel at hear himself speak to in such term listen he say almost beside himself and determine to close the matter at any cost you be not such a fool that you can not understand a word of common sense be you rich no be you noble still less so what be this frenzy that bring you here you come to worry I you think you be do something clever you know perfectly well that it be useless you wish to make I responsible for you death have you any right to complain of I do i owe a son to you father be it my fault that you have come to this mon dieu when a man be go to drown himself he keep quiet about it -- that be what i be go to do now i be you very humble servant one moment it shall not be say that you have recourse to I in vain there my boy here be three loui d'or : go and have dinner in the kitchen and let I hear no more about you much oblige i be not hungry and i have no use for you money so croisille leave the room and the financier have set he conscience at rest by the offer he have just make settle himself more comfortably in he chair and resume he meditation mademoiselle godeau during this time be not so far away as one might suppose she have it be true withdraw in obedience to she father but instead of go to she room she have remain listen behind the door if the extravagance of croisille seem incredible to she still she find nothing to offend she in it for love since the world have exist have never pass as a insult on the other hand as it be not possible to doubt the despair of the young man mademoiselle godeau find herself a victim at one and the same time to the two sentiment most dangerous to woman -- compassion and curiosity when she see the interview at a end and croisille ready to come out she rapidly cross the drawing-room where she stand not wish to be surprised eavesdropping and hurry towards she apartment but she almost immediately retrace she step the idea that perhaps croisille be really go to put a end to he life trouble she in spite of herself scarcely aware of what she be do she walk to meet he the drawing-room be large and the two young people come slowly towards each other croisille be as pale as death and mademoiselle godeau vainly seek word to express she feeling in pass beside he she let fall on the floor a bunch of violet which she hold in she hand he at once bent down and pick up the bouquet in order to give it back to she but instead of take it she pass on without utter a word and enter she father 's room croisille alone again put the flower in he breast and leave the house with a troubled heart not know what to think of he adventure iii scarcely have he take a few step in the street

he arrive there so sad a spectacle meet he gaze that he have scarcely the courage to enter the shop be in utter disorder the room desert he father 's alcove empty everything present to he eye the wretchedness of utter ruin not a chair remain all the drawer have be ransack the till break open the chest take away nothing have escape the greedy search of creditor and lawyer who after have pillage the house have go leave the door open as though to testify to all passer-by how neatly they work be do this then exclaim croisille be all that remain after thirty year of work and a respectable life -- and all through the failure to have ready on a give day money enough to honor a signature imprudently give while the young man walk up and down give over to the saddest thought jean seem very much embarrassed he suppose that he master be without ready money and that he might perhaps not even have dine he be therefore try to think of some way to question he on the subject and to offer he in case of need some part of he savings after have tortured he mind for a quarter of a hour to try and hit upon some way of lead up to the subject he could find nothing better than to come up to croisille and ask he in a kindly voice : sir do you still like roast partridge the poor man utter this question in a tone at once so comical and so touching that croisille in spite of he sadness could not refrain from laugh and why do you ask I that say he my wife reply jean be cooking I some for dinner sir and if by chance you still like they -- croisille have completely forget till now the money which he be bring back to he father jean 's proposal remind he that he pocket be full of gold i thank you with all my heart say he to the old man and i accept you dinner with pleasure but if you be anxious about

remain after my debt be pay as though it be he inheritance ' those sir be he own expression so put this back in you pocket and since you accept my dinner pray let we go home the honest joy which shine in jean 's eye leave no doubt in the mind of croisille the word of he father have move he to such a point that he could not restrain he tear on the other hand at such a moment four thousand franc be no bagatelle as to the house it be not a available resource for one could realize on it only by sell it and that be both difficult and slow all this however could not but make a considerable change in the situation the young man find himself in so he feel suddenly move -- shake in he dismal resolution and so to speak both sad and at the same time relieved of much of he distress after have close the shutter of the shop he leave the house with jean and as he once more cross the town could not help think how small a thing we affection be since they sometimes serve to make we find a unforeseen joy in the faintest ray of hope it be with this thought that he sit down to dinner beside he old servant who do not fail during the repast to make every effort to cheer he heedless people have a happy fault they be easily cast down but they have not even the trouble to console themselves so changeable be they mind it would be a mistake to think they on that account insensible or selfish on the contrary they perhaps feel more keenly than other and be but too prone to blow they brain out in a moment of despair but this moment once pass if they be still alive they must dine they must eat they must drink as usual only to melt into tear again at bed-time joy and pain do not glide over they but pierce they through like arrow kind hot-headed nature which know how to suffer but not how to lie through which one can clearly read -- not fragile and empty like glass but solid and transparent like rock crystal after have clink glass with jean croisille instead of drown himself go to the play standing at the back of the pit he draw from he bosom mademoiselle godeau 's bouquet and as he breathe the perfume in deep meditation he begin to think in a calmer spirit about he adventure of the morning as soon as he have ponder over it for awhile he see clearly the truth that be to say that the young lady in leave the bouquet in he hand and in refuse to take it back have wish to give he a mark of interest for otherwise this refusal and this silence could only have be mark of contempt and such a supposition be not possible croisille therefore judge that mademoiselle godeau 's heart be of a softer grain than she father 's and he remember distinctly that the young lady 's face when she cross the drawing-room have express a emotion the more true that it seem involuntary but be this emotion one of love or only of sympathy or be it perhaps something of still less importance -- mere commonplace pity have mademoiselle godeau fear to see he die -- he croisille -- or merely to be the cause of the death of a man no matter what man although withered and almost leafless the bouquet still retain so exquisite a odor and so brave a look that in breathing it and look at it croisille could not help hope it be a thin garland of rose round a bunch of violet what mysterious depths of sentiment a oriental might have read in these flower by interpret they language but after all he need not be a oriental in this case the flower which fall from the breast of a pretty woman in europe as in the east be never mute be they but to tell what they have see while repose in that lovely bosom it would be enough for a lover and this in fact they do perfume have more than one resemblance to love and there be even people who think love to be but a sort of perfume it be true the flower which exhale it be the most beautiful in creation while croisille muse thus pay very little attention to the tragedy that be be act at the time mademoiselle godeau herself appear in a box opposite the idea do not occur to the young man that if she should notice he she might think it very strange to find the would-be suicide there after what have transpire in the morning he on the contrary bent all he effort towards get nearer to she but he could not succeed a fifth-rate actress from paris have come to play mérope and the crowd be so dense that one could not move for lack of anything better croisille have to content himself with fix he gaze upon he lady-love not lift he eye from she for a moment he notice that she seem pre-occupied and moody and that she speak to every one with a sort of repugnance she box be surround as may be imagine by all the fop of the neighborhood each of whom pass several time before she in the gallery totally unable to enter the box of which she father fill more than three-fourths croisille notice further that she be not use she opera-glass nor be she listen to the play she elbow rest on the balustrade she chin in she hand with she far-away look she seem in all she sumptuous apparel like some statue of venus disguise en marquise the display of she dress and she hair she rouge beneath which one could guess she paleness all the splendor of she toilet do but the more distinctly bring out the immobility of she countenance never have croisille see she so beautiful have find means between the act to escape from the crush he hurry off to look at she from the passage lead to she box and strange to say scarcely have he reach it when mademoiselle godeau who have not stir for the last hour turn round she start slightly as she notice he and only cast a glance at he then she resume she former attitude whether that glance express surprise anxiety pleasure or love whether it mean what not dead or god be praise there you be live -- i do not pretend to explain be that as it may at that glance croisille inwardly swear to himself to die or gain she love iv of all the obstacle which hinder the smooth course of love the greatest be without doubt what be call false shame which be indeed a very potent obstacle croisille be not trouble with this unhappy fail which both pride and timidity combine to produce he be not one of those who for whole month hover round the woman they love like a cat round a caged bird as soon as he have give up the idea of drown himself he think only of let he dear julie know that he live solely for she but how could he tell she so should he present himself a second time at the mansion of the fermier-général it be but too certain that m godeau would have he eject julie when she happen to take a walk never go without she maid it be therefore useless to undertake to follow she to pass the night under the window of one 's beloved be a folly dear to lover but in the present case it would certainly prove vain i say before that croisille be very religious it therefore never enter he mind to seek to meet he lady-love at church as the best way though the most dangerous be to write to people when one can not speak to they in person he decide on the very next day to write to the young lady he letter possess naturally neither order nor reason it read somewhat as follow : mademoiselle -- tell I exactly i beg of you what fortune one must possess to be able to pretend to you hand i be ask you a strange question but i love you so desperately that it be impossible for I not to ask it and you be the only person in the world to whom i can address it it seem to I last evening that you look at I at the play i have wish to die would to god i be indeed dead if i be mistaken and if that look be not mean for I tell I if fate can be so cruel as to let a man deceive himself in a manner at once so sad and so sweet i believe that you command I to live you be rich beautiful i know it you father be arrogant and miserly and you have a right to be proud but i love you and the rest be a dream fix you charming eye on I think of what love can do when i who suffer so cruelly who must stand in fear of every thing feel nevertheless a inexpressible joy in write you this mad letter which will perhaps bring down you anger upon I but think also mademoiselle that you be a little to blame for this my folly why do you drop that bouquet put yourself for a instant if possible in my place i dare think that you love I and i dare ask you to tell I so forgive I i beseech you i would give my life 's blood to be sure of not offend you and to see you listen to my love with that angel smile which belong only to you whatever you may do you image remain mine you can remove it only by tear out my heart as long as you look live in my remembrance as long as the bouquet keep a trace of its perfume as long as a word will tell of love i will cherish hope have seal he letter croisille go out and walk up and down the street opposite the godeau mansion wait for a servant to come out chance which always serve mysterious love when it can do so without compromise itself will it that mademoiselle julie 's maid should have arrange to purchase a cap on that day she be go to the milliner 's when croisille accost she slip a loui into she hand and ask she to take charge of he letter the bargain be soon strike the servant take the money to pay for she cap and promise to do the errand out of gratitude croisille full of joy go home and sit at he door await a answer before speaking of this answer a word must be say about mademoiselle godeau she be not quite free from the vanity of she father but she good nature be ever uppermost she be in the full meaning of the term a spoilt child she habitually speak very little and never be she see with a needle in she hand she spend she day at she toilet and she evening on the sofa not seem to hear the conversation go on around she as regard she dress she be prodigiously coquettish and she own face be surely what she think most of on earth a wrinkle in she collarette a ink-spot on she finger would have distressed she and when she dress please she nothing can describe the last look which she cast at she mirror before leave the room she show neither taste nor aversion for the pleasure in which young lady usually delight she go to ball willingly enough and renounce go to they without a show of temper sometimes without motive the play weary she and she be in the constant habit of fall asleep there when she father who worship she propose to make she some present of she own choice she take a hour to decide not be able to think of anything she care for when m godeau give a reception or a dinner it often happen that julie would not appear in the drawing-room and at such time she pass the evening alone in she own room in full dress walk up and down she fan in she hand if a compliment be address to she she turn away she head and if any one attempt to pay court to she she respond only by a look at once so dazzling and so serious as to disconcert even the boldest never have a sally make she laugh never have a air in a opera a flight of tragedy move she indeed never have she heart give a sign of life and on see she pass in all the splendor of she nonchalant loveliness one might have take she for a beautiful somnambulist walk through the world as in a trance so much indifference and coquetry do not seem easy to understand some say she love nothing other that she love nothing but herself a single word however suffice to explain she character -- she be wait from the age of fourteen she have hear it ceaselessly repeat that nothing be so charming as she she be convince of this and that be why she pay so much attention to dress in fail to do honor to she own person she would have think herself guilty of sacrilege she walk in she beauty so to speak like a child in its holiday dress but she be very far from think that she beauty be to remain useless beneath she apparent unconcern she have a will secret inflexible and the more potent the better it be conceal the coquetry of ordinary woman which spend itself in ogle in simpering and in smile seem to she a childish vain almost contemptible way of fight with shadow she feel herself in possession of a treasure and she disdain to stake it piece by piece she need a adversary worthy of herself but too accustomed to see she wish anticipate she do not seek that adversary it may even be say that she feel astonished at he fail to present himself for the four or five year that she have be out in society and have conscientiously display she flower she furbelow and she beautiful shoulder it seem to she inconceivable that she have not yet inspire some great passion have she say what be really behind she thought she certainly would have reply to she many flatterer : well if it be true that i be so beautiful why do you not blow you brain out for I a answer which many other young girl might make and which more than one who say nothing hide away in a corner of she heart not far perhaps from the tip of she tongue what be there indeed in the world more tantalizing for a woman than to be young rich beautiful to look at herself in she mirror and see herself charmingly dress worthy in every way to please fully dispose to allow herself to be love and to have to say to herself : i be admire i be praise all the world think I charming but nobody love I my gown be by the best maker my lace be superb my coiffure be irreproachable my face the most beautiful on earth my figure slender my foot prettily turn and all this help I to nothing but to go and yawn in the corner of some drawing-room if a young man speak to I he treat I as a child if i be ask in marriage it be for my dowry if somebody press my hand in a dance it be sure to be some provincial fop as soon as i appear anywhere i excite a murmur of admiration but nobody speak low in my ear a word that make my heart beat i hear impertinent man praise I in loud tone a couple of foot away and never a look of humbly sincere adoration meet mine still i have a ardent soul full of life and i be not by any means only a pretty doll to be show about to be make to dance at a ball to be dress by a maid in the morning and undress at night -- begin the whole thing over again the next day that be what mademoiselle godeau have many time say to herself and there be hour when that think inspire she with so gloomy a feeling that she remain mute and almost motionless for a whole day when croisille write she she be in just such a fit of ill-humor she have just be take she chocolate and be deep in meditation stretch upon a lounge when she maid enter and hand she the letter with a mysterious air she look at the address and not recognize the handwriting fall again to muse the maid then see herself force to explain what it be which she do with a rather disconcerted air not be at all sure how the young lady would take the matter mademoiselle godeau listen without move then open the letter and cast only a glance at it she at once ask for a sheet of paper and nonchalantly write these few word : no sir i assure you i be not proud if you have only a hundred thousand crown i would willingly marry you such be the reply which the maid at once take to croisille who give she another loui for she trouble v a hundred thousand crown be not find in a donkey 's hoof-print and if croisille have be suspicious he might have think in read mademoiselle godeau 's letter that she be either crazy or laugh at he he think neither for he only see in it that he darling julie love he and that he must have a hundred thousand crown and he dream from that moment of nothing but try to secure they he possess two hundred loui in cash plus a house which as i have say might be worth about thirty thousand franc what be to be do how be he to go about transfigure these thirty-four thousand franc at a jump into three hundred thousand the first idea which come into the mind of the young man be to find some way of stake he whole fortune on the toss-up of a coin but for that he must sell the house croisille therefore begin by put a notice upon the door state that he house be for sale then while dream what he would do with the money that he would get for it he await a purchaser a week go by then another not a single purchaser apply more and more distressed croisille spend these day with jean and despair be take possession of he once more when a jewish broker ring at the door this house be for sale sir be it not be you the owner of it yes sir and how much be it worth thirty thousand franc i believe at least i have hear my father say so the jew visit all the room go upstairs and down into the cellar knock on the wall count the step of the staircase turn the door on they hinge and the key in they lock open and close the window then at last after have thoroughly examine everything without say a word and without make the slightest proposal he bow to croisille and retire croisille who for a whole hour have follow he with a palpitating heart as may be imagine be not a little disappointed at this silent retreat he think that perhaps the jew have wish to give himself time to reflect and that he would return presently he wait a week for he not daring to go out for fear of miss he visit and look out of the window from morning till night but it be in vain the jew do not reappear jean true to he unpleasant rôle of adviser bring moral pressure to bear to dissuade he master from sell he house in so hasty a manner and for so extravagant a purpose die of impatience ennui and love croisille one morning take he two hundred loui and go out determine to tempt fortune with this sum since he could not have more the gaming-house at that time be not public and that refinement of civilization which enable the first comer to ruin himself at all hour as soon as the wish enter he mind have not yet be invent scarcely be croisille in the street before he stop not know where to go to stake he money he look at the house of the neighborhood and eye they one after the other strive to discover suspicious appearance that might point out to he the object of he search a good-looking young man splendidly dress happen to pass judge from he mien he be certainly a young man of gentle blood and ample leisure so croisille politely accost he sir he say i beg you pardon for the liberty i take i have two hundred loui in my pocket and i be die either to lose they or win more could you not point out to I some respectable place where such thing be do at this rather strange speech the young man burst out laugh upon my word sir answer he if you be seek any such wicked place you have but to follow I for that be just where i be go croisille follow he and a few step farther they both enter a house of very attractive appearance where they be receive hospitably by a old gentleman of the highest breed several young man be already seat round a green cloth croisille modestly take a place there and in less than a hour he two hundred loui be go he come out as sad as a lover can be who think himself beloved he have not enough to dine with but that do not cause he any anxiety what can i do now he ask himself to get money to whom shall i address myself in this town who will lend I even a hundred loui on this house that i can not sell while he be in this quandary he meet he jewish broker he do not hesitate to address he and featherhead as he be do not fail to tell he the plight he be in the jew do not much want to buy the house he have come to see it only through curiosity or to speak more exactly for the satisfaction of he own conscience as a pass dog go into a kitchen the door of which stand open to see if there be anything to steal but when he see croisille so despondent so sad so bereft of all resource he could not resist the temptation to put himself to some inconvenience even in order to pay for the house he therefore offer he about one-fourth of its value croisille fall upon he neck call he he friend and savior blindly sign a bargain that would have make one 's hair stand on end and on the very next day the possessor of four hundred new loui he once more turn he step toward the gambling-house where he have be so politely and speedily ruin the night before on he way he pass by the wharf a vessel be about leave the wind be gentle the ocean tranquil on all side merchant sailor officer in uniform be come and go porter be carry enormous bale of merchandise passenger and they friend be exchange farewell small boat be rowing about in all direction on every face could be read fear impatience or hope and amidst all the agitation which surround it the majestic vessel sway gently to and fro under the wind that swell she proud sail what a grand thing it be think croisille to risk all one possess and go beyond the sea in perilous search of fortune how it fill I with emotion to look at this vessel set out on she voyage load with so much wealth with the welfare of so many family what joy to see she come back again bring twice as much as be intrust to she return so much prouder and richer than she go away why be i not one of those merchant why could i not stake my four hundred loui in this way this immense sea what a green cloth on which to boldly tempt fortune why should i not myself buy a few bale of cloth or silk what be to prevent my do so since i have gold why should this captain refuse to take charge of my merchandise and who know instead of go and throw away this -- my little all -- in a gambling-house i might double it i might triple it perhaps by honest industry if julie truly love I she will wait a few year she will remain true to I until i be able to marry she commerce sometimes yield greater profit than one think example be want in this world of wealth gain with astonishing rapidity in this way on the change wave -- why should providence not bless a endeavor make for a purpose so laudable so worthy of he assistance among these merchant who have accumulate so much and who send they vessel to the end of the world more than one have begin with a smaller sum than i have now they have prosper with the help of god why should i not prosper in my turn it seem to I as though a good wind be fill these sail and this vessel inspire confidence come the die be cast i will speak to the captain who seem to be a good fellow i will then write to julie and set out to become a clever and successful trader the greatest danger incur by those who be habitually but half crazy be that of become at time altogether so the poor fellow without further deliberation put he whim into execution to find goods to buy when one have money and know nothing about the goods be the easiest thing in the world the captain to oblige croisille take he to one of he friend a manufacturer who sell he as much cloth and silk as he could pay for the whole of it load upon a cart be promptly take on board croisille delighted and full of hope have himself write in large letter he name upon the bale he watch they be put on board with inexpressible joy the hour of departure soon come and the vessel weigh anchor vi i need not say that in this transaction croisille have keep no money in hand he house be sell and there remain to he for he sole fortune the clothes he have on he back -- no home and not a son with the best will possible jean could not suppose that he master be reduce to such a extremity croisille be not too proud but too thoughtless to tell he of it so he determine to sleep under the starry vault and as for he meal he make the follow calculation he presume that the vessel which bear he fortune would be six month before come back to havre croisille therefore not without regret sell a gold watch he father have give he and which he have fortunately keep he get thirty-six livre for it that be sufficient to live on for about six month at the rate of four sous a day he do not doubt that it would be enough and reassure for the present he write to mademoiselle godeau to inform she of what he have do he be very careful in he letter not to speak of he distress he announce to she on the contrary that he have undertake a magnificent commercial enterprise of the speedy and fortunate issue of which there could be no doubt he explain to she that la fleurette a merchant-vessel of one hundred and fifty ton be carry to the baltic he cloth and he silk and implore she to remain faithful to he for a year reserve to himself the right of ask later on for a further delay while for he part he swear eternal love to she when mademoiselle godeau receive this letter she be sit before the fire and have in she hand use it as a screen one of those bulletin which be print in seaport announce the arrival and departure of vessel and which also report disaster at sea it have never occur to she as one can well imagine to take a interest in this sort of thing she have in fact never glance at any of these sheet the perusal of croisille ' letter prompt she to read the bulletin she have be hold in she hand the first word that catch she eye be no other than the name of la fleurette the vessel have be wreck on the coast of france on the very night follow its departure the crew have barely escape but all the cargo be lose mademoiselle godeau at this news no longer remember that croisille have make to she a avowal of he poverty she be as heartbroken as though a million have be at stake in a instant the horror of the tempest the fury of the wind the cry of the drown the ruin of the man who love she present themselves to she mind like a scene in a romance the bulletin and the letter fall from she hand she rise in great agitation and with heave breast and eye brim with tear pace up and down determine to act and ask herself how she should act there be one thing that must be say in justice to love it be that the stronger the clearer the simpler the consideration oppose to it in a word the less common sense there be in the matter the wilder do the passion become and the more do the lover love it be one of the most beautiful thing under heaven this irrationality of the heart we should not be worth much without it after have walk about the room -lrb- without forget either she dear fan or the pass glance at the mirror -rrb- julie allow herself to sink once more upon she lounge whoever have see she at this moment would have look upon a lovely sight she eye sparkle she cheek be on fire she sigh deeply and murmur in a delicious transport of joy and pain : poor fellow he have ruin himself for I independently of the fortune which she could expect from she father mademoiselle godeau have in she own right the property she mother have leave she she have never think of it at this moment for the first time in she life she remember that she could dispose of five hundred thousand franc this thought bring a smile to she lip a project strange bold wholly feminine almost as mad as croisille himself enter she head -- she weigh the idea in she mind for some time then decide to act upon it at once she begin by inquire whether croisille have any relative or friend the maid be send out in all direction to find out have make minute inquiry in all quarter she discover on the fourth floor of a old rickety house a half-crippled aunt who never stir from she arm-chair and have not be out for four or five year this poor woman very old seem to have be leave in the world expressly as a specimen of hungry misery blind gouty almost deaf she live alone in a garret but a gayety stronger than misfortune and illness sustain she at eighty year of age and make she still love life she neighbor never pass she door without go in to see she and the antiquated tune she hum enliven all the girl of the neighborhood she possess a little annuity which suffice to maintain she as long as day last she knit she do not know what have happen
