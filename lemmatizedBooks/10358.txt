late last Thursday evening one jona rodney pott better know to this community as upright pott stumble into the mill-race where it have providentially be leave open just north of cady 's mill everything be go along finely until two hopeless busybody be attract to the spot by he scream and fish he out it be fear that he will recover we withhold the name of he rescuer although under strong temptation to publish they broadcast -- _ little arcady argus _ of may 21st = look back to that time from a happier present i be fill by a genuine awe of j rodney pott reflect upon those benign end which the god choose to make he serve i can but marvel how lightly each of we may meet and scorn a casual pott unreck he gracious and predestined office in the play of fate of the present -- to I -- supreme drama of the little country i can only say that the god have select they agent with a cunning so flawless that suspicion of he portent could not well have be arouse in one lack discernment like unto the god ' very own so trivially so utterly so pitiably casual to eye of the flesh be this pott of little arcady from he immortal soul to the least item of he inferior raiment thus craftily be we fool by the lord of destiny whose caprice it be to affect remoteness from we and a lofty unconcern for we poor little doings there be bitterness in the line of that _ argus _ paragraph and a flippant incivility might be read between they by the least discerning arcady of the little country however know there be neither bitterness nor real cynicism in solon denney founder editor and proprietor of the _ little arcady argus _ motto hew to the line let the chip fall where they may indeed we do know solon often enough have the _ argus _ hew inexorably to the line when that line lead straight through the heart of its guide genius and through the heart of we all one who have see he as i do stand uncover in the presence of he new washington hand-press the day that dynamo of light be erect in the _ argus _ office could never suppose he to lack humanity or the just reverence demand by he craft we may concede without disloyalty that solon be peculiar unto himself in he presence you be curse with a unquiet suspicion that he may become frivolous with you at any moment -- may indeed be so at that moment despite a due facial gravity and tone of weight -- for he will not infrequently seem to be both trivial and serious in the same breath again he be amazingly sensitive for one not devoid of humor in a pleasant sense he be acutely aware of himself and he do not dislike to know that you feel he quality still again he be bind to spice he writing be it he lot to report event on the day of judgment i believe the _ argus _ account would be think too highly color by many person of good taste but little arcady know that solon be loyal to its welfare -- know that he be fit to wield the mightiest lever of civilization in its behalf on Wednesday of each week we know now moreover that a undercurrent of circumstance exist which do not even ripple the surface of that apparently facetious brutality hurl at j rodney pott the truth may not be tell in a word but it be in this affair that solon denney win he title of boss of little arcady a title first render unto he somewhat in derision i regret to say by a number of we lead citizen who seek as it be to make sport of he it begin in a jest as do all the choicest tragedy of the god -- a few line of idle badinage mean to spice solon 's column of business local with a readable sprightliness the thing be print in fact between let harpin cust shine you face with he new razor and see that line of clock at chislett 's for sixty cent they look like cuckoo and keep good time not much news this week the item blithely run so we hereby start the rumor that ` upright ' pott be go to leave town we would incite no community to lawless endeavor but -- may the colonel encounter swiftly in he new environment that warm reception to which he quality of mind no less than he quality of heart so richly entitle he -- that reception in short which we own debilitated public spirit have timidly refuse he we claim the right to start any rumor of this sort that will cheer the soul of a admiring constituency now be the time to pay up that subscription the intention of course be openly playful -- a not subtle sally mean to be read and forget yet -- will it be credit -- more than one of we read it so hurriedly perhaps with so passionate a longing to have it the truth as not to perceive its satirical indirection the rumor actually live for a day that pott be to disembarrass the town of he presence and then from the fictitious stuff of this rumor be spawn a veritable inspiration several of we most public-spirited citizen seem to father it simultaneously why should pott _ not _ leave town -- why should he not seek out a new field of effort field of effort be a rank bit of poesy it be certain that pott would never make a effort worthy of the name in any field whatsoever but the sense of it be plain increasingly with the year have plan be devise to alleviate the condition of pott 's residence among we some of these have require a too definite and artificial abruptness in the mechanic of he removal other like eustace eubank 's plot for have all we best people refuse to notice he depend upon a sensitiveness in the person aim at which he do not possess besides there have be talk of disbar he from the practice of he profession and i as a lawyer have be urge to instigate that proceed unquestionably there be ground for it but now this random pleasantry of solon denney 's set we mind to work in another direction in the broad pleasant window of the post-office under the no loafing here sign half a dozen of we discuss it while we wait for the noon mail there seem to be a half-formed belief that pott might adroitly be make to perceive advantage in leave we it be a whole lot better to manipulate and be subtle in a case like this suggest the editor of the _ argus _ threat of violence forcible expulsion disbarment proceedings -- all crude -- and besides they will not move pott jona rodney may not be gifted with a giant intellect but he be cunning the cunning of a precocious boy prompt eustace eubank who be one of we he be well aware that we would not dare attempt lawless violence exactly eustace answer solon i tell you gentleman this thrive little town need a canning factory as we all know but more than a canning factory it need a boss -- one of those strong character that make tool of they fellow-man who rule we city with a iron hand but take care to keep the hand in a velvet glove -- a boss that be diplomatic yet a autocrat that careless use of the term boss be afterward see to be unfortunate for solon they remember it against he that be right say westley keyt let 's be diplomatic with he how would _ you _ begin westley if you do not mind tell we solon have already begin to shape a scheme of he own why answer westley look very earnest just go up to he in a quiet refined manner -- no blustering understand -- and say in a low tone kind of off-hand but serious ` now look a ' here pott old boy let 's talk this thing over like a couple of gentleman have ought to ' ` well all right ' say pott ` that be fair -- i could not refuse _ that _ as from one gentleman to another gentleman ' well then say to he ` now pott you know as well as any man in this town that you be a all-round no-good -- you be a human _ not _ -- and a darn scalawag into the bargain so what be the _ use _ will you go or will not you ' then if he would begin to hem and haw and try to put it off with one thing or another why just hint in a roundabout way -- perfectly genteel you understand -- that there would be doings with a kittle of tar and feather that same night at eight-thirty sharp rain or shine with a free ride right afterward to the town line and mebbe a bit beyond without no cushion up about the narrow would be a good place to say farewell he conclude thoughtfully we have listen patiently enough but this be too summary westley keyt be we butcher a good honest energetic downright business man with a square forehead and a blunt jaw and red hair that bristle with challenge but he seem compel to say too nearly what he mean to render he useful in negotiation require any considerable finesse we be speak westley of the gentle function of diplomacy remark solon cuttingly of course we _ could _ waylay pott and kill he with one of you cleaver and have he noble head stuff and mount to hang up over barney skeyhan 's bar but it would not be subtle -- it would not be what the newspaper call ' a triumph of diplomacy ' and then again report of it might be carry to other town and talk would be cause now say retorted westley somewhat abashed i be think i answer all _ that _ by wind up the way like i do ask he -- not mad-like you understand -- ` now will you go or _ will not _ you ' just like that all i can say be if that be not diplomacy then i do not know what in time diplomacy _ be _ i think we concede this in silence be it understand for westley be respect but we look to solon for a more tenuous subtlety nor do he fail we two day later pott upon the public street actually announce he early departure from little arcady to know how please a excitement this create one should know more about pott it will have be infer that he be objectionable for the fact he be objectionable in every way : as a human be a man a citizen a member of the slocum county bar and a veteran of we late civil conflict he be shiftless untidy a borrower a pompous braggart a trouble-maker forever drive some poor devil into senseless litigation moreover he be blithely unscrupulous in he dealings with the court he client he brother-attorney and he fellow-man at large when i add that he be give to spell of hard drinking during which he become obnoxious beyond the wildest possible dream of that quality it will be see that we of little arcady be not without reason for wish he away he have drift casually in upon we after the war accompany somewhat elegantly by one john randolph clement tuckerman a ex-slave he come with much talk of he regiment -- a fat-cheeked florid man of forty-five or so with shifty blue eye and a address moderately insinuate very tall he be and so erect that he seem to lean a little backward this physical trait combine with a fancy for refer to himself freely as a upright citizen of this reunited and glorious republic sir have speedily make he know as upright pott he be of a slender build and a bony frame except in front he long single-breasted frock-coat hang loosely enough about he shoulder yet button tightly over a stomach that be so incongruous as to seem artificial the sleeve of the coat be glossy from much desk rubbing and its front advertise a rather inattentive behavior at table the colonel 's dress be complete by drab overgaiter and poorly drape trousers of the same once-delicate hue upon he bald head which be high and peak like sir walter scott 's he carry a silk hat in a inferior state of preservation when he begin to drink it be he custom to repair at once to a barber and submit to have he side-whisker trim fastidiously sober he seem to feel little pride of person and he whisker at such a time merely call attention somewhat unprettily to he lack of a chin he other possession be a ebony walk stick with a gold head and what he refer to in moment of expansion as he library this consist of a copy of the revise statute a directory of cincinnatus ohio for the year 1867 and two volume of patent office report at the time of which i speak the colonel have long be sober and the day that solon denney complete those mysterious negotiation with he he be as far from conventional standard of the beautiful as i remember to have see he the guise of solon 's subtlety the touch of he iron hand in a glove of softest velvet have be in this wise : he have point out to the colonel that there be richer field of endeavor to the west of we newer larger town fitter abode for a man of he part community which have honor and emolument to lavish upon the worthy -- prize which it would doubtless never be in we poor power to bestow pott be stir by all this but he be not blind to certain disadvantage -- a stranger in a strange land etc while in little arcady he have already make himself known but suggest solon with a ready wit if the stranger be to go fortify with certificate of character from the lead citizen of he late home this be a thing to consider pott reflect more favorably but still he hesitate he be unable to believe that these certificate of he excellence might be obtain the bar and the commercial element of little arcady have be cold not to say suspicious toward he it be a unpleasant thing to mention but a cabal have undeniably be form solon be politely incredulous he pledge he word of honor as a gentleman to provide the letter -- a laudatory a uplifting letter from every citizen in town whose testimony would be of weight also a half-column of fit praise in the next issue of the _ argus _ twelve copy of which pott should freely carry off with he for judicious scattering about the fortunate town in which he journey should end then pott speak openly of the expense of travel solon royally promise a purse of gold to take he on he way clench the winning of a neat and bloodless victory no one have ever deny that denney must have employ a faultless a incomparable tact to bring j rodney pott to this agreement by tact alone have he achieve that which open sneer covert insult abuse ridicule contumely and forthright threat have fail to consummate and in the first flush of the news we all feel much as westley keyt say he do solon denney be some subtler than I say westley in a win spirit of concession i can see that now he be the boss of little arcady after this all right so far as _ i _ know nevertheless there be misgive about the letter for pott old asa bundy we banker want to know somewhat peevishly if it seem quite honest to send pott to another town with a satchel full of letter certify to he rare value as a man and a citizen what would that town think of we two or three day later this be no time to split hair bundy say solon and i believe i add do not be quixotic mr bundy hereupon westley keyt break in brightly why now they 'll see in a minute that the whole thing be mean as a joke they 'll see that the laugh be on _ they _ and they 'll have a lot of fun out of it and then send the old cuss along to another town with some more funny letter to fool the next one that be all very _ well _ but it be not high conduct insist bundy westley keyt now achieve the nearest approach to diplomacy i have ever know of he oh well asa after all this be a world of give and take ` live and let live ' be my motto we must use common sense in these matter you know bundy observe solon judicially and that sophistry prevail for we be weak unto faintness from we burden we give letter set forth that j rodney pott be the ideal inhabitant of a city larger than we own we glow in describe the virtue of we depart townsman he honesty of purpose he integrity of character he learning in the law he wide range of achievement civic and military -- all those attribute that fit he to become a stately ornament and a tower of strength to any community larger in the least degree than we own modest town and there be the purse fifty dollar be suggest by eustace eubank but asa bundy say that this would not take pott far enough eustace say that a man could travel a immense distance for fifty dollar bundy retort that a ordinary man might perhaps go far enough on that sum but not pott if we be to perpetrate this outrage at all insist bundy pull in calculation at he little chin-whisker let we do it thoroughly a hundred dollar can not take pott any too far we must see that he keep go until he could never get back -- we all nod to this -- and another thing the farther away from this town those letter be read -- why the better for we reputation a hundred dollar it be purse and letter be turn over to solon denney to deliver to pott the _ argus _ come out with its promise eulogy a thing so fulsome that any human being but j rodney pott would have sicken to read it of himself but we little town be elated one could observe that last day a subdue but confident gayety along its street as citizen greet one another on every hand be good fellowship and kind word the light-hearted salute the joyous mien it be a occasion that come near to be festal and solon denney be its hero he seek to bear he honor with the modesty that be native to he but in he heart he know that we now speak of he glibly as the boss of little arcady and the consciousness of it bubble in he manner in spite of he when it be all over -- though i have not once raise my voice in protest and have frankly connive with the other -- i confess that i feel shame for we and pity for the friendless man we be send out into the world something childlike in he acceptance of the proposal a few phrase of naive enthusiasm for he new prospects repeat to I by solon touch I strangely it be therefore with real embarrassment that i read the _ argus _ notice with profound regret it begin we be oblige to announce to we reader the determination of we distinguished fellow-townsman colonel j rodney pott to shake the dust of little arcady from he foot deaf to entreaty from we lead citizen the gallant colonel have resolve that in simple justice to himself he must remove to some larger field of action where he native genius he flawless probity and he profound learning in the law may secure for he those richer reward which a man of he unusual caliber commendably crave and so abundantly merit there follow a overflow half-column of warmest praise embody felicitation to the unnamed city so fortunate as to secure this peerless pleader and prince of gentleman it end with the assurance that colonel pott would take with he the cordial good-will of every member of a community to which he have endear himself no less by he sterling civic virtue than by he splendid quality of mind and heart the thing fill I with a indignant pity i try in vain to sleep in the darkness of night we plan come to seem like a atrocious outrage upon a guileless defenceless ne'er - do-well for my share of the guilt i resolve to convey to pott privately on the morrow a more than perfunctory promise of aid should he find himself distressed at any time in what he would doubtless term he new field of endeavor chapter ii the golden day of colonel pott i awake the next morning under most vivid portent of calamity i believe i be neither notional nor give to small vulgar superstition but i have learn that this peculiar sensation be never without significance i remember that i feel it the night we wagon bridge go out by high water i try to read the presentiment as i dress but not until i be shave do it relate itself to the go out of pott then the illumination come with a speed so electric that i gashed my chin under the shock of it instantly i seem to know as well as i know to-day that the pott affair have in some manner be botch so apprehensive be i that i linger a hour on my little riverside porch dread the event that i feel the day must unfold inevitably however i be draw to the center of thing turn down main street at the city hotel corner on the way to my office i have to pass the barber-shop of harpin cust in front of which i find myself impel to stop look over the row of potted geranium in the window i beheld colonel pott in the chair swathe to the chin in the barber 's white cloth a gaze of dignified admiration rivet upon he counterpart in the mirror see thus he be not without a similarity to picture of the matterhorn he bare rugged peak rise fearsomely above he snow-draped bulk harpin appear to be put the last snip touch to the colonel 's too-long neglect side-whisker on the table lay he hat and gold-headed cane and close at hand stand he bulge valise i walk hastily on the thing be ominous yet might it not merely denote that pott wish to enter upon he new life well barber the bulge bag support this possibility and yet i be ill at ease reach my office i seek to engage myself with the papers of a approach suit but it be impossible to ignore the darkling cloud of disaster which impend i return to the street anxiously on my way to the city hotel where i have resolve to await like a man what calamity there might be i again pass the barber-shop harpin cust now lean gracefully attentive on the back of the empty chair absently swish he little whisk broom before he be plant pott he left foot advance he head throw back read to harpin from a spread page of the _ argus _ i divine that he be read solon 's comment upon himself and i shudder as i pause at the door of the hotel pott emerge from the barber-shop in one hand he carry he bag in the other he cane and the _ little arcady argus _ he hat be a bit to one side and it seem to I that he be lean back farther than usual he have start briskly down the street in the opposite direction from I but halt on meeting eustace eubank the colonel put down he bag and they shake hand eustace seem eager to pass on but the colonel detain he and begin read from the _ argus _ he voice carry well on the morning air and various phrase to which he give the full meed of emphasis float to I on the gentle breeze that peerless pleader and prince of gentleman come crisply to my ear eustace appear to be restive but the colonel through caution or perhaps mere friendliness have moor he by a coat lapel the reading do i see that eustace decline some urgent request of the colonel 's draw away the moment he coat be release as they part my worst fear be confirm for i see the colonel progress flourishingly to the corner and turn in under the sign barney skeyhan choice wine liquor and cigar what do he say i ask of eustace as he come up it be exceedingly distasteful major eustace be not a little perturb by the encounter he read every word of that disgusting article in the _ argus _ and then he beg I to go into that skeyhan 's drinking-place with he and have a glass of liquor i say very sharply ` colonel pott i have never know the taste of liquor in my whole life nor used tobacco in any form ' at that he look at I in the utmost astonishment and say : ` bless my soul _ really _ young man do not you put it off another day -- life be awful uncertain ' ` why colonel ' i say ' _ that _ be not any way to talk ' but he simply tear down the street say that i be take great chance and now he be read he piece to barney skeyhan i groan rum be the scourge of we american civilization remark eustace warmly barney skeyhan 's rum would scourge anybody 's civilization i say of course i mean _ all _ civilization suggest eustace in polite help to my lame understanding precisely at nine o'clock pott issue from skeyhan 's bear he bag cane and _ argus _ as before he look up and down the quiet street interestedly then cross over to hermann hoffmuller 's another establishment in which we civilization be especially menace he be follow cordially by five of little arcady 's lesser citizen who have obviously sustain the relation of guest to he at skeyhan 's in company with westley keyt and eubank i watch this procession from the window of the city hotel solon denney chance to pass at the moment and we hail he oh i 'll soon fix _ that _ say solon confidently do not you worry and forthwith he send billy durgin who work in the city hotel to hoffmuller 's he be to remind colonel pott that he train leave at eleven-eight billy return with news pott be read the piece to hoffmuller and a number of he patron further he have buy and the crowd be then consume the two fly-specked bottle of champagne which hoffmuller have keep back of he bar one on either side of a stuff owl since the day he begin business eleven year before billy also bring two message to solon : one from pott that he have be mistake about the attitude of little arcady toward himself -- that he be see this more clearly every minute the other be from hoffmuller solon denney be to know that some people might be just as good as other people who think themselves a lot better and would he please not take some shingle off a man 's roof solon ever the incorrigible optimist say of course i might have wait till he be on the train to give he the money but do not worry he 'll be ready enough to go when the ` bus start i feel unable to share he confidence that presentiment have for the moment corrupt my natural hopefulness it be a few moment after ten when pott next appear to we group of anxious watcher this time he have more friend they swarm respectfully but enthusiastically after he out of hoffmuller 's place a dozen at least of we ne'er - do-well one of these big joe kestril a genial lout of a section-hand ostentatiously carry the bag and have a arm lock tenderly through one of the colonel 's these two lead the procession it halt at the corner where the colonel begin to read he _ argus _ notice to belum bedford we druggist who have be on the point of enter he store but the newspaper have suffer it be damp from be lay on bar and part of it be in tatters the reader pause midway of the first paragraph to piece a tear across the column and bedford escape by dash into he store the colonel suddenly discover that he could recite the thing from memory do so with considerable dramatic effect seem not to notice the defection of bedford the crowd cheer madly when he have finish and follow he across the street to the bar of the city hotel we could now observe better the bar of the city hotel be next the office a door be open between they with a wooden screen standing before it inside the carouse rage while we who have think to set pott at large listen and wonder the taller among we could overlook the screen we behold pott one elbow rest on the bar he other hand with the cane in it wave forward he unreluctant train while he loudly inquire if there be drink to be have suitable for a gentleman who be prepare to spend he money like a lord none of that cooking whiskey mind -- nothing but the best bottled goods if you please be the next suggestion again the crowd cheer new face be constantly appear the news have go out with a incredible rapidity honest man inflamed by the report be leave they work and speed to the front from as far north as the fair-grounds and as far south as the depot soon say pott after the first drink ah too soon i shall be mile away from you thrive little hamlet -- as pretty a spot by the way as god ever make -- see none but strange face longing for the old hearty hand-clasp seek perhaps in vain for one kindly look which -- which be now to be observe on every hand but friend colonel j rodney will not forget you i have rare prospects but no matter to this little spot the fairest in all nature -- here among you simple heartfelt face where i first get my start -- here my feeling will ever and anon return for -- why should i conceal it -- it be you my friend who have make I the man i be here pott put a arm over the shoulder of big joe and urge pleadingly : another verse of that sweet old song boy i tell you that have the true heart-stuff in it -- now -- they roar out a verse of auld lang syne with execrable attempt at part-singing little dan leffert a dissolute house-painter contribute a tenor that be simply maniacal pott order more drink this do he lean heavily upon the bar and burst into tear the varlet crowd about he with tender soothing word while we in the other room anxiously watch they and the clock he be overcome it seem by the affection which it now transpire that little arcady bear for he presently he half dry he tear and draw from a inner pocket of he coat the package of we letter with eye again streaming in a sob-riven voice he read they all to the pleased crowd at the end he regain control of himself gentleman believe it or not nothing have touch I like this since i bade farewell to my regiment in '65 you be get under the heart of jona rodney this time -- i can not deny that he begin on the letter again select the choicest and not forget at interval to rebuke the bar-tender for alleged inactivity at last the clock marked ten-forty and we hear the welcome rumble of the ` bus wheel there be a hurry consultation with amo deane the driver he be to enter the bar in a brisk businesslike way seize the bag and hustle the colonel out before he have time to reflect we peer over the screen know the fateful moment be come we see the colonel resist the attack on he bag and listen with marked astonishment to the assertion of amo that there be just time to catch the train time be make for slave say pott that there train be not goin ' to wait a minute remind amo civilly the colonel turn upon he with a large sweetness of manner ah yes my friend but train will be pass through you pretty little hamlet for year -- i hope for age -- yet they pass every day but you can not have jona rodney pott every day here with a gesture he direct the crowd 's attention to amo look at he gentleman speak to he for I -- for i can not i ask you to note the condition he be in here again the colonel burst into tear and oh my god he sob could they ask I to trust myself to a drunken rowdy of a driver even if i _ be _ go amo be not only sober he be a shrewd observer of event a seasoned judge of man he turn away without further parley big joe tell he he ought to be in better business than try to break up a pleasant party as the ` bus start the strain of auld lang syne float to we again and we know the day be lose a hand of iron in a cunning little velvet glove say westley keyt in deep disgust as he leave we it look to I a darned sight more like a hand of mush in a glove of the _ same _ i have often be bring to realize that the latent nobility in we human nature be never so effectually arouse as at the second stage of alcoholic dementia the victim sustain a shock of illumination hardly less than divine on a sudden he be vividly cognizant of he overwhelming spiritual worth daze in the first moment of this flooding consciousness he be presently to be hear recall instance of he noble conduct under difficulty of righteous fortitude under strain especially do he find himself endowed with the antique virtue -- with courage and a rugged fidelity a stainless purity of motive a fond and measureless generosity to this stage the libation of pott have now bring he he begin to refresh the crowd with comment upon he own worth intersperse with kindly but hurt appreciation of the great world 's lack of discernment he beseech and defy each gentleman present to recall a occasion however trivial when he conduct have fall short of the loftiest standard especially be they beg to cite a instance when he have deviate in the least degree from a line of strictest loyalty to any friend big joe kestril be overcome at this he break down and weep out upon the shoulder of pott he hopeless inability to comply with that outrageous request the entire crowd become emotional and a dozen light match be thrust forward toward a apparently incombustible cigar with which pott have long strive recover from these first ravages of he self-analysis the colonel become just a bit critical but you see boy a man of my attribute be hamper and keep down in a one-horse place like this remark have be pass about I here that i should blush to repeat i say it in confidence but i have again and again be make the sport of a wayward and wanton ridicule i say gentleman i have always conduct myself as only a pott know how to conduct himself -- and yet i have be pester by cheap fling at my personal bearing be this courtesy be it common fairness be it the boast civilization of we nineteenth century -lrb- illustration : and yet i have be pester by cheap fling at my personal bearing -rrb- hoarse expression of incredulity of execration of disgust come from the crowd as it raise glass once more the colonel glare down the sloppy length of the bar then gaze aloft into the smoky height the crowd wait for he to say something this be a beautiful day gentleman a fine balmy spring day let we be out and away to mossy dell why stay in this low drinking-place when all nature beckon come on back to hoffmuller 's besides -- he cast a reproachful look at the bar-tender -- the hospitality of this place be not what a upright citizen of this great republic have a right to expect when he be throw he good money right and leave he march out in hurt dignity follow by he train many of whom in loyalty to they host sneer openly at the bar-tender as they pass outside the colonel poise himself in gala attitude and benignantly survey we quiet little main street in both direction across the way in the door of the first national bank stand asa bundy a look of interest on he face the colonel 's sweeping glance halt upon bundy with a glad cry he start across to he but bundy behold the move flee actively inside the colonel reach the door of the bank and try the knob but the key have be turn in the lock and the next moment the curtain of the door be swiftly draw bank close be print upon they in large gold letter pott step aside to look into the window and the curtain of that descend relentlessly the bank have suddenly take on a aspect of sabbath blankness once more the colonel rattle the knob then he turn to he gathering follower gentleman i come here to press the hand of one of nature 's nobleman my try friend the honorable asa bundy whom we have just see retreat to he precinct as i might say with a modesty that be rarely beautiful but no matter here the colonel mount the top step and glow out upon he faithful and ever enlarge band instead my friend allow I to read you this splendid tribute from bundy and i trust that after this i shall never hear one of you utter a word in he disparagement rapidly flutter the packet of letter he draw out one bear the imprint of the first national bank of little arcady the crowd press closer be cheerfully animated from down the street on both side anxious look be bent upon the scene by many of we lead citizen ` to whom it may concern ' begin the colonel in a voice that carry to the confines of we business center ` the determination of we esteemed citizen colonel j rodney pott to remove from we town make it fitting that i record my high appreciation of he

eventful day quietly among rosebush and tender bud hyacinth unspotted of the world receive however occasional bulletin of the orgy from passer-by from these and sundry narrative glean the following

he power of resistance -- that the head of pott be erect he gaze bent aloft and he gait one of perfect directness save that he step a little high i like to think of he in that last walk i like to bring up as nearly as i can he intense exaltation it _ have _ be a beautiful day and now as he look aloft walk with a automatic precision he eye must have behold glorious vista in which he ride a chariot of triumph at the head of a splendid procession while he ear ring with chaste tribute to he worth trumpet by outride herald and the good earth be firm beneath he tread stretch broadly off for he to walk upon and behold he apotheosis i can not wonder that he step high nor can i find it in my heart to begrudge he he day cunningly have he clutch a few golden moment from the hoard that fate the niggard guard from we so jealously to myself i acclaimed he as one to be envy i have always like to believe that the splendor of that last walk endure to the end -- that there be no uncertainty no hesitation above all no vulgar stumbling but that the last high step which plunge he into the chill water of the race be lift in the same exult serenity as the first i stand in my garden that evening charm by the wild sweet gusty-gentle music of the spring night northward in the gathering dusk come a solitary figure walk rapidly -- a slight nervous figure a soft hat draw well over the face the skirt of its coat streaming to the breeze as it pass I i recognize solon denney he be gesticulate with some violence and i could see he expressive face work as if he utter word to himself i think it possible that he might be compose a piece for he newspaper instantly there come to my mind that rather coarse paraphrase of westley keyt -- a hand of mush in a glove of the _ same _ i do not intrude upon my friend as he pass chapter iii the perfect lover to the crime of be pott the wretched colonel have now add malversation of a trust fund but i crave surcease while it may be mine from the immediately troubling water of pott let I turn more broadly to we town and its good people for that need recreation which they never fail to afford I arcady of the little country we often say on map it be little arcady county seat of slocum county a isle and haven in the dreary land sea that flatten away from it on every side -- north to the big wood south to the swamp county and east and west one might almost say a thousand mile to the mountain we point be one from which to say either back east or out west it be neither of itself though it touch both we be so ancient that plenty of we remember the stone fireplace in the log-cabin with its duster for the hearth of buffalo tail and wild-turkey wing with iron pot hang by a chain from the chimney hook with pewter or wooden plate from which to eat with horn-handled knife and iron spoon but yet be we so modern that we have fine new house with bay window ornamental cupola and porch rave woodenly in that frettish fever which the infamous scroll-saw put upon fifty year of we land 's domestic architecture and these house be furnish with splendid modern furniture even with black walnut gold touch and upholster in blue plush and maroon fresh from the best factory we fairly old people remember when they hunt deer and be hunt by the red indian on we town site while they grandchild have only the memory of the town-born of the cottage-organ the novel railroad and the two-story brick block with ornamental false front in short we round a epoch within ourselves historically and socially the country however keep its first purity of charm a country of little hill and little valley line with little quick river these beauty indeed have not go unsung year ago a woman poet ease she heart of ecstasy about this little country here swell the river in its boldest course she write intersperse by halcyon isle on which nature have lavish all she prodigality in tree vine and flower bank by noble bluff three hundred foot high they sharp ridge as exquisitely definite as the edge of a shell they summit adorn with those same beautiful tree and with buttress of rich rock crest with old hemlock that wear a touching and antique grace amid the softer and more luxuriant vegetation not spectacular this -- not sensational -- not even unusual common enough little hill as the world go with the usual ragged-edged village between they and the river people by human being entirely usual both in they outer and inner life it seem to be indeed not a place in which event could occur with any romantic fitness perhaps i have grow to love this little country because i be a usual man perhaps i would have feel as much for it even have i not be hold to it by a memory that would bind I to any spot howsoever unlovely but i rejoice always in its beauty and more than ever when it make easier for I the only life it once appear that i should live i quote again from we visit poet : the aspect of this country be to I enchant beyond any i have ever see from its fulness of expression its bold and impassioned sweetness here the flood have pass over and marked everywhere its course by a smile the fragment of rock touch it with a mildness and liberality which give just the need relief i should never be tire here though i have elsewhere see country of more secret and alluring charm better calculate to stimulate and suggest here the eye and heart be fill here too my eye and heart be fill -- empty -- and wondrously fill yet again for which last i hold pott to be curiously -- but i wander enough to say that i store a harvest of memory in a secret place here year ago and i go to this on day when i be downheart you boy of fifteen i think be the only perfect lover -- give all demand nothing save indeed the right to he secret cherishing tremor bear within I that day when old gray bristle leggett we principal open the schoolroom door upon lucy tait be as poignant as sweetly terrible now as in that far time when the light of she wondrous presence first fall upon I a instant she hesitate timidly in the sombre frame of the doorway look far over we head then old leggett come in front of she there be a word of presentation to miss berham we teacher the vision be escort to a seat at my left front and i be bade to continue the reading lesson if i ever expect to learn anything as a matter of truth i do not expect to learn anything more i think i must suddenly have learn all there be to know the page of the ancient reader over which i then mumble be now before I a good investment be the title of the day 's lesson and i have be call upon to render the first paragraph with lightness unreck the great moment so perilously at hand i have begin : ` will you lend I two thousand dollar to establish myself in a small retail business ' inquire a young man not yet out of he teens of a middle-aged gentleman who be pore over he ledger in the counting room of one of the largest establishment in boston the iron latch rattle the door swing fatefully back we head be raise we eye bore she through and through then swing a new world for I out of primeval chaos and for aeon of century i dizzied myself gaze upon the pyrotechnic marvel _ continue calvin _ -- if you ever expect to learn anything the fabric of my vision crumble awake i glared upon a page where the word run crazily about like a disrupt colony of ant i stammer at the thing feel my cheek blaze but no two word would stay still long enough to be related i glance a piteous appeal to authority while old leggett still stand by crumple he shaven upper lip into a professional sneer that i do not like that will _ do _ calvin sit down solon denney you may go on with careless confidence brushing the long brown lock from he fair brow come solon denney to he foot with flawless self-possession he read and i disgraced cower in my seat hear word that burn little inconsequential brand forever into my memory well do i recall that the middle-aged gentleman regard the young man with a look of surprise and inquire what security can you give I to which the latter answer nothing but my note ` which i fear would be below par in the market ' reply the merchant smile ` perhaps so ' say the young man ` but mr barton remember that the boy be not the man the time may come when hiram strosser 's note will be as readily accept as that of any other man ' ` true very true ' reply mr barton thoughtfully ` but you know business man seldom lend money without adequate security otherwise they might soon be reduce to penury ' benny jeliffe you may go on during this break i steal my second look at she the small head be sweetly bent with a air of studious absorption -- a head with two long plait of braided gold a scarlet satin bow at the end of each it seem to I now that these bow be like the touch of frosted woodbine in a yellowing elm though at the moment i must have be unequal to this fancy i see too the tiny chain that clasp she fair throat she dress of pale blue and most wonderful of all two tassel that dance from the top of she trim little boot the air be indeed too heavy with beauty but the reading lesson continue the year that stretch between that time and this have not bereave I of the knowledge that mr barton graciously accommodate hiram strosser after vainly seek to induce mr hawley a wealthy merchant of milk street to share half the risk at this point a row of star on the page indicate a lapse of ten year mr barton pale and agitate examine with deepen despair page after page of he ponderous ledger at last he exclaim i be ruin utterly ruin how so inquire hiram strosser who enter the room just in time to hear the cry mr barton explain -- the failure of perleg jackson & co of london -- news bring on last steamer -- creditor press he ` what amount would tide you over this crisis ' ask hiram strosser respectfully ` seventy-five thousand dollar ' ` then sir you shall have it ' reply hiram and step to the desk he draw a check for the full amount nor can i ever forget the stroke of poetic justice with which the anecdote conclude mr hawley of milk street be also embarrass by the failure of perleg jackson & co but for want of a trustful friend in fund be throw into bankruptcy mr barton have the chastened pleasure of tell mr hawley about hiram 's loan and of remind he that he have neglect a fair opportunity to become a co-benefactor of that upright and open-handed youth whereupon the ruin hawley -- deservedly ruin the tale imply -- move on dejected and sad while mr barton return to he establishment cheer and animated the gross the immoral romanticism of this tale be not then of course apparent to I child be so defenceless child that i be i believe it would be entirely practicable for a lad in he teens to borrow two thousand dollar from a boston merchant by remind he that the boy be not the man so readily be the young mind poison during the latter part of the lesson between look steal fearfully at she profile i be mentally engage in borrow two thousand dollar from a convenient mr barton with which to establish myself in a small retail business -- preferably a candy store with a ice-cream parlor in the rear then i take she to wife not forget to reward mr barton handsomely in the day of he ruin dimly in the background of this hasty dramatization the distrustful mr hawley who refuse to share the loan with mr barton figure as a rival for my love 's hand and live to hear she say that she hate loathe and despise he at recess the other crowd about she girl at the center within a straggle circumference of young male who dissemble they gallantry under a pretence of be mere brutal marauder but i solitary moped and gloom in a far grassy corner of the school yard i could not be of that crowd and it be then i perceive for the first time that the world be too densely populated i see how much better it would be if every one but she and i be dead thereupon in a breath i dispeopled the earth of all but we two and with the courage gain of this solitude i see myself approach she there at the corner of the old brick schoolhouse greet she with assurance that everything be all right -- and then after she understand what i have do and how fine it be we come into we own alas how bitter the crude truth instead of this those wondrous tassel now dance from she boot top as she give chase to solon denney who have pull one of the scarlet bow from its yellow braid grimly i be aware that he should be the first to go out of the world and i call upon a just heaven to slay he as he flee with he trophy but nothing sweet and fitting happen he go unblasted she come back to the group of girl flush and lovely beyond compare hold up the ravish end of that golden braid with a comic dismay while she despoiler laugh coarsely from a distance and pin the trophy to he coat lapel i now see that blast be too merciful he should be remove by a slower process if the thing could as easily be arrange that be a bitter recess even though i learn she wonderful name and the enchanted state back east from which she have come a still more bitter experience await I when we be again in the schoolroom miss berham fasten a steely gaze upon solon denney launch heaven upon he from tightly draw lip without in the least meaning to do so solon denney you may return that ribbon at once to its owner with a conscious smirk amid the titter of the room and the sharp rap of the ruler on miss berham 's desk solon swagger offensively to the seat that enshrine my idol and fling down the scarlet treasure before she she merely push the thing away bend she head lower above she book -- push it away with a blind little hand and with undiminished bravado she despoiler return scathless of heaven 's vengeance to he seat and you may remain half a hour after school the a-class ready for geography thus lightly do we ruler turn from tragedy to comedy for tragedy there be the look my queen lavish upon solon when she hear he sentence a look of blush merriment with a maddening dash of pity in it -- he be to suffer because of she 'twa you beauty that make I do it he might have quote with the old result how i long for the jaunty lightness that would have let I do a thing like that toss I fairly to the pinnacle of a public association with she but i instead moped alone know well that the gift of graceful brigandage be not mine have _ i _ snatch that ribbon there would have be tear and a mad outcry at my brutal roughness now come the lesson in geography i have know it have study it faithfully that morning it treat of the state from which she have so lately come but now all knowledge of it flee I save that on the map it be a large clumsy state though yellow the color of she hair be it to be bound like any cheaper state do it have principal product like maine new hampshire vermont and other ordinary state its color be rightly golden have it not produce she but other product -- iron coal wheat -- these be stuff too base to fellow in the same mind with she have it principal industry like any red or green or blue state on that pedantic map i could no longer recall they formally confront with this problem i muttered shamefully again that day in the valley of humiliation there be i know a picture at the top of the page in which strong rugged man toil at various task but the nature of these have escape I be they mine coal or building ship catch fish or plough furrow in god 's green earth out of my darkness i stammer principal industry agriculture and fish-building -- that will _ do _ calvin you may remain after school to-night i have never less like the way she say this as if it be a boon at which i would snatch instead of a penalty impose solon denney follow I glibly enumerate the industry of a great and busy state but i could not listen phantom-like in my poor mind float a wordless conviction that however it might once have be the state would immediately abandon its industry now that she have come away from it i beheld its considerable area desolate the forge cold the hammer still the field overgrow the ship rot at they dock the stalwart mechanic droop idly above they unfinished task it be not possible to suppose that any one could feel in a state which she have leave that interest which good work demand my disgrace bring I respite for fresh adventure i be let alone the world could still be people even solon denney might survive a little time for another picture in the same geography now reproduce itself in my inflamed mind -- the picture of a south sea island a sandy beach with a few indolent native loll negligent of task in the shade of cocoanut palm here on the outer reef i wreck a excellent steamship over the rail spring a stalwart lad not out of he teens with a lovely golden-haired girl in he arm with strong swift stroke he strike out for the beach notwithstanding he burden the other passenger a hazy and quite uninteresting lot quickly go down all save one a coarse swaggering youth with too much self-possession whom i need not name he too spring over the rail but near the beach a justly enraged providence intervene and he be bite neatly in two by a famished and adroit shark with some interest i watch he blood stain the lucid green water but it be soon over then i bear my fainting burden to the dry sand and revive she with cocoanut milk and breadfruit while the native crowd respectfully about and make we they king and queen on the spot we live there forever how flat of sound be it to say that we live happily and yet i doubt if solon denney ever suspect I of aspire to be he rival she i think know it full well in the way she sex know matter not communicate by act or word of mouth and once on the afternoon of that day a Friday when we speak piece i fear that solon have find I out he be a fiery orator and i feel on this occasion that he deliver himself straight at I with a very poorly veil malignance surely it must be i that he mean literally when he thunder out sir you be much mistaken if you think you talent have be as great as you life have be reprehensible fall upon I and upon I alone seem to flash he gaze after a rank and clamorous opposition you become -- all of a sudden -- silent you be silent for seven year you be silent on the greatest question -- and you be silent _ for money _ there could be no doubt i think that he single I from the multitude of he auditor it be i who have support the unparalleled profusion and jobbing of lord harcourt 's scandalous ministry i who have manufacture stage thunder against mr eden for he anti-american principle -- you sir whom it please to chant a hymn to the immortal hampden -- you sir approve of the tyranny exercise against america and you sir vote four thousand irish troops to cut the throat of the american under the burden of this imputed ignominy be it remarkable that i falter in my own piece immediately follow the warrior bow he crested head and tame he heart of fire and sue the haughty king to free he long imprison sire not more foully be the blameless don sancho do to death than i upon this Friday murder the ballad that recount he fate and she who have hang breathless on solon 's denunciation of I whisper chattily with eva mcintyre during my rendition of bernardo del carpio later event however convinced I that i swam never in solon 's ken as a rival for she smile he own triumph be too easy too widely herald in the second week of she come be there not a rhyme shout on the playground full in the hearing of both first the post and then the gate solon denney and lucy tait be not this follow by one more subtle more pointed more ribald solon 's mad and i be glad and i know what will please he a bottle of wine to make he shine and lucy tait to tease he i think there be a inhuman devilish deftness in the rhyme the mighty mechanism of english verse have be employ to proclaim my remoteness from my love and yet the god be once graciously good to I one wondrous evening before hope die utterly i survive the ordeal of walk home with she from church she come with she aunt uncle and i present by the god 's permission surmise that she might leave they and go to she own home alone when church be out through that service i worship she golden braid and the pink rose on she leghorn hat and when they sing praise god from whom all blessing flow my voice soar fervently in the word for i have satisfy myself by much crane of the neck that solon denney be not present even now the doxology revive within I that mixed emotion of relief at he absence and apprehension for the approach encounter with she she pass I at the portal of the house of a double worship say good night to aunt and uncle -- and i be at she side may i have the pleasure of see you home she manage a timid certainly she hand flutter within my arm and my heart bound forward like a free race-horse we walk now it have be my occupation at quiet moment to devise conversation against the time of this precise miracle i have dream that it might come to pass even as it do and i know that talk for it should be store safely away this talk have be the coinage of my leisure as we walk i would say lightly -- do you like it here as well as you do back east -- or still better as sound more chatty -- how do you like it here -- a easy masterful pause -- as well as you do back east a thousand time have i rehearse the inflection until they be perfect and now the time be come whether i speak at all or not until we reach she gate i have never know dimly in my memory be a suggestion that when we pass uncle jerry honeycutt i confide to she that he send to chicago for he ear-trumpet and that it cost twelve dollar if i do this she must have make a suitable response though i retain nothing of it i only know that the sky be full of flame meteor that golden star dust rain upon we from a applaud heaven that the earth rock gently as we tread upon it down the wonderful street we go a strange street shimmering in mystic light -- and then i be open she gate i afterward decide that surely at this moment with the gate between we i would have remember -- superbly would i have say how do you like it here -- as well as you do back east but two stare boy pass we and one of they speak thus : -- there be horsehead blake -- hello horsehead that be not old horsehead say the other ` tis too -- be not that _ you _ horsehead how do you do boy i answer loftily and they pass on appease do they call you horsehead she ask oh yes i reply brightly it be a funny name be not it and i laugh murderously yes it be very funny well i 'll have to be go now good night good night and she leave I stare after she the whole big world and its starry heaven cry madly within I to be say to she chapter iv dream and waking the incomparable lucy tait be still but a star to be adore in she distant heaven when i go away from little arcady to learn some thing not teach in the fade brick schoolhouse it be six year before i come back six year that i live in a crowded place where people have no easy way nor front yard with geranium bed nor know enough of they neighbor either to love or to hate they i come back to the little country a mannish be learn in the law and with the right sort of laugh in my heart for the old school day for the simplicity of my boy 's love but there and then with she old sweet want of pity do she smite I again through and through she smite the man as she have smite the boy treacherously it be within my own citadel at the very moment of my come gayly up the remembered path i go under the flowering horse-chestnut to the little house standing back from the street only to find that as of old she block my way she stand where the pink-blossomed climber stream up the column of the little porch and she arm be twine among the strand to draw they to she face she be leave -- but she have stay too long not the child with yellow braid humorously preserve in my memory but a blossom a fruiting eve with whilom braid mass high in a coronet they gold a little tarnished later it come to I to think that she be spring and have filch a crown from autumn in that first glance however i could only wonder instinctively if the tassel yet dance from she boot top i see at once that this might not any longer be know one could only surmise pleasantly but straightway be i atlas stoop a little round my shoulder under the earth she deign to walk upon and the disconcerting strangeness of it be in this : that though she be no longer the woman child yet with one flash of she gold-curtained eye have she reduce I to my ancient schoolboy clumsiness she be a woman but i be again a awkward stammering boy rebelliously decline to believe that a state she have come away from could retain any significance industrial or otherwise nor in the little time leave to we do i ever achieve a condition higher than this consciously i be a prince of lofty origin in she presence but ever unable to make known my excellency of rank it be as in a dream when we must see evil approach without power to raise a avert hand she be spring with a steal crown of autumn and again she be a sherbet -- sweet fragrant cold and about to melt -- but not for I i know that i hear presently that she speak well of I she speak of my have a kind face -- even the kindest face in the world the _ kindest plainest _ face in the world be she fashion of put it and of course that make it hopeless since surely no woman have ever love the kindest face she know only a fool would have hope after this -- and at least i never give she ground to call I that not even do i commit the folly of reveal my need she alone ever know it and she only in the way that the child have know the schoolboy to gloom and rage afar in he passion for she she have no word of mine for it then nor have she now and i believe she feel rather certain there never would be any she seem to be grateful for this and doubly kind with only now and then the flash of a know look or the trifle of a deep swiftly question glance bear i dare say of that curiosity which the devil contrive to kindle in god 's most angelic woman doubtless she have a little speech of refusal pat into kindliness for I perhaps she would not have be wholly anguished to have I hear this -- to be able to assure I tenderly graciously of the depth and pureness of she friendship for I who know i be older now and thing once hide be reveal sometimes i think that a certain new respect for I grow within she as the day try the metal of my silence -- a respect but nothing more she appreciation of my face be too palpably without those reservation that so often cry louder than word so we seal we secret she and i in a unspoken pledge and not even solon denney so keen of scent for rival ever divine it he call I out with the old boyish whistle the day he confide to I the tremendous news of he engagement he laugh foolish with joy as he tell it and i feel tingle in my arm that old boyish brute impulse to slay he for the wretched ease of he victory but we be man so i thrust one of those rebellious arm in among the strand of the creeper where she own arm have once be and lay the other on he shoulder in all friendliness this while he ramble on of the bigness of life the great future before arcady of the little country the importance of the _ argus _ which he have just found and the supreme excellence of that splendid mechanism the new washington hand-press install the week before he life be build of these many interest of she and himself and he country and he town in the fulness of he heart he even bring out the latest _ argus _ and read part from he obituary of dougla while i stand stupidly strive to realize what i have long know must be true a great man have fall he read declaim a little as in we school day stephen a dougla be dead the voice that so lately and eloquently appeal to he countryman be hush in -- how long he read be uncertain but from moment to moment he tone would call I back from vision and i would vaguely hear that one be go who have warn he fellow against the pitfall of political jealousy and bid all who love they country band against those who would seek to pluck a laurel from the wreath of we glorious confederacy but under vision i have make my resolve dougla be dead but other be live two month before in a gray dawn the wall of a fort in charleston harbor have crumble under fire from a score of rebel battery now the shot echo in my ear with a new volume good luck solon -- and good-by -- i be go ` on to richmond ' oh _ that _ say he easily that will be over before you can get to the front but i go forthwith and triumphant lover though he be the editor of the _ little arcady argus _ be less than a prophet i go to the little war and of she i carry as i march a ambrotype in a closed case which i have obtain deviously she smile in it a little question incite smile that seem to lurk back in she eye rather than along she lip it be the smile that have avail to keep I firm in my vow of silence it be another picture i bring back five year later -- the picture of a young girl not smile but grave even fearful as if she have face the camera full of apprehension but i know she not the thing have come to I by chance and i throw it aside to be forget it be best to tell quickly that those year be swift and full early in the second a letter from solon read at a random camp-fire tell I of my namesake 's come for the other year i pleased myself prodigiously by remember that she must speak my name openly to she first-born and i lust for battle then i be a early norseman and i would escape the prosaic bed-death since for those die thus hold wait in she chill prison-house below with hunger she dish starvation she knife care she bed and anguish she curtain to survive for easy death long defer perhaps i should have my empty dish and bed of care at once lack the battle death i could at least mimic it as they do of old that odin 's chooser of the slay might lead I to valhallum there should i forever fight at dawn and be heal at noon if wound to be ready for the feast and song the world be not big enough for we two if we must stay apart life be not to be live in a beggarly and ignoble compromise war be its business bravery its duty and cowardice its greatest crime -- above all that ultimate puling cowardice of accept life empty for its own barren sake at the last i lay on a cot in a field hospital entertain for the moment by the novelty of that vacant spacious feeling on my left side -- wonder if i could shave now with one arm -- without another hand to pull my face into hard little hummock for the razor i hear the soft quick tread of a hospital steward and standing before I he take from its envelope the letter solon denney have send I to say that she be dead i hand it back tell he to burn it and i shut my eye to the sickening shape of life my fever come up again and in the night i feel inch by inch over ground wet with blood for a picture i have relinquish in a quixotic moment i must have be troublesome for they give I the drug of dream and i awaken peacefully i watch the field surgeon gather about a young line officer bring in with a shot through he neck for the better probe of the wound they remove he head and give it to I to hold see that it be solon denney 's head i be seize with a mood of jest -- i would hide it and make solon search i advanced craftily down a endless corridor but come to the edge of a wood where there be a wicked spitting of shot i cry out again and once more they give I the drug then i dream more quietly i see that the soul of my dead arm search for she soul -- that it would soon be draw to she and offer itself to comfort she and never never leave she it would say at least take the arm since you may have it without the face it seem that my other arm should go to she too this side of she there could be nothing for either to close upon it appear to I that i fall asleep on this fancy and dream that i awake painfully to a poor one-sided life effortless barren forbid a year later i go back to the little country to be counsellor at law to its people in time of need and a father to solon denney and he two child solon could direct large affair acceptably but he and he babe be as thistle-down in a prairie wind he bring the child to visit I the first day that i come home -- to a home where i be now to live alone i sit on the little porch above the river bank by the wall of blossom creeper whose tendril she have once embrace bring she cheek intrepidly against the blossom of that year and see he come slowly up the path he seem so sadly alone because of the two little creature that follow he i place a chair for solon and be confront by my namesake do they shoot you arm off in the war he ask yes in the war he pat the empty sleeve and he eye beam with discovery what do you have you sleeve roll up for when you arm be shoot i make plain to he the mystery of the whole sleeve she often speak of you say solon she seem to think you would like to be a help to we if you could i turn to greet the woman child but she have stray into the house i hear she shout from my bedroom then she come run to we coo in helpless joy candy -- candy -- uncle maje -- lovely candy -- all pink and dusty well over a face set with the mother 's eye be spill that which she have clutch and eat of -- a thing pink and dusty in truth but which be not candy she do those thing constantly say the dejected father i do not see what i can do to she i see however and do it first wipe the tooth-powder from she face she have call I uncle maje she be a regular baddix announce my namesake gravely judicial then as if with intention to indicate delicately that the family afford striking contrast he add _ i _ be not a baddix -- i can nearly sing the child fribble about we while we talk away the afternoon the woman child at last put I to think -- to think that perhaps butterfly be not mean to be happily catch with many shout she have clumsily enough imprison one -- a fairy thing of green and bronze -- in a hand so plump that it seem to have be quilt a moment she hold it then set it free perhaps for its lack of spirit it crawl and flutter up the vine trail a crumpled wing most sadly and i take it for my lesson assuredly they be not to be catch with any profit -- at least not brutally in a eager hand brush they ever so lightly and the bloom be off the wing they be to be watch in they pretty flitting love only in they freedom and from afar with no clumsy reaching that be a good thing to know in any world the _ argus _ announce my home-coming with a fine flourish of my title in solon 's best style it say that i have come back to take up the practice of the law not even solon know that i have come back to the memory of she this be how it befall that i be presently engross to outward seem with the affair of little arcady -- even to the extent of a casual pott and those bless contingency that be later to unfold from he thus i take my allotted place and the year begin chapter v a mad prank of the god a week after the publication of that blithe bit of acrimony which open this tale colonel j rodney pott recreate and natty in a new summer suit of alpaca he hat freshly iron sue the town of little arcady for ten thousand dollar damages to he person and announce he candidacy at the ensue election for the honorable office of judge of slocum county he do this at the earnest solicitation of he many friend in whose hand he have place himself -- at least so read he card of announcement in the _ banner _ we other paper he do not name these solicitous friend but it be a easy suspicion that they be the democratic leader who think by this mean to draw vote from the republican candidate to the advantage of they own who otherwise be concede to have no hope of election in a county overwhelmingly republican it may be tell with adequate confidence that westley keyt be not of they number as to the damage suit westley find it unthinkable that pott could deteriorate ten thousand dollar worth and still walk the earth indeed he believe and utter a few rough word to express it that ten dollar would be a excessive valuation even if pott be utterly destroy be a earnest soul westley have take the pott affair very seriously he make it a point to encounter the colonel on a early day and to address he on main street in tone that lack the least affectation of suavity or diplomatic guile he have see diplomacy try and find wretchedly want he would have no more of it ever like the straightaway man he be he go to the meat of the matter you squander that hundred dollar we give you to git out of town on he burst forth to pott breathe with a ominous difficulty you just wait till you hear the worst of it answer pott as he confidingly dust the shoulder of westley 's coat the worst of it be i have over twelve dollar of my own money that i would save up -- you know how hard it be to save money in these little town -- well that go too _ every cent of it _ it be admit by witness competent to form a opinion that westley 's contorted face he troubled breathing he manner of step back and the curious writhe of he stout arm all encourage a supposition that he might be contemplate immediate violence upon the person of pott at all event this view be take by the aggrieved and puzzle colonel who flee through the boston cash store and by means of a rear exit from that emporium gain the office of truman baird justice of the peace where he swear to a legal document which aver that the say jona r pott be in fear of immediate and great bodily harm which he have reasonable cause to believe will be inflict upon he by the say westley keyt the majesty of the law be thus invoked westley be put under a good and sufficient bond to refrain from in any manner of attack or molest the say pott against the statute therein make and provide and against the peace and dignity of the state of illinoi a proceeding so official somewhat dampen the fire of mr keyt he be a citizen law-abiding by intention with a patriot 's esteem for government it have merely not occur to he that the summary extinction of pott could be a performance at all incompatible with the peace and dignity of the great commonwealth to which he be at heart loyal be convinced otherwise he abide grimly by the statute therein make and provide nevertheless he return to he shop and proceed to cut up a quarter of beef with a energy of concentration and a ruthlessness of fury that cause pott to shudder as he pass the door sometime later by such demeanor also be the bondsman of westley -- the first flush of they righteous enthusiasm fade -- greatly disturbed they agree that he ought to be watch closely by day and they even debate the wisdom of sit up night with he for a time turn by turn but they charge dissuade they from this precaution he expend he first vicious fury usefully upon he stock in trade with knife and saw and cleaver and thereafter he be but petulant or sarcastic i have the right of it he insist the only way to do with a person like he be to git you feather and you kittle of tar cook up all nice and gooey and git pott on the ground and _ make a believer of he _ right there and then this he follow by he pointed reflection upon the administrative talent of solon denney -- a hand of mush in a glove of the _ same _ when listener be not by he would mutter it to himself in sinister guttural nor be he alone in this spirit of dissatisfaction with solon the too-trustful editor of the _ argus _ be frankly deride he be a boss at whom they laugh openly they wait however with interest for the subsequent issue of this paper the _ banner _ that week contain the follow bit of news : -- = dastardly assault in broad daylight = = early last Thursday evening as colonel j rodney pott dean of the slocum county bar be enjoy a quiet stroll along we beautiful river bank near cady 's mill he be set upon by a gang of ruffian and would have be foully deal with but for he vigorous resistance be a man of splendid proportion and a giant 's strength the colonel be make gallant headway against the cowardly miscreant when he foot slip and he be precipitate into the chill water of the mill-race at a point where the city father have allow it to remain uncovered see they victim plunge into a watery grave as they think the thug take to they heel the colonel extricate himself from he perilous plight by dint of herculean strength and start to pursue they but they have disappear from sight in the vicinity of crowder & fancett 's lumber yard thing have come to a pretty pass we must say if such a dastardly outrage as this should be allow to go unpunished now that colonel pott have bring suit against the city we suppose the council will have that mill-race cover we have repeatedly warn they about this we wonder if they ever hear a well-known say about lock the stable door after horse be steal etc = = the card of colonel pott print elsewhere in this issue be a sufficient refutation of the malicious gossip that have be hand back and forth lately that he have plan to leave little arcady it look now like certain busybody in this community have over-step themselves and be hoist up by they own petard the colonel be a fine man for county judge and we bespeak for he the suffrage of every voter who want a honest judiciary = westley keyt read this want to know what a petard be inquiry disclose that he hope it might be something that could be use upon pott to the advantage of almost every one concerned but in the mind of other of we a agonize suspicion now take form have the letter be upon pott when he go down have they be save be they legible and would he use they it be decide that solon denney should try to illuminate this point before take the candidacy of pott seriously in the next issue of the _ argus _ therefore be this paragraph mean to be provocative : -- = god 's providence have be say to watch over fool and drunkard we guess this be so and that the pretension of a certain individual in we midst to its watchfulness in the double capacity indicate can no longer be in doubt = these line do they work the next _ banner _ speak of a foul conspiracy whose nefarious end it be to blacken the sterling character of a good man of that nestor of the slocum county bar colonel j rodney pott as testimony that the best citizen of the town be not involve with this infamous ring it have extort from colonel pott he consent to print certain letter from these gentleman set forth the colonel 's surpass virtue in no uncertain term -- letter which he innate modesty have shrink from make public until goad to desperation by the hell-hound of a corrupt and subsidized opposition the letter follow in a terrific sequence -- a series of laudation which the chevalier bayard need not have scorn to evoke then we wait for solon but he be rather disappointing say the next _ argus _ : -- = we have heretofore consider jr pott to possess the anti-social instinct of a parasite without its moderate spirit of enterprise but we be wrong we now concede the spirit of enterprise as for this candidacy of pott horace greeley once say comment we think on some action of weed 's i like cool thing of ordinary dimension -- a iceberg or a glacier but this arctic circle of coagulation appal credulity and paralyze indignation hence my numbness hence also we own numbness but though speech lieth prone on a paralytic 's couch action be hearty and stalketh willingly abroad in this campaign it will speak louder than word yea it will be hear high above noah webster 's entire assemblage of such of they as be decent that be all jrp _ take notice _ = it be jaunty enough but pott have unquestionably gain a follow indeed he have ably cement the foundation of one by he magnificent hospitality on that day of day he whilom serf be man not easily offend by fault of taste and they be voter to a man they come out strongly for pott he himself behave with a faultless discretion above the slur of the _ argus _ and the bickering of faction he bear himself as one alienate from earth by the grace of he spirit and he copiously promise deed which should in the year to come be as a beauteous garment to he memory the glaive of justice should descend where erstwhile it have corruptly be stay vice should surfer its meed of retribution and virtue come again into its glorious own we letter of eulogy print at the _ banner _ office be scatter among the voter and with they go a letter from pott say that if he strenuous labor as a attorney in the interest of humanity public moral and common decency meet with the voter 's approval he would be gratify to have he good-will and assistance it be such gentleman as yourself read the letter constitute the best element of we society to whom i must look for the endorsement of my work the criminal class of this community whose minion have so recently seek my life by mob violence will leave no stone unturn to prevent my sit as judge we democratic candidate who have first feel but a academic interest in the campaign begin now to show elation old cuthbert mayne the republican candidate who have be certain of success but for the accident of pott chew he unlighted cigar viciously and from the corner of he trap-like mouth speak evil of pott in a voice that be terrifying for its hoarseness he own letter among the other tell of pott as one who spring to arm at he country 's call and be now richly deserving of political preferment this have seem to heighten the inflammation of he utterance daily he consult with solon warn he that the town look to the _ argus _ to avert this calamity of pott but solon if he have form any plan for relief refuse to communicate it mayne and the rest of we be compel to take what hope we could from he confident if secretive bearing meantime the _ banner _ be not reticent about j rodney pott that gallant old war-horse across the top of its front page each week stand pott forever -- pott the come man big joe kestril be the chief henchman of pott and he fidelity be like to have be fatal for he he throw himself into the campaign with a single-heartedness that leave he few sober moment upon the city hotel corner day after day he buttonhole voter and whisper to they with alcoholic fervor that pott be a gentleman of character as blotchless as the driftin ' snow joe believe in pott pathetically the campaign wear its way through the summer and solon denney be still silent still secretive still confident but alas still inactive so far as we could observe i may say that we lose faith in he as the barren week come and go we come to believe that he assure bearing be but a shield for he real despair have give up hope some of we reach a point where we could view the whole affair as a jest it become a popular diversion to enter the establishment of the ever serious westley keyt and whisper secretively to he that solon denney have find a diplomatic way to rid the town of pott but this never move westley once bit -- twice shy would be he response as he return to slice steak chapter vi a matter of personal property in deference to the wish of jrc tuckerman i have form a habit of breakfast in summer on the little back porch that overlook the river less radical departure from orthodox custom it be true have cause adverse comment in we watchful little town but the spot be secluded from casual censor and it be pleasant to sit there on a summer morning over a omelette and bacon coffee such as no other little arcadian ever drink and beat biscuit beyond the skill of any in we vale save the stout short-statured elderly black man who serve I with the grace of a ambassador moreover i be glad to please he and please he it do to set the little table back against the wall of vine to place my chair in the shaded corner and to fetch the incomparable result of he cookery from the kitchen couch and cover in snowy napkin against the morning breeze john randolph clement tuckerman he be mr tuckerman to many simple soul of we town and clem to I after we intimacy become such as to warrant this form of address a little tightly kinked grizzled mustache give a tone to he face he hair well retreat up he forehead be of the same close-woven salt-and-pepper mixture he eye be well of ink when the light fall into they -- sad kind eye that give he face a look of patient service long and toilsomely but lovingly bestow it be a look tell of kindness that have endure and triumph -- a look of submission in which suffering have once burn but have consume itself i have never see it except in the eye of certain old negro the only colorable imitation be to be find in the eye of my setter pup when he crouch at my foot and beseech kindness after a punishment in bearing as i have intimate clem be impressive he be low-toned easy of manner with a flawless aplomb as he serve I those morning in late summer wear a dress-coat of broadcloth a choice relic of he splendid past it be not difficult to see that he have be the associate of gentleman as i eat of he cooking on a fair Sunday i marvel gratefully at the slender thread of chance that have draw he to be my stay alone in that little house with no one to make it a home for I clem be the barrier between I and the fare of the city hotel apparently without suggestion from I he have take I for he own to tend and watch over and the marvel be assuredly not diminish by the circumstance that i be beholden to pott for this black comfort event be in train which be to intensify a thousand fold my amazement at the seeming inconsequence of really vital fact in this big life-plot of which we be the puppet -- event so incredible that to dwell upon they relation to the minor accident of a mere pott be to incur confusion and downright madness apparently fate have never make a wilder more purposeless cast than when it bring clem to little arcady with pott true the circumstance enable pott for a time to refer to he body-servant and to regale the chair-tilted lounger along the city hotel front with a tale of pick the fellow up on a southern battle-field and of win he dog-like devotion by subsequent valor upon other field it be pathetic and comical too gentleman to hear that nigger beg I on he bended knee to take better care of myself and not insist upon get to the front of every charge ` stay back and let some of the other do a little fighting ' he would say with tear roll down he black cheek and i admit i be rash but -- clem not long after they arrival confide to such of we as seem worthy the less romantic tale that he have find the colonel drunk on the street of cincinnatus he have go there to seek a fortune for he

for he part cut the colonel dead on main street one day and never afterwards betray to he any consciousness of he existence it be say that they final disagreement hinge upon a matter of thirty odd

heart cry out for the distinction of train-boy conductor engineer brakeman or fireman in the order name have be force into the only degrading post in the game -- a mere passenger without voice or office in those delicate feat of administration and she suffer -- suffer with a pathetic loyalty for she know as well as they that some one _ have _ to be the passenger i hold a accuse eye upon my

post and come run after we john b gough he exclaim bitterly -- profanely he be swearing warn he sister look out uncle maje or he 'll say ` gamboge ' next i do not care retort the indignant follower you can not have a train without any passenger -- it be silly i do not care if i do say gamboge there gamboge it i turn upon he i have endure terrapin-buzzard hurl at the group by my woman child perceive need of relief for she pent-up passion i have moreover for the same reason permit my namesake to roll under he tongue the formidable and satisfying expletive john b gough but i feel that the line must be draw at gamboge terrapin-buzzard be bad enough though it be true that this might be use innocently as in a moment of mild dismay or as a exclamation of mere astonishment without sinister import but gamboge -- and rip out brazenly as it have be -- no a thousand time no calvin i say sternly be not you ashamed to use such language -- before I -- and before you little sister but here the little sister sink beneath she true woman 's level by say : -- i know worse than that -- dut with a look of deadly coldness i seek to chill the pride that shine in she eye as she achieve this new enormity what be ` dut ' i ask severely dut be -- be _ a _ dut she answer somewhat abashed by my want of enthusiasm a dut be a baddix -- a regular baddix volunteer she brother follow a device familiar to philologist he submit concrete example two of those sullivan be dut and so 's mr sullivan sometimes when she make I split kindling and let the cat alone and -- that will do i say that be enough of such talk come right into the house it be not a baddix to say ' o cracker ' he observe tentatively as he follow we it may not be for some people i answer nice people might say that once in a great while on week-day if they never say any other baddix but it be just as bad as any of they if you say all the other -- especially that horrible one -- gamboge he remind I brightly never mind say it again then come a new uproar from the wagon-box we perceive that the train have move off again man now entirely by sullivan they seek i detect to produce in we mind a impression that the thing be go better than ever the toot of the sullivan-throated whistle be louder and more frequent and the voice of the largest could be plainly hear he have combine the two office of train-boy and conductor we hear he alternately demand ticket and urge peanut cake and candy if the intention have be to lure we back to witness a sullivan triumph it fail we shut we lip tightly and move around to the front porch the foiled sullivan presently follow we here they make a group at the base of a maple on the lawn and affect not to notice we talk in a large loud way so that we must overhear and be make envious -- even awe-struck for they have all secure job on the real railroad it appear they would have to begin to-morrow probably they do not know for sure but they think it would be to-morrow it would be fine ride off on the big train probably they would never come back to this town but sleep on they big engine every night and every day from the toothsome dainty of the train-boy sullivan 's basket they would eat all they could hold the elder sullivan aged eight he of the artistic temperament here soar dizzily into the farthest ether of romance he have he uniform at home at that very moment and a cap with gold reading on it -- it read conductor on one side and candy on the other only -- this veritably smack of genius -- the blue coat with the gold button have be make too small for he and he would have to wait until they send he a larger size -- a no 12 he say with a careless unseeing glance at we group this be a stroke that have nearly do for one of we -- but a moment 's resistance and another of sober reflection save he he flash to I a look of scorn for the clumsy fabrication there be still a brakeman need it appear -- a _ good _ brakeman the sullivan consult importantly wonder if a good man could by any chance be find around here they name and reject several possible candidate -- other boy that we know and they wonder again no -- probably every one around here be afraid to leave home or would not be strong enough i hold my breath perceive at once the villany on foot they be try to lure one of we into a trap they wish one of we to leap forward with a glad eager artless shout -- _ i 'll _ be the other brakeman at once they would jeer coarsely slapping one another 's back and affect the utmost merriment that this one of we should have be equal to so monstrous a pretension this would last a long time they would take up other matter only for the sake of come back to it with sudden explosion of contemptuous mirth happily the one of we most liable to this ignominy remain unbelieving to the bitter end even do he pretend to a yawning sort of interest in a book carelessly pick up the sullivan have be foiled at every turn and now we be relieve from the covert but not less pointed insult of they presence mr delia she morning 's work do come out dress for church bidding I a briskly sad little good marnin ' _ major _ i respond pleasantly for in a way i like mr sullivan who come each day from she bare little house under the hill to make a home for solon and we child at least she be kind to they and keep they plump that she remain dismal under circumstance that seem to I not to warrant it be a detail of minor consequence terry sullivan have be no good husband to she beat she and the lesser sullivan have be he serious aim when in liquor and he diversion when out but he fall from a gracious scaffolding with a bucket of azure paint one day and fracture he stout neck a thing which in the general opinion of little arcady heaven have mean to be consummate under more formal auspices but when they take terry home and lay he on she bed she have wail absurdly for the lose lover in he through the night she cry have be ah terry terry -- ye gev I manny a haird blow darlin ' but ye kep ' th ' hairdest til th ' last it be not possible to avoid be irritated a little by such a woman but i always try to conceal this from she i suppose she have a right to she own play-world she be dress now in a limp black of many rusty ruffle that sag close to she and glisten in spot through its rust both the dress and the spiritless silk bonnet that circle she keen little face seem to have be cry over a long time -- to be always damp with she tear with parting injunction to my namesake to let the cat alone not to track up the kitchen and not to play with match the little woman lovingly cuff the conspire lesser sullivan into a decorous line behind she and march they off to church there i know she would give from she poor wage that the soul of dead terry should be the sooner pray out of a place which it would seem might have be create with a eye single to he just need thinking of woman 's love -- that like the peace of god it passeth all understanding -- i officiate absently as one of two guest at a tea-party my fellow-guest be a large doll brace stiffly in its chair a doll whose waxen face have be gouge by vandal nail that be a old tragedy though a sickening one at the time the doll have be my christmas offer to the woman child and in the dusk of that joyous day my namesake have crave of its proud mother the boon of hold it a little while relinquish trustingly to he he have sit with it by a cheerful fire -- without evil intent i do truly believe surely it be by chance that he find its waxen face soften under the stove 's glow -- and have heaven affixed nail to any boy of seven that in a dusky room at a quiet moment would have behave with more restraint i trow not one surprised dig and all be lose of that fair surface of round cheek fatten chin and noble brow not a square inch be leave ungouged it be indeed a face of evil suggestion that the unsuspecting mother take back that be the evening when the crowder live next door have rush over in the belief that my woman child be be murder the criminal have never be able to advance the shadow of a reason or excuse for he mad act he seem to be as honestly puzzle by it as the rest of we though i rejoice to say that he be not leave without reason to deplore it but the mother -- the true mother -- have thereafter love the disfigured thing but the more she promptly divest it of all its splendid garment as a precaution against further vandalism and the naked thing with its scar face be ever a honor guest at we function you really must get some clothes for irene i say that be not quite the right thing you know have she sit there without any in much annoyance she rebuke I whisper for this thoughtless lapse from my rle as guest at we party irene be no longer irene but mr judge robinson and justly sensitive about she faulty complexion and lack of clothes besides come the whisper again i be go to make she some clothes -- a lovely veil to go over she face resume she company voice and with the aplomb of a perfect hostess who have rectify the gaucherie of a awkward guest she press upon I another cup of the custard coffee and tactfully inquire of the supposedly embarrassed mr judge robinson if she do not think this be _ very _ warm weather for this time of year the propriety be thus mend we hostess raise she voice and bade mr sullivan within door to hurry with the next course which i be charm to learn would be lemon soup and frosted cake mr sullivan 's response though audible only to she mistress who be compel to cock a intent ear toward the kitchen seem to be in some manner shuffling or evasive what be _ that _ she exclaim sharply listen again then with dignity well if you _ do not _ hurry i 'll have to come right in there and see to you this minute the threat happily avail and the feast go forward a phantom and duly apologetic mr sullivan serve we with every delicacy which we imagination afford when we have eat to repletion of and from the checkers which be we plate and food as well mr judge robinson suddenly become irene who have eat too much and have to be scold and put to bed the light be out the revelry do go walk now ask my namesake he do not know how to behave at tea-party and sit at a little distance from we he have be aim a imaginary gun at every fat robin that mine the lawn for sustenance ask you father if you may go i say i have hear solon pacing he room -- forever cogitate the imminent pott i do not enter the house oftener than i could help for always in those room i feel a troubled presence a homesick thing that push two frail white hand against a intangible but sufficing curtain that hold it from those it sicken for i could not long be easy there it be a day poise and serene with white brush-dab of cloud on a wonderful canvas of blue -- a day when i long for the honeyed fragrance of the wood warm from the last night 's rain but this be not to be my walk not for I the shaded arch of the wood where glad bird pipe nor the velvet hillside tuft with green and yellow and brown nor eke the quiet lane run between wall of foliage where simple rabbit scamper amaze but not yet teach they fullest fear the butterfly we must chase hover rather along urban way that of the woman child be social ahead of we she flounce strangely she be herself mr judge robinson now i understand that she be deck in a gown of royal purple whose sweeping velvet train give she no little trouble but she pay she call at each gate she stop and it seem that person meet she there for she begin : -- why how do you _ do _ yes it be lovely weather we be have be you child get the scarlet fever that be too bad so have mine i be afraid they 'll die well i must be go now _ good _ day sometimes she run back to say now do come over some day and bring you work the butterfly pursue by my namesake be various and some of they be more secret for one he make I stand with he while he gaze long into the drug-store window i divine at last that those giant chalice one of green and one of ruby liquor be the object of he worship he could not have tell I this but i know that in he mind these be compound of unparalleled richness potent with heaven know what wondrous charm it be not that he dream ever of secure any of the stuff the spell endure only while they must stand there remote splendid inaccessible then we stroll down the quiet street to a road that go close to the railway and there with beat heart we behold the two-twenty eastern freight rattle superbly by we from the cab of its inspiring locomotive one of fortune 's favorite ring a priceless gold bell with a air of indifference which we believe in we heart be assume to impress we and notwithstanding we suspicion we _ be _ impressed for do we not know that he could reach up he other hand and blow the splendid whistle if he happen to feel like it after the locomotive come the closed and mysterious box-car important with big number and initial in cabalistic sequence indicate a wide and exciting range of travels then come stock car from between the slat of which strange and envied cattle look out on they way to a wondrous city and there be a car of squeal pig who seem not to want to ride on a real train and some car of sheep that be stupidly indifferent about the whole thing at the last be a palatial caboose and toward this over the top of the move car a happy brakeman make he exciting progress not have to hold on or anything he casually wave a arm at we a salute that one of we number in acknowledge seek to imitate for the cool indifferent flourish of its arm as if it be a common enough thing for we to be notice by the mighty from they eminence this be my namesake 's most beautiful of butterfly any one could understand that as the train lose itself in smoke i know well what he feel i know that that smoke of soft coal be so delicious so wonderful of portent in he nostril that throughout he life it would bring up the wander-bidding in he -- always a strange sweet passion of _ start _ even now the journey-wonder be in he eye i know that he see himself jauntily step the perilous top of car clothe in a coat of padded shoulder bind with wide braid a lantern on he arm coal dust smudge the back of he neck and two finger felicitously go from he left hand i cough to recall he from vision he look up at I a little shyly debate -- but why should it not be tell uncle maje -- when i grow up i be go off to be a brakeman i know it i say quietly will not it be just fine it be the very finest life in all the world i hope for it myself once but i be disappoint he give I a quick look of sympathy would not they let you well they be afraid i would be hurt -- only i know i would not be -- anything to speak of -- a couple of finger perhaps -- off the left hand he suggest understandingly of course -- off the left hand that brakeman on no 3 have get two off _ he _ leave hand be the final comment we retrace we step but there be yet another butterfly of my namesake 's he lead we to a by-path that follow the river bank up to the bridge run far ahead of we when we reach he he be seat dumb with yearning before a newly paint sign go to budd 's for a up-to-date 25 ct dinner he be oblige to limp that day for he stone-bruise be come on finely but he have go half a mile out of he way to worship at this wayside shrine again he be dream in the day of he opulence he see himself go to budd 's fortunately for he illusion the price be now prohibitive i have be to budd 's myself have you ever be there i ask of the dreamer i have be in he store in the front part where the candy be -- and if you go ` round when he be freezing ice cream he 'll give you a whole ten-cent dish just for turn the freezer but pop will not let I stay out of school to do it and budd do not freeze saturday but some day -- he pause then with seemingly another idea : -- he be get a awful funny sign up over the counter he would not tell I what the sign be though he shuffle and talk of other thing i enter budd 's on the morrow purposely to read it and i know that my namesake have quail before it the sign be in white frosted letter on a blue ground and it run : -- to trust be to bust to bust be hell no trust no bust no hell its syllogistic hardness be repellant but i dare say it preserve a gorgeous butterfly from utter extinction home again at early twilight we eat of a cold supper set out for we by mr sullivan and here i reflect that good day often end badly for my namesake betray extreme dissatisfaction with the food why do not we have that pudding oftener -- with lather on top of it be he first outbreak and at last he feel oblige to declare bitterly we do not have a thing that be fit to eat calvin say he father if i have to whip it will hurt you worse than it do I whereupon the complainer be wisely silent but later i hear he assert between catch of he breath and out of he father 's hearing : -- i do not care -- -lrb- _ a sniff _ -rrb- -- when i be rich i 'll go to budd 's for a up-to-date dinner you bet -- -lrb- _ a snuffle _ -rrb- -- i 'll probably go there every day of my life -- -lrb- _ two snuffle _ -rrb- -- yes sir -- sunday and all i cheer he as best i could he sister have save she day to a happy end babble off to bed with the distressing irene to whom she would show a book of picture until sleep shut off she little eyelid a wise old man -- i believe he be a bishop -- once say he know that outside the real world be a world of fine fabling i have steal a day from that world now i hurry through the gloom of the hall past the poor strive hand to sit with solon denney and tell he of a peculiar thing i have observe during the afternoon 's walk chapter viii adventure of billy durgin sleuth i speak to solon of billy durgin whose peculiar not to say mysterious behavior i have be compel to notice i have first observe he that afternoon as we pass the city hotel through the window of the little wash-room where i see that he be polish a pair of shoe he have wink at I from over he task and then erect himself to make a puzzling gesture with one hand again while we stand dream-bound before the window of the corner drug store he have send I a low whistle from across the street follow this with another puzzling arm wave whereat he have start toward we but instead of accost I as i have think he mean to he rush by with eye rigidly ahead and he thin jaw grimly set throughout the stroll he haunt we adhering to this strange line of conduct i would turn a corner to find billy apparently wait for I a block off then would follow a signal of no determinable import after which he would walk swiftly past I as if unaware of my presence once i start to address he but be meet with _ not a word _ hiss at I in he best style from between clenched tooth i decide at last that billy be play a game of he own for billy durgin though sixteen year old have happy access to we world of fine fabling and to this i know he resort at those time when he duty as porter at the city hotel pall upon he romantic spirit billy in short be a detective well soak in the plenteous literature of he craft and living in the dream that criminal would one day shudder at the bare mention of he name nor be he unprovide with a badge of office upon he immature chest conceal by he waist-coat be a eight-pointed star emblazon with a open eye billy have once proudly confide to I that the star be pure german silver a year before he have answer a advertisement which make know that a trusty man be want in every community to act for we in a confidential capacity address for particulars with stamp the particulars be that you send the international detective association five dollar for a badge after that you be they confidential agent and if a case occur in you territory you be the man they turn to billy 's five hard-earned dollar have go to the great city and back have come he star he wear it secretly at first but be move at length to display it to a few choose friend not wisely choose it would appear for now there be mocker of billy among the irreverent of the town as he sit aloft on he boot-blacking throne wait for crime to be do among we con meantime one of those romance in which he hero do rare deed he would be subject to intrusion some coarse town humorist would leer upon he from the doorway -- a leer of furtive devilish cunning -- and whisper hoarsely hist be we alone strike thus below the belt of he dignity we hero could only respond : -- aw that be all right you g ` wan out a ' here now a ' quit you foolin ' but criminal seem to have conspire against little arcady to cheat it of its rightful distinction in vain have billy wait for a case to be send he by the international detective agency in vain have he seek to develop one by he own ferret genius each week he search the column of the police paper in harpin gust 's barber-shop fix in he mind the lineament of criminal there advertise as want in various corner of we land these be counterfeiter murderer embezzler horse-thief confidence man what not -- criminal to satisfy a sleuth of the most catholic taste but they be all want elsewhere -- at altoona pennsylvanium or deme new mexico at portland maine or dodge city kansa in truth the country elsewhere swarm with billy 's lawful prey and only little arcady seem good billy also gloat over the portrait of well-known deputy sheriff and other officer of the law print in the same charming police paper it seem not too much to hope that he own likeness might one day grace that radiant page -- himself in a long fashionable overcoat carelessly fling back to reveal the badge with its never close eye and underneath william p durgin the dash young detective whose coolness skill and daring have make he name a terror to evil-doer famish for adventure thirst for danger yearning for the perilous midnight encounter avid of secrecy and disguise billy have be force to toil prosaically barrenly unprofitably about the sinless corridor of the city hotel all he have be able to do thus far be to regard every newcomer to the town with a steely eye of distrust to watch each one furtively to shadow he in he walk and to believe during he sojourn that he might be red mike alia jame k brown want for safe-breaking at muskegon michigan reward $ 1000 or some like desperado as such do he view they all -- from the ornately garb young man who come among we purvey windmill to the portly broadclothed gray-whiskered and forbiddingly respectable colporteur of the american bible society some day would he keen gray eye penetrate the cunning disguise some day would he step quietly up to he man and say in low but deadly tone : come with I now make no trouble or it will be the worse for you whereupon the guilty wretch would blanch and say in shake voice : my god it be billy durgin the famous detective do not shoot -- i 'll come billy have faith that this dramatic episode would occur in the very office of the city hotel and he believe that some of those who have joke he about he life passion would thereafter treat he in a very different manner though i have long win these fact from billy i have never know he to play he game so openly before but when i mention the thing to solon think to beguile he from he trouble i find he more interested than i have think he could be for solon know billy as well as i do do billy follow you here he ask perhaps he have a clew a clew to what a clew to pott billy volunteer to work up the pott case and i tell he to go ahead be that fair solon to pit a sleuth as relentless as billy against poor pott all 's fair in love and war be it really war you ask westley keyt if he think it be love i think i notice for the first time then that the pott affair be etch line into solon 's face of course it be war he go on you know the fix i be in i have the plan to get pott out it be a good plan too the more i think of it the better i like it with any man in the world but pott that plan would have be a stroke of genius but i do not mind tell you that this thing have rob I of sleep for three month pott have get I talk to myself i wake up talking of he out of the little sleep i do get i 'll tell you the fact -- if pott be here six week longer and let to finish this canvas my influence in slocum county be go i might as well give up and move on to another town myself where my dreadful secret be unknown nonsense but what can billy durgin do well i be desperate that be all and one night billy have I meet he up by the cemetery -- he come disguise in long black whisker -- and he tell I that pott be jame carruther better know to the police of two continent as ` smooth jim ' want for rob the post-office at lima ohio of course that be nonsense pott have not the wit to rob a post-office but i do not have the heart to tell billy so i tell he instead that this be the chance of he life to fasten to pott like a enraged leech and draw out every secret of he dark past you can not tell -- billy might find something to pry he into the next county with anyway he certainly look charge with information this afternoon he be fizz like a impatient soda fountain but why do he follow I well that might be billy 's roundabout way of get to I the other time he shadow marvin chislett to get a message to I if you be a detective you can not do thing the usual way or all may be lose at that instant a low whistle sound in we ear a small missile be throw over the evergreen hedge bound almost to we foot and a slight but muscular figure be see retreat swiftly into the dusk solon spring for the mysterious object it be a stone about which be wrap a sheet of paper this he take off and smooth out by the fading light we make out to read : meet I at graveyard step at midnight you know who we look at each other why do not he come in here i ask that would not have be detective-like but the graveyard at midnight well perhaps he will not hold out for midnight -- billy be merely poetic at time -- and maybe if we hurry along we can catch up with he and have it out by the marble work there instead of go clear on to the cemetery perhaps that will be near enough in the right spirit for billy quickly we make ready for the desperate assignation pull we hat well down in a way that we think billy would approve four block along the street by rapid walking we come within hail of the intrepid young detective we be also opposite the marble yard of cornelius lawson who work monument for the dead of little arcady in front of the shop be a dozen finish and half-finished stone ghostly white in the dusk it seem indeed to be a spot impressive enough to meet even billy 's captious requirement but we have underrate the demand of he artist 's conscience solon call to he will not this do billy billy stop dramatically turn back upon we and then explode : -- fool would you ruin all you must not be see address I now i must disguise myself turn stealthily from we he swiftly adjust a beard that sweep its sable flow down he youthful chest then he address we again still in tense hoarse accent be you arm to the tooth answer solon with deadly grimness and with a presence of mind which i envied then follow I but at a distance meekly we obey while we hero stalk ahead stroke he luxuriant whisker ever and anon we pursue he at a interval so great that not the most alert citizen of little arcady could have suspect this sinister undercurrent to he simple life it be a long walk to the cemetery but we reach it to find billy seat on the step that lead over the fence still shield by he hairy envelope a tough case he whisper as we sit by he we man have he spy out and my every step be dog both night and day indeed we ask you know that slim little duck that get in last night purtendin ' he be a shoe-drummer well he be a detective hire by pott to shadow I you know that big fat one lettin ' on he be agent for the nonesuch duplex washin ' machine he be another you know that slick-lookin ' cuss -- like a minister -- be here all week makin ' out he be canvassin ' for ` the scenic wonder of we land ' at a dollar a part thirty-six part and a portfoly to pack 'em away in well he be a -- hold on billy let 's get down to business remind solon but i have throw 'em all off for the nonce continued billy look closely i think to see if we be rightly affect by nonce yes sir it be be the toughest darned case in my whole experience as a inside man he wait for this to move we what have you find out ask solon and say can not you take off those whisker now that we be alone and unobserved you know they kind of scramble you voice with cautious look all about he billy bare he tender young face to the night a weak wind fret in the cedar back of we and a owl hoot it be not a occasion that he would permit to glide by he too swiftly well first i have to git my skeleton key make i think you say he door be never lock interrupted solon that might be only a ruse suggest we hero well i get my key make and then i begin to search he room that be always a delicate job you get to know just how first i look under the aidge of the carpet clear around nothing reward my masterly search then i examine the bed and mattress inch by inch with the same discouragin ' result billy have now drift fairly into the exciting manner of he favorite author baffle but not beat i nex ' turn my attention to the picture examinin ' with a trained eye the back of same where might be cunningly conceal the old will -- uh -- i mean the incriminatin ' dockament that would bring the craven wretch to bay and land he safely behind the bar of jestice but it seem like i have the cunning of a fiend to contend with no objek of interest be reveal to my swift but thorough examination thence i direct my attention to the wall-paper well knowin ' the desperate trick to which the higher class of criminal will ofttimes resort to once i think the game be up and all be lose that new swede chambermaid walk right in a ' ketch I at my delicate task always retainin ' my calm presence of mind and coolness in emergency quick to think a ' as ready to act with a undaunted bravery i spring at the girl 's throat and hiss ` how much will it take to silence you accursed tongue ' she draw she slight girlish figure up to its full height -- ` ten thousand dollar ' she hiss back at I ` ten thousand devil ' i cry hoarse with rage -- too palpably we hero have be overwhelm by he passion for fictitious prose narrative hold on billy -- back up break in solon this be business you know -- this be not a old cap ' collyer tale well anyway resume billy a little abashed i silence the girl i threaten to have she transport for life if she breathe a word mebbe she do not suspect anything after all tilly be not so very bright so at length i continue my research into every nook and cranny of the den and jest as i be about to abandon the trail baffle and beat at every turn what should i git but a idee to look at some papers lyin ' in plain sight on the table at the head of the bed well out with it i think solon be grow a little impatient but billy control the situation with a firm hand it be a old trick he continue one that be fool many a better man than billy durgin -- leavin ' the dockament carelessly expose like they do not amount to anything but havin ' the well-known tenacity of a bloodhound i be not to be thwart well -- to make a long story short -- solon brighten wonderfully i have to admit that my first suspicion be incorrect he be not the one that do that lima ohio job and carry off they eight hundred dollar ' worth of stamp -- but what _ do _ he do well i get a clew to another past of he -- what be it let 's have it billy be still not to be drive faster than a detective story should move we hear and dimly see he engage with a metallic object which he draw from under he coat we be silent then we hear he say : -- my lamp 's go out -- _ darn _ these match at last he seem to light something he unfold a bit of paper before we and triumphantly across its surface he direct the ray of a bull 's - eye lantern this be he climax we study the paper billy say solon after a pause this look like a good night 's work true it may come to naught we may still be baffle foiled thwart at every turn -- and yet something tell I that the man be in we power -- that by this precious paper we may yet bring the scoundrel to he knee in prayer for we mercy craven with fear at we knowledge say say billy sting to admiration by this flow of the right sort of talk mr denney do you ever read ` little rosebud or be beauty a curse to a poor girl ' that sound just like the detective in that -- you remember -- where he be talkin ' to clarence armytage just after he be overhear the old lawyer tell mark vinton the villain ` if this child live you be a beggar ' remember that why no billy i must get that first thing in the morning my tribute to you professional skill be wholly spontaneous though perhaps a shade influence by have listen to you own graphic style but come man let we separate and be off ere we be discover and mind not a word of this one false step might ruin all so have a care it must have be one of the few perfect moment in the life of billy you may rely upon william durgin to the bitter end say he with a quiet dignity but there be work yet ahead for I to-night i get to regain my hotel unobserved my life be not safe a moment with my every step dog by the hire assassin of that infamous scoundrel if death or disaster come to you billy you shall not be unavenged we swear it here on this spot _ swear _ cal say billy call back to we after adjust he beard if anything come of this -- reward or anything -- first thing i be goin ' a ' do -- git I a good forty-four colt you can not stop a man with this here little twenty-two a ' it be only a one-shot at that i would be in a _ nice _ hole sometime would not i with my back up against a wall a ' six or seven of 'em comin ' for I a ' nothin ' but _ this _ in my jeans point that the other way billy -- we 'll see about a bigger one later we can not do anything to-night and sell you life as dearly as possible if you have to sell it i fall asleep that night on a conviction that we taste for barren reality be we chief error if we could only believe forever what a good world it could be -- a world of fine fabling indeed also i wonder what j rodney pott might have to apprehend from the leaven of fact in the fabling of billy durgin chapter ix how the boss save himself he whom they have with facetious intent call the boss of little arcady now begin to wear a mien of defiance from be confessedly distraught he display as the day go by a spiritual uplift that fall but little short of arrogance he do not permit any reason to be reveal for this marked change of demeanor he be confident but secretive serene but furtive as one who have endure gibe for the sake of one brilliant _ coup _ this apparently causeless change permeate even to the column of the _ argus _ it have be observe by more than one of we that these have of late suffer from the depression of they editor they general tone have be negative now they speak in a lightsome tone of self-sufficiency they be gay even jaunty it be in this very epoch that the verse be bear which for many year sing blithely from the top of the first column -- sing of denney 's public-spirited optimism as to slocum county and the little country keep you eye on slocum she be all right she sky be clear and full of cheer and all she prospects bright as point more specifically to the incubus of pott there be this : -- lot of people be say that we have meet we waterloo they forget that waterloo be a _ victory _ as well as a defeat two man meet it and the name of one be wellington look it up in you encyclopedia but the faction of pott it should be note see no reason to be impress by a vaunt so vague it have not temper its hopefulness its idol be jubilant careless as a schoolboy babble but sober the _ banner _ still challenge the world with its page-wide line : pott forever pott the come man certain hopeful soul among the opposition have take counsel how they might cause pott to fall by means of strong drink they have observe that the mill-race be still significantly uncovered but to all invitation all cunning incitement to indulgence pott be urbanely resistant conscious that a river of strong water ripple at he foot freely to be partake of do he choose it be true that he face show line of restraint a serene restraint like unto that which the great old painter limn so beautifully upon the face of the martyr but the martyr of old in they ecstasy be not more resolute than pott it be probable that he look forward to a period of post-election refreshment but pend the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November he determination be such that it stamp he face with something akin to dignity say westley keyt if it be rain whiskey pott would not drink as much as he could ketch on a fork and to this the town agree for once pott be firm he alpaca suit have visibly deteriorate during the campaign and he tall hat again cry for the gloss ministry of a heated iron but he virtue burgeon under stress and flower to beauty in the sight of man it be understand at last that the mill-race might as well be cover for any adventitious relation it could sustain to pott drunk westley keyt 's suggestion that pott be weight with pig-iron and dump into the healing water drunk or sober be the mere playfulness of a excellent butcher unpractised in sarcasm he offer to supply free of cost a quantity of pig-iron ample for the purpose leave this hypothesis unavoidable for westley wink flagrantly and leer when he voice it but a retribution subtler than mere drown await the superfluous pott a retribution so simple of mechanism so swift so potent and work with a talent so masterly that the right of its instigator to the title of boss of little arcady seem to be unassailable for all future time at the very zenith of he heavenward flight pott be bring low at the very nethermost point of he downward swoop solon denney be raise to a height so dizzy that even the erstwhile sceptic spirit of westley keyt abase itself before he frankly concede that diplomacy 's innocent and mush-like surface might conceal spring of a terrible potency though solon 's public mien for a week or more have be hint enough of he secret to those who know he well i be possibly the first to whom he confide it in word he send for I one crisp October morning and i rush over to the _ argus _ office know that he must have matter of importance to communicate i find he pacing the little sanctum scanning a still damp sheet of proof he brow be furrow but the line be those of conscious power in the broken chair by the litter desk sit billy durgin he eye ablaze with the lust of the chase as i push into the dingy little room solon halt in he walk and with a flourish that do not entirely lack the dramatic he hand I the narrow strip of paper the item be brief

my able and dauntless young coadjutor before whom i can see a future so brilliant that you need smoked glass to look at it very long at a time the gallant young detective turn from the window the hour have come to strike we blow he remark he brow contracting to a scowl that bode no good to a certain upright citizen of this great republic i have think it best resume solon to take pott into we confidence at precisely this stage -- give he this exclusive news one day in advance of its publication to-morrow when every one know it pott might be rash enough to stay and brave it out be advise to-day privately and thus afford a chance to fade gracefully into the great bound west he may use he common sense now then officer do you duty we hero arise from he chair button he coat pass a hand caressingly over he hip pocket take the proof from I and stalk grimly out so the lady be really come i ask as billy 's footstep die away down the wooden stair she be the lady and she little son say

may be able to do good among we and in she last letter she want to know if i have ever see a little book call ` one hundred common error in speaking and write ' she seem to have the missionary instinct as nearly as i can judge he pause in he walk and lower he voice impressively between you and I cal -- you know i have have about six letter from she -- it be just possible that pott have he reason i do not _ say _ he do mind you -- but strange thing happen in this world but that be neither here nor there he go on more lightly pott have bring it on himself in silence then we await the return of the messenger the moment be tensely electric when at last we hear the clatter of he boot on the stairway breathless he enter and stand before we he coolness for once destroy under the strain of he adventure solon help he to a chair with soothing word take it easy now billy get you breath -- there -- that be good now tell we all about it -- just what you say and just what he say and just what talk there be back and forth gosh-all-hemlock splutter billy not yet equal to he best narrative style we wait he draw a dozen long breath before he be again the cold self-possessed steely-eyed avenger well he begin brightly i gain access to we man in he wretched den on the second floor of the eubank block as good luck would have it he be alone by hisself walkin ' up and down swingin ' he arm like he be practisin ' one o ' they speech of he well i have it all fix up fine how i be goin ' to act and what i be goin ' to say to he and how i would back up a few pace against the wall and say ` not a word above a whisper or i 'll send this bullet through you craven heart ' and he would fall down on he knee and beg I in vain for mercy and so on but gee the minute i see he i get all nervous up and i jest say ` here read that there piece -- you wife 's comin ' next Thursday ' well sir at those careless word of mine he give a guilty start he face blanch with horror and he hiss through he

fearlessly ` stand back coward that you be -- make no word of outcry or it will go hard with you -- they be _ both _ comin '' i say -- ` this one 's comin ' next week and the other one 's comin ' the week after soon as she can git some sewin ' do up ' _ I _ -- i be leadin ' he on you understand -- for we have not know there be more than one well at that he read the piece over and set down in he chair with both hand up to he head and he say ` i be bein ' hound by a venal press that be what be the matter i be bein ' hound from pillar to post ' at this i break in with a sneer -- ` oh we have only just begin ' i say ` we 'll have the whole lot of 'em here inside of six week -- child and all ' ` it be a lie ' he hiss at I ` there be not any more ' ` have a care colonel pott ' i exclaimed `

for _ you _ ' at they word he craven face turn a ashen gray and he fasten upon I a glare of baffled rage that might well have make a stouter heart quail before it but i return he glare fearlessly and back swif ` ly to the door feelin ' for the knob when i find it i get quickly out without a blow bein ' strike or a shot fire then i run here early in the narrative solon have begin to beam identify readily the slender but important vertebra of fact upon which billy have organize this drama of he fancy at the close he shake hand warmly with we hero this have be a splendid day 's work william durgin and billy beam in he turn i be not goin ' to let he know we think there be only one he say precisely where you training show my boy any one could have hand pott that proof but it take you to handle the case after the scoundrel have say ` which one ' well it be pott 's move now if he do not move we 'll just add this to the item : ` mrs j rodney pott wife of colonel j rodney pott will arrive again the follow week the lady anticipate a interesting time in meet they mutual husband ' how 's that billy 's eye glisten -- he be yearning for just that situation but if pott do move add solon not a word about the second lady we will not take a mean advantage even of pott at six o'clock that evening the follow fact become know : that colonel pott have obtain a quart of whiskey from barney skeyhan that he have borrow twenty dollar from the same trustful tradesman that he cane in one hand and he oilcloth valise in the other he have walk down main street late in the afternoon and board the five twenty-eight freight go west ostensibly on a business trip into the next county not until the next morning be it know that pott have leave we forever this come from big joe kestril the two have meet at the depot and drunk fraternally from the bottle of pott discuss the thing frankly meanwhile they have hound I out of town say the colonel how say big joe they send for mr pott to come here -- it be infamous sir it appear that pott have say further : i can not understand the man of this town at all it look as if i have be trifle with much as i dislike to think so one minute they crowd letter on to I praise I up to the sky and print piece in the paper say that nothing be too good for I and my departure be a public loss and why will not i remain and be a credit to the town and a lot more like that good and strong then when i do consent to remain why what do they do do they grasp my hand and say ` ah good old pott -- stanch pott loyal pott -- good for you -- you will not desert the town ' do they talk that way no they do _ not _ instead of talk like a body would think they would talk after all those letter and thing why they turn and fling abuse at I -- and now -- now they have go and do _ this _ hellish thing i will not say a word against any man but in my opinion they be a passel of knave and lunatic look at I joe yesterday i be a make man to-day i be all ruin up i merely state fact and let you draw you own conclusion the conclusion which big joe draw such as they be he be unable to communicate intelligibly until the morrow for the train be late and they drink of the liquor until the colonel have time to lament he improvidence in bring away so little of it and by the time big joe 's report be abroad both the _ banner _ and the _ argus _ be out the item in the latter concern mr pott have be only a little altered mr j rodney pott wife of colonel j rodney pott until yesterday a resident of this town will arrive here next Thursday from boston massachusett to make she home among we she be a estimable and culture lady and we bespeak for she a warm welcome to this garden-spot of the mid-west across the top of the _ banner 's _ first page be its campaign slogan as usual : -- pott forever pott the come man across the top of the _ argus _ in similar type run the pregnant line : -- pott forever but mayne for county judge the trouble with the come man be that he be go chapter x a lady of power superficially and distantly consider the woman from whom even j rodney pott must flee in terror would not be of a sort to excite the imagination pleasurably a less impulsive man than solon denney might have find cause for misgive in this circumstance of pott 's prompt exodus in the immediate flush of he triumph however the editor of the _ argus _ have no leisure for negative reflection and when misgive do at last find root in he mind the time have come for he to receive the lady but solon denney be not the man to betray it if a doubt heart beat within he breast to the town that now lavish admiration upon he dub he boss without ulterior implication he be confidence itself and rife with prophecy of benefit to be derive by we public from the advent of mr aurelia pott with a gallant show of anticipation a sprig of geranium in he lapel he set out for the train on that fateful morning while little arcady await he return with a cordial curiosity it be a gray day of damp air and a dull thick sky bear down upon the earth -- a day conducive to foreboding but solon denney 's spirit to the best of little arcady 's belief soar aloft to realm of pure sunlight my knowledge of subsequent event that day be gain partly by word of mouth and partly by observation which i be permit to make to the hotel solon conduct he charge hand they from the ` bus with a flourish that seem to confer upon they the freedom of the city from shop door and adjacent street corner the most curious among we behold a tall full-figured woman of majestic carriage with a high noble forehead and a face that seem to register trace of some thirty-five earnest but not unprofitable year even in the quick glance she bestow up and down washington street before the hotel swallow she up she quality be to be note by the discerning -- the quality of a commander of one bear to prevail the flash of she gray-green eye be interested but unconcerned complement by the marked auburn of she plenteous hair the eye be masterful advertising most legibly the temperament of a capable ruler the subdue white-faced boy of twelve with hair like he mother 's who trot closely at she heel be for the moment a negligible factor a hour later i enter the sanctum of the _ argus _ to find its owner alone before he litter table upon he usually careless face be the most profoundly thoughtful look i have ever know he wear open before he be that week 's _ argus _ but he eye narrow to its neat column only at interval for the most part he gaze plunge far into virgin realm of meditation it be only after several remind cough that i succeed in recall he from afield and even then the deeply thoughtful look remain to estrange he face from I say cal do you believe in _ power _ what kind of power well i do not know -- every kind -- just _ power _ -- mystic occult power i do not care to commit myself without more detail i answer with a caution that seem to be need well sir that woman have 'em -- she have _ power _ -- she certainly have there be something in she eye that paralyze the will you look at she and you say yes to anything she suggest for example -- well i have just agree with she that the _ argus _ be not what it ought to be i gasp this indeed savor of the blackest magic what do she _ do _ to you just look at I that be all -- and take it for grant heaven you be shiver you _ wait _ -- wait till she talk to you she be promise to give I a little book he go on dejectedly ` one hundred common error in write and speak ' and she say the split infinitive be a crime in this nineteenth century but say this paper would never get to press if i take time to unsplit all my infinitive well put billy durgin to work on she case right away i say to cheer he if the woman talk like that i 'll bet billy can find some good reason why she ought to push on after the colonel again he deeply thoughtful gaze bear upon I i be puzzle he say -- honestly puzzle i do not know whether she 'll be good for this town or not she may in a way -- and in a way she may not she will be disturbing -- i can see that already -- but she be stimulate she may stir we up to nobler endeavor do she say so well -- uh -- something of the sort i believe that _ be _ the expression she use i 'll tell you what you do you come along with I and see the lady right now they have have dinner by this time together we go and be presently climb the stair that lead to the second floor of the city hotel mr pott receive we graciously upon I she bestow a glance of friendly curiosity as do a kind physician who wait to be tell of symptom before prescribe upon solon she bent a more know look as upon one whose frailty have already be reveal she give we chair and she talk little roscoe pott writhe near by upon a ottoman and betray that he too could talk when circumstance be kindly the detail of they personality salient in that first moment be that heaven have deny they both the gift of reticence yes -- i have be tell mr denney -- i feel that there be a work here for I she begin briskly i feel it strongly when i peruse the column of the newspaper which mr denney be thoughtful enough to send I solon 's eye uneasily seek the cabbage-like flower in the fade carpet of the room and i feel it more strongly now that i have venture among you continue the lady glowing upon we both i have long suspect that it be a regrettable waste of energy to send missionary into heathen part of the globe when there remain so many unenlightened corner in we own land it almost seem now as if i have be guide here it be true that my husband have go but that shall not distress I rodney be a drifter -- i may say a natural-born drifter and i can not undertake to follow he i shall remain here i have be guide -- determination gleam in she gray-green eye -- i shall remain here and teach these poor people to make something of themselves solon draw a long breath my own echo it hereupon little roscoe break into a high-pitched recitative we be now in the great boundless west a land of rough but kind-hearted and worthy folk and abound with instructive sight and scene which be well calculate -- my son interrupt he mother kindly tell the gentleman what should be you aim in life to strive to improve my natural gift by reading and conversation answer roscoe in one swift breath very good -- _ ver-ry _ good -- but for the present you may _ listen _ now mr denney -- she turn to solon with the latest _ argus _ in she hand -- peruse you sheet my eye light upon this sentence : -- ` lige brackett sunday in we midst he report a busy time of fall ploughing over bethel way ' why ` sunday ' mr denney she smile brightly almost archly at solon i dare say you would not employ ` monday ' or ` tuesday ' or ` wednesday ' you _ see _ the term be what we may call a vulgarism -- you perceive that do you not -- likewise ` in we midst ' which be not accurate of course and which would be indelicate if it be now i let my eye descend the column to you account of a certain social function you say ` the table fairly groan with the weight of good thing and a good time be have by all present ' surely mr denney you be a man not without culture and refinement have you but take thought you could as well have say that ` a elegant collation be serve the menu include many choice delicacy and the affair be widely pronounced to be most enjoyable ' solon 's frightened eye beseech I but i could not help he and again he be force to meet the kindly almost whimsically accuse gaze of the censor who be by no mean do with he again i read here ` the graveyard fence need repair badly ' do you not see mr denney how far more refine it be to say ` god 's acre ' or ` the marbled city of the dead ' i now turn from mere solecism to the broader question of taste under the head ` hang in carroll county ' i read a item begin ` at eight-thirty be last Friday the soul of martin g buckley dress in a neat-fitting suit of black with a low collar and black cravat be usher into the presence of he god ' pardon I but do we not find here if we read closely a attempt to blend the material with the spiritual with a result that we can only designate as infelicitous solon be writhe after the manner of uneasy little roscoe the bland but inexorable regard of he inquisitor have subdue he beyond retort i might again call you attention to this item and she do read with well-trained inflection : -- ` kye mayabb from south of town and sym pleydell who rent the clemison farm meet up in front of barney skeyhan 's place last Saturday afternoon and start to settle a old grudge while they respective better half look on from across the street kye have sym down and be do some good work with he right when he wife call to he now kye mayabb you come right away from there before you get into trouble whereupon the valiant better half of he who be be beat to death call out cheerily do not let he scare you sym the boy make it up afterward but we little street be quite lively for a time ' now as to that go on mr pott affect to deliberate could we not better have describe that as ' a disgraceful street brawl ' and yet i find no word of deprecation it be tell indeed with a regrettable flippancy flippancy i may note again mar the follow item : ` they tell a good story of old sarsius lambert over at bethel he wife be drown a couple of week ago and link talbot go to break the news to the old man uncle sarsh say link you wife be drown she fall in at the ford and a hour later they find she two mile down-stream two mile a hour say uncle sarsius in astonishment well well she float down quite lively do not she ' you will pardon I i trust say mr pott if i say it would have be better to speak of the grief-stricken husband and to conclude with a fitting sentiment such as ` the proudest monument to the sleep dead be rear in the heart of the living ' i 'll put it in next week venture solon meekly i do not think of it at the time ah but one should _ always think _ should one not ask mrs potts almost sweetly by think for example you could elevate you sheet by eliminate certain misapply colloquialism here i read : ` the rain last week leave the street in a frightful state the mud simply will not jell ' shame mantle the brow of solon denney in short conclude mr pott i regret to say that you paper be not yet one that i could wish to put into the hand of my little roscoe little roscoe cough sympathetically and remark before he lose he chance for a word : the boy of to-day be the man of to-morrow parent can not be too careful about what they little one will read during the long winter evening that will soon be upon we he cough again when he have finish the press be a mighty lever of civilization continue the mother with a approve glance at she boy and you mr denney should feel proud indeed of you sacred mission to instruct and elevate these poor people of course i shall have other duty to occupy my time -- solon have glance up brightly but gloom again overspread he face as she continue : -- yet i shall make it not the least of my work -- if a poor weak woman may so presume -- to help you in correct certain fault of style and taste in you sheet for it go each week into many home where the light must be sorely need and surely you and i would not be adequately sensible of we responsibility if we continue to let it go as it be _ would _ we and again she glow upon solon with the condescending sweetness of a sabbath-school teacher to the littlest boy in she class but now we both breathe more freely for she allow the wretched _ argus _ to drop from she disapproving finger and begin to ask we question as to a place of worship a house suitable for residence purpose a school for little roscoe and the nature of those club or society for mental improvement that might exist among we and she ask about family we be oblige to confess that there be no family in little arcady in the true sense of the term though we do not divine its true sense until she favor we with the detail that she second cousin have marry a relative of the adam family we say honestly that we be devoid of family in that sense none of we have ever be able to marry a adam no adam with a consent mind -- not even a partial adam -- have ever come among we still mr pott wear she distinction gracefully and be even a little apologetic in boston you know we rather like to know ` who be who ' as the say be out here say solon we like to know what be what he have revive wonderfully after he beloved _ argus _ be drop but at he retort the lady merely elevate she rather fine brow and remark really mr denney you speak much as you write -- you must not let I forget to give you that little book i speak of as we go down the stair solon place one hundred common error in speaking and write close under he arm adroitly shield the title from public scrutiny we stand a moment in the autumn silence outside the hotel door watch a maple across the street the line of its bough show strong and black amid its airy yellow plumage the still air be full of leaf that sail to earth in leisurely sadness we be both thoughtful mr pott be a very alert and capable woman i say at last have decide that this would be the most suitable thing to say i tell you she have _ power _ say solon in a tone almost of awe she will teach you to make something of yourself i hazard one minute she make I want to fight and the next i surrender he answer pathetically we separate on this solon go toward the _ argus _ office with slow step and bow head while i go thoughtfully abroad to ease my nerve by watch the splendid death of summer above the hill now royally color as by great rug of brown and crimson velvet fling over they flank i seem to hear the echo of ironic laughter -- the laughter of perverse god who have choose to avenge the slight put upon a inferior pott chapter xi how little arcady be uplift the winter that follow prove to be a season of unrest for we town mr aurelia pott be a leaven of yeast that ferment its social water erstwhile calm not to say stagnant early in November a evening affair be hold in she honor at the eubank home the eubanks be we lead presbyterian and mr pott have ally herself with that church it be feel that they be best fit to give the lady she initial impression of little arcady 's society not only be the three eubank girl talent but the mother be a social leader eustace be travel have be one of a excursion party to the holy land and the family have relative live in philadelphium none of the girl have marry nor have eustace the girl it be say have not wish to marry eustace have earnestly wish to it be know but two of we young woman who have successively find favor in he sight have fail to please he mother and sister and eustace be say to be watch and wait for one upon whom all could agree though every one but eustace himself know this be a utterly hopeless vigil meantime the mother and sister look up to he guard he jealously from corrupt association see that he wear he overshoe when cloud lower and knit he chest protector glove and pulse warmer which he be not allow to forget he teach the bible class in the presbyterian sabbath school sing bass in the choir and on occasion give a excellent entertainment with he magic lantern with view of the holy land which he explain with a run fire of comment both instructive and entertaining the eubank home that evening be say by a subsequent _ argus _ to have be ablaze with light and its handsome and spacious parlor throng with the elite of the town who have gather to do honor to the note guest of the evening there first occur a piano duet render expertly by the two younger miss eubank listen to the mock bird with some bewildering variation of a imitative value do by the miss eubank seat at the right then the front parlor be darken and after the consequent tittering among the younger set have die away eustace throw he picture upon a hang sheet and deliver he agreeable lecture about they begin with the exciting trip from jaffa to jerusalem most of those present have enjoy the privilege of this lecture enough time to know what picture be come next and what eustace would say about it but it be think graceful now consider the presence of a stranger to simulate the expectancy of the uninformed and to emit little gasp of astonished delight when eustace would say pass from the city gate we next come upon a view that be well worthy a moment of we attention with the light up again a small flask of water from the river jordan be hand about to be examine by those who know it too well in the same loyal spirit of curiosity a guest would hold it reverently a moment then glance up in search of some one to whom it might be heartily extend this over the elder miss eubank -- marcellum of the severe mien -- sing interestingly i gather shell upon the shore and for a encore in response to eager demand comin ' thro ' the rye not coyly do she give this with incite blush implication but rather with a unbending disapproving sternness as if with intent to divert the mind of she listener from the song 's frank ribaldry to its purely musical value eustace follow with a solo : -- nigh to a grave that be newly make lean a sexton old on he earth-worn spade in the very low part where the sexton old be require to say i gather they in he be most effective and many of he more susceptible hearer shudder for a encore he sing i be the old turnkey which go lower and lower with deliberate step until it descend to incredible depths of bassness it be a rare comfort to the eubank lady that eustace be a bass instead of a tenor they have observe that most tenor song be of a suggestive and meretricious character arthur updyke for example who clerk in the city drug store be a tenor and nearly all of he song be distressingly sentimental indeed fairly indelicate at time in they lack of reserve about kiss and embrace and sigh and ecstasy glad indeed be the guardian of eustace that he voice have lower to a salutary depth and that bass song in general be pure and innocent -- song of death of dungeon of honest war or of diving beneath the deep blue sea -- down down down as far as the singer 's chest tone permit with euty a tenor warble those pernicious boudoir _ chanson _ of moonlight and longing of sigh love and anguished passion they suspect that he would have be harder to manage even as it be he have once bring home a most dreadful thing call a bedouin love song for a bass voice truly enough but so fearfully outspoken about matter far better left unmentioned among nice people that the three girl have flee horrify from the room after that first verse : -- from the desert i come to thee on a stallion shod with fire and the wind be leave behind in the speed of my desire the mother speed to she daughter ' appeal for help and require she son to sing the lose chord as a febrifuge the other song be confiscate after the mother have read the word so unblushingly pen by a author whom she ever afterward deem a abandon profligate she consider that bedouin must be unspeakable creature -- but how much lower the mind that could portray they depravity and send it out into the world for innocent young man to carol in the home of we best people thereafter eustace sing only song that have be censor by he family and he repertoire be now stainless contain no song in which a romantic attachment be even hint at but only those recite wholesome adventure military and marine pastoral scene and occupation or the religious experience of the singer in the word of the _ argus _ he powerful singing be highly enjoy by all present there follow the feature of the evening -- a paper read by mr pott subject the message of emerson with a agreeable public manner the lady erect herself at one corner of a square piano place she manuscript under the shaded lamp and begin the subject aforetime make know among we have be talk about and perhaps a little wonder at it be certain at least that westley keyt have yield to the urge of he good wife to be present in the belief that a man name emerson have send mr pott a telegram to be read to we this be what the message of emerson mean to westley and the novelty of it have seem to justify what he call tog up after a hard day 's work at the slaughter-house if then he listen to mr pott at first with wonder-widening eye amaze at mr emerson 's recklessness in the matter of telegram and if at last he fall into gentle slumber perhaps it be only that he have be less hardened than other present to the rigor of social nicety no one else fall asleep but it be notice that the guest when the paper be do praise it to one another in swift generality and with avert face as if they seek to evade specific or pointed inquiry as to its import but the impression make by the reader be all that she could have wish and the gathering be presently engross with refreshment the _ argus _ state that a dainty collation be serve to all present the menu comprise the choicest delicacy of the season which i take to mean that solon be try to profit by instruction and that never again would he permit a table in the _ argus _ to groan with its weight of good thing westley keyt be skilfully awaken without scandal by he wife drink a cup of strong coffee to clear he brain and cordially consume as many segment of cake as he be able to glean from pass tray speculate comfortably meanwhile about the message of emerson -- chiefly as to why emerson have not send it by mail thus save -- he estimate -- at least a hundred and twenty dollar in telegraph toll mr pott thus auspiciously launch upon the social sea of little arcady be henceforth to occupy herself prominently with the regulation of its ebb and flow already she have organize a lady ' literary and home study club and have promise to read a paper on the lesson of greek art at its first meeting a week hence as the _ argus _ observe it be certainly a gala occasion and one and all feel that it be indeed good to be there in addition to elevate the tone of we intellectual life however mr pott find it necessary to support herself and she son that she could devise a way to merge these important duty will perhaps be surmise comfortably install in a cottage at the south end of town with she household belongings include a chair once sit in by the adams-husband of she heaven-favored second cousin she lose no time in prosecute she double mission the title of the work with which she begin she task of uplift we mass be gaskell 's compendium of form a meritorious production of amazing and quite infinite

truman seek to copy these attitude to place the foot aright for earnest appeal or bold assertion or to clasp the hand as direct for supplication and earnest entreaty the lady of the literary and home

quarrel with he master dismiss a teacher inquiry for lose baggage with a basket of fruit to a invalid and to a gentleman elect to congress rare indeed in we earth life would be the crisis unmet by this treasury of knowledge not only be there a elevation of tone in we correspondence that winter result from the persuasive activity of mr pott but we write become decorative with flourish in the muscular and whole-arm movement we learn to draw fly bird and bound deer and float swan with scroll in they beak all without lift pen from paper some of we learn to do it almost as well as the accomplished mr gaskell himself and almost all of we show marked improvement in penmanship doubtless truman baird do not he be engross with oratory strive to reproduce hate -- the right foot advance the face turn to the sky the gaze direct upward with a fierce expression the eye full of a baleful light or other phase of passion duly set down not for truman be the ornate full-arm flourish he have observe that all congressman write very badly but my namesake may be say to have lay the foundation that winter for a excellent run chirography under the combined stimulus of mr gaskell 's curve and a hopeless passion for he school-teacher as my own teacher have be my own first love i know all that he suffer in voiceless longing for he fair one throned afar in he languish gaze i know that he pluck flower mean to be give to she only to lay they carelessly on the floor beside he seat when school take in lack the courage to bestow they brazenly upon he idol as other do i know too he thrill when she come straight down the aisle take up the flower with a glance of sweet reproof for he and nested they in the largest vase on she desk but my poor affair have be in a earlier day and my namesake weave novelty into the woof of he for in that wonder-book of the fertile-minded gaskell be a form of letter which calvin blake denney begin to copy early in December and which by the follow spring he could write in a style that already put my own poor penning to the blush do he write it a hundred time or five hundred move anew each time by its sweet potency its rarest of suggestion i know not but it must have be very many time for i would find the copy in he school book grow in beauty of flourish day by day as well as if he have confess it i know that this letter be intend for the father of he love -- for old sam murdock to be literal who uncouthly perform for we the office of drayman but who in my namesake 's eye shine pure and splendid for he relationship doubtless the letter be never send but i be sure it be write each time with a iron resolve to send it its title in the excellent book be from a lover to a father on he attachment to the daughter and it run : -- = dear sir : as i scorn to act in any manner that may bring reproach upon myself and family and hold clandestine proceedings unbecome in any man of character i take the liberty of distinctly avow my love for you daughter and humbly request you permission to pay she my address as i flatter myself my family and expectancy will be find not unworthy of you notice i have some reason to imagine that i be not altogether disagreeable to you daughter but i assure you that i have not as yet endeavor to win she affection for fear it might be repugnant to a father 's will i be etc = under this be provide a favorable answer in which sam murdock might have say that he have long perceive this thing and applaud it and would the young man dine with we to-morrow at six if you be not engage and you will then have a opportunity to plead you own cause but chillingly after this graceful assent follow a unfavorable answer which sam murdock would also see when he open the book at page 251 and still more portentously on the same page be a letter which miss selina murdock herself might choose to write he a sickening and dreadful thing entitle unfavorable reply on the ground of poverty to say that i do not feel pleased and flattered at you proposal would be to tell a useless untruth the thing begin speciously but how be we situate what hope of happiness with we unsettled prospects and worse than small means industry have doubtless never be and never will be want on you part but -- and so to its dreadful end it be almost base in its coldness and mercenary calculation that phrase about the useless untruth imply even a dubious and consider morality and the conclusion we must not entail misery upon other as well as ourselves by a too hasty step argue a nature cautious in the extreme yet mr gaskell be too evidently a man of the world know in he ripe experience that there exist a sufficient number of such cold nature to warrant the obtrusion of this heart-rending formulum and i doubt not that these negative specimen of the possible alone restrained my namesake from go beyond mere copy of that first letter it will be see that the influence of mr pott pervade we utmost social and commercial limit and when the compendium have become a centre-table ornament in the home of the rich and a bulky object of awe in humbler abode she go over the ground again with other volume calculate to serve she double purpose from dr chase 's receipt book to picturesque italy profusely illustrate she also purvey a line of art-piece include wide awake and fast asleep the monarch of the glen woman gathering fagot and retreat from moscow also little roscoe out of school hour take subscription for the _ youth 's companion _ yet the town long bear it with a gentle fortitude i believe it be not until the follow spring that murmur be really noticeable naturally they be direct against solon denney by that time westley keyt be greet solon morosely though without open cavil but asa bundy no longer hesitate to speak out he quote scripture to solon about the house that be sweep and garnish and the seven other wicked spirit that enter it make its last state worse than its first and of course solon be much trouble by this though he never fail to rally to the support of the lady thus malign dwelling upon the advantage she mere presence must always be to the town if she would only let it go at that -- ` she mere presence ' -- rejoin bundy but solon protest defend the lady 's activity he become sensitive to any mention of she name and fall to brooding he believe she to be a model woman and little roscoe to be a model boy why do not you try to be more like roscoe pott i hear he ask he son in a moment of reproof my namesake take it meekly but to I privately he say : -- hunh i can lick ginger pott with one hand tie behind I how do you know i ask sternly he wriggle somewhat at this but at length confide in I well there be a sell you know uncle maje you say ` they be goin ' to tear the schoolhouse down ' or something like that and the other boy say ` what fur ' and then you say quick as you can ` cat-fur to make kitten britch of ' and then we all laugh and yell and i catch ginger pott on it and he get mad when we yell and come at I and they push he against I and they push I against he and they say he dassent and they say i dassent and then it happen only when i get he down he begin to say ` oh it be wrong to fight i promise my mother i would never fight ' but i would not ` a ' stop for _ that _ because teacher say he be by far the brightest boy in school -- only just then eustace eubank come along and he lay down the meat he be take home to dinner and jump into the crowd and say : ` boy boy shame on you to act so like the brute _ that _ be not any way to act ' and he pull I off 'n ginger and -- and that be all but i have he lick fair i shall not tell you father of this i say sternly he have enough to worry he say my namesake exactly i say but i advise you to cultivate a friendly feeling for roscoe pott boy should not fight well -- now -- i would -- but he be a regular teacher 's pet and remember the letter that be not send to sam murdock -- that the teacher be my namesake 's love -- i perceive that this breach be not to be heal chapter xii trouble water be still it be spring again a Sunday in early may warm humid scented with blossom that be body soul of the laughing air they star the bank that fall away from my porch to the clear-watered river and they sing of the young spirit that live in this old earth so deceptively deface it with false scar of age and craftily permit we to count year by the thousand yet remain always as fresh in itself as on the primal morning when the world be find good by that ill-fated but joyous first pair of lover i marvel that so many be fool by the trick how so few of we detect that the soul of it all be ageless -- have never even weary the blossom tell this secret now in quiet triumph over the denial of ancient oak that tower above they and murmur solemn falsity in they top about the incredible oldness of thing there be the star-shaped bloodroot with its ten or a dozen petal of waxen white set with jewel-like precision about a center of dead gold there be the less formal phlox of a pinkish purple deer 's - tongue white and yellow frail anemone both pink and white small but stately violet and the wake-robin with its wine-red center among long green leaf there be a dogwood in the act of unfold its little green tent that would presently be snow-white and a plum tree ruffle with tiny flower of a honied fragrance with a fine japanese restraint clem have place a single bough of these in a dull-colored vase on my out-of-doors breakfast table all these be to say that the soul of the world be ageless and that time be but a cheap device to measure we infirmity above the tree be hint that life might still be live acceptably as in eden day though they seem to suspect that the stage of it to which they be amazedly awaken must be at least the autumn and timidly clothe themselves accordingly the elm the first big tree to stir in its sleep show tiny curl leaflet of a doubt yellowish green and the later move oak be frankly sceptical one glowing faintly brown and crimson another silvery gray and pink they would need at least ten more day to convince they into downright summer greenery even though slender-throated dove already mate in they top with a perfect confidence it be a early morning hour when it be easy to believe in the perfect fitness of little arcady 's name a hour in a time when the potts-troubled water have be mercifully still by the hand of god a hour when the spirit of each little arcadian might share to its own fulness in the large serenity of the ageless world-soul i recall mr pott 's paper on the lesson of greek art which have enrich two column of the _ argus _ after its reading to the lady of the literary and home study club it seem to I that the greek must have divine this important secret of the vegetable world -- the secret of ageless time -- and that therein lay the charm of they that spirit of ever freshen joy which they chisel and sing into tangible grace for we of a later and heavier age at the moment i be on the porch wait for my coffee and my thought seem to be share by jim my bony young setter who be but a scant year old have not yet forget the lesson of greek art over the grassy stretch before the porch he chase robin tirelessly though with indifferent success he be a spirit truly greek i know it by reason of he inexhaustible enthusiasm for this present sport after a year 's prove that chase bird will rise strangely but expertly into air that no dog can climb by any device of whine leap or strain living on into the renaissance i see that jim would be teach the grievous thing call wisdom -- would learn he limitation and to form habit tamely contrary to he natural greek liking then would he honorably neglect rabbit and all fur cease point drove of pig and quit the silly chase of robin under check-cord and spike-collar he would become a fast and stylish dog clean-cut in he bird work perhaps a field-trial winner he would learn to take reproof amiably to heel at a word to respect the whistle at any distance to be steady to shot and wing to retrieve promptly from land or water and never to bolt or range beyond control or be guilty of false point i know that coercion steadily and tactfully apply would thus educate he for be he not of champion ancestry wear he pedigree in he look with the narrow shoulder so desirable and so rarely find with just the right number of hair at the end of he tail the foreleg properly feathered the foot and ankle strong the right amount of leather in he ear to the fraction of a inch -- a dog in short of beauty style speed nose and brain but in this full moment of a glad morning i resolve that jim should never know the renaissance he should never emerge from what mr pott have gracefully describe as the golden age of pericle to the end of he day he should be blithely navely greek a dog of wretched field manners point cattle and quail impartially shamefully gun-shy inconsequent volatile ignorant forever paganly joyous without due cause for he i should do what no one have be able to do for I -- detain he in that world of fine fabling where everything be true that ought to be where the earth be a run course fascinating in its surprise of open road and tangled hedgerow where mere indiscriminate smell be keenest ecstasy and where the fact that robin have elude one 's fleetest rush to-day by a amazing and unfair trick of levitation be not the slightest promise that they can escape we interested mouthing on the morrow doubtless he would be a remarkably foolish dog in he old age but i grow old beside he would learn wisely foolish thing from he excellent folly i know we should both be happier for it know it be best for we both to prove that my thin white friend have be bear chiefly to display the acute elegance of he bone and the beauty of hopeful effort it be this last that keep he thin when i take to the road he travel five mile to my every one circle I widely range far over the hill in mad dash or run straight and swiftly on the road vanish in a white fog of dust walk slowly to avoid this i would only meet he emerge from a fresh cloud of it with a glad tongue throw out to the breeze again there be desperate plunge into wayside underbrush or down steep ravine whence i would hear rapid splash through a hidden stream and short plaintive cry to tell that that wonderful unseen wood-presence of a thousand provoke scent have once more cunningly evade he also do he love to swim stoutly across a field of grow wheat he head alone show above the green wave and if the wheat be tall he still brave it -- lose to sight at the bottom then one might observe the mystery of a furrow plough itself swiftly across the billow without visible agency when i do not walk to give countenance to he run he have a game of he own he play it with a ancient fur cap that he keep conveniently store the cap represent a prey of considerable dignity which must be spring upon and shake again and again until it be finally disabled then it be to be seize by implacable jaw and swiftly run with about the yard in a feverish pretence that enemy wish to ravish it from its captor any chance observer be implore to humor this pretence and upon he compliance he be flee from madly or perhaps turn upon and growl at most directly if he show sign of lose interest in the game this ceaseless motion with its attendant nervous strain have prevent any accumulation of flesh and explain the name of slim jim affix to he by my namesake jim consent now to rest for a moment at my foot though at a loss to know how i could be calm amid so many exciting smell i promise he as he lay there that he should never be compel to learn any but the fewest fact necessary to make he as harmless as he be happy chiefly not to bark at old lady and baby no matter how threaten they aspect as they pass we house a few thing he have already learn -- to avoid fence of the barb wire to respect the big cat from across the way who sometimes call and treat he with watchful disdain and not to chew a baby robin if by any chance he catch one this last have be a hard lesson he first contact with a problem only a few day younger than eden itself it come to he understand however that if you mouth a helpless baby robin a hand or a stick fall upon you hurtfully even if you evade it for the moment and seclude yourself under a porch until it would seem that so trifling a occurrence must have be utterly forget this be the one big sin -- sin to the best of we knowledge be obedience to any natural desire the satisfaction of which be unaccountably follow by pain i tell he this would probably be all that he need ever know and he look up at I in a fashion he have the silky brown ear fall either side of the white face it be a look of languish melting adoration and if i face he steadily he must always turn away as if to avoid be overcome -- as if the sight of beauty so great as mine could be bear full in the eye only for the briefest of moment but clem come now range my breakfast dish about the bowl of plum flower and i approach the table with all the ardor he could have wish at he softly speak yo ' be suhved mahstah majah the sight of clem however inevitably suggest the person to whom i be indebted for he sustain ministration pott have be a necessary instrument in one of those complication which the god devise among we human ephemera for they mild amusement on a day of _ ennui _ and pott have serve he purpose have be neatly remove i have say that the potts-troubled water of little arcady be for the moment still by the hand of the god have they be mercifully still so that not for a month have any citizen be ask to subscribe for any improve book or patented device of culture a month before in a far-off place j rodney pott have suffer extinction through the apparently casual agency of a move railway train the intervention of the god in all such matter be discreetly veil so that the denser of we shall suspect nothing but that they be the merest of accident one could only surmise that the widow view this happen with a kind of trustful resignation sweeten perhaps by certain ancient memory attuned to a gentle melancholy i know that she place on view in she parlor for the first time a crayon portrait of pott in he early manhood one make ere life have break so many of its promise to he the portrait of one who might conceivably have enchain the fancy of even a superior woman but the widow be not publicly anguished she don a gown and bonnet of black in testimony of she bereavement but there be no unnecessary flaunt of crape in she decently symbolic garb as aunt delium mccormick phrase it she be not in heavy mourning -- merely in light distress the town be content to let it go at that especially after the adjustment of certain formality which enable the widow for a time to suspend she work of minister to its higher want the railway company have at first it appear be dispose to view its removal of pott very lightly indeed not only because of he unimposing appearance but by reason of he well-attested mental condition at the time of the occurrence -- a condition clearly self-induced and one that place he beyond those measure of safety which a common carrier be oblige to exercise in behalf of its patron but a package of letter have be discover among the meager belongings of the unfortunate man and these have place the matter in a very different light they show conclusively that the victim have be of importance a citizen of rare value in any community that he might choose to favor with he presence truman baird settle the case and after these letter have be appraise by the corporation 's attorney he succeed in extort the sum of eight hundred dollar from the railway as recompense to the widow for the loss of she husband 's service i consider that the company would have give up at least five hundred more to avoid be sue for the death of a man who have be able to evoke those letter but i do not say so for the case be truman 's and eight hundred dollar be many westley keyt think they be indeed a great many and outrageously excessive as a cold money valuation of pott she only get eight hundred dollar but there be they that think she skin the company at _ that _ say westley but there be no disposition to begrudge the widow a single dollar of this modest sum a jury of little arcadian would have multiply it tenfold without a blush for while that little hoard endure any citizen however public spirited could flavor with a certain grace he refusal to subscribe for a book to solon denney the thing come as a deep and divine relief in the satisfaction induce by it he pen a obituary of pott in which he employ the phrase grim messenger of death very cleverly indeed for matter have be go from bad to worse murmur at the demand of mr pott -- liken by asa bundy to a daughter of the horse leech -- have become passionately loud as we mass toil expensively up that potts-defined path of enlightenment the old sneer at solon 's boss-ship be again to be observe on every hand that attitude of doubt ridicule half-playful half-contemptuous which you public man find more dangerous to he influence than downright hostility would be but the murmur be again still and solon might breathe the peace of a golden age when as yet no pott male or female have come unto we it be not feel at all that solon 's genius for the discretion of public affair have avail he in this latest crisis but the benefit be substantial none the less and the column of the _ argus _ be again buoyant as of yore it be at this time i remember that the _ argus _ first speak of we town as a gem at beauty 's throat and touch the rare enterprise of we citizen declare that if you put a slocum county man astride a streak of lightning he would call for a pair of spur for myself i frankly mourn pott for i saw now that he have be truly and finely of that greek spirit -- one accept gift from the god with a joyous young faith in they continuance i feel that he have divine more of the lesson of greek art than he one-time love could write down in papers unending i should not have wish he back in little arcady but i do breathe a prayer that he might in some early greek elysium be indeed pott forever might it not be have not that other paper on the message of emerson hint of compensation in a jargon that sound authoritative and now as i breakfasted my attention be invite anew to that fateful never end extension of the potts-made ripple in we little pool i be threaten with the loss of my domestic stay again might i be force to the city hotel 's refectory of a thousand blended smell and spotty table-linen or even to irksome adventure at the board of the self-lauded budd there be selfish wonder in my heart as i listen to clem who now that my second cup of coffee compete with the may blossom stand by to tell I of he worldly advancement and the near of a time when miss caroline should come among we to be independent he stubborn industry have count the vegetable and melon crop of the year before have be abundant and well sell despite sundry raid upon the latter by nameless boy who he assure I hai not have no raght raisin ' and he have further swell that hoard of reglah gole money in bundy 's bank by he performance of house-cleaning catering and he work as janitor not a little too by sale of the fish he catch he be believe to possess a secret charm that make he fish-bait irresistible certainly he fortune in this matter be superior to that of any other frequenter of the bass nook below the dam and now he have wax so heavy of purse that a woman could come between we -- a selfish woman i make no doubt pampered survival of a pernicious and now happily destroy system who would not only unsettle my domestic tranquillity but would in all likelihood fetch another alien ferment into we already sorely try existence as a town need elevation it seem indeed that we be never to be do with these consequence separate from my house by a stretch of weedy lawn be a shambling structure build year before by one azariah prouse who believe among other strange matter that the earth be flat and that house be build higher than one story only at great peril because of the earth 's proneness to tip if overbalanced prouse have compromise with this belief however and make he house a story and a half high in what i conceive to have be a dare-devil spirit the reckless upper room be thus cut off untimely by ceiling of sudden slope and might not be walk in uprightly save by person of a inconsiderable stature in a fulness of year azariah have die and be chest like joseph of old he soul to be gather as he believe to another horizontal plane exalt far above this as would befit a abode for spirit of the depart good he earthly home now long vacant have be rent by clem for a

little miss be sweetah 'n honey on a rag they would find we summer acceptable even after a southern summer heavy-sweet with magnolia and jasmine honeysuckle and mimosa with spirea and bridal-wreath and white-blossomed sloe tree and the house as put to rights by clem would be find at least endurable it have not the solid grace nor the columned front of the house i have somewhat hurriedly admire in the southland some year before but its lower room be wide its window abundant and outwardly it have escape the blight of the scroll saw but the civilization of little arcady would be alien to the newcomer and i be apprehensive that it would also be difficult further i suspect that jrc tuckerman with all he genius for hard work lack the administrative gift of a true financier he say a hundred thousand pullet when he should have say twenty-five and he seem to consider he banked hoard of gold money to be inexhaustible when it be in fact merely a sum slightly greater than he be wont to juggle

could unpack the stuff be it unpile at he door and it be poor stuff moreover in the opinion of little arcady clem 's history be know of course and during these busy day the town make it a point to pass he door in friendly curiosity about the belongings of he mistress when these could not be satisfactorily appraise from the yard they saunter up to the porch and survey clem in the front room at he work of unpack and clean often indeed some kindly disposed observer with time to spare would lend a hand in free some heavy bit of mahogany from its crate or wrapping the public opinion thus advantageously form be for once unanimous the house overflow with worthless and unbeautiful junk to little arcady this be a grievous disappointment it have expect elegance for clem have be wont to enlarge upon the splendor of he former home when it be finally know that the long-vaunted furnishings be come the town have prepare to be dazzle by set of black walnut ornate with gilt line by patent rocker do in plush by fashionable sofa gay with upholstery of flowered ingrain by bedroom set of ash stencil adroitly with pink-and-blue flower or set with veneered panel of burl by writing-desk of maple and music-stand of cherry with many spindle and fretting by sideboard of finest new oak with brass handle and mirror in the back the town have anticipate in short up to its own high and difficult standard and along have come a ruck of stuff that be dark and dingy and old-fashioned awkward article with a vast dull expanse of mahogany end in clumsy claw foot spindle-legged table inlay with white wood old-fashioned mirror in scar gilt frame awkward-looking highboy and the plainest of sofa and lounge the chief sideboard boast not the tiniest bit of brass even the handle be of cheap glass and clem have set candle-stick upon it that be nothing but pewter where little arcady have look for the best brussels carpet there come only dull-colored rug of a most aged and depressing lack of gayety as for silver we know the worst when aunt delium mccormick declare they have not even a swing ice-pitcher -- nothing but thin battered old stuff that be make in the year one aunt delium have quite the newest and most fashionable furniture in town she parlor be a feast of color for any eye and she fine hardwood sideboard alone have cost twenty-two dollar so she speak as one have authority by the time that clem 's ancient treasure be all unpacked little arcady feel a genuine if patronize sympathy for he mistress if _ that _ be the boast elegance of the ante-bellum south then tradition have report falsely no plush rocker of the newest patent no chenille curtain no art chromo no hat-rack not even a imitation bronze mantle clock guard by its mail warrior such clock as there be leave only honest distress in the mind of the beholder -- tall outlandish old thing in wooden case it be believe that clem have waste money in pay freight on this stuff certainly no one in little arcady would have pay those bill to possess the furniture as to the folly of those who have originally purchase it the town be likewise a unit if clem be make aware of this public sentiment he still do not waver in he loyalty to the old piece day after day he unpack and dust and polish they with loving devotion they speak to he of other day and when he be quite sure that the last freight bill have be pay he seem really to enjoy they the unexpected drain have reduce he savings to a pittance but be not the pullet which he could raise absolutely without number it be true that miss caroline would have to come alone now leave little miss still to teach in the school at baltimore until a day of renew surplus this much clem confide to I in sorrow i sympathize with he truly but i feel it be a fortunate circumstance i think that one of the lady at a time would be as much as little arcady could assimilate slowly the house grow into a home await its mistress a home whose furnished room overflow into other not furnished but merely crowd i foresee not without a certain wicked cheerfulness that even after the come of miss caroline clem would be force to pander to my breakfast appetite for the slight betterment it make in he fortune even must this be do surreptitiously and at least one dinner be secure to I beyond the come of this mistress for clem have convey to I with appropriate ceremony a invitation which i promptly accept to dine with mr caroline lansdale at six-thirty on the evening of she arrival she have glean from he letter it appear that i have be a rather friendly adviser of she servant in the day that follow i see that clem be regard I with a embarrassed troubled look something of weight lay upon he mind nor be it easy to make he speak but i achieve this at last well seh

hope of ever win for I the favor of he captious owner chapter xiv the come of miss caroline she come to we auspiciously on a day in the first week of June mistress caroline lansdale a one-time belle of the old dominion relict of the late colonel jere lansdale csa legislator and duellist whose devotion to she in the day of they courtship have be the talk of two state not less notable than he eloquence in the forum he skill in the duello have be the determine fervor with which he kneel at she foot and i wait no more than a hundred seconds in she presence to applaud he discernment i have picture a old woman -- some aged trifle of a elder day sad withered devitalize intemperately reminiscent -- steep in tradition that would leave she formidable and impracticable as a friend to I i have fancy she thus from clem 's fragmentary and chance description and my own knowledge of what she should be by all law of the probable and she be not as i have evolve she the day she come be one of little arcady 's best quite all that she anxious servitor could have wish -- a day of summer 's first abundance when we green-bordered street bask in a temper sunlight and we trim white cottage nestle coolly back of they flower garden harry alien as she be she would be welcome with smile and i be glad for she sake and clem 's when i hurry home to dress for that first dinner with she on my way across the lawn at six-thirty i pick a bunch of the newly open yellow rose as a peace offering should one be need clem in he most formal dress receive I ceremoniously at the door he look betray only the faintest formalest acknowledgment of have ever encounter mine before with a superb bow toward the drawing-room and in tone stiffly magnificent he announce mistah calvin blake it be excellently do but i know he have rehearse the mistah then a woman rise from one of the deep old chair to offer I she hand and a soft quick laugh come as she perceive my difficulty for my one hand hold the rose these she gather gracefully into she left hand while she right fall into mine with a swift little pressure as she bid I welcome clem have tell I of you mr blake i feel that you be one of we let I thank you at once for the consideration you have show he in the half light i hesitate awkwardly enough to speak she name for i feel that this could not be the mother of little miss rather be it the daughter herself i stammer word that must have reveal my uncertainty for again she laugh and then she order light clem come soft-footedly with a branch candelabrum which he place on the round-topped old table by which she have be sit she move a step to where the soft light glow up into she face and with mock seriousness stand to be survey fairly there mr blake you see i confess all my year and i see the truth that she loiter gracefully among the vague and pleasant fifty but then she do a thing which would have be injudicious in most woman of she year she hand still hold my rose go up to she face and she cheek glow dusky and pink against the yellow petal i see that she rightly appraise she own daring and feel free to say : -- you _ see _ my confusion be inevitable not one of those candle can be spare if i be to believe you be miss caroline again she laugh reveal now a girlish freshness in the small mouth that have somehow linger to belie the deeper graver line about she dark eye as she still regard I with that smile wait lift of the short upper lip i call out : -- more light clem i need all you have whereat miss caroline fall into she chair with a marvellous blush a undeniable darkening of the pink on cheek that be in texture like the finest sheerest lawn never thereafter could i refuse credence to tale of which many come to I expose miss caroline as a able and relentless coquette nor could i fail to understand how the late colonel jere lansdale would have find need to be a duellist after he become she lover even have he aforetime be unskilled in that difficult art as she chat chiefly of she journey i falsely pretend to listen whereas i only stare and in spirit be prostrate before she mere kneel at she foot savor too nearly of arrogance i feel the need to be a spread rug in she presence she sit back in the chair that embrace she loosely a slight figure with a small head on which the heavy strand of whitening hair seem only a powdered lie above the curiously girlish face a tiny black patch or two on the face i think would have make this illusion perfect and yet when she do not laugh or in some little silence of recollection the deeper line stand out and i could see that sorrow have long know its way to she face it even lurk now back of she eye and i know that she try to keep she face light for I so that i should not detect it she succeed admirably but the smile could not always be there and ghost of she dead year come stealthily to haunt she face as surely as the smile go when clem with a air of have have word from a numerous kitchen crew stand before we and bow out miss cahline dinneh be suhve i give she my arm with a feeling of vast relief not only be miss caroline a abide joy but apprehension as to my modest complicity in she late distress have too evidently be groundless she have once with what seem to be a almost artificial politeness ask I about we timber supply and the state of the lumber market query to which i have reply with a assumption of interest equally artificial for i be ignorant of both topic and not even remotely concern about either seat at the table which clem have array with a faultless artistry i promptly demand the removal of a tall piece of cut glass and its burden of carnation assert that both glass and flower might be well enough in they way but that i could regard they only as a blank wall of exasperating ugliness while they interrupt a view of my hostess whereat i be again regale with that imcomparable blush clem serve a soup that have be two day in the making and be worth the time but even ere the stain have fade from the cheek of my hostess cheek of slightly crumpled roseleaf another look flash the smile from she eye -- a quick firm woman look of suffering and defiance she have raise she glass and i mechanically do the same mr blake let we drink standing -- we woman earn the right to stand with you a little puzzle i stand up to face she as clem pull back she chair one hand on the table the other reach she slender stem glass aloft she lean toward I with a look of singular vehemence to we murder brother and husband and son mr blake to we lost leader and we deathless lose cause to jefferson davi and robert edmund lee to the confederate state of america a black wind seem to blow across the face of she servitor 's flutter eyelid but i drink loyally to mr caroline lansdale and whatsoever that woman would i could see that clem exhale a deep breath how long he have hold it i know not we resume we seat and the dinner go forward with my hostess again herself it be a dinner not heavy but choice a repast upon which clem have magically work all he spell there be a bass that have nose the river 's current that morning two pullet cut off in the very dawn of adolescence and a mysteriously perfect pastry whose secret i have never be able to wring from he beyond the uninforming and obvious enough datum that it contain some sugah a ' a little spicin 's have for my luncheon that day suffer a up-to-date dinner at budd 's i feel a genuine craving for food yet the spell of my hostess be such that i leave she table ahunger again there be a inexplicable reference from she to the timber and sawed-lumber interest of the little country and the circumstance that another black wind seem to shiver the eyelid of clem lend no light to the mystery of it but then as if some recondite duty to I have be safely perform she talk to I of herself of day when the youth of the old dominion have be covetous of she smile of nightly triumph in ball and rout of gay season at the nation 's capital amid the fashion and beauty and wit of pierce 's administration and of buchanan 's of round of call make in she calash of bewitching gown she have worn of theater and musicale and tea and embassy reception in a day when harriet lane be mistress of the white house for my pleasing she laugh she sprightly way through memory of that romantic past when she dance and chatter in the fulness of she bellehood bring out a multitude of treasured memento compliment she have compel witticism she have prompt prank she have play delectable repast she have eat at lady napier 's or another be the splendor of pageant she have witness and though she be back in a elder day she glow young as she talk whether recall official solemnity or a once-cherished gown of embroidered tulle catch up with bunch of grape the girl 's mouth be she 's -- fresh and full unlined by care it be not until she talk of later younger day that she face take on a old look when we federated state rise up in they might be a phrase that bring the change thereafter she speak in subdue tone of a time more eventful than romantic but still absorb she remember the word in which she felicitate general pope walker for have issue the order to fire on sumter she give detail of the privation that richmond on she seven hill have suffer in the latter day and she make plain why they woman should rise with they man to drink certain toast how they too have sacrifice and toil and suffer with the same loyal tenacity she mention the present government casually as the affair of a day and speak of mr lincoln they northern president in a tone imply confidence that i share she feeling for he as we go back to the drawing-room for coffee she sum up herself to I though she think to sum up more than herself they sweep we with the besom of war mr blake and they overwhelm -- but they could not subjugate we as she speak my eye catch for the first time a portrait that hang on the wall back of she it be the portrait of one dark but fair with shoulder of a girlish slenderness all but thin with eye of glowing dusk and a half-smile upon she lip it be like my hostess in a fashion of line and color and yet enough unlike she so that i know it must be the daughter the face be a shade narrower of chin a bit longer and in some obscure differ of the feature there be a effect of more poise almost of a maturer dignity so that while i divined it be the face of she daughter it would seem to have be better plan for the face of she mother she follow my eye to the picture and she face be still almost stern from she last speech though it be true that the sternness be a dimpled sternness for the chin of my hostess be round they overwhelm we mr blake -- my daughter there and I and god alone have count how many other wretched woman she they strike a double blow -- they kill the two man she love one be she father but she fly to the other she find she picture in he dead hand we young man be apt to die in that fashion and when she put it back to be bury with he she eye be dry even under she double blow she be stronger than i she have be stronger ever since but she suffer more than i be make to oh it be a fine thing for they to do she voice rise at the last into a little tremble gust of passion and i see again the spirit that give those woman the right to stand with the man she recover herself quickly and the girl in she smile upon I again you must overlook my forgetfulness i shall not forget often especially now that i be among these murderous fanatic but i be tired to-night and i be so glad when i know i could talk to you freely she eye be upon I in friendly unreserve in confident appeal in the face of what i should have feel i be ashamed at that moment and in the nervousness of hidden guilt i handle the minute coffee cup awkwardly clem who must have be equally nervous step to right the thing in its saucer with yes seh mahstah majah from across the table i know without raise my eye that he mistress glance up at clem in quick astonishment then that she eye be fasten upon my face i still regard the coffee interestedly but i know that i myself blush now and i suspect that my hostess be pale major she begin questioningly then more decidedly _ major _ blake i raise my eye to hers and nod idiotically she laugh a little laugh that be icy in its politeness how stupid of I and now i must ask you pardon for all my tirade for my blasphemy and for that monstrous toast i -- really -- she shoot a look at clem under which he blanch visibly then she eye be again upon I and she smile with a rare art really you will overlook a old woman 's weakness it be the inimical remote icy superiority of she tone that nettle I -- perhaps she imply assumption that i would not know it for such but also i feel curiously stricken by that swift withdrawal of she confidence for mr caroline lansdale have win I by she laugh and blush of ancient girlishness further i would not now be hurt by any woman though she be ten time my year without a show of defense i arise as clem hastily flee from the room miss caroline -- i wait for the fine little brow to go up at that i have not long to wait i shall positively never call you anything else but miss caroline while you permit I to address you at all -- understand it -- i have associate with you boy too long

should fight again as long and try to fight harder in the same cause but the hellishness of it -- the damnable inhuman obscenity of it -- i should like to forget i never say so before miss caroline -- there be no one to say it to -- but it make I old before my time why i could almost be a son of yours if you will pardon that minor brutality and the thing be age I to this day i help to kill you

still smile he would fall there as if sleep have overtake he on the march we column have halt and i go to he it must have take a full minute for I to realize that this be dignified war and not the murder of a boy in a homely gray uniform when i do realize it i be so weakened that i break down and cry i be a private then i cover he face and get up strong enough to assault two other private who have find my snivelling funny one of they go to the field hospital and i go under arrest when i would finish with the other you ought to know miss caroline that the sight of thousand of you other dead

th ' notion to shine huh eye up she sho ' be a highly illuminous puhsonality i see then what he mean for miss caroline have shine she eye and they flood I with a distracting medley of light i think she struggle very uncertainly with herself she eye shift from my face to the empty sleeve twice before that evening -- i remember it have be when she speak so enigmatically of the lumber industry -- she eye have rest there briefly discreetly but in all sympathy now the look be different it waver at one instant i seem to read regret that i have come off so well -- she eye flicker suggestively to my remain arm be fair i say do i not drink you toast i think she waver at this for a blush deeper than all the other suffuse she besides i continue warningly you be within the enemy 's line now and

servant i say you have another slave miss caroline another that refuse manumission -- another bit of personal property clumsy but willing thank you major i need you kindness more than i might seem to need it good night and even then she give I a rose with the same coquetry i doubt not that have once make colonel jere lansdale quick to think of he pistol when another evoke it only now it mask she weariness she sense of desperate desolation i take the rose and kiss she hand i leave she wilting in the big chair stare hard into the fireplace that clem have rill with summer green thing when my fellow-chattel appear next morning with my coffee he be embarrass with guile he strive to be talkative about matter of no consequence but this avail he not clem i say frigidly tell I just what you say to mr lansdale about I he palter shift on he foot he brow contract in perplexity as if i have propound some intricate trifle of the higher mathematics huh wha -- what be that yo ' - all be a-sayin '

yes seh chapter xv little arcady view a parade and so begin the time of miss caroline among we -- one effect the more of fate 's mad trickery it be my privilege to be more intimately aware of she concern than be the town at large and even to I in those day she carry off the difficulty of she lot with a manner so plausible that it clench my admiration if it do not win my belief i know that she daily bear a burden of ruin and face a future of perilous uncertainty i know that she must have journey into we strange land with a real terror nerve to that course only by a resolve to be no longer a burden upon she impoverished kinsman surely it have be like die a death for she to leave the land of she own people devastate though it be and vacant of those who have make the world easy for she and i be not a little puzzle by the tie that bind she to she one remain stay both she and clem i see consider she come to he to be a thing so natural that it should excite no wonder a thing familiar in the thought and as little to be puzzle about as they own breathing i see that she perplexity lay not at all in this black fellow 's unthinking adherence to he life of service but rather in the circumstance of she spirit-grieving exile and in the necessary doubt of she chattel 's competence for the feat he have undertake i despaired very soon of ever comprehend the intricate strand of they relationship when i understand as i be not long in do that each be in certain way genuinely afraid of the other i know that the problem must always be far beyond my own little power as to little arcady at large some aspect of this complication be simpler than they appear to I other be more obscure of the tragedy of miss caroline 's mere come to we they could suspect nothing save it might be the humiliation she old-fashioned furniture must put upon she in a prosperous town where so much of the furniture be elegant to the point of extravagance in the much-discussed matter of mistress and slave the town agree simply that clem be stupid and have be delude by miss caroline into believe that a certain proclamation have stop short of she personal property it be believe that she have terrorize he by threaten to put bloodhound on he trail if he ever try to run off -- for the town know its uncle tom 's cabin as well as it know gaskell 's compendium it be think that if clem prove to be disobedient or rebellious he mistress would try to hire big joe kestril or some equally strong person to whip he with a black-snake also it be say that she have sell he wife away from he and might try to sell clem himself if ever she get hard up though it be feel that she would be wise not to go too far in that matter for the rest little arcady rather rejoice in the novelty of miss caroline 's establishment there be a flavor of much-needed romance in this survival at we very door of a ante-bellum unrighteousness the town cherish a hope that clem would try to run off some time or that miss caroline would have he back cut to ribbon or try to sell or mortgage he or something thus create entertainment of a agreeable and exciting character if the town could have overhear clem scold the lady with frank irritation in he voice -- as i chance to do once or twice -- have it behold he scowl as he rage miss cahline yo ' sho ` ly gittin ' old ` nuff to know betteh 'n _ that _ i suttinly do wish yo ' paw be alive a ' yeh ` bout ah git he afteh yo ' maghty quick now yo ' je ' remembeh ah be not go 'n' a ' _ have _ no sech doin 's -- if it could have note the quail consternation of the mistress at these moment it might have be puzzle but of such phenomenon it never know it be aware only that miss caroline treat clem with a despotic severity issue command to he as from a throne of power and in tone of acrid authority that be the envy of all housekeeper among we who keep hire girl even mr pott long before the arrival of miss caroline have despair of teaching clem to make something of himself he have refuse to subscribe for a compendium and she cordial assurance that he be by the law of the land both a man and a brother do not even mildly elate he mr pott be soon in a like despair regard miss caroline whom she regard as too frivolous ever to make anything of herself these two lady indeed be widely apart perhaps i can intimate the extent of they unlikeness by reveal that mr pott early in we acquaintance have observe of I that i be not serious enough whereas miss caroline be presently aver to my face that i be entirely too serious these judgment of myself seem to contrast the lady informingly the impression that miss caroline be frivolous -- or even worse -- become current the day after she arrival in little arcady array in a lavender silk dress of many flounce with bonnet beribboned gayly beyond she year shoe in low walking shoe of heel iniquitously high a toe minute and shine and a instep ornate to a unholy degree bear a slender gold-tipped staff of polished ebony to assist theatrically in she progress and bestow placid patronize look to right and leave she have flounce into main street follow ceremoniously by she black chattel himself set up with a palpable and shameless pride in he degradation salute stiffly and with a artificial grandeur those whom he would otherwise have greet with the unstudied ease of long association this procession regale both main and washington street where miss caroline visit we shop to make inconsiderable purchase and many friend it be a function the pleasant datum whereof i be not long in collect she first conquest be chester pierce we excellent hardware merchant whom she commission to make a need repair to she range it be a simple business matter and chester pierce be a simple business person of plain manners but as he slouch comfortably upon he counter and listen to miss caroline 's condescend exposition of she need he become sensible of a strange influence steal upon he by degree he bring himself erect and slowly dazedly perform a act which have never before be perpetrate within he establishment it be not that he deliberate nor that he reason dictate it but instinctively almost from a purely reflex muscular action he remove he hat while miss caroline talk feeling himself thrill with a foreign and most suave deference it be customary in we town to raise you hat to a lady on the street but for a merchant and a solid citizen at that to do this thing in he own establishment be a thing unheard of -- and a thing of pretentious and sickening foppery when it _ be _ hear of for that matter though this need not now concern we and be sure to tell my servant to give you a glass of wine when you work be do conclude miss caroline as she turn to rustle silkily out whereat chester pierce charter member and president of we son of temperance a man prime with all statistics of the woe result traditionally from that first careless glass murmured word unintelligible but of gratified import and bow low after the retreat vision a moment later he be stare with mystified absorption at the hat in he hand quite as if the hat be a stranger 's -- and then he brush it around and around with the cuff of he coat sleeve as if the stranger have not be careful enough of it thence parade miss caroline to the city drug store to be bow well out to the sidewalk by young arthur updyke when she errand within have be do but arthur have attend a college of pharmacy far away from slocum county and it be not unnatural that he should exhibit a alien grace in time of emergency with westley keyt again to whose shop miss caroline next progress it be as with chester pierce a phenomenon of instinctive muscular reaction -- that of he hat come off as he greet the stately little lady at he threshold and apologize for the sawdust on he floor which be compelling she to raise a froth of skirt above the top of those sinful-looking shoe i suspect that miss caroline be rather take with westley she call he my good man which make he feel that he have be distinguish uncommonly and she chat with he at some length ask cordially about cut of meat and he family two matter in which westley be much absorb he declare later that she be a grand little woman there follow pilgrimage that June morning to the first national bank and to several of we lesser establishment pilgrimage rarely divert to little arcady and which invariably provoke bow under strangely lift hat but there be little arcadian of miss caroline 's own sex to whom she might not so swiftly fetch confusion aunt delium mccormick devote a chance view of the newcomer to discover that the gown of lavender satin have be turn and make over none too expertly from one originally build some year before the war later she find what we lady agree be its primal design after much turning of the leaf of ancient godey 's magazine mr judge robinson from one sidelong glance bring off detailed intelligence of the bonnet 's checkered past the elder miss eubank decry the mannishness of cane-bearing and mr westley keyt enter the shop as miss caroline be bow out declare that she silk stocking be of a hue hardly respectable and that she wear shoe twice too small for she the eye of the suddenly urbane westley glisten when he overhear this but he fall to dissect a beef without further sign for better or worse miss caroline and little arcady have exchange impression of each other i meet she by chance that morning and be charm by she flattering implication of reliance upon myself she make I feel that we understanding be secret and we attachment romantic to complete she round of we commercial center i escorted she to the _ argus _ office she greet of solon denney be a thing to behold with unalloyed delight they seem to understand each other at once two minute after solon have look up in some astonishment from he dusty over-piled desk they be array as north and south in a combat of blithest raillery miss caroline sit in solon 's battered chair with the miss castor survey he exchange-laden desk with a humorous eye and seize the last _ argus _ skim its local column with a lively interest and profess to be enthral by its word-magic she read stray item that commend themselves to she critical judgment such as a wind blow last week that you could lean up against like the side of the house or westley keyt have a bran-new ` no admittance ' sign over the door of he slaughter-house we do not see why he could put up a ` come one come all ' sign and still not get _ we _ into the place they be messy further she read some fiend with sub-human instinct ravage we secret hoard of eating-apple while we be out meet the farmer last Saturday afternoon we wish they have be of no value to any one except the owner and then in she sprightliest manner and with every sign of enjoyment she go on to a item during the reading of which i think we both flush a little solon and i : -- the united state _ be _ some grammar sharp down east say you must say ` the united state be ' but we guess not opinion to that effect prevail widely to the south of we some year ago but the contrary be prove we believe the united state _ be _ brother ever since appomattox and even the grammar book should testify to its is-ness -- to its everlasting and indivisible oneness she carry it off so finely that i know miss caroline have recover from the fatigue of she journey i shall write you a item myself she exclaim and seize a stubby pencil she write rapidly : -- a batter and ungrammatical old woman from the valley of virginium have settle in we midst she will always believe that the united state be but she be harmless and otherwise sane have i catch the style -- have i use ` in we midst ' correctly she ask solon and he protest that she style be faultless but that she matter be grossly misleading from this she be presently assure he in all pleasantness that the seed of cain descend through ham would by reason of the curse of god be a servant of servant unto the end while solon be assure she with equal good nature that this scriptural law have be repeal by president lincoln she retort i dare say you mr lincoln be _ capable _ of wish to repeal the bible be she nearest approach to asperity a battered old woman say solon to I later she look more like a candy saint if they make such thing -- one that a child have be careless with we agree that she be a addition to little arcady the editor of the _ argus _ sigh at this point and i think he might be wish that all feminine newcomer could be like the latest for mr aurelia pott whose leisure heaven have increase be now redouble she effort to make the _ argus _ a well of english undefiled -- undefiled by what she call journalism solon must not he confide to I say enthuse nor we opine nor disremember he might not say that the pastor be give a donation party when he really mean that the party be give -- not that the pastor be give further he must be cautious in the use of who and whom and try to break himself of the a good time be enjoy by all present habit and she always say ` diddy-you ' instead of ` dij-you ' break in my namesake who loitering near we have overhear the name of mr pott that will _ do _ calvin say he father shortly it seem to I that the still young life of solon be fast be blighted chapter xvi the spectre of scandal be raise a graver charge than frivolity be soon to be bring against the widow of the late colonel jere lansdale not with she antiquated gown she assist staff the gay bonnet nor yet with the showy small slipper and silken hose tinted unseasonably to she year do scandal engage itself but rather with the circumstance that she drink to drink mean in little arcady to get drunk as big joe kestril do every pay-day clarence stull polish a stove in the rear of pierce 's hardware store be swift to divulge that mr lansdale have ask chet pierce to have a glass of wine -- and he a-bowin ' and a-scrapin ' like you would think he be goin ' to fly off the handle it be enough for the town the unfortunate woman have not yet reel through its street but little arcady would give she time and it know there could be but one result that sort of thing might be do in tale of vicious high life to point a moral but in the real world it could not compatibly exist with good conduct even aunt delium mccormick good methodist as she be who put up a little elderberry wine each year for communion purpose be think by more than one to strain near to the breaking point the third branch of that concise behest to touch not taste not handle not the lady be at once dismayed about miss caroline from aunt delium herself to marcella eubank who keep conspicuous upon she dressing-table a bedizened motto of the daughter of rebecca -- the lip that touch wine shall never touch mine it be true that this legend appear to marcellum to be a bit licentious in its implication as to lip _ not _ touch by wine it have indeed first be hang in the parlor but one creston fancett in the course of a evening call upon miss eubank have read the thing aloud twice over and then observe with a sinister significance that wine have never touch he own lip whereupon in a coarsely conceive spirit of humor he proceed to act as if he have forget that he be a gentleman hence the card 's seclusion in marcellum 's boudoir hence likewise marcellum 's subsequent preference in she temperance propaganda for straightforward means which no gentleman could affect to misunderstand she rely chiefly thereafter upon some highly color chart depict the interior of the human stomach in vary stage of alcoholic degeneration accord to these a single glass of wine or a measure of ale take daily for a year suffice to produce some startling effect in color while the result of unrestrained indulgence for five year be spectacular in the extreme besides these disconcerting color effect marcellum enact a brief but pithy drama in which she touch a light match to a tablespoonful of alcohol to show the true nature of the stuff and to symbolize the fate of its votary with chart and with blaze spirit with tract and with figure to prove that we spend more for the staff of death than for the staff of life marcellum be prepare to move upon the unsuspicious miss caroline nor be she alone in such readiness for a good work the lady all feel that they profligate sister should be bring to sign the pledge and they call upon miss caroline with precisely this end in view -- call singly and by two and three but for some reason they seem always to find obstacle in the way of bring forward this most vital topic if they have only discover miss caroline in she cup or if she shaded room have be litter with empty rum bottle and pervade by the fume of strong drink or if she have audaciously offer they wine doubtless the thing would have be easy but none of these helpful phenomenon could be observe and miss caroline have a way of lead the talk which would have make any reference to she unfortunate habit seem ungraceful it would be far too much to say that she charm they but all of she caller be interested many of they be entertain and a few become she warm defender aunt delium mccormick surprise every one by align herself with this latter minority she declare after she first call that miss caroline be a dear and after the second call that she be a poor dear and she forthwith become of service to the newcomer in a thousand way know only to the masonry of housekeeping and since none of the lady for one reason or another have find a way to say those thing that mr lansdale sorely need to hear it be agree among they that the minister must say they the minister in little arcady mean he of the methodist church the two other clergyman be so young and unimportant as to need identification by name of the official and inspire visit of this good man to miss caroline the version that reach the public be one thing : its secret and true history be another the latter have never be tell until now it be know abroad only that the minister have call on a warm afternoon in July that miss caroline have receive he out of door on the shaded east side of the house where the heat have drive she to await a cooling breeze from the river one of the dingy rug have be spread upon the grass close to the lilac clump and by a unfashionable little table miss caroline sit in a chair sadly out of date reading of childe harold it be understand that the minister have there sit in another antiquated chair of capacious arm and upholstered in fade green velvet a chair bring by clem and that he have weakly chat away a pleasant hour or two without ever once daring to bring miss caroline 's evil state to that attention which it merit from she he difficulty seem to have be similar to that experience by the call lady he could observe no opening that promise anything but a ungracious plunge or a awkward stumble and the lady have be wrong in suspect that he authority as a cleric would nerve he to either of these thing there be despair next day when it be know that he have come away even lavisher in praise of miss caroline than aunt delium have become that he refuse with a gentle but unbreakable stubbornness a thing he be know to be curse with latently ever again to approach the lady with a conceal purpose or with aught in he heart but a warm and flagrant esteem so much for the public 's knowledge and doubtless the public in every case know all that it ought to know but these be the fact as they come to my privileged ear and to what i believe be gift of interpretation not below the average when clem bring the chair for the minister miss caroline give he a brief low-toned order which he hurry away to execute within ten minute and before miss caroline have finish tell how altogether beautiful she find arcady of the little country clem return bear breast-high a napkin-covered tray from which tower twin pillar of glass top with fragrant leafage and pierce each by a yellow straw this tray he place upon the table beside the poem of lord byron and the minister permit himself a oblique look thereat even though this involve desert the eye of he agreeable hostess the ice in the glass tinkle a brief phrase of music the top burgeon with a luxuriant summer green and the straw be of a sweetly pastoral suggestiveness the fragrance move one to the heart of some spice-scented dell where a brooklet purl down a pebbled course the ensemble be indeed overwhelming in its message of a refreshment joyous satisfying timely and of a consummate innocence the day be warm say miss caroline receive one of the glass from she servant and with a bright look at she guest it be intensely warm and quite unusually so for this time of year say the minister absently take the other glass now proffer he we shall combat it say miss caroline with some vivacity she delicately apply she lip to the straw and a slight depression appear in each of she acceptable cheek a cooling beverage at this hour be most grateful say the minister rejoice in the icy feel of the glass and fall hopefully to he own straw clem make they perfectly say miss caroline what do you call they ask the minister he have relinquish he straw and he kind face shone with a pleased surprise why mint julep reply miss caroline glance quickly up ah mint that explain it say the minister with satisfaction he broad face clearing of a slight bewilderment clem find a beautiful patch of it by a spring half a mile up the river volunteer miss caroline between dainty pull at she straw it be a lovely plant -- a _ lovely _ plant indeed rejoin the minister for a moment set down he glass to wipe he brow i remember now detect the same fragrance when i water my horse at that spring but i do not dream that it -- i wonder -- he break off take up he glass -- that its virtue be not more widely apprehend i have never hear that a acceptable beverage might be make from it not every one can make a mint julep as clem can say he hostess a moist and futile splutter from the bottom of the minister 's glass be he only reply he set the glass back on the table with a pleasant speculation show in he eye the talk become again animated chiefly the minister talk and he hostess find he most companionable let I offer you another julep she say after a little note that he eye have sweep the empty glass with a chastened blankness the minister let she if it would not be trouble you -- really the heat be excessive and i find that the mint simple herb though it be be strangely salutary the minister be a man of year and weight and worth he possess a reliant simplicity that put he at once close to those he meet of these by he manner he ask all : confidence without reserve trouble doubt distress material or otherwise and this manner of he prevail the heart of he people open to he as freely as he own open to receive they he be a good man and partly by reason of this ingenuous unsuspicious mind a invaluable instrument of grace when he have talk to miss caroline through the second julep -- digress only to marvel briefly again that the property of mint should so long have be nature 's own secret in little arcady -- tell she he joy he grief he interest which be but the joy and grief and interest of he people he work a spell upon she so that she in turn become confide she be a episcopalian she line have be bear episcopalian since a time whereof no datum be obtainable and this be of course not a condition to meddle with in late life even if one 's mind should grow consent for that matter miss caroline would be frank and pretend to no change of mind she be a old woman and fix she could not at this day free herself of a doubtless incorrect notion that the outside church -- mean those not episcopal -- have be intend for people other than she own family and its offshoot clem have once be a baptist and it be true that he be now a methodist he have tell she that he new religion be distinguish from the old by be dry religion but these be intricacy with which a woman of miss caroline 's year could not be expect to entangle herself this she would say however that during she residence in little arcady she would fling aside the prejudice of a lifetime and worship each sabbath at the minister 's methodist church it do not seem to the minister that she say it as might a explorer who consent for a time to adopt the manner and custom of the tribe among which a spirit of adventure have lead he he accept she imply tribute modestly and with unaffected gratification again wipe he brow and he broad good face when i join they at four o'clock have be move by hope of a cooling chat with miss caroline the minister be slightly more flush i think than the day could warrant he be about to leave be in fact conclude he choicest anecdote of big joe kestril -- for he be a man who meet all we kind big joe six foot five a tower of muscle brawn standing on a corner pleasantly inebriate have watch go feebly by the totter palsied form of little old bolivar kent we most aged and richest man the minister also pass have observe kestril 's humorous stare the big fellow call to I he be say to miss caroline as i come up ` parson ' say he -- they all know I familiarly madam -- ` parson ' say he ' i wish i could take all i be worth and all old kent be worth and put it in a bunch on the sidewalk there and then fight the old cuss for it ' it be a favorite anecdote of the minister 's but i have never know he before to tell it to a lady on the occasion of he first call miss caroline laugh joyously as she turn to greet I i can not tell you how finely i have be entertain she say to I nor can i tell he for myself madam retort the minister i think indeed he speak with a effort that make this gallantry seem not altogether baseless in fact i be on the point of leave say the minister be you return home or have you more call in the neighborhood i ask feeling just a tinge of uneasiness about he expansive manner no more call no i have plan instead a pleasant walk up along the riverside to a spring some distance above i mean to procure a supply of this delicious mint -- for mint julep he add affably come with I i urge i be about to walk out myself together we bid adieu to miss caroline but the minister 's walk end at my own door in the cool gloom of my little library i ask he if he would be good enough to excuse I a moment indicate the broad couch beneath the window with pleasure major and he sink among the restful pillow i be ashamed to say that the heat have render I a trifle indolent when i come softly back five minute later he lay in deep slumber he face cherubically innocent he breathing soft as a babe 's he awake freshly two hour later he apologize for he rudeness and express a wish for a glass of cool water three of these he drink with evidence of profound relish then he draw he large silver watch from he pocket on my word major it be after six and i shall be late for tea i have trespass shamefully upon you the heat be very try i say quite enervating indeed i seem only now to be feel its effect as he walk briskly down the now cooling street he bare he brow to the gentle breeze of evening to the lady solicitous about miss caroline who call upon he a few day later he say she be a most admirable and lovely woman -- not at all a person one could bring one 's self to address on the painful subject of intoxicant have she offer I a glass of wine or other stimulant a way might have be open but i be delighted to say that she hospitality go no farther than this innocent beverage the minister indicate on he study table a glass contain sweeten ice-water in which some leaf of mint have be submerge it be call a mint julep he add though i confess i do not get the same delicate tang from the herb that she black fellow do as he prepare the decoction i assure you its flavor be capital chapter xvii the truth about shakspere at last miss caroline dutifully return the call that be pay she with never a suspicion that she slavery to strong drink have be the secret inspiration of they she be not yet awake to we sentiment in this matter she have give strong water to the minister with a heart as innocent as they disguise of ice and leafage have make they actually appear to that good man and i who be well inform hesitate to warn she hope weakly that she would come to understand for i have see there be many thing that miss caroline have not to be tell in order to know for one she have quickly divine that the lady of little arcady consider she furniture to be unfortunate she know that they scorn it for its unstylishness that some of they sympathize in the humiliation that such impossible stuff must be to she while other believe that she be too unsophisticated to have any proper shame in the matter these latter strove by every device to have she note the right thing in furniture and thus be move to contrast it instructively with she own : as when mr judge robinson borrow for a afternoon aunt delium mccormick 's best blue plush rocker mr westley keyt 's new sofa upholster with gorgeous ingrain and mr eubank 's new black walnut combination desk and bookcase with brass trimming and little spindled balcony in which could be elegantly place the mineral specimen pick up along the river bank and the twin statuette of the fluting shepherd and he inamorata as mr judge robinson herself possess new and high-priced furniture include a gold-and-onyx stand to occupy the bay window and uphold the roger group go for the parson as well as two fragile gilt chair which considerate guest would not sit in but leave expose to view and a complete new set of black walnut the effect that day -- which include a grand smell of varnish -- be nothing less than sumptuous the occasion be a semi-monthly meeting of the lady ' home study and culture club at which miss caroline be to be present there have be a suspension of the club 's meeting while mr pott be in abeyance but on this day she be to enter the world again and preside over the meeting as madam president though the lady sometimes forget to call she that the paper read by mr pott -- who be not at all ineffective in she black -- be on the lake poet with a few pointed selection from wordsworth and other whether or not miss caroline be rightly impress by the furniture exhibit be a question not easy to determine true she stare at it with something in she eye beyond a mere perception of its line but whether this be the longing passion of a awaken soul or the simple awe of the unenlightened be not to be ascertain at the moment testimony as to she enjoyment of the president 's paper be more circumstantial in the midst of this as the listener be besought to dwell a moment on this exquisite delineation of nature -- expertly pronounced nate-your by mr pott -- miss caroline turn she head aside as one deeply move by the poet 's magic but marcellum eubank glance at that moment into a mirror on the opposite wall -- a mirror in a plush frame on which pansy have be paint -- catch the full and frank exposure of a yawn it be a thorough yawn miss caroline have surrender abjectly to it in the belief -- unreck the mirror -- that she could not be detect the discussion that follow the paper -- as be customary at the meeting -- prove to be a bit livelier each lady say something she have think up to say beginning do it not seem -- or be we not force to conclude -- i suspect that miss caroline be sleepy perhaps she be nettle by the boredom she have be make to endure without just provocation perhaps the fashionable fume of varnish have be toxic to she unaccustomed sens at any rate she now compromise herself regrettably mr westley keyt have be think up something to say something choice that should yet be sufficiently vague not to incriminate she it have seem that these requirement would be meet if she say in a tone of easy patronage mr wordsworth be certainly a very bright writer of poetry but as for I -- give _ I _ shakspere she have think of say the bard of avon a polished phrase coin for he compendium by the ingenious mr gaskell but hear she own voice strangely break the silence mr keyt become timid at the last moment and let it go at shakspere oh shakspere -- of _ course _ say most of the lady at once and those not quick enough to utter it concertedly look it almost reprovingly at the speaker a silence fall as if every one must have time to recover from this trivial platitude but it be a silence outrageously shatter by miss caroline who say : -- o dear i have always consider shakspere such a overrated man the silence grow more intense only mr pott emit a slight but audible gasp but swift look flash from each lady to she horrified sister be it possible that the unfortunate woman have be in no condition to come among they oh a _ greatly _ overrated man repeat miss caroline terribly far too wordy -- too fond of wretched pun -- so much of he humor coarse and tiresome by the way have you lady take up byron the moment be charge almost to explosion a crisis impend out of the very speechlessness of the gathering mr pott be aghast in behalf of william shakspere and marcellum eubank be crimson at the blunt query about byron well know that he could be take up by a lady only with the wariest caution and that he would much better be let alone the other be tear demoralizingly between these two extreme of distress but the situation be save by the ready wit of mr judge robinson i think the hour have come for refreshment madam president she say urbanely and the meeting be nervously adjourn under the animation thus induce a approximate equilibrium be restore the lady gulp down chicken salad many of they use fork with black thread tie about they to show they be borrow from mr eubank they drink lemonade from a fine glass pitcher that have come as a gratuitous mark of esteem from the tea merchant patronize by the hostess and they congeal themselves pleasantly with vanilla ice-cream eat from dish of excellent press glass that have come one by one as the robinson family consume its baking powder but miss caroline would have be dense indeed have she not divine even amid that informal babble that she be be view by the lady of the club with a shocked stupefaction precisely what emotion this knowledge leave with she i have never know but i do know that before the meeting break up it have be agree to hold the next one at the house of miss caroline herself it may be that she suggest and urge this in pure desperation wish to regain a favor which she have feel unaccountably withdraw and it may be that the lady accept in a similar desperation know not how to inform she that she be grossly ineligible for membership in a home study club the intervene two week be fill with tale and talk of miss caroline 's heresy excitement and adverse criticism be almost universally arouse it be a scandal of proportion almost equal to that of she love for strong drink about most writer one could be permit to have a opinion but it be not think that one could properly have a opinion about shakspere and so far as we know no one have ever before subject he to this indignity one might as well have a opinion about virtue or the law of gravitation a opinion of any sort be impossible one favorable would be puny futile immodestly patronize a unfavorable opinion have heretofore not be within realm of the idlest speculation there be but two of we i believe who do not promptly condemn miss caroline 's violence of speech -- two man of vary part westley keyt frankly say he have never be able to get into shakspere and consider it as a book for read purpose inferior to cudjo 's cave which he have read three time the minister whose church miss caroline now patronize -- that term be choose after some deliberation -- hold up both he hand at the news and mildly exclaim well then after a pause well well and still again after another pause well well well this be think to be shifty and evasive -- certainly not so outspoken as the town have a right to expect solon denney though in he heart true to shakspere affect to be gleeful a paragraph mysterious to many include miss caroline appear in the ensue _ argus _ : -- a encounter long suppose by scientist to be a mere metaphysical abstraction of almost playful import have at last occur in sober physics the irresistible force have meet up with the immovable body we look for result next week i know that solon consider miss caroline to be a irresistible force i be uncertain whether shakspere or mr pott be mean by the immovable body i know that he hold they in equal awe and i know that mr pott feel in a way responsible for shakspere this far west of boston regard any attack upon he as a personal affront to herself on the day of the next meeting the lady of the club gather in the dingy and inelegant drawing-room of miss caroline no vividly flowered carpet deck the floor only a time-toned rug that leave the outer edge of the floor untidily expose its dull stain no gilt and onyx table bear its sculptured fantasy by the busy roger the mantel and shelf be bare of those fix ornament that should decorate the waste place of all true home there be no flint arrow-head no specimen no varnished pine cone no rock of age no waxen lily not even a china cup goldenly emblazon with love the giver in german script and there be no beautiful chair with delicate gilded spindle -- not a elegant and impracticable chair in the whole big room -- not one chair which could not be occupy as comfortably as any common kitchen rocker it be indeed a poor place obviously the woman 's best room yet show careless trace of almost daily use to lady who never open they best room save to dust and air they on day when company be expect and who would as soon have lounge in they informally as they would have desecrate a church this laxity be heinous and ordinarily in the best room of one another the lady become spontaneously rigidly formal as they assemble speak in tone suitably stiff of the day 's paper or view with hushed esteem those art treasure that surround they but so difficult be it to attain this formality amid the homely surroundings of miss caroline that to-day they not only lounge with negligent ease in the big chair and on the poor broad sofa but they talk familiarly of they household concern quite as if they have be in one of they own second-best room on any common day on a table in one cool corner be a huge bowl of thin silver whence issue a baffling fragrance discreet observation as the throng gather reveal this to contain a large block of ice and a color liquid in which float cherry with slice of lemon and orange a ladle of generous line repose in the bowl and circle it on the table be many small cup there be a feeling of relief when these detail have be ascertain fear have be feel that miss caroline might forget herself and offer they a glass of wine or something worse from a large black bottle for little arcady believe in its innocent remoteness that the devil 's stuff come in no other way than large black bottle miss eubank have make sure that the lady wear they white ribbon marcellum 's own satin bow be larger than common so that no one might mistake the principle of the heart beat beneath it but the cool big bowl with its harmless fruit restore confidence at once and when miss caroline urge they to try clem 's punch they refrain not the walk to the north end of town on a sultry afternoon have qualify they to receive its consolation and they gather gratefully about marcellum eubank quaff the first beaker a trifle timorously it be true for the word punch have stir within she a vague memory of sinister association sometime she have read a tale in which one howard melville have go to the great city and wreck a career of much promise by accept a glass of something from the hand of a beautiful but thoughtless girl pampered child of the banker with whom he have secure a position for a dread moment marcellum seem to recall that the fatal draught be name punch but after a tentative sip of the compound at hand she decide that it must have be something else -- doubtless a glass of sparkling wine for this punch before she be palpably of a babe 's innocence indeed it taste rather like a inferior lemonade but it be cold and marcellum toss off a second cup of it she could make better lemonade herself and she murmur slightingly of the stuff to aunt delium mccormick it want more lemon and more sugar say marcellum firmly aunt delium press back the white satin bow on she bosom in order to manage she second glass with entire safety i do not know marcellum she say in a dreamy undertone after drain the cup to its cherry i do not know -- it do seem to take hold for all it taste so trifling as each lady arrive she be lead to the punch-bowl when the last one have be teach the way to that cool nook there be a pleasant hum of voice in the room there be still a undercurrent of difference as to the punch 's merit -- other than mere coolness though miss eubank now agree with aunt delium that it possess virtue not to be discern in the first careless draught the conversation continue to be general to the immense delight of the hostess for she have dread the ordeal of that formal opening with its minute of the last meeting and she have dare even to hope that the day 's paper might by tactful management be avert she wax more daringly hopeful when clem come to refill the punch-bowl she feel that she owe much to the heat of the day which be insure the thirst of the arrival the punch and general conversation seem to suffice they even after they first thirst have be allay she begin to wonder if the lady be not a more unbending and genial lot than she have once suspect a considerable group of they now chat vivaciously about the replenish bowl include madam the president who have arrive very thirsty indeed and who be now between sip account for the singular favor which the adam family have always find in the sight of god and the people of massachusett she seem to be prevail over not without difficulty by aunt delium who relate she failure to learn from clem the ingredient of he acceptable punch this be not surprising for clem be either never able or never willing to tell how he make anything whatever of this punch aunt delium have be able to wheedle from he only that it contain some little fixin 's insistent question do develop further that cold tea be one of these but cold tea do not make plain its recondite potency -- do not explain why a beverage so unassuming to the taste should inspire one with a wish to partake of it continuously we might get he to make a barrel of it for the sunday-school picnic say marcellum brightly over she fourth cup if it contain only a little tea perhaps the effect upon the child would not be deleterious we 'll try it say aunt delium reach for the ladle at sight of empty cup in the hand of mr judge robinson and mr westley keyt _ i 'll _ furnish the cherry and the sugar and the tea how it come about be never quite understand by the lady but the true and formal note of a lady ' home study club be never once strike that afternoon madam the president do not call the meeting to order the minute of the last meeting be unread to this day and a motion to adjourn never become necessary it have be think wisest to keep entirely away from poetry at this meeting and the paper for the day to have be read by marcellum eubank be the pathos of charle dickens marcellum have take unusual pain in its preparation bring with she two volume of the author from which to read at the right moment the death of little nell and paul dombey she have practice these until she could make she voice quaver effectively and she have look forward to a genuine ovation when she sit down -lrb- illustration : we might get he to make a barrel of it for the sunday-school picnic -rrb- if it be clearly understand then that no one thought of call for the paper that even its proud author feel the hour glide by without any poignant regret it should be see that the occasion have strangely come to be one of pure and joyous relaxation with never a instructive or culture or studious moment there be talk of domestic concern sprightly town gossip mirth wit and anecdote aunt delium mccormick tell she parrot story which be _ risqu _ even when no gentleman be present for the parrot say damn it in the course of he surprisingly human repartee under difficulty mr westley keyt the bar be down thereupon begin another parrot story but miss eubank who have observe that all parrot story have damn in they suddenly conceive that matter have go far enough in _ that _ direction affect not to have hear mr keyt 's opening of a return missionary make a gift of a parrot to two elderly maiden lady -- marcellum lead the would-be anecdotist to the punch-bowl and under the cover of operation there speak to she in a undertone mr keyt say that the thing have be print right out on the funny page of hearth and home but over the cup of punch that marcellum press upon she she consent to forego it on account of the minister 's wife be present there be other anecdote however not of a parrot character but chiefly of funny saying of the little one at home mr judge robinson with the artistic mendacity of you true _ raconteur _ accredit to she own four-year-old a speech about the star be hole in the floor of heaven although it be say of this gem in harper 's drawer where she have read it that the follow good one come to we from a lady subscriber in the well-known city of x -- it could not be recall afterwards how from this harmless exchange they have come to be listen to passage from the adventurous life of childe harold read crisply by they hostess still less could the lady later comprehend how some of they number have be guilty of innuendo -- or worse -- against the well-known bard of avon yet so it be miss caroline herself have refrain from abuse he -- have seem to have forget he indeed but as she read byron to they they heart open to she -- rush out indeed with a friendly wholeness that demand something more than mere cordial applause of she favorite poet some intimation of a sympathy with she view of the other poet come to seem not ungraceful during one of the reader 's pause to impress upon they the splendor of the byronic imagery and eke its human heart-warmth good aunt delium with defiant look about the circle break in with : -- i should not wonder if shakspere _ have _ be make too much over mr keyt step loyally into the breach thus effect westley think shakspere be not such a _ awful _ good book she say feel she way though it seem to I it have some very interesting and excellent piece in it shakspere be _ ver-ry _ uneven remark mr judge robinson in a tone of dignified concession there be always a word to be say on either side of these matter -- there be undeniably room for controversy thus mr pott in she best manner of authority from the punch-bowl let the dead rest gently murmur miss eubank from she dreamy corner of the biggest sofa she inflection be archly significant one have to suspect that shakspere alive and a fair target for dispraise might have learn something to he advantage if not to he delight miss caroline be both surprise and gratify at the previous meeting she have detect no sign of this concurring sentiment she plunge again into byron with renew enthusiasm the afternoon come to a glorious end and the lady depart with many expression of rejoice they have find miss caroline so charming that several of they be tear with fresh pity and bring to the verge of tear when they think of she furniture marcellum eubank do cry on the way home and have to put down she green barege veil but that be for thinking of poor little paul dombey she be mourn he as a personal loss also must she have adore the genius of a master who could thus move she from a calm that be constitutional with every known eubank chapter xviii in which the game be play the next _ argus _ say of miss caroline 's afternoon that the lady present one and all report a most enjoyable time there be another mysterious paragraph too farther down the column of local which proclaim that the immovable body have at last be strike by the irresistible force and have fail to live up to its reputation it move and move so you could see it move another bubble explode we live in a sensational age now while it be true that the lady one and all have speak with entire enthusiasm of they afternoon at the unpretentious home of my neighbor i nevertheless deem it vital to hold plain speech with that impulsive woman immediately i see indeed that i should have act after the incident of the mint julep solon denney who have experience the hospitality of miss caroline and who could speak from a wider knowledge than we minister or the lady of the town have once say : -- those mint julep be simple honest thing they taste injurious from the start but that punch -- it be hypocritical it steal into you brain as a little child steal its rosebud hand into yours beguiling you with prattle but afterwards -- well if i have the choice i would rather be chloroform and strike sharply with a axe i would be my old self again sooner whereupon he would have write a guard piece for the paper about this have i not dissuade he but i see that i must at once have with miss caroline what in a later day come to be call a heart-to-heart talk and i forthwith summon what valor i could for the ordeal i never dream -- i never suspect -- how _ should _ i she murmur pathetically after my open speech of a few simple but tell phrase she listen in genuine horror while i give the reason why she might justly regard the call of we minister and she entertainment of the club as nothing short of adventure -- adventure which she have survive scathless not but by the favor of a indulgent providence so _ that _ be what those little white satin bow mean she ask and i say that it most emphatically be i suspect it might be some kind of mourning for baby -- a local custom you know though it do seem queer what can they think of I they do not know what to think now i say and if you be wise you will never let they know the colonel be proud of that punch she muse i dare say he have reason i answer grimly especially after cousin looshe peavey come to spend christmas with we one time the colonel have always consider cousin looshe rather arrogant about this punch and it may have be a special brew i know that cousin have a immense respect for it after he be able -- that be -- afterwards -- i can easily believe it cherry brandy -- jamaica rum -- pint of madeira -- gill of port -- a bit of cordial -- some sherry -- i forget if there be anything else i grasp the chair in which i sit heaven forbid i cry and do not tell I anyway -- i be reel now but of course there be lemon and orange and cherry and tea and _ quantity _ of ice to weaken it -- the whole frozen polar sea itself could not weaken that mixture of elemental force see to it i go on sternly that you remember only the innocent part of it if you be ever ask for the recipe she actually cower also as to mint julep -- remember that you have forget if you ever know how they be make dear _ dear _ -- and we bishop do enjoy he mint julep so that be different i say they be probably raise together and that afternoon i think something of the sort be necessary do you know they seem rather cold to I at that other meeting -- and of course there be not enough of it to hurt they you intention be amiable i concede but you carelessness be criminal -- nothing short of it you lay the train for a scandal that would have shake slocum county to its remotest outlying cornfield and even make itself feel over this whole sovereign state i be gratify to see that she shudder i shall never learn she plead they life be so different let they at least live it out to its natural end such as it be i urge hereupon confess herself unnerved miss caroline lead I to the dining room and in a glass of madeira from a cask forward by second-cousin colonel lucius quintus peavey csa she pledge herself to preserve the decency as these have be codify in little arcady by the son and daughter of temperance for my part i drink to she continuance in the wondrous favor of heaven thereafter i be bind to say miss caroline conduct herself with a discretion that be admirable upon more than one occasion i be make to notice this one of they be at a evening entertainment at the eubank home that autumn to which it be my privilege to escort she a large and brilliant company be present to quote from a competent authority and the refreshment be recherche to quote again this be i believe the first of we social function at which japanese paper napkin be hand around eustace eubank entertain one and all by exhibit and describe lantern view of important scene in the holy land marcellum sing comin ' thro ' the rye with such iron restraint that the most fastidious among we could have find no cause for offence and eustace sing a innocent song of war and bloodshed and death all go well until eustace be press for more venture a drinking song whether this have be censor by he household i have never learn perhaps there have be demur -- there be almost certain to have be and possibly eustace have hold out for the thing because of the rare opportunity it afford for the exercise of he lowest tone perhaps it have be deem wise to indulge he in this lest in rebellion he break all bond of propriety and revert to the bedouin love song at any rate he sing drink a song that laud the wine-cup as chiefest of godless joy and terminate in drinking thrice reiterate of which each individual one finish so much lower than it begin that the last one seem to expire in the bottomless pit many of those present appear to enjoy this song even marcella eubanks seem for once to have soar above mere principle into the unmoral realm of art for art 's sake but it fall to be say and i say it with a pride which i think should not excite cavil that miss caroline frown splendidly from the first moment that the song 's true character be reveal she superbly evince uneasiness moreover when the thing be do as if to say one can not tell _ what _ may occur in a place where _ that _ be permit and she performance be not observe by myself alone marcellum see it and speed to she brother who after listen to hurry word from she dash into the lose chord with a swift and desperate fervor as if to allay all alarm in the mind of this sensitive guest eustace be at heart as earnestly well mean as any eubank that ever live and he vagary in song be attributable solely to a trust nature capriciously endow with a dash of the artistic temperament it be only a dash however beyond doubt have he family but know he could have sing the bedouin love song and be none the worse for it if miss caroline 's eloquent pantomime at this time arouse a suspicion that she have be malign as to she habit of drink she behavior on a subsequent evening when mr judge robinson entertain leave no one to doubt it there be music too on this occasion -- describe elsewhere as a gala occasion -- after eustace have conclude he part of the entertainment and get he lantern out of the way -- music by a quartet consist of messr fancett and eubank first and second bass and messr updyke and g brown first and second tenor in excellent accord these tenor and bass so blameless in they living lift up they voice and sing they would that the wavelet of ocean be wavelet of sparkling champagne it be a blithe and ripple morceau if one could forget the well-nigh cosmic depravity of it but miss caroline it appear be not able to forget she confide as much to marcellum eubank and aunt delium mccormick intimate that while she be doubly desirous to be pleased because of she position as a outsider she be nevertheless a silly old woman encrust with prejudice and she could not deny that she find this song _ suggestive _ she eye glisten when she say it and marcellum feel like pin a white ribbon to she then and there escort miss caroline to she home that night i listen to she account of this colloquy and find myself wish that matter have be different it seem to I that i must ultimately become the victim of a romantic passion for she and i tell she as much when we part gossip the yellow-tongued dragon have be track to its lair and do to death or at least that one of its head have be smite off which babble slander of miss caroline thenceforth she and i be free to think upon other matter and there be these other matter in both we life as to most of they we do not hold speech together we intimacy as yet lay quite within a circle so charm that it might not be enter by thing too personal to either of we by a kind of tacit treaty we bring thither none but those affair which invite a not too serious tone we late common life have provide a abundance of these and they have be hail by my friend with a unfailing levity which the widow of j rodney pott for one would have find it impossible to condone i be a light old woman she have say to I i laugh at the world even when i fear it most there be a desperate sprite of banter in she eye when she make this confession a sprite that leap forth to be gay when i shrived she but though we sacredly observe all mirthful convention in we dally i know that miss caroline have more than enough to ponder of matter weighty i know that she be likely to have regret a too-ready sharing of clem 's easy enthusiasm over industrial condition in the north clem believe by instinct not only that the evil thereof be sufficient unto the day but that the incidental good sufficeth also he quality of faith would have seem a pointed rebuke to the common run of believer in a providence that watch and send confront by the spectre of present want he could exorcise it neatly by the device of behold in a contrary vision future limitless pullet of a marketable immaturity or endless acre of garden produce ripe and ready to sell moreover he experience with gold money be as yet insufficient to acquaint he with its truly volatile character all sum greater than a hundred dollar be blessedly alike to he -- equally prodigious two hundred or thousand or ten of thousand send the same ray of light through the spectrum of he poetic mind and a bank be a institution of such abiding grace that have once establish a connection with it one possess forever a stout prop in time of need i be sure indeed that miss caroline have define these limitation of clem as a financier it be one of those enjoyable topic which we have be free to discuss that she have discover how lamentably he resource have be reduce by freight toll on she furniture i could only infer but i know at least that she be aware of the blister rainless summer that have lay clem 's high hope of a garden in dust and cut off half he revenue plainly miss caroline have more than enough of matter fit to engage she graver moment for my own part i too have matter to dwell upon of a equal gravity in they own poor way though perhaps too i could not have define they as understandingly as i do the perplexity of my neighbor happily the feat need not be attempt i have the game in which trouble may be play away at least beyond the necessity for analyze they -- the game which require two deck and be to be play alone -- the most efficacious of those device for the solitary which card afford i have be make acquaint with its scheme and with some of its cruder virtue by a certain illustrious soldier whom i be once much throw with he confess to I that he play it before a battle to inspire he with coolness and after a battle to learn wise behavior under victory or defeat as it might have be i be persuade to learn more of it i play the thing at first to be sure as i have notice that novice always do with a mind so bent upon get it that i be insensible of its curative and refining agency you have not the secret yet say my mentor who watch I as i win for the first time and be move to warn I by my unconcealed pride in this achievement after you have play it a few year you 'll learn that the value of it lie chiefly in lose you 'll try like the devil to win of course but you 'll learn not to wish for it to win be nothing but a endless pile up of the right card begin with the ace and end with the king and it only mean more shuffling for next time but every time you lose you will learn thing about everything it be even as he say -- it take I year to learn this true merit of the game and still as he have say i learn much from it of life there be a fine moment at the last shuffling of the card a moment when free will and fatalism be indistinguishably merge i be ready to lay down eight card in a horizontal row off my double deck who will say that the precise number of shuffle i have give to it be preordained i do exclaim a oblige fatalist the sequence of every one of those card be determine when we be yet star-dust i bring confusion to he by perform half a dozen other shuffle i be thus far the master of my unborn game -- another last shuffle to prove it though i shuffle clumsily enough i glance disdainfully at the fatalist whom i have refute and prepare again to lay down the first row of card but the fellow come back with those last shuffle be also determine as be this challenge -- very well and i prepare for still another rearrangement but here i reflect that this could be endless and not at all interesting i dismiss the fatalist as a quibbler and play on now there be no dispute unless there be other quibbler fix be the order in which the card shall fall eight at a time there be pure fatalism but in the moving after each eight be deal i shall consciously choose and judge which be pure free will -- or a imitation of it sufficiently colorable to satisfy any but quibbler there for I be the fatalism of body the free will of soul of these i learn when i play the game now my first eight card be down in a horizontal row there be two king among they which be auspicious for king must be place sometime at the top there be a red queen also auspicious to be place on one of the black king there be a ace of diamond and its deuce good again the ace be place above the row begin a row of ace to be place there as fast as they fall and the deuce be place atop of it for in that row the suit will be build _ up _ each in its kind in the lower row the suit be to be build down and cross as when i play the red queen on the black king so that only the top of he crown head can be see then i play a red eight on a black nine and a black seven on the red eight i be now leave most fortunately with five space when i deal off my second row of eight -- five space into which it may be a king or two shall happily fall the game usually become intense after the third eight card be play by that time a choice must be make shall this black six or the other be play on the red seven one must be wise for either will release important card the game have start so well that it promise to play out too easily -- which be one of its trick presently a deuce will be cover by a king for which no space be ready a dark queen will be bury under a succession of smaller card crowd along with apparent carelessness but relentlessly now a space be open for the king that cover the deuce but the king have meantime be cover by a insignificant but unmanageable four-spot and can not be reach the game be not so absurdly easy as it promise to be still it may be win by clever playing there follow eight card that prove to be immovable and the issue be almost in doubt now the last eight card be down and the game be suddenly see to be lose one small other shuffle might have win it if that tray of spade have fall one place to the right or leave the thing would now be easy if it be a deuce or a four the thing be easy one spot on the card have bring ruin the game have foiled we with its own peculiar cleverness but then we learn to expect failure and most important of all we learn to succeed while fail we learn to see we card fall wretchedly without a tremor we learn to take small gain that offer and to watch unmoved while splendid chance come to naught we learn to live life and to waste no energy in vain wish that we have shuffle differently we learn even to marvel admiringly at the unobtrusive cunning which thwart we of we dream 's own -- to wonder that card ever should come right for any player in that maze of chance and faulty judgment and we learn above all to brush the thing together without loss of time and to play a new hand with the same old hope as i study the card make sure of my defeat -- one must be most careful to do that a way be sometimes to be find -- it be not strange that i fall to thinking of the face on my neighbor 's wall i have muse often upon it since that first night it seem curiously enough to be a face that have long be mistily afloat in my shut eye a girl 's face that have a trick of blend from time to time with the face of another i have better reason to know unaccountably they have come and go one follow by the other of that last new face in my vision i could make nothing save that some one seem to have paint it over there in the other house how i have come by my own mind copy of it be a mystery to I beyond solution i play the game again to still this perplexity which have a way of seize I at odd moment it be a especially good game for a man who have have to believe that life will always beat he chapter xix a worthless black hound after a autumn speciously benign come we season of cold and snow it prove to be a season of unwonted severity every weather expert in town from uncle william mccormick who have keep a diary record for thirty year to grandma steck who have foretell its come from a goose-bone agree that the cold be most unusual the editor of the _ argus _ not only speak of nature 's snowy mantle but coin another happy phrase about little arcady be lock in the icy embrace of winter this be admit to be accurately literal in spite of its poetic daring miss caroline confess homesickness to I after the first heavy snow she speak as lightly of it as she should have do but i could see that she own land pull at she heart with every blast that shake she casement no longer however be there even a second-cousin whose hospitality she be free to claim for colonel lucius quintus peavey csa now sleep with he father in far-off virginium leave behind he only tradition and a little old sherry the former miss caroline have always share with he and a cask of the latter he bequeath to she with he love and the valley be now void of she kin she be doubly a exile such new desolation as she must have feel be mask under jest dispraise of we execrable northern climate surely a land permit to congeal so utterly have forfeit the grace of its maker clem 's lack of executive genius also earn a meed of my neighbor 's disparagement he be a worthless trifling boy a idle dreamer a irresponsible inconsequent visionary in whose baseless fancy it be astounding that a woman of she year should fatuously place reliance i must confess that i be more than once guilty of irritation when miss caroline speak thus slightingly of she boy -- of one who have be unable to view himself as other than she personal property again and again it seem to I that fine little creature that she be she tone toward clem lack the right feeling i should not have demand gratitude precisely at least no bald expression of it but a manner of speech denote if not wording a recognition of he unswerving loyalty would have accord better with the estimate i have otherwise form of she character the absence of any tone or word that even one so devoted as i could construe to she advantage be puzzling in the extreme still feel toward she as i do i be compel to excuse she as best i might by attribute she hardness to a evil system now happily abolish but the nerve in my lose arm seem to tingle with a secret satisfaction when i thought of clem 's empty reward for he life-work and remember that i have help though ever so little to free he and he kind from a bond so unfortunate for each of the party to it the winter deepen about we chill and bleak and ravage the smoke from we chimney go up in tall column that lose themselves in the gray sky the snow shut we in and presently the wind lay in wait to blast we when we dare the drift yet miss caroline throve despite she nostalgia she be even jaunty in she recital of the weather 's minor hardship to its rigor she bring a front of resolute gayety a new stove grace the parlor a stove with the proud nickeled title of frost king a title see to be deserve when clem have it properly gorge with dry wood within its tropic radiation miss caroline bloom and be hale of be like some hardy perennial of clem nothing but hardiness be to be anticipate he have be toughen by four other of we winter all say to have be unusual for severity and yet it be clem curiously enough and not miss caroline who find the season most try true he have to be abroad most of the time procure sustenance for the insatiable frost king or perform labor for other people by which miss caroline should preserve she independence but it be not suppose that a creature of he sort could be subject to weakness natural enough to a superior race i believe this be he own view of the matter for when he admit to I one morning that he have take cold in the chest he manner be one of deprecate confusion and he swear I against betrayal of he lapse to miss caroline she discover he guilt for herself however after a few day from he very annoying cough she tax he with it so sturdily that effort at deception avail he not he tale that the snow sift into he bref-place and tickle it be pitifully unconvincing for he cough be deeper than eustace eubank 's proudest note in the drinking song he be a worthless thing say miss caroline tell I of he fault and i say he be indeed -- that he have not serve I four year without my finding _ that _ out i add that he be undoubtedly shamming but that at the same time it might be as well to take a few simple precaution miss caroline say that of course he be sham in order to get out of work and that she would soon drive _ that _ nonsense out of he head if she have to wear the black wretch out to do it she add that she be about tired of he nonsense it may be know that i have heretofore lose no opportunity to foist all fault of understand upon the head of my fellow-townsmen and i should have like to keep my record clear in that matter but it would be uncandid to pretend even at this late day that i have ever divine the precise relationship that exist between miss caroline and she slave i may know a bit more of its intricacy than do little arcady at large but not enough to permit that certain thrill of superior discernment which i have so often be able to enjoy in slocum county each of the two consider alone be fairly comprehensible but take together there be something between they which must always baffle I -- something which i can not believe to have be at all typical of the relation between owner and slave else many of the fact note by we discerning and impartial investigator be either imperfectly observe or unintelligently report up to a certain point my own study of this slave-holder align perfectly with the information which we of the north have be at such pain to gather and i try to hold miss caroline blameless remember that she have be long school to the inhumanity of it i resolve nevertheless to take clem under my own roof -- there be a small unused room almost directly under it -- the moment miss caroline 's impatience with he should move she to the extreme foretell by she abusive fashion of speech i would not see even a negro turn out in the coldest of winter for no better reason than that he be sick and useless though i plan to intervene delicately so as not to affront my neighbor for my heart be still hers despite this hardness for which i see that she must not be blame as i have fear clem 's cough become more obtrusive and with this miss caroline 's irritation deepen toward he she declare that he trifling no-account nature make he all but impossible then one morning -- one to be distinguish by its cold even among many unusual morning -- there be no clem to light my fire and to scent my snug dining room with unparalleled coffee this bring it definitely home to I that the situation have become grave i dress with what speed i could and hurry to miss caroline 's door the time have come when i should probably have to do something my neighbor meet I and say that clem have meanly decide to remain in bed for the day i search she face for some sign of consideration as she say this but i be disappointed she seem to feel only a fierce disgust for he foolishness but you may go up and look at the black good-for-nothing if you like she say grudgingly enough i think i climb the brief flight of stair i know that clem have not refuse to get up without reason that seem sufficient to he in a narrow bed in one of the doll-house room he lay cough so you can not get up this morning i ask yes seh mahstah majah ah _ be _ a-gittin ' up but ah be fohce to cough raght smahtly a ' miss cahline she yeh it a ' she awdeh I back to baid seh then ah call out to huh that ah be not go 'n' a ' have no sech foolishness in this yeh place a ' so she staht to come up which fohce I to retiah huhiedly then she stand theh at th ' head of th ' staih a ' she fault I -- yes seh -- she _ threaten _ I mahstah majah a ' she tek mah clothes away a ' so on a ' so fothe then ah huhd huh a ' mekin ' th ' fiah a ' then she brung this yeh cawfee a ' she do mek it that foolish that ah can not tech it yes seh she plumb ruin that theh cawfee _ that be _ what she do he tone be peevish clem himself be not talk as i think would have be become in he and there be a definite issue of veracity between he and he mistress i go down again for the room be cold he have some fever i say he be a lazy black hound say miss caroline he say you order he to stay in bed -- threaten he and hide he clothes oh never fear but what that fellow will always have a excuse she retort shortly observe that she have a day 's supply of wood at hand i leave not a little annoyed at both of they i miss my coffee when i knock at the door that evening no one come to admit I i go in hearing clem 's voice in truculent protest from a large room on the first floor which have be call the room of little miss i go to the door of this room clem and he bed be there we have two physician in little arcady old doc and young doc young doc be now present measure powder into little papers which he fold neatly while miss caroline stand at hand cowering but stubborn under clem 's violence miss cahline yo ' suttinly old enough t ' know betteh 'n that ah do wish yo ' paw be about th ' house -- he maghty quickly put yo ' - all in yo ' place now ah tole yo ' ah be not go 'n' a ' have none o ' this yeh doctah foolishness yo ' not go 'n' a ' stravagate all that theh gole money on sech crazy doin 's a ' mek we be indigent in ouah ole aige what ah _ want _ with a doctah hanh anseh I that yo ' - all je ' git I a little bit calamus a ' some catnip a ' ah do all th ' doctahin ' tha 's advisable all this he bring out with difficulty for he breathing be by no means free he be up to he trick say miss caroline contemptuously to I then to clem seem to draw courage from my presence you be quiet there you lazy black good-for-nothing or i 'll get some one here to wear you out and clem be again the vanquished pneumonia say young doc bad he add as we step into the drawing-room take lot of care i think it as well that young doc have come old doc though well like boast that all any man of he profession need really be calomel and a good knife young doc have always seem to be subtler anyway he be of a later generation i learn that old doc have scorn to make the call believe that a nigger could not suffer from anything but yellow fever or crack shin for this reason he become genuinely interested in clem 's case as it be later report to he by young doc to the rest of little arcady the case be also of interest sympathy have heretofore be with clem because miss caroline pay he no wages and be believe to take what he earn from other people now however a important number of person veer -- in wonder if not in absolute sympathy that the woman should watch and nurse the black fellow apparently with perfect single-heartedness be not to be square with any known law of human association nurse a nigger in she own house with she own hand be the fashion of describe this untoward spectacle it be like take a sick horse into you house and make play that it be human the already puzzle town be further mystified and it be probable that miss caroline fall a little in public esteem she course be not think to be edifying she could have send clem to the county poor farm where he would have be see to after a fashion good enough for one of he color by the proper authority my own bewilderment be at first hardly less than the town 's have miss caroline suddenly change she manner toward clem show regret however belated for she previous abuse of he i should have understand that would have be a simple case of awaken sensibility but she continue to disparage he to he face and to I she be venomous -- scurrilous in she abuse yet only with the greatest difficulty could i persuade she to let I share the watch that must be keep over he she call he a infamous black wretch in tone befitting she word but i could not get she to leave he even so long as she own health demand there come night however as the disease run its course when she have to give up from sheer lack of force then she permit I to watch though even at these time she often break from sleep to come and be assure that the worthless black hound have not change for the worse one dim early morning when she think i have go after my night 's watch i return softly to the half-opened door with a forget injunction about the medicine all night clem have babble languidly of many thing of a hunded thousan ' hatchin ' aig and a thousan ' brillion dollah of mahstah jere and little miss of a visit cousin peavey whom he have be oblige to whup for he repeated misdemeanor and darkly and often have he whisper so low i could scarcely hear it of a enemy that be enter the room with a fell design _ tha ' _ he be -- he go 'n' a ' sprinkle snake-dust in mah boot -- tha ' he be -- watch _ out _ he still maunder weakly as i reach the door but it be not this that detain I at its threshold it be miss caroline who have actually kneel at he side at first i think she weep over one of he blue-black hand which she cling eagerly to with both she own then i see that there seem to be no tear -- yet silently almost impassively she give I a sense of hopeless grief that i think no outburst of weep could have do i wonder wildly then if she fashion of speech for clem might not mask some real affection for he but this be unsatisfying on the spot i give up all wonder forever about miss caroline i have ever since constrain myself to accept she without question even in situation of difficulty there be so much vain knowledge that day too be the bad day when news come that little miss have be stricken with the same dread pneumonia when she tell I this miss caroline have a look in she eye that i suspect must often have be there in the first half of the sixty it be calm enough but there be a resistance in it that promise to be unbreakable and to my never-ending wonder she seem still to be more concerned about clem than about she daughter will you go to she i ask she smile that could hardly be afford just now you could manage it i think clem have some money due from I even so i could not leave clem my daughter will be care for but clem would not have anybody we 'll fight it out on this line major i now see that continuous question about miss caroline would bring one in time to madness and i be glad of my resolve never again to indulge in this unprofitable occupation but even pneumonia have its defeat young doc surprise old doc again for the latter once convince that a african could suffer so civilized a affliction as pneumonia have decline to believe that he could ever throw it off and have disclose good reason why he could not to a attentive group at the city drug store yet after a night when miss caroline have refuse to let I watch she meet I at the door as young doc be leave she be wearied but chipper though there be a unsteady little lift in she voice as she say : -- that lazy black wretch be go to get well it be about time i say grimly i have be in a bad way without he indeed i be very glad to hear you say so she eye twinkle approval upon I i think you have behave excellently major really i be glad that we leave you that other arm this be almost in she old manner though she eye seem a little dimmed by she excitement then with a sudden return to the patient : -- i wonder if you would be good enough to go in and swear at clem he be perfectly rational now and it will hearten he wonderfully he be dreadfully mortified because he be be sick so long and it need a man you know really i 'll close the door for you do it hard call he a damned black hound if you please and ask he what he mean by it i hurry in for miss caroline 's eye be threaten to betray she chapter xx in which something must be do clem 's prolonged convalescence be a trial to he militant spirit the month or more of curious weakness in he body always before so stout leave he with a fear that he have be pah ` lyze in th ' frame moreover there be trouble less intimately personal to he but not less harass to the household there be little miss who be make a fight like clem 's own in a baltimore hospital each day i bear to miss caroline a telegram detail the progress of she daughter though it have cost I time and trouble to convince my correspondent that he be not to skimp such encouragement as might be he to offer merely to comprise it within ten word there be three day it be true when ten word be more than enough in which to be non-committal and there be a day that come upon the heel of these when the profit of the telegraph company must have be unusual for only two word come instead of ten -- recovery doubtful this might as well have be leave unsent for i tear it up and assure the wait pair that no news be good news they try eagerly to believe this aphorism which have the authority of age but which i suspect be coin originally from despair the next day 's bulletin read temperature still up but make a strong fight stupid it be when these be but eight word not to have add two more such as very hopeful i induce we telegraph operator to rectify this oversight and feel repay for my trouble when i show the message that last touch seem to have be need of course little miss would make a strong fight miss caroline and clem both know that but they have know other strong fight to be none the less hopeless and they be grateful for those last two word of qualification there be four other day when the report seem to need judicious editing and in this i do not prove remiss as the telegraph company remain indifferent i could see that no harm be do for at last come a bulletin of seventeen word which leave we assure that little miss have conquer henceforth we could receive the thing without that stifle dread that eager fearfulness of the eye to read all the word in one glance leisurely could we learn that little miss be get back she strength and miss caroline and i could laugh at clem 's fear that she also would find herself pah ` lyze in th ' frame after that miss caroline and i be free to consider another matter weighty enough with pneumonia out of the run this be a matter of way and mean -- of sheer downright money when clem in the first day of he sickness have warn miss caroline that she would not be let to waste all that gold money he lofty reference as a matter of cold figure be to a sum less than nine dollar i forget the precise amount but that be near enough -- nine dollar in round number and the winter have be a expensive one at the lowest time of doubt when miss caroline have affair of extreme gravity to face i have speak to she incidentally of money that i owe to clem for service perform and i have in fact pay several instalment of the debt as money seem to be need when clem 's recovery be assure and i urge miss caroline to go to little miss she ask I bluntly what sum i have owe clem i feel oblige to confess that it be not more than two hundred dollar this must have surprise miss caroline as much as it rejoice she for she take up the matter with clem and in so clumsy a fashion that he perhaps owe to he enfeebled condition witlessly make a confession at variance with mine and with a effect of candor that move he questioner to take he word rather than that of a officer and a gentleman of course this be not at all like clem in refer to sum of money due he he have ever be wont to chant they with a bard-like inflation that recognize only sum of a vague but immense rotundity i have never know he to be thus prosaic and i suspect that miss caroline have in a sudden impulse of doubt terrify he into be so brutally explicit whence fall a coldness between miss caroline and I for the discrepancy between clem 's confession and mine be not slight even my muttering about interest have accumulate be put down as the desperate resource of embarrassment miss caroline do not even dignify they with she notice and the coldness increase yet while it be a true coldness it be distinguish by a certain alien quality of warmth for miss caroline though now on guard against any mere vulgar benevolence of mine talk to I frankly as she have never do before about she situation first it be impossible to think of go to she daughter there be debt in the town clem would be unable to work for many week and not only have little miss 's contribution from she small wage now fail but she herself have incur debt and would be without money to pay they my neighbor depict the gravity of this situation with a spirit that tax my power of admiration -- power not slight i may explain for have they not already be develop beyond the ordinary by this same woman not even be she downcast in my presence in fine she be superbly miss caroline to I if i see that to herself she be a ill-fated old woman perversely survive a wreck with which she should have go down alone in a land that seem unkind because it do not understand and in desperate strait for the commonest stuff in the world -- why that be no matter to be open between we we affect with mild philosophy to study a situation that not only do not require study but scarcely permit it by candid soul but we affect to agree that something must be do which sound very well indeed as a sign that she bear I no malice it be promise that i might hire a man to plant clem 's garden that spring with the understanding that i should thus acquire a equity in its product this seem to be in the line of that something that must be do and miss caroline and i make much of it to avoid the situation 's more embarrassing aspect if i could only sell something say my neighbor with a vacant look about the room -- a look of humorous disparagement the silver be good but there be hardly enough of it to pay one of those debt -- and i have nothing else but clem but if i try to sell he she add brightly it would only bring on trouble again with you northern president i know just how it would be we part on this jest miss caroline i believe go to be scold by clem for she trifling way while i seek out solon denney when something must be do i seem never to know what it shall be i believe solon be often quite as uncertain but he will never confess this so that talk with he under such circumstance stimulate if it do not sustain i put miss caroline 's difficulty before he as any common catalogue of trouble will not provoke solon from a happy unconcern which be temperamental i spare no detail in my recital and i observe at length that my listener be truly arouse to the bad way in which miss caroline find herself he sit forward in he chair rest one elbow upon he untidy desk and for several moment of silence jab a inky pen rhythmically into the largest rutabaga ever grow in slocum county at last he sit back and gaze upon I distantly from inspired eye then with he characteristic enthusiasm he exclaim : -- something will have to be do wonderful i murmured here i have worry over the thing for two month study it in court study it in my office study it in bed -- and could not make a thing out of it all at once i be guide to a welling fount of wisdom and the thing be solve in a flash solon you dazzle I denney forever now do not be funny calvin -- i mean do not try to be -- but i arise to go you have solve it solon _ something must be do _ there be the difference between intuition and mere clumsy ratiocination in another month i might have find this out for myself but you divine it instantly you be a clairvoyant now i be go to find billy durgin you have do the heavy work -- you have discover that something must be do what we need now i suppose be a bright young detective to tell we what it be but solon interrupted soothingly there there something must be do and of course i 'll do it what will you do even then i think he do not know we must use common sense in these matter he say to gain time and narrow he gaze for a interval of study at last he drive the pen viciously to its hilt in the rutabaga and almost shout : -- i 'll go to see mr pott before i could again express my enthusiasm reawaken by the felicitous adequacy of this device he have seize he hat and be clatter noisily down the stairway two hour later solon bustle into my own office whither i have flee to forget he manifest incompetence he hat be well back and he seem to be inflate with secrecy i remember it be thus he have impressed I just previous to the _ coup _ that have relieve we of pott i know at once that he be go to be mysterious with I i be not to say a word to any one i begin merely to show he that i be not dense he pause apparently on the point of tell I as much i see that i have read he aright i be merely to be quiet and trust everything to you i continue oh well -- if you -- one moment -- let I take a few more word out of you mouth you be not certain i be to remember that anything will come of it but you think something will you think you may say _ that _ much but i be again to remember not to talk about it there that be it be not it he be entirely serious well that be _ practically _ it but i do not mind hint a little in strict confidence he drop into a chair sit earnestly forward you see cal i remember a little remark mr pott once make i believe it be the day after mr lansdale entertain the lady ' club last summer -- i remember she be complain of a headache -- i never know mr pott to make a little remark i say i be not to be trifle with solon grin well perhaps this one be not so very little only i never think of it again until this morning it be about mr lansdale 's furniture indeed i say in cold disinterest have design to be tell more well mr pott think there may be something in it he effort be to seem significant but those thing be apt to fail with I oh i see well that be a good idea solon but you and mr pott be slow billy durgin have the same idea last summer while the furniture be be unloaded he take a good look at some of those old piece and he confide to I in strict secrecy that there be probably miss will and roll of banknote hide away in they it seem that they be the kind that have secret drawer billy know a case where a man touch a spring and find thirty thousand dollar in a secret drawer ` and from there ' as billy say ` he flee to australia ' so you can see it be be think of of course i have never speak of it because i promise billy not to -- but there be nothing in it bosh say solon of course it be bosh i could have tell billy that but some way i always feel tender about he illusion you may be sure i have learn enough of the lansdale family to know that no member of it ever hide any real money -- money that would _ spend _ -- and there have not be a will miss for at least six generation bosh again say solon it be not secret drawer no what then well -- it be worse -- and more of it be that all you have to say i ask as he stand up well that be all i can say now we must use common sense in these matter but -- mr pott have write with this cryptic utterance he stalk out there have be little need to caution I to secrecy i be not tempt to speak have i know any debtor of miss caroline 's who would have take mr pott have write in payment of he account it might have be otherwise chapter xxi little arcady be grievously shake mr pott have write i have solon 's word for it but that which follow the writing will not cease within this generation or the next to be a affair of the most baffling mystery to we town folk I also it amaze though my emotion be chiefly concern with those gracious effect which the god continue to manage from that apparently meaningless sojourn of j rodney pott among we superficially it be a thing of utter fortuity actually it be a masterpiece of cunning calculation a thing which clear-visioned person might see to bristle with intention on every side year after that innocent encounter between a adventurous negro and a amiable human derelict in the street of a far city -- those two atom shake into contact while the god affect to be engage with weightier matter -- the culture widow of that derelict recall the name of a gentleman in the east who be accustom to buy tall clock and fiddle-backed chair in she native new england pay price therefor to make one in that conservative locality rich beyond the dream of avarice almost such be the cleverly devise circumstance that now intervene between my neighbor and a indigence distressing to think about it be as if in the game a red four which one have neglect to play up should actually permit victory after a intricate series of disaster by provide a temporary resting-place for a black trey otherwise fatally obstructive cause the player to marvel afresh at that last fateful but apparently chance shuffle a week after mr pott have write the gentleman who receive she letter register as hyman cohen new york ny at the city hotel from he manner of speech when he inquire for the lansdale home it be see that he seem to be a german when miss caroline receive he a little later he ask abruptly about furniture and she in some astonishment show he what she have even to that crowd into dark room and out of use he examine it carelessly and remark that it be the worst lot that he have ever see this do not surprise miss caroline in the least though she think the gentleman 's candor exceptional little arcady 's opinion which she know to tally with he have always come to she more circuitously the strange gentleman then ask miss caroline not too urbanely if she have expect he to come all the way from new york to look at such cheap stuff miss caroline assure he quite honestly that she have expect nothing of the sort and intimate that she regret for he come surpass he own even if it must remain more obscurely word she indicate that the interview be at a end the strange gentleman arise also but as clem be about to close the door after he he offer miss caroline one hundred and fifty dollar for the lot observe again that it be worthless stuff but that in this business a man have to take chance miss caroline decline to notice this have find that there be something in the gentleman 's manner which she do not like and he go down the path reveal annoyance in the shrug of he shoulder and the sidewise tilt of he head to mr lansdale 's unaffected regret and amazement as well the gentleman return the follow morning to say that he be about to leave for new york but that he would actually pay one hundred and seventy-eight dollar for the stuff this be at least twenty-two dollar more than it could possibly be worth but the gentleman have a unfortunate passion for such thing miss caroline bow and call clem as she leave the room the gentleman return the morning of the third day to close the deal he say he have miss he train on the previous day and be a superstitious man he regard that as a augury of evil nevertheless he have resolve to take the stuff even at a price that be ruinous he unfold two hundred dollar in the presence of clem and wish to know if he might send a wagon at once clem bring back word from miss caroline who have decline to appear that the strange gentleman would oblige she by cease he remarkable intrusion whereupon the gentleman have say : oh very _ well _ then i go but he go no farther than the city hotel and here one may note a further contrivance of indirection on the part of we attend fate from the evening train of that day the ` bus bring another strange gentleman of a eastern manner but somewhat neater of dress than the first one and speak with a accent much less obtrusive this gentleman write jame walsingham price ny on the register call for a room with a bath order coffee and roll to be send there at eight-thirty the next morning and then ask to see the dinner card after mine host jake kilburn have be make to understand what dinner card mean he make mr jame walsingham price understand that there be no dinner card this be clear at last the newcomer say : oh _ very _ well then just give my order to the head-waiter will you -- there be a good chap -- a cup of consomm a bit of fish a bird of some sort broil i fancy -- er -- potato _ au gratin _ a green salad of some kind -- serve that with the bird -- a piece of camembert if it be in good condition any _ entremet _ you have and a _ demi-tasse _ i 'll mix the salad dress myself tell he -- oh yes -- and a pint of chambertin if you have something you can recommend billy durgin scrutinize the newcomer in a professional way tell I afterwards that jake kilburn bat he eye during this strange speech and reply to it like a man come to -- supper in twenty minute after which he pound a bell furiously and then himself show he new and puzzling guest to a room -- but not a room with a bath be it understand for a most excellent reason billy durgin be excite half a hour later by note the behavior of the first strange gentleman from the east as he eye fall upon this second he throw both hand into the air where they engage in rapid horizontal shaking from he pliant wrist and in hushed guttural exclaim my god my god in he own fashion of speech which be reproduce admirably for I by my informant billy be thus confirm in he earlier belief that the first strange gentleman be a house-breaker badly want somewhere and he now surmise that the newcomer must be a detective on he trail but a close watch on they meeting a little later in the evening seem to contradict this engaging hypothesis the second stranger emerge from the dining room where he have be serve with supper and as he shut the door of that banqueting hall billy stand by hear he too call upon he maker he call only once but it be in a voice so full of feeling as to make billy suspect that he be remember something unpleasant at this point the newcomer have glance up to behold the first strange gentleman and billy hold he breath expect to witness a sensational capture to he unspeakable disgust the suppose sleuth grin affably at he suppose quarry and say : ah hyman be the stuff any good how do you find it out ask the first strange gentleman the other smile winningly why i drop into you place the other day and that beautiful daughter-in-law of yours mention incidentally where you would go and what for she be a good soul hyman bright and as chatty as she can be ach that malke she go back right off to de lancey street where she belong say the first stranger plainly irritated how do you find the stuff hyman have you et you supper yet yes -- ` tis not kosher be it how do you find the stuff no it be not kosher -- nothing be not kosher it be a devilish sight worse though how do you find the stuff hyman the one call hyman here seem to despair of put off this query no good no good -- not a decent piece in the lot i pledge you my word as a gentleman i would not pay the freight on it to fourth avenue billy remark that the gentleman say pletch for pledge and afanoo for avenue the second stranger hearing this at once become strangely cheerful and insist upon shake hand with the first one fine hyman fine i be delighted to hear you say so you word lift a load of doubt from my mind it come to I in there just now that i might be incur that supper for nothing but my sin have you choke say hyman a little bitterly i have hyman i have have my ` choke ' say jame walsingham price with a glance of disrelish toward the dining room it seem clear to billy durgin who report this interview to I in a manner of able realism that these man be both crook of the first water billy at once polish he star and clean and oil he new 32-caliber bull-dog the promise of work ahead for the right man loom more brightly than ever before in he exciting career while i discuss with miss caroline that evening the unpleasant mystery of she late caller there come a note from he by messenger he offer six hundred and twenty-one dollar for she furniture the sum be write in large letter so that it have the effect of be shout from the page he further express a wish to close the deal within the half hour as he must leave town on the night train have miss caroline be alone she might have fall even i be stagger but not beyond recovery the messenger bear back at my suggestion a refusal of the offer and a further refusal to consider any more offer that evening there be indicate a need for calm daylight consideration and a face-to-face meeting with this variable mr cohen but he leave on the night train say miss caroline it may be we last chance and six hundred dollar be -- he only say he leave i respond and for three day at least mr cohen seem to have be grossly misinformed about he own movement perhaps he be deceive himself again at eight o'clock the follow morning clem serve my breakfast for the first time since he illness and i approach it with thanksgive for he recovery a knock at the door take he from I just as he have pour the first cup of real coffee i have see for nearly three month he come back with the card of one jame walsingham price whom i do not know whereas i do know the coffee fetch he here i say he can not expect I to leave this coffee whoever he be into my dining room be then usher a tall smartly dress smooth-faced man of perhaps middle age with yellowish hair compactly plaster to he head he become i think suddenly alert as he cross my threshold i arise to greet he this be -- i have to glance at the card yes -- and you be major blake i regret to disturb you major -- here he glance rest blankly upon the rich golden-brown surface of clem 's omelette and it seem to I that the thread of he intention be break for a instant by a fit of absentmindedness he resume he speech only after a appreciable pause as if the omelette have remind he of something the hour be untimely but i be tell that you be a friend of a mr lansdale who have some piece of colonial furniture she wish to let go i wonder you know if you would be good enough to introduce I i rather think some such formality might be advisable -- i understand that a shark name cohen have already approach she even as he speak i recall that mr cohen 's face in profile might provoke the vision of a shark to a person of lively imagination i shall be glad i say to present you to mr lansdale again have my caller 's glance trail across the breakfast table where the omelette the muffin and the coffee-urn wait the glance be politely unnoting but in it there yet lurk far back the unmistakable quality of a caress in a instant i remembered and with a pang of sympathy i become he hungered brother by the way mr price be you stay at the city hotel the man say it be the only place you know you have breakfast there this morning he bow he assent eloquently i think then by all means sit down and have breakfast oh _ really _ no -- by _ no _ mean -- i assure you i would a capital breakfast -- clem clem place a chair into which mr price drop without loss of time though protest with polish vehemence against the imposition he eye shine nevertheless as clem set a cup of coffee at he elbow and bring a plate may i ask when you arrive i question only last evening then you dine at the city hotel major blake i will be honest with you -- i _ do _ clem another omelette quick -- but first fetch some orange then put on a lot more of that virginium ham and mix up some waffle too hurry along really you be very good major not that i answer modestly i have merely eat at the city hotel but i doubt if he hear for he lovingly inhale the aroma of he coffee with half-shut eye i be delighted to have meet you he say if ever you come to new york -- he tear himself from the omelette long enough to scribble the name of a club on the card by my plate i rarely crave more than coffee and a roll in the morning he continue after the second omelette the ham the waffle and more coffee have be consume i fancy it be you brace air i fancy it be only the city hotel but i do not revert to that when at last mr price light a cigar which i have procure at a immense distance from slocum county he speak of furniture also of cohen behold through the romantic mist of after-breakfast cohen be perhaps not wholly a shark at least not more than any dealer in old furniture really they be almost force to be shark it be not in the nature of the business that they should lead honest life mere collector -- of which class my guest be -- be bad enough still if you could catch a collector in one of he human moment -- he blow forth the smoke of my cigar with a relish so poignant that i suspect he have already try one of jake kilburn 's best the kind concern which jake feel it considerate to warn purchaser that they be five cent straight and _ not _ six for a quarter i see that if the collector before I be subject to human moment he must be suffer one now so while he smoke i tell he freely of miss caroline of she furniture and she plight he commend the tale one of the best i ever hear he declare only if you 'll pardon I it sound too good to be true it sound indeed like a ` plant ' -- fine old southern family impoverish by war -- faithful body-servant -- old colonial mansion despoil of its heirloom -- rare opportunity for the collector really major you should see some of the stuff that be land on I when i begin year ago with a story almost as good reproduction every piece of it with as fine a imitation of worm-eaten back as you could ever wish to see i have never wish to see any worm-eaten back whatever but i seek to betray regret that i have not encounter this surpassing lot of they of course he continue you will understand that i be speak now as a hardened collector whose life be beset with pitfall and with gin -- not as a starve wretch to the saver of he life you shall see the stuff i say oh by all means and the quicker the better cohen be wait at the hotel for I now -- at the foot of the front stairway and he may suspect any minute that i be mean enough to slink down the back stair and out through a alley in fact i be rather excite at the prospect of see that furniture -- cohen condemn it so bitterly he send a offer of six hundred dollar for it last night i say hereupon my guest become truly excite he _ do _ -- six hundred -- _ cohen _ do i do not wish to be rude old chap but would you mind hasten that be more eloquent than all you story for half a hour notwithstanding he eagerness mr jame walsingham price succumb to the manner of miss caroline note the lack of compunction with which she play upon he before my very eye i divine that the late colonel lansdale have not find the need of pistol entirely do away with even by the sacrament of marriage not until clem announce mr cohen do the self-confessed collector cease to be a man not at home say miss caroline crisply price grin with appreciation and fall to examine the furniture in strange way it be a busy day for he but i could see that he find it enjoyable and strangely be it bear in upon I that miss caroline 's ancient stuff be in some sense desirable more than once do price permit some sign of emotion to be read in he face -- as when the sixth chair of a certain set be at last find support a water-pail in the kitchen the house be not large but it be crowd and price be frankly surprise at the number of thing it hold at six o'clock he go to dine with I miss caroline have tell he that i be authorize to act for she on any proposal he might have to make you have save I again he say warmly in the midst of clem 's dinner i assure you major that hotel be infamous i be surprised you know that something be not do about it by the authority i have to confess that the city hotel be very highly regard by most of we citizen again after a brief interval of stupefaction do jame walsingham price call upon he maker and yet he murmur we be spend million annually to impose mere theology upon savage far less benighted think for a moment what a tithe of that money would do for these poor people take the matter of green salad alone -- to say nothing of soup -- do not you have so simple a thing as lettuce here we do i say but it be regard as a trifle they put vinegar and sugar on it and cut it up with they knife my guest shudder i dare say it be hopeless but i shall always be glad to remember that _ you _ exist away from you city hotel thus do we reach the coffee and some cognac which the late lq peavey have gifted I with by the hand of he estimable kinswoman and now to business say my guest he whimsical gray eye have become studious and detach from we surroundings he have a generous mouth which he seem habitually to sew up in a close-drawn seam but this would suddenly and pleasantly rip in moment of forgetfulness be the collector at this moment the mouth be tightly stitch let I begin this way he say there be exactly six piece in that house that will prevent my be honest so long as they be not mine i be not unmindful of you succor major i 'll prove that to you if you look I up in town -- send I a wire and a room shall be wait for you -- and i be enrapture by that small and lively brown lady nevertheless i shall remain a collector and humanly speak a ingrate a wolf a caitiff until those six article be mine make they mine and for the remainder of that stuff you shall have the benefit of a experience that have be of incredible cost accept my figure and i promise you as man to man to de-cohenize myself utterly they be yours i say -- what be they and what be the figure clem -- mr price 's glass there -- you disarm I one bit of haggle or hesitation might have harden I even now the serpent within I would have lift its head and strike but you have save yourself -- and very well for that the article be those six ball-and-claw-foot chair with violin back i will pay fifty dollar apiece for those remember -- it be the voice of cohen the chair be worth more -- some day they 'll fetch twice that but really i must throw a sop to that collector-cerberus within I he be entitle to something he have the wit to fetch I here the chair be yours i say wonder if i have not mistaken he offer but determine not to betray this a little memorandum of sale if you please -- and i 'll give you my check that larger sideboard would also have stand in the way but those glass handle be not the original the formality be soon despatched and my curious friend become truly human now blake this be from the grateful wretch whose life you have not only save but enrich well there be a excellent lot of stuff there i have get the pick from a collector 's standpoint -- though not from a money valuation i can not tell what it will bring but enough to put we youngish old friend easy for some time to come you box it up as much as she want to let go and send it to the empire auction room -- here be the card they be plain auction-room people you understand -- would not hesitate to rob you in a genteel auction way -- but i 'll be there and see that they do not some of those other piece i may want but i 'll take a bidding chance on they like a man and i 'll watch the whole thing through and see that it be straight billy durgin tell I that cohen and jame walsingham price leave on the night train go east billy notice that cohen seem morose and hear he exclaim something that sound like goniff under he breath as price turn away from he after a brief chat for little arcady the appalling wonder be still to dawn load after load of the despise furniture go into freight-car until the home of miss caroline be only comfortably furnish this be sensational enough -- that the thing should be think worth ship about the country with freight so high but after a few week come tale that atrophy belief -- tale corroborate by a print catalogue and by certain deposit of money in we bank to the account of miss caroline that six wretched chair plain to ugliness have sell for three hundred dollar spread consternation the plain old sideboard for a hundred and ten dollar only feed the flame but there have be sell what the catalogue describe as a colonial sofa with carve dolphin arm wing claw foot and carve back for two hundred and ten dollar and after that the emotion arouse in little arcady be difficult to classify upon that very sofa most of the lady of little arcady have sit to pity miss caroline for be lumber with it again a colonial highboy hood recall as a especially awkward thing and five mahogany side chair have go for three hundred and eighty dollar a heppelwhite mahogany armchair remember for its fade red satin have veritably bring one hundred and sixty dollar and a carve rosewood screen say to be of empire design but a shabby thing have sell astonishingly for ninety dollar a hogarth chair-back settee for two hundred and ten dollar and four hogarth side chair for three hundred and fifteen dollar only darken we vision still further some of we have know that hogarth be a artist but not that he have find time from he draw to make furniture of heppelwhite we have hear not at all although twelve arm-chair say to be he have be by some one thought to be worth around seven hundred dollar nor of any sheraton do we know though one of he sideboard and a pair of sheraton knife urn fetch the incredible sum of five hundred and fifty dollar chippendale be another name unfamiliar in slocum county but chippendale it seem have once make a wing book-case which be now worth two hundred and forty dollar of some enthusiast 's money after that a chippendale settee for a hundred and forty dollar and a empire table with 1830 base for ninety-three dollar seem the merest trifle of this insane outbreak the amount net by the late owner of these thing be report with various exaggeration which i never see any good reason to correct as i have say the thing be and promise to remain forever in little arcady a phenomenon to be explain by no known natural law for a long time we lady be too aghast even to marvel at it intelligibly when aunt delium mccormick in my hearing say well now what a world this be and mr westley keyt answer that be very _ true _ i know they refer to the lansdale furniture it be typical of the prevail stupefaction it seem that a collector _ may _ be a gentleman say miss caroline but mr cohen be not even a collector then i tell she the considerable sum now to she credit she draw a long breath and say _ now _ and clem who stand by almost cry _ now _ little miss the book of little miss chapter xxii the time of dream i have clem to myself for a time little miss it seem be not yet rugged enough for travel into the far little country nor be she at once to be convince that she might safely leave she work i suspect that she have find cause in the past to rank she mother with clem as a weigher and disburser of money i notice that she choose to accept miss caroline 's earliest letter about they good fortune with a sort of half-tolerant attention as a elder listen to the wonder-tale of a imaginative child or as i have long listen to clem 's own dreamy-eyed recital of the profit already he from brillion of chicken not yet come even to the egg-stage of they career not until miss caroline have cease from large and beauteous phrase about the great good fortune that have befall we in the strangest manner -- not until she descend to actual dumfounding figure with powerful little dollar-mark back of they do she daughter seem to permit herself the sweet alarm of hope even in that moment she do not forget that she know she own mother for she take the precaution to elicit a confirmatory letter from she mother 's attorney under guise of thank he for the friendly interest he have ever manifest in the welfare of the lansdale it occur to I that little miss have be endowed either by nature or experience with a marked distrust of mere seeming the impression convey to I by she unenthusiastic though skilfully polite letter be of one who have form the habit of doubt beyond she year these i judge to be twenty-eight or thereabout while she power of restraint under provocation to believe savor of more year than even she mother could claim i have myself be compel to note the value of negative view save in that inner and lonely world where i abode of night and sunday i too have prove the wisdom of much doubting as to actual literal event but little miss be make I think of myself as almost raw-and-twenty credulous in a lawyer 's letter of formal conciseness devoid of humanities maintain to the end a atmosphere of unemotional fact and figure that descend not even to conventional felicitation upon the result i therefore acquaint little miss with the situation so nearly perfect be this letter that it cause she to refer to I in a later communication to miss caroline as you dry-and-dusty counting-machine of a lawyer who doubtless consider the multiplication table as a cycle of sonnet that after i have merely determine to meet she palpable need and have sign myself she obedient servant but i have convince she she admit as much in word almost joyous so that miss caroline go to be with she -- to fetch she when she should be strong enough for the adventure of travel there be three week of my neighbor 's absence -- three week in which clem clean house polish the battered silver neat the room and try to arrange the remain furniture so that it would look like a great deal of furniture indeed three week in which little arcady again deck itself with June garland and seem not at first glance to belie its rather pretentious name three week when i study a calendar which impassively aver that i be thirty-five a mirror which add weight to that testimony and the game which teach I with some freshness at each failure that the greater game it symbolize be not mean to be win -- only to be play forever with as eager a zest as daring a hope as if victory be sure the season at hand find I in sore need of this teaching it be then that errant impulse counsel rebellion against the decree of calendar and looking-glass if vatt wine in dark cellar turn in its bed and mutter seethingly at this time in a mysterious intuitive sympathy with the blossom grape a man free and above ground with eye to behold that miracle may hardly hope to escape a answering thrill to its call wherefore i play the game diligently tear by the need of its higher lesson and at last i be well instruct by it as all may be who approach it thus above a trivial lust for win two of we play in that provocative June one be myself alert for auspicious fall of the card yet stoical and undepressed when a deal promise to be almost too easy for interest be suddenly block by some trifling card thus be i school to expectation of a wise shallowness not so deep but that they might be overrun by the moderate flow of human happiness thus one learn to expect little under much want and to find he most certain profit in observe the freshness of those device which leave he frustrated jim the other player of we chase gluttonous robin on the lawn ever with a indifferent success but with as undimmed a faith as fatuous a certainty as the earliest of god could have wish to see and between we we achieve a conviction that the greater game be worth play even when one have discover its terrific percentage of failure i be not unpleased to be alone during this period of discipline when my soul be perforce purge of its troublesome ferment it be well that my neighbor should have go where she might distract I never so little for it be at the season when nature brew the irresistible philter always i resolve to forego it like a man always like a man i be overborne by the ancient longing the formless heimweh that haunt the heart of the unmated and which in my own case make short work of stoic resolution and since the game have teach I that yield -- where opposition be fate to avail not -- be graceful in proportion to its readiness i surrender as quietly as might be one woman face have be wholly mine for hidden cherish through all the year a woman face be it understand not the face of a woman at first it have be that but with the year it have lose the line that make it but that one imperceptibly it have take on a alien vague softness that but increase its charm while diminish its power to hurt it bring I now only a pensive pleasure and no feeling more acute it be my ash of rose the music of my first love its poignancy soften by time and memory into a ineffable faint melody it be the moon that drench my bygone youth with wonder-light -- a dream-face exquisite as run water unfold flower and those other sweet that poet try in vain to entangle in the mesh of word and rhythm this be the face my fancy bring to go with I into every June garden of familiar surprise all of which mean that i be a poor thing of clay and many dolor who still perversely make himself believe that somewhere between he and god be the one woman breathing and conscious perhaps even longing more plainly it mean that i be a man whose gift for self-fooling promise ably to survive he hair gravitation would presently pull down my shoulder my face would flaunt the wrinkled spoil of age my voice would waver ominously and i should forfeit the dignity befitting even this decay by still play childish game of belief with some foolish dog i would be a village character of the sort that be justly say to dodder and the judicious would shun observation by I or if it befall they would affect a intense preoccupation lest i halt and dodder to they of a past unromantically barren there be moment in which i make no doubt of all this but i fight they off as foolishly as do jim he own interval of clear see sometimes in a half doze he breathe a long almost human sigh of perfect and despairing comprehension as if the whole dead weight of he race 's history flash upon he as if the woful failure of he species to achieve anything worth while and the daily futility of himself as a individual dog be suddenly reveal in such instant he know perhaps that there be little reward in be a dog unless you cheat yourself by believe more than the fact warrant but presently he be up to dash at a bird with a fine forgetfulness quite as startle by the trick of flight as in he first day and i envy he he gift of credulity weakly strive for it as i have say i have note that in these free dreaming of mine the paint face above my neighbor 's mantel seem to have have a place long before i look upon its actual line this perplexed I not a little that the face should seem to have be familiar before i have see it -- the portrait that it should have blended with and then almost replace another 's so that now the woman face i saw be eloquent of two though fittingly harmonize in itself must i lay to the philter 's magic this audacious notion that the face of little miss have tangibly come to I in some night of the mind sober i be loath to commit this absurdity but breast drunkenly that tide of dream it cease to be absurd and so i have plunge into the current again one early evening when the grow thing seem to have stop reluctantly for rest when the robin have flute of they household duty the last time for the day and when only the song of child at a game be bring to I from a neighbor yard unconsciously my thought fall into the rhythm of this song with the result that i presently listen to catch its word -- faint childish laughing yet musical in the scented dusk : -- king william be king jame 's son and from the royal race he spring upon he breast he wear a star that show the royal point of war go choose you east and choose you west and choose the one that you love best if she be not here to take you part go choose another with all you heart down on this carpet you must kneel low as the grass grow in yon field salute you bride and kiss she sweet and then arise upon you foot the sentiment be ill suit to my own at the moment but the raw-voiced little singer appeal to my ear not unpleasantly again the verse come -- if she be not here to take you part -- go choose another with all you heart i hear wheel then nearer than the singing -- the clumsy rumble of we big yellow ` bus voice be bear to I -- clem 's voice miss caroline 's and another not like she be a voice firmer yet a dusky-warm woman 's voice that be all i could think of at the time : perhaps the night suggest it they have quality in common it be a woman 's voice but a determine woman 's i know of course that little miss have come but also i know at once -- this be she voice -- that it would not be in my power to call she little miss chapter xxiii the strain of peavey it be too true that i could not call she little miss as i have lightly call she mother miss caroline at we first encounter of a dusky pallor be miss lansdale when i first behold she under the night of she hair as the wane light show I she i thought of a blossom young sloe tree in she own far valley of the old dominion closer to she i could note only that she be dark but fair for observation of this character become for some reason impracticable in she immediate presence she greet I kindly as she mother 's lawyer she be cordial to I a moment as she mother 's friend but later when these debt of civility have be duly pay when we have go from the outer dusk into candle light she favor I only with occasional glance of the mildest curiosity in which be neither kindness nor cordiality not that these have give way to they opposite they be simply not there not the faintest hint of unfriendliness could i detect miss lansdale have merely detach herself into a magnificent void of disinterest from the center of which she survey I without prejudice in moment when she glance could not be better occupy i have catch much the same look in the eye of twelve bored juryman who be nevertheless bind to give my remark they impartial attention sometimes one may know from the look of these twelve that one 's case be already as good as lose or at least that a opinion have be reach which new and important testimony will be require to change it occur to I as my call wear on that i catch even a hint of this prejudgment in the eye of the young woman it put I sorely at a disadvantage for i know not what i be expect to prove know not if i be on trial as she mother 's lawyer she mother 's friend or as a mere man the latter seem improbable as a offence for be not my judge a daughter of miss caroline and yet strangely enough i come to think that this must be my offence -- that i be a man she make I feel this in she careless incidental glance she manner of turn briskly from I to address she mother with a warmer show of interest than i have be able to provoke it seem indeed opportune to remember at the moment that while this allege little miss be the daughter of miss caroline she be likewise -- and even more palpably as i could note by fugitive swift glimpse of she face -- the daughter of a gentleman whose metal have be often try one who have win he reputation as much by self-possession under difficulty as by the militant spirit that incur they kate have little of the peavey in she -- she be every inch a lansdale miss caroline find occasion to say while i thus provide with a excuse to look remark to myself that she inch while not excessive be unusually meritorious worse than that -- she be a jere lansdale be my response though i tactfully leave it unuttered for a indeed that seem less emotional i could voice my deeper conviction not more explicitly than by say further to miss caroline perhaps that explain why she have the effect of make she mother seem positively immature my mother _ be _ positively immature remark the daughter with the air of tell something she have find out long since then perhaps the other be the false effect i venture it be you mother 's immaturity that make you seem so -- i think it kind to hesitate for the word but miss lansdale say again confidently : -- oh but i really _ be _ and this with a finality that seem to close the incident she voice have the warm little roughness of a thrush 's which sing through a throat that be loosely string with wire of soft gold in _ my _ day begin miss caroline but here i rebel no longer perceive any good reason to be overborne by she daughter i could endure only a certain amount of that you day be to-day i interrupted and to-morrow and many to-morrow you be a woman bereft of all she yesterday let you daughter have have _ she _ day -- let she have come to a incredible maturity but you stay here in to-day with I we will not be fit companion for she but she shall not lack for company uncle jerry honeycutt be now ninety-four and he have a splendid new ear-trumpet -- he will be rarely divert for miss lansdale but the daughter remain as indifferent to taunt as she have be to my friendly advance it occur to I now that she self-possession be remarkable it be little short of threaten if one regard she too closely i wonder if this could really be a inheritance from she well-nerved father or the result of she year as teacher in a finishing school for young lady i be tempt to suspect the latter for physically the creature be by no means formidable perhaps a inch or two taller than she mother she be of a marked slenderness a _ complete _ slenderness i might say -- a slenderness so palpably finish as to detail that i can only describe it as felicitous in the extreme it seem almost certain that she appearance have once be disarm that the threat in she eye-flash and tilted head be a trick learn by contact with many young lady who need finish more than they would admit of course this do not explain why miss lansdale should visually but patently disparage I at this moment i be by no mean a unfinished young lady and in any event she should have leave all that behind the moment be one wherein relaxation would have be not only graceful but entirely safe for she be in no manner to be hold accountable for my conduct yet again and again she curious reserve congeal I back upon the stanch regard of miss caroline my passion for that sprightly dame and she gracious acceptance of it be happily not to deteriorate under the regard of any possible daughter however egregiously might we flaunt to she trained eye we need to be finish the newcomer 's reserve be indeed pregnable to no assault i could devise not even do she lighten when i say to she mother in open mockery of that reserve well she cost you a lot of furniture that be really most companionable about the house and pause with a sigh betoken a regretful comparison of value that lance shatter against she lansdale shield like all the other end my call i feel vividly what i have elsewhere see describe as the cosmic chill the small mighty night-eyed well-completed miss lansdale with the voice of a golden jangle have freeze it about I in lavish abundance i go home to play the game until my eye tire so that the face of king queen and knave leer at I in defeat or simpered sickeningly when i be able to shape they destiny thrice i lose interestingly and with profit to my soul and once i win though without elation for we know that little skill may be need to win when the card fall right whereas to lose profitably be a mark of supreme merit even after that i must have recourse to the wonted philter to bring sleep the face of my vision be unaccountably the face of the true little miss before she have evolve into miss lansdale of the threatening self-possession i refuse to bother about the absurdity of this for the sake of bring sleep the sooner i be privileged to observe the follow day that my neighbor 's daughter be still of a dusky whiteness the baffle shaded whiteness of soft new snow in a cedar thicket incidentally she partake of another quality of soft new snow -- one by no means so incommunicable and yet in sunlight i incur the full close look of she eye and no longer doubt the presence of a peavey strain in she immediate ancestry far in they incalculable depths i see a myriad of light brown-gold that smoulder ominously even promisingly it might never meet this young woman 's caprice to be flagrantly a peavey in my presence but she capacity for this if she choose to exercise it i detect beyond a doubt she be patently a daughter of miss caroline and the cosmic chill have be a afterthought of she own she do I the honor late in the afternoon of this day to occupy a easy-chair within my vine porch she go farther she affect a polite interest in myself but she craft be crude i detect at once that she have fall in love with my dog that she come not to seek I but to follow he who have race joyously from she at he first knowledge of my home-coming i be secretly proud of the exquisite thoroughness with which he now ignore she again and again he assure I in she very presence that the woman be nothing _ could _ be nothing to he i know this well enough -- i need no protestation from he but i think it be well that she should know it i see that he have probably consent to receive she address through a long afternoon have perhaps eat of she provender and even behave with a complaisance which could have lead she to hope that some day she might be something to he but i know that he have not persistently face the peril of be trample to death by I in he pulpy infancy -- so great he fear of we separation -- to let a mere woman come between we at this day and it be well that he should now tell she this in the plainest of word the woman seem to view I with a increase respect from that very moment she try first to bring jim to she side by a soft call that almost make I tremble for he integrity but he do not so much as turn he head he eye be for I alone with a rubber shoe fling gallantly over he shoulder he dance incitingly before I pray that i would pretend to be craze by the sight of he prize and seek to wrench it from he but i pretend instead to be bore by he importunity choose to rub it in to she who long for he friendly notice -- a little throaty bark a lift of the paw perhaps a winsome lay of he head along she lap -- i affect indifference to he infatuation for I i pretend always to have be a perfect devil of a fellow among the dog and profess loftily not to have divine the secret of my innumerable and unvarying conquest dog be so foolishly faithful remark miss lansdale with polite acerbity i know it i concede that fellow think i be the most beautiful person in all the world she say indeed with a inflection and a sweeping glance at I which i find charge with meaning but i know well enough that i have for all time master a certain measure of she difficult respect and he be such a fine dog too she add in a tone intend to convey to I the full extent of she pity for he i have he remarkably well trained i say i can often force he to notice people whom i like especially if they be clever enough to let he see that they like I rather well it would be almost worth while she remark with a longing look at jim but none at I many have find it quite so i say order jim to charge at my foot but it be a great bear i assure you i need not to be tell that she envy I my power and so deep and genuine appear to be she love for he that secretly i hope he would again be amiable to she during my absence on the morrow the contrast of he manner on my return would further chasten she from the porch we both watch she move across the little stretch of lawn and at my whisper suggestion jim rise to he foot and bark she insultingly over the last twenty foot of it i be delighted to note that this induce a shamed acceleration of she pace and a tighter clutch of she skirt i think it important to let she know clearly and at once just who be the master in my own house chapter xxiv the loyalty of jim if it must be my lot to dream out a life of insubstantial vision that be well but it appear not unreasonable that i should keep at least one ponderable dog by I as a emblem of something i have miss through one too many shuffle of the card before this big game begin yet miss lansdale have clearly resolve to deprive my dream of even this slight support of realness i try always to remember in she behalf that she do not know the circumstance and she herself very soon discover that she do not know jim the assault she make upon he fidelity prove she to be past-mistress of tactic and strategy no possible approach to he heart do she leave untried she flatter and pet lure cajole entreated she menace command storm rage draw inspiration from a siege celebrate in antiquity she seek to secrete she force -- not in a horse of wood but within the frame of numerous fowl pick to the bone but shred over so temptingly with fugitive succulence as to have make a dog of feeling less fine she slave for life it be not until the desperate woman have in the terminology of billy durgin be baffle and beat at every turn that i could get into communication with she on a basis at all acceptable to a free-necked man have prove to the last resource of she ingenuity that jim be more than human in he loyalty she seem disposed to admit though grudgingly enough that i myself might be not less than human to have win he so utterly and thereafter i find it often practicable to associate with she on term of apparent equality she surrender i believe on a day when she have think to lure jim into she boat -- fatuously for be i not a distinguishable figure in the landscape she hope must have be high for she have but lately replete he with chicken-bone divinely crunchable and then bestow upon he a charlotte russe a unnatural taste for which she have succeed in teach he with something of a swagger -- she swagger in a rather starchy white dress that day and under a garden hat of broad rim -- she have entice he to the water 's edge so that i must have be nervous but for know the dog through and through she failure be so crush so swift so entire that for a instant i almost fail to rejoice in she open humiliation seat in the boat oar poise she invite jim with soft speech and a smile that might have move a iron dog without occasion any remark from I but jim note with one paw already in the boat that i be not to be of the party turn quickly from she and come to I with he head down he inform and well-feathered tail signal to miss lansdale that she seem to have forget herself at that moment i think the woman abandon all she preposterous hope then too i think she learn the last and bitterest lesson which great fighter must learn to embellish defeat with a air of urbane acceptance miss lansdale relax -- she melt before my eye to a aspect that no victor who know he business could afford to despise i clamber in jim follow remark amiably to the woman as he pass she on he way to the bow of the boat i _ think _ you could not have mean _ that _ and defeat row jim and I row we past the feathered marge of green island quite as if nothing have happen but i know it _ have _ happen for miss lansdale be so nearly human that i presently find myself think miss kate of she she not only answer question but what amaze I far more she condescend to ask they now and then to a observer we might have seem to be hold speech of a actual friendliness -- speech of the water and the day of herself and the dog and a little of I at length as i catch a overhang willow to rest she arm a moment i feel bold enough to venture word about this assumption of amity which be so become in she i even confess that she be remind I of certain distinguished but truly amiable personage who be commonly to be find in the side-show adjacent to the main tent particularly of the wild man i say to be more specific for my listener seem at once to crave detail there be a powerfully paint banner swell in the breeze outside you know it show the wild man in all he untame ferocity in he native jungle arm with a simple but rather promising club a dozen intrepid tar from a british man-of-war -- to be see in the offing -- be in the act of cast a net over he it be a exciting picture i assure you miss lansdale the net look flimsy and the wild person be not only enraged but very muscular -- i fail to see she interrupt with a slight lapse into what i may call she first or lansdale manner of course you fail you have to go inside to see i explain kindly but it only cost a dime which be little enough -- the hire enthusiast indeed station just outside the entrance remind we over and over again that it be only ` the tenth part of a dollar ' and he sometimes add that ` it will neither make nor break nor set a man up in business ' he be a flagrant optimist in small money matter ever look on the bright side inside suggest my listener with some impatience i have regret my beginning and have mean to shirk a finish if she would let I but it seem i must go on well inside there be a hand-organ go all the time you know -- the wild man she insist like a child look ahead for the real meat of the story one be tell it i be get to he as fast as i consistently can the wild man sit tamely in a cheap chair on a platform with a row of he photograph spread charmingly at he foot of course you be certain at once that he be no longer wild you know that a wild man whose spirit have not be utterly break would never sit there and listen to that hand-organ eight hour every day except Sunday the fluent and polished gentleman in charge -- who have a dye mustache -- assure we that we have nothing to fear from this ` once ferocious monster of the tropic jungle with he bestial craving for human flesh ' but that seem a mere matter of form with the hand-organ go in we ear -- really miss lansdale begin -- or try to one moment please the scholarly person go on to relate the circumstance of the wild person 's capture -- substantially as depict upon the canvas outside -- and wind up with : ` after be bring to this country in chain he be reclaim from he savage estate be give a good english education and can now converse intelligently upon all the lead topic of the day step up lady and gentleman ' he conclude with a rather pointed delicacy ` and you will find he ready and willing to answer all proper question ' miss lansdale drop she oar into the water dully i think i release the willow that have moor we but i persist and he always _ do _ answer all proper question just as the gentleman say he would doubtless a improper question would be to ask he if he be not bear tame on we own soil of reputable new england parent but i do not know i have always conduct myself in he presence as a gentleman must with the result that he have never fail to be chatty he be a trifle condescend to be sure he do not forget the difference in we station but he do not permit himself to study I with eye of blank indifference nor be he reticent to the verge of hostility of course he feel indifferent to I -- nothing else could be expect -- but he captor have teach he to be gracious in public and really miss lansdale you seem strangely tame and broken to-day yourself you have not only receive a good english education but you answer all proper question with a condescension hardly more marked than that of the wild person 's i can only pray you will not resume a manner that will inevitably recall he to I to you own disadvantage she row in silence against the gentle current but she lift she eye to I with a look that be not all lansdale there be peavey in it and she smile i have see she smile before but never before have she see I at those time that she should now smile for and at I seem to be a circumstance little short of epoch-making i can not affirm that there be even one moment of that curiously short afternoon when she become wholly and frankly a peavey but more than once do this felicity seem to impend and i suspect that she might even have be more graciously endowed than with a mere peavey capacity in general i believe that if she choose she might almost become a miss caroline peavey this occur to I when she say : -- i only bring you along for you dog it be of course quite like a lansdale to do that but much liker a peavey to tell it with that brief poise of the open eye upon one 's own do not hold it against jim i plead it be my fault i be oblige to be most careful about he associate i have bring he up on a system indeed it would be interesting to know why you object -- she bridle with a challenge almost miss caroline in its flippancy well for one thing i have to make sure that he do not become worldly lot of good dog be spoil that way and i have succeed very well thus far to this moment he believe everything be true that ought to be true or if not that something ` just as good ' be true as the people in drug store tell one and you be afraid of I -- that i 'll -- one can not be too careful about dog especially one that believe as much as that one do frankly i _ be _ afraid of you you have such a know way of fight off moment that might become peavey i do not quite understand -- of course you do not but that be of little consequence -- to jim he do not understand either but you see he have a fine faith now that the world be all peavey -- he learn it from I of course i _ know _ better but i pretend not to and often i can fool myself for half a hour at a time and of course i should not care to have that dog find out that this apparently peavey world -- flawlessly peavey -- have a streak of lansdale run through it -- that it have even its moment of curious hard suspicion of distrust of downright disbelief in all the good thing -- in short its miss katherine lansdale moment if you will pardon that hastily contrived metaphor perceive that further concealment would be unavailing i add quite openly : now young woman you see that i know you secret i feel it in the dark of we first meeting it have since become plainer -- too plain you know too much -- far more than be good for either jim or I to know you can not believe enough -- all those thing that jim and i have find it best to believe i myself always fear that i shall be lead into way of unbelief in you presence that be why i can not trust jim with you alone and why i could hardly trust myself there without jim 's sustain look -- that be why in fact that i shall try to shun you in all but you approximately peavey moment i trust now that this shall be the last time i must ever speak bitterly in you presence you be sufficiently warn while i speak she have cease rowing and we drift with the current a long time we drift and i rejoice to see that i have taunt miss lansdale into something like interest i see that she be uncertain as to the degree of seriousness i have mean my word to convey once she begin as if they be wholly serious and once again as if they have be wholly unserious if she at last appear to suspect that she must effect a compromise i dare say she be as nearly correct as i could have put she with any word i know but you have that dog from the first she at length decide to say clearly in self-defence and still you be worried and oblige to guard he from evil companion you confess i exclaimed in triumph you have he as a puppy could you have expect so much of he if he have run wild in a world where any number of good dog learn unbelief where they be shock into it all in a moment i do not have myself from the first i remind she and i believe only a few trifle less than jim do i know that robin ascend without visible means for example if you run at they but i believe it be good to run at they just the same even more enjoyable than if they sit still to be catch we be speak of dog say miss lansdale at any rate jim have _ you _ from the first let we keep to dog then i answer meantime if you listen to I you 'll soon be in deep water when we have both lose the taste for adventure this current will take we over the dam in about seven minute i should judge she fall to the oar again with a dream face in which lansdale and the other be so well blended that it be indeed the face of vision that have long be come to I you remind I again of the wild gentleman i say after a long look at she a look which she be good enough to let I see that she observe _ et ego in arcadium vixi _ -- and i too be net in my native jungle i see that she too essay the feat of be both light and serious without let the seam show i mean about picture i explain the gentlemanly curator of the side-show always say of the wild man thoughtfully ' i _ believe _ he have a few photograph for sale ' he be always right -- the wild man do have they though i should not care to say that they be worth the money that depend upon one 's taste of course -- by the way miss lansdale i have long have a picture of you have mother -- no -- long before i become a fellow-slave with clem -- long before there be a juvenile mother or even a clem in little arcady may i ask how you get it certainly you may i do not know may i see it i think she feel a deeper interest than she care to reveal unfortunately no if you only could see it you would see that it be almost a perfect likeness -- perhaps a bit more little miss than you could be now -- but it be unmistakably true i lose such a picture once she say with a fall of she eye where be the one you have sometimes it be behind my eye and sometimes it be out before they nonsense to be sure only jim and i train and harden in the way of belief be equal to a feat of that sort i see no merit in believe that i do not know that there be especially -- not in believe this particular thing but the power for belief in general which it imply -- you see i be unprejudiced why should you want to believe it i should have know without catch the glint of she eye under the hat brim that a peavey speak there if you could see the thing once you would understand i say a answer of course fit only for a peavey at all event you 'll not keep it long the word be peavey enough but the voice be rather curiously lansdale i have make as little effort to keep it as i do to acquire it i say but it stay on and i have a notion it will stay on as long as jim and i be uncorrupted but it sha not inconvenience you i add brightly in time to forestall a imminent other nonsense be thus neatly thwart she look over my shoulder and bent to she oar for we have again drift toward the troubled water of the dam i warn you -- if you listen to I i remind she oh i have not be listen -- only thinking of course and you be disbelieve it be high time you put we ashore i want to believe and i want not to be drown so do jim -- _ both _ of 'em she point the boat to we landing and as she lean she narrow shoulder far back she shoot I one swift look but i could see much farther into the water that float we chapter xxv the case of fatty budlow lest miss katharine lansdale seem unduly formidable i should perhaps say that i appear to be alone in find she so little arcadian of my own sex younger than myself -- and if i may suggest it less discerning -- be not only not menace but she invite they with a cordiality in which the keenest eye among they could detect no flaw miss lansdale 's mother have also please the masculine element of the town at she first progress through its pleasant street but miss caroline despite many detail of dress and manner that fail interestingly to corroborate the fact be a old woman and one whose way of life make she difficult of comprehension to the little country

where man have eye -- as well by the homekeeping as by the travel eustace eubank more or less a man of the world by virtue of that adventurous trip to the holy land understand she at one glance as do arthur updyke who have fare abroad to the college of pharmacy and know thing but she be also lucid as crystal to g brown and creston fancett whose knowledge of the outside world be somewhat affect by they experience of it which be nothing to all seven of the age be this woman comprehensible old bolivar kent eighty-six and shuffling he short step to the grave not far ahead understand she with one

regale he vision that he toil for half a hour as one entranced disengage what he believe to be porter-house steak long after the porter-house line in the beef under he hand have be pass in short miss lansdale be understand spontaneously -- to borrow a phrase from the _ argus _ -- by each and all who have the good fortune to be present for she be dower with that quick-drawing charm which have work a familiar spell upon the son of man in all time she be incontestably feminine she give the woman-call that she seem to give it against she wish -- without intention -- that i be alone in detect this be trifle beside the point masculine little arcady care not that she have be less successful than the late colonel pott for example in preserve the truly greek spirit -- care naught for this so long as meaningly or otherwise she utter the immemorial woman-call in its true note wheresoever she fare and curiously since miss lansdale do not appear formidable to masculine little arcady -- with one negligible exception -- she seem to try perversely not to be so she be amazingly gracious to it -- still with one exception she melt to frivolity and the dance of mirth she affect joy in its music and confess to a new feeling for jerusalem after attend a lawn party at which eustace eubank do he best to please she speak of this to eustace with a crafty implication that it have remain for he to interpret the antique grace of that storied place to a world all too heedless eustace himself feel not only a renew interest in the land exploit by he magic lantern but he begin to view all the rest of the world in a new and rosy light of which miss lansdale be the iridescent globe that diffuse and subdue it to the mellow hue of romance it be impossible to believe that eustace be ever at any pain to conceal the effect of this astral phenomenon from he family for its member be very quickly excite if in that vale the woman-call could be hear by ear attuned to its haunting cadence so also do the frightened mother-call echo its equally primitive note accompany by the less well-known sister-call of warning and distress the truth be that eustace be become harder to manage with each recur crisis for testimony in the present instance i need only adduce that he write poetry more or less after meeting miss lansdale but a scant half-dozen time this come to I in confidence however and the obliquity of it spread no farther beyond the family line flutter with alarm the mother of eustace approach I as one presumably familiar with the power of the lansdale to work disaster in a peaceful and orderly family she seek to know if i could not prevent she boy from make a fool of himself it be never she way to bother with many word when she know the right few with a air that signify she intention of let I know the worst at once mr eubank draw from she bead reticule a sheet of paper scribble over in the handwriting of she misguided offspring it be a rondeau i know that by the shape and the mother apologize for the indelicacy of it before permit my own cheek to blush thereat the dominant line of the composition i see to be -- when love light night to be its day i turn from the stricken mother to cough deprecatingly when i have read she likewise have the delicacy to turn away and cough but a emergency of this momentous import must be discuss in plain term however disconcert the detail and mr eubank have nerve herself for the ordeal i can not think she begin where the boy _ learn _ such thing i have not the courage to tell she that they might be entirely self-taught under certain circumstance such shameless brazen thing she persist we have always be _ so _ careful of euty -- strive to keep he -- well wholesome and pure you understand major blake there be always danger i say but only because she have stop speak and not in any hope of instruct she if only we can keep he from make a fool of himself -- it seem rather late i say this time with profound conviction see there upon the margin of that capture sheet eustace have expose as it be the very secret mechanic of he passion there be write tentative rhyme one under another as kate -- mate -- fate -- late -- and eke a unblushing sate also have he in the frenzy of he poetic rapture divine and indicate the technical affinity exist among word like bliss kiss and miss interference however delicately manage seem hopeless after that and i say as much but i add : of course if you let he alone he may come back to he better self perhaps the young lady herself may prove to be you ally indeed not she have set out deliberately to ensnare my poor euty say the mother with a incisive drawing in of she expressively thin lip i know it the very first evening i see they together might not it have be sheer trifling on she part i suggest can you imagine that young woman _ daring _ to trifle with eustace eubank she demand i could as a matter of fact but as she query seem to repel such a disclosure i lie true i say she would never dare i do not think of that with _ all _ she frivolity and lightness of manner and fondness for dress she must have some sense of fitness -- she must indeed she could not go _ that _ far certainly _ not _ even if she _ do _ wear too many ribbon and lace and fancy furbelow with never a common-sense shoe to she foot even if she _ do _ i assent warmly and thus we be compel to leave it in view of those verse i could suggest no plan for relief and my one poor morsel of encouragement have be stonily reject eustace go the mad pace so do arthur updyke it be rather to be expect of arthur however he duty at the city drug store seem to encourage a debonair lightness of conduct he treat he blond ringlet assiduously from the stock of pomade he be as fastidious about he fingernail

through he small but perfect mustache naturally enough it be say by the lady of little arcady that arthur 's attention be never serious -- except they he pay to himself aunt delium mccormick would often add for that excellent woman be not above playing venomously with familiar word also do g brown and creston fancett go the same mad pace these four be fill with distrust of one another but as they compose we male quartette they would gather late on summer night and conduct themselves in a manner to make I wish that old azariah prouse 's peculiar belief as to house structure might have include a sound-proof fence about he premise for on the insufficient stretch of lawn between that house and my own the four rival sing serenade she sleep -- my lady sleep they sing with a volume that

however the one occasion when they feel that none of the four have any advantage over he fellow they make the most of it then in the dead of night i would be very sorry that i have not counsel the mother of eustace eubank to send he around the world on a slow sailing ship for it be he voice even in song of sleep that render this salutary exercise most difficult on one of these wakeful summer night however i receive a queer little shock perhaps i half dream it in some fugitive moment of half sleep but it be as if i be again a awkward silent boy worship a girl new to the school a girl who wear two long yellow braid i worship she from afar so that she see I not be occupy with many adorer less timid who make nothing of snatch a hair ribbon but the face in that instant of dream be the face of miss katharine lansdale and couple with the vision be a prescience that in some later life i should again look back and see myself as now a grow but awkward boy still hold aloof -- still adore from some remote background while other and bolder gallant capture trophy and lightly carol they serenade it seem like borrow trouble to look still farther into the future but the vision be striking surely history do repeat itself i should have make this discovery for myself have it not be exploit before my day for on the morrow i find my woman child on the lansdale lawn when i go home in the afternoon she have now reach a age when she be begin to do pretty with she lip as she talk -- almost at the age when i have first be enrapture by she mother with the identical two braid also the tassel dangle from she boot top this latter be unexciting as a coincidence however i myself have deliberately produce it miss lansdale turn from talk with the child to greet I she face be so little menacing that i call she miss katharine on the spot but my business be with the child lucy i say as i take the wicker chair by the hammock in which they both lounge there be a boy at school who look at you a great deal when you be not watch he -- you catch he at it -- but he never come near you he act as if he be afraid of you he be a awkward stupid boy if he get up to recite about geography or about ' a gentleman send he servant to buy ten and five-eighth yard of fine broadcloth ' or anything of that sort and if he happen to catch you eye at the moment he flounder like a catch fish stare hard at the map of north america on the wall and sit down in disgrace and when the other boy be chase you and pull off you hair ribbon he mope off in a corner of the school yard though he look as if he would like to shoot down all the other boy in cold blood he have nice hair say my woman child oh he _ have _ very well do he name happen to be ` horsehead ' or anything like that -- the name the boy call he by you know fatty -- fatty budlow if that be the one you mean do you know he uncle maje better than any boy in the world have not i be tell you about he once he bring a bag of candy to school and i think he be come up to hand it to I but he turn red in the face and stuff it right into he pocket he mean to give it to you really -- he buy it for you -- but he could not when the time come oh do he tell you it be not necessary for he to tell I i know that boy i tell you through and through lucy do you think you could encourage he a little now and then -- be sociable with he -- not enough to hurt of course you do not know how he would appreciate the least kindness he might remember it all he life i might pat he hair -- he have such nice hair -- if he would not know it -- but of course he would know it and when he look at you he be so queer -- yes i know i suppose it be hopeless could not you even ask he to write in you autograph album y-e-s -- i could only he would be sure to write something funny like ` in memory 's wood-box let I be a stick ' he always do write something witty and i do not much care for ridiculous thing in my album i be be careful with it well if he be as witty as _ that _ in you album it will be to mask a bleeding heart i happen to know that in a former existence he be never even ask to write though he always hope he might be i be sorry if you like he uncle maje but i be positive that fatty budlow be not a boy i could _ ever _ feel deeply for i do not believe we acquaintance will even ripen into friendship and she look with profound eye into the wondrous opening future of course it will not i say i might have know that he will continue through the age to be a impossible boy miss lansdale feel the same way about he poor fatty or horsehead or whatever they call he stand off and glare at she and can not say he lesson when he catch she eye -- only he seldom do catch it because she be so busy with other boy of more spirit who crowd about she and snatch hair ribbon and sing ` my lady sleep ' until no one else can do you know fatty budlow ask my surprised woman child of miss lansdale but that young woman only reach out one foot to point its toe idly at a creep green worm and turn its vagrant course the toe be by no means common-sense and the heel be simply idiotic of course she know he i say she know he would give he right hand for she which be a good deal under the circumstance and she very properly despise he for it she would take she picture away from he if she could she would not say miss lansdale with a gesture of she foot that disconcert I miss kate i say i have live my life in terror of see one of those squashy green worm meet a fearful disaster in my presence would you mind -- with a fillip of the bronzed toe she send the amaze worm into a country that must have be utterly strange to it she would take it back quickly enough if she know what he make of it i say return to the picture if she know that he have keep it ever since he learn that agriculture mining and ship-building be principal industry -- only at first it have two long yellow braid and tassel dangle from its boot top my mother have beautiful long golden hair say the woman child add simply papa say mine be just like it miss lansdale regard I narrowly you get I all mix up she say i like to you be heady then -- like you mother 's punch when it be ` all mix up ' i must put in more ice remark miss lansdale calmly fatty budlow be so serious say the woman child suspect that the talk have drift away from she it be he curse i admit if he be not a a no 1 dreamer he would be too serious to live but be go dream and maunder along -- dream that thing be about as he would like to have they he see you face and miss lansdale 's and then they get mix up in a queer way and miss kate 's face come out of the picture with such a look in the eye that a man of ordinary spirit would call she ` little miss ' right off without ever stop to think but of course this fatty or horsehead or whatever it be can not say it right out so he say it to himself about twenty-three or twenty-four thousand time a day as nearly as he can reckon -- he always be weak in arithmetic you might let he write in _ you _ autograph album say the woman child brightly to miss lansdale i know what he would write if he get the chance i add incitingly but it do not avail miss lansdale remain incurious and merely say long golden braid as one try to picture they and later a little row of curl over each ear and a tiny chain with a locket around the neck i have a picture once -- you have have many picture yes -- two be many if you have have nothing else but she be now regard the woman child with a curious close look almost trouble in its intensity do you look like you mother she ask papa say i do and uncle maje think so too she be very pretty this come with a unconscious placidity she look almost as she mother 's picture do i say when the child have go miss lansdale search my face long before speak she seem to hesitate for word and at length to speak of other matter than those which might have perplex she why do they call you ` horsehead ' she ask almost kindly i never ask it seem to be a common understanding doubtless there be good reason for it as good as there be for call budlow ` fatty ' what do you do she ask again i go to the war with what i could take -- nothing but a picture and you lose that yes -- under peculiar circumstance it seem a kind thing to do at the time and you come back with -- _ with yours little miss _ some excitement throb between we so that i have involuntarily emphasize my word briefly she eye cling to mine and very slowly we relax from that look i only want to say she begin presently that i shall have to believe you absurd tale of my picture be with you before you see I something make I credit it -- a strange little notion that i have carry that child 's picture in my own mind we be even then i answer only you be think more thing than you say that be not fair but she only nod she head inscrutably chapter xxvi a little mystery be solve the significance of miss lansdale 's manner rather than she word run through my darkened thought like a thread as i play the game that night after a third defeat this thread seem to guide I to daylight from a tortuously wind cavern at first the thing be of a amazing simplicity in a far room be a chest fill with forget odds and end that have come back with I year before i run to it and from under bundle of letter old family trinket a canteen a pair of rusty pistol and other such matter i bring forth a ambrotype -- the kind that be mount in a black case of press rubber and close with a spring but even as i hold the thing flush with my discovery another recollection cool I and the structure of my discovery tumble as quickly as it have build itself little miss have find she own picture when she find _ he _ she mother have tell I this definitely it have be clutch in he hand and she after a look have tenderly replace it to stay with he dust forever this i have forget at first in my eagerness for light i press the spring that bring the face to my eye know it would not be she face close to the light i study it the face of a girl eighteen or so with dream eye that look beyond I it could not be miss lansdale and yet it be strangely like she -- like the little miss she must once have be but one mystery at least be now plain -- the mystery of my own mind picture i have not look at this thing for ten year but its line have stay with I and this be the face of my dream carry so long after its source have be forget the face of this picture have naturally enough change to seem like the face of miss lansdale after i have see she perhaps it be the face of a peavey there be at least a family resemblance that would explain the likeness to miss kate this be not much but it be enough to sleep on as i leave the house the follow morning miss lansdale she skirt pin up be among she rose with a water pot and a busy pair of scissors as i approach she i have something to say but it be for a interval drive from my lip promise I i say instead never to wear a common-sense shoe she stare at I with brow a trifle raise of course it will displease mr eubank but there be still a better reason for it the brow go farther up at this until they be hardly to be detect under the broad rim of she garden hat she answer be icy even for a indeed -- quite in she best lansdale manner yes ` indeed ' i retort somewhat rudely but never mind -- it be not of the least consequence what i mean to say be this -- about those picture of people you remember i remember perfectly and i have conclude that it be all nonsense -- all of it you understand that be queer -- so have i have i be a third person and a observer i would doubtless have swear that miss lansdale be more surprised than please by this remark of mine i have not have you picture at all i go on it be a picture of some one else and i have not think to look at it for a long time -- have forget it utterly in fact that be how i come to think i know you face before i know you i tell you it be nonsense and she snip off a rose with a kind of miniature brusqueness but you shall see that i have some reason if you find time to-day step into my library and look at the picture it be on the mantel and the door be open it may be some one you know though i doubt even that with this i brazenly snatch a pink rise from those within she arm you see fatty budlow be come on i remark of this bit of boldness let he come -- he sha not find _ I _ in the way this with a effort to seem significant oh not at _ all _ i assure she politely and with equal subtlety i believe have i know that this be the last time i should ever look upon miss katharine lansdale i might have look longer she be well worth see for sundry other reason than she need for common-sense shoe but those last time pass so often without we suspect they and it be indeed my good fortune never to see she again for never again be she to rise even at she highest above miss kate she be even so low as little miss when i find she on my porch that afternoon -- a troubled little miss so droop so queerly draw about the eye so weak of mouth so altogether stricken that i be shoot through at sight of she i wait here -- to speak alone -- you be late to-day i be early but if she have wait she would of course not know this what have happen miss kate come here through my open door i follow she quick step you be jest about that this morning -- she point to the picture prop open against a book on the mantel and then with a effort to steady she voice -- you be jest and of course you do not know -- but you should not have jest can it be you miss kate -- can it really be you it be it be -- could not you see tell I quickly -- do not do not jest again be sure i shall not sit down but she stand still with a arm extend to the picture and again implore I : see -- i be wait where -- how -- do you get it sit down i say and this time she obey with a little cry of impatience i 'll try to bring it back i say it be that day sheridan hurry back to find he army break -- all but beat just at dark there be a last charge -- a charge that be meet i go down in it hear yell and a spit fire but feel only numbness when i wake up the firing be far off near I i could hear a voice the voice of a young man i think wound like myself i first take he for one of we man but he talk undeceive I it be the talk of you man and sorrowful talk he be badly hurt he know that but he be sure of life he could not die there like a brute he have to go back and he would go back alive and well for god be a gentleman whatever else he be and above practical joke of that sort then he seem to know he be lose strength and he cry out for a picture as if he must at least have that before he go weak as he be he try to turn on he side to search for it ` it be here a moment ago ' he would say ' i have it once ' and he try to turn again still cry out for it -- he must not die without it it hurt I to hear he voice break and i make out to roll near he to help he search ` we 'll find it ' i tell he and he thank I for my help ` look for a square hard case ' he say eagerly ` it must be here i have it after i fall down ' together we search the rough ground over in the dark as well as we could i be glad enough to help he i have a picture like that of my own that i should not have like to lose but we be clumsy searcher and he seem to lose hope as he lose strength again he cry out for that picture but now it be a despairing cry and it hurt I under the darkness i reach my one good hand up and take my own picture from its place so many of we carry picture over we heart in those day i pretend then to search once more tell he to have courage and then i say ` be this it ' he fumble for it and he hand catch it quickly up under he chin he be so glad he thank I for find it and then he lay still pant after a while -- we both want water -- i crawl away to where i hear a run stream it must have be farther than i think and i could not be quick because so much of I be numb and have to be drag but i reach the water and fill a canteen i have find on the way as soon as i could manage it i go back to he with the water but i must have be go a long time he be not there but as i crawl near where he have lie i put my hand on a little square case such as i have give he i think it must be mine i lose consciousness again when i awake two hospital steward carry I on a stretcher and a field surgeon walk beside we i still have the picture and not for many day do i know that it be not my own after that i forget it -- but i have already tell you of that she eye have not quit my face while i speak though they be glisten she mouth have weaken more than once and a piteous little oh would come from she lip when i have finish she look away from I drop she eye to the floor lean forward intently she hand shut between she knee for a long time she remain so forget I but at last i could hear she breathe and could see the increase rise and fall of it so that i fear a crisis but none come again she master herself and even manage a smile for I though it be a poor thing i have tell you all miss kate yes -- i be unfair but you have a right to know i find that picture -- you picture when they bring he in he hand be clench about it they say he have plead to hold it and make they promise not to take it from he -- ever i be leave alone and i dare to take it just for a moment something in the design of the cover puzzle I i have mean to put it right back and after i have look at it there be only one thing to do -- to put it back they say you find you own picture or i might have suspect they have reason to say it -- i never tell of course you never tell miss kate i seem to learn a great deal of she from that she have carry she wound secretly through all those year poor little miss i say in spite of myself and at this quite unexpectedly there befall what i have hope we might both be spare i might not soothe she as i would have wish so i busied myself in the next room until she call to I she be put what touch she could to she eye with a small and sadly bedraggled handkerchief there be a better reason for tell no one now she say so we must destroy this mother might see it my grate contain its summer accumulation of waste paper she lay the picture on this and i light the pyre you mother will see you eye i say she have see they so before and she give I she hand which i kissed poor little miss i say still hold it not poor now -- you have give I back so much i can believe again -- i can believe almost as much as jim but i release she hand though she eye have not quit mine they look be one of utter friendliness chapter xxvii how a truce be troublesome in the day and night that follow this interview i associate rather more than usual with jim it seem well to do so i need to learn once more some of the magnificent belief that i have teach he in day when my own be stronger close companionship with a dog of the truly greek spirit under circumstance in which i now find myself be bind to be of a tonic value i have see almost at the moment of miss kate 's disclosure that a change be to come in we relation perhaps i be wild enough at the moment to hope that it might be a change for the better but this be only in the first flush of it -- of a moment ill adapt for close reasoning it take no great while to convince I that the discovery in which we have cooperate be of a character necessarily to put I from she even farther than she have at first choose to put I -- and that be far enough heaven know in effect i have give back she love to she a love she have for ten year unjustly doubt that be the cold truth of it for one who know woman one who could doubt the tenth year as poignantly as she have doubt in the first -- would she not in bitterness regret she doubt ten other year and sweetly mourn she lose love still another ten she who have let I be little enough to she while she feel she wound -- how much less could i be when the hurt be heal before she might have be in want at least that be conceivable now she want be meet not only be there this to fill she heart but remorse the tenderest a woman may know it seem to I -- remorse for undeserved suspicion in a setting less prosaic than little arcady where event might be of a story-fitness that lover would have be alive by a happy chance estrange by the misunderstanding but splendidly faithful and i should have be helper and interested witness to a ideal reconciliation thereafter to play out my game with a full heart though with a exterior placidly unconcerned but with we event halt always a little short of true romance they be unexcitingly usual i would have to play out my game full heartedly nurse my power of belief back to they one-time vigor nothing would occur to ease my lot -- not even a occasion to pretend that i give my blessing to a reunited and happy pair miss kate could go on believe unwittingly i have give she the stuff for belief i too must go on believe and provide my own material as have ever be my lot all of which be why my dog seem my most profitable companion at this time he every bark at a threatening baby-carriage a block away each fresh time he believe sincerely that a rubber shoe be engage in deadly struggle with he tax all he force to subdue it each time he testify with sensitive twitch nostril that the earth be good with innumerable scent each streaking of he glad-tongued white length over yellowing field design solely for he recreation hold for I a certain soothing value and when in quiet moment he assure I with melting gaze that i be a be to challenge the very heart of love -- in some measure at least do my soul gain strength from he own to know as much as i have indicate have be unavoidable for one of any intuitive power the change at once to be detect in miss kate 's manner toward I confirm my divination without enlarge they miss katharine lansdale be go forever in she place be a miss kate -- even a little miss to the eye -- who regard I at first with a undisguised alarm then with a curious interfusion of alarm and shyness a little disguised with not a little effort this be plain reading she would at first have distrust I apprehend i know not what rashness of ill-timed and forever impossible declaration as she perceive this alarm to be baseless for i not only refrain from intrude but i ostentatiously let miss kate alone shyness would creep into she apprehension to make amends for its first crude manifestation as the day go by and i display still the fine sense to keep myself aloof to seek miss kate only in those way that i seek she refreshing mother she let I discern more clearly she faith in my firmness and good sense to be plain in reward for let she alone she do not let I alone and this reward i accept becomingly with a resolve -- the metal of which i hope she would divine -- never to show myself undeserve of its benison when i say that the young woman do not let I alone i mean that she seem almost to put herself in my way not obviously true enough but in a degree palpable enough to one who have observe she first almost shrink alarm and this behavior of hers go forward at last without the slightest leaven of apprehension on she part but she shyness remain it be so marked and so novel in she -- with reference to myself -- that i could not fail to be sensible to it it be as if she divine that mad notion might still lurk within my untaught mind to be reason why she should fear I but that she confidence in my self-mastery could not at the same time be too openly show tacitly it be as if we have treat together a treaty that bind I to observe a perpetual truce my arm be forever lay down and she who have once so fear I be now free to wander when she would within the line of a honorable enemy that she should walk there with increase frequency as the day pass be a tribute to my power of restraint which i be too wise to undervalue i ignore the shyness of which she seem unable to divest herself in my presence it would have be easy not to ignore it for there be time when so little careful be she to guard herself that this shyness suggest invite appeal signalled time when without my deeper knowledge of she sex i could have swear that the true woman-call ring in my ear but a treaty be a treaty on paper or on honor and ours would never be break by black treachery of mine let she eye fall under my own with never so flutter a allurement they be not bad day as day go in this earth-life of too much exact knowledge miss kate row I over still water and walk beside I in green pasture at time like these she might even seem to forget she would even become i must affirm more nearly peavey than be strictly she right for it be plain that we treaty must involve certain stipulation of restraint on she part as well as on my own the burden be not all to be mine but these moment i learn to withstand remember that she be a woman that be a circumstance not hard to remember when she be by it be probable that my heart could not have forget it even have my trained head learn blandly to ignore it further to enliven those day i permit jim to give she lesson in believe everything when i tell she of this she say i need they i be so out of practice that be the nearest we have come to touch upon the interview of a certain afternoon i should not have consider this a forbid topic but she shyness become pitiful at any seeming approach to it jim will put you right again i assure she and i believe he do though it be not easy to persuade he that she could be morally recognize when i be by the occasion on which he first remain crouching at she foot while i walk away be regard by miss kate as a personal triumph she be so childishly open of she pleasure at this that i do not tell she it be a mere trick of mine that i have tell he to charge when he spring up she know he eye so little as to think he display regard for rather than respect for my command she could not see that he beg I piteously to know _ why _ he must crouch there at a couple of strange inconsequential foot and see the good world go suddenly wrong still further to make those day not bad day miss kate would cross we little common ground of a early evening to where i play the game on my porch often i do this until dusk obscure the face of the card i faintly suspect in the course of these bird-like visit a caprice in miss kate to know what it might be that i prefer to the society of she mother on she own porch she appear to be more curious than interested she promptly make those observation which the unillumined have ever consider it witty to make concern those who play at solitaire but find that i have long cease to be move by these she be friendly enough to judge the game upon its merit that she judge it to be stupid be neither strange nor any reflection upon the fairness of she mind the game -- in those profounder rarer aspect which alone dignify it -- be not for woman i believe that the game of card to teach they philosophy under defeat respect for the inevitable and a cheerful manipulation of such trifling good fortune as may befall -- instead of that wild womanish demand for all or nothing -- have yet to be invent i predict of this game moreover if ever it be find that it will be a game at which two at least must play rarely have i know a woman however rigid she integrity otherwise who would not brazenly amend or even repeal utterly those decree of fate which be symbolize by the game she desire intensely to win and she will not be above shift a card or two in contravention of the known rule far be i from intimate that this put upon she the stigma of moral delinquency it be mere testimony rather to she astounding capacity for self-deception and this i can not believe to be other than gracious of influence upon the intricate muddle of human association miss kate be finely the woman at those time when she deign for a ten minute to overlook my playing of the game before i have half finish on the first occasion she have master its simple mechanism and before i have quite finish she seek to practice upon it those method of the world woman in game of solitaire she would calmly have place a black nine on a black ten but the color must alternate i protest think she have forget this important rule of course -- i know that perfectly well -- but look what a fine lot of card that would give you there be a deuce of heart you could play up and a three of spade and then you could go back to cross the color again right away you know and you would have that whole line run up to the king ready to put into that space i look at she as she would have glide brazenly over that false play to rejoice in the true play it permit but i do not speak there be time indeed when we most honor the tongue of shakspere by silence emergency to which word be so inadequate that to attempt to use they be to degrade the whole language at the last i be bring face to face with a most intricately plan defeat a defeat insure by one spot on a card have the obstructive card be a six-spot of club instead of a seven-spot victory be mine i point this out to miss kate who have decline a chair at the table and have choose to stand beside my own i show she the series of play which but for that seven-spot would put the king in they place at the top and let I win and i be beat for lack of a six that she have grasp my explanation be quickly make plain actually with some enthusiasm she show I that the much-desired six of club lay directly under the fatal seven just lay the seven over here she begin eagerly and there be you black six ready for that horrid red five that be in the way -- but there be not any ` over here ' i exclaimed in some irritation there can only be eight card in a row -- that would make nine yes but then you could play up all the other so beautifully -- just see be this a game i ask or a child 's crazy play then it be a exceedingly stupid game if you can not do a little thing like that when it be absolutely necessary what be the _ sense _ of it she eye actually flash into mine as she lean at my side point out this simple way to victory what be the sense of any rule to any game on earth i retorted if i have not learn to respect rule -- if i have not learn to be thankful for what the game allow I however little it may be -- i pause for the water be deeper than i have think well well -- well _ then _ -- i should not be as thankful as i be this instant for -- for many thing that i can not have more of she straighten herself and favor I with a curious look that melt at last into a puzzling smile i do not understand you she say with a shade more of encouragement in she voice i have be near to forget my honor as a truce-observing enemy i be grateful indeed afterwards that she wish to understand I be not sufficiently imply to bring I thus low neither do i understand the morbid psychology that find satisfaction in cheating at solitaire i succeed in say i never can see how they fix it up with themselves i believe you think and talk a great deal of foolishness say miss kate in tone of reproof and with this she be off the porch before i could rise she wear pink with bit of blue spot it in no systematic order that i could discern and a pink rise lay abashed in she hair chapter xxviii the abdication of the boss there be no need to conceal that i be by this time put to it for matter to think upon not clearly related to myself in other word for matter extraneous to my neighbor 's troublesome daughter in sheer self-defence be i drive to look abroad for interest that would suffice without disquieting I i be now compel to admit that there be plainly to be observe in miss kate lansdale something more than a mere win faith in my power of self-control it be difficult at first to suspect that she actually mean to try I to the breaking point the suspicion bring a false note to that harmony of chastened grief wherein i have divine she mean to live out she life it seem too peavey and perverse a thing that she should find we truce honorably observe by myself behave toward I as if with a cold design to bring I down in disgrace -- as a proof of she superior power and my own wretched weakness yet this very thing be i oblige regretfully to concede of she before many day and it be behavior that i could palliate only by remind myself constantly that she be not only a woman but the daughter of miss caroline and by that token subject inevitably to certain infirmity of character and still do she at time evince for I that shyness which only enhance my peril i manage to refrain though in so grievous a plight from wish for another war though i do concede that if we must ever again be curse with war it might as well come now as later regrettable though i must consider it i should there find spite of my disability some field of active endeavor to engage my mind lack war i seek distraction in a matter close at hand -- one which possess quite all the vivacity of war without its violence early in the summer mr aurelia potts have resume she activity in behalf of we broader culture whereupon we people murmur promptly at solon denney for he do little arcady still hold to account for the infliction of this relentless evangel it be know that something still remain to mr pott even after a year of the pittance secure from the railway company so that it be not necessity which drive she to a considerable element of the town it seem to be mere innate perversity it be _ in _ she be a explanation which westley keyt think all-sufficient though he add by way as it be of put this into raise letter for the blind she would have to raise hell just the same if it have cost that there railroad eight million ` stead of eight hundred to exterminate pott for myself i should have set this thing to different word i regard mr pott as a zealot whom no advantage of worldly resource could blind to we shortcoming nor deter from minister unto they have it be unnecessary to earn bread for herself and little roscoe i be persuade that she would still have be unremitting in she effort to uplift we in that event she might it be true have read we more papers and sell we fewer book but she would have allow herself as little leisure that little arcady be unequal to this broader view however be to be infer from comment make in the hearing of and often in truth mean for the ear of solon denney the burden be shift to he poor shoulder with as little concern as if we best citizen have not coperated with he in the original move with grateful applause for its ingenious and fanciful daring in way devoid of he own vaunted subtlety it be convey to solon that little arcady expect he to do something this be after the town have be cleanly canvass for two monthly magazine -- one of which have a dress-pattern in each number to be cut out on the dot line -- and after we heroine have gallantly return to the charge with a rather heavy handbook of science for the home -- a book cost two dollar and fifty cent and treat of many matter such as how to conduct electrical experiment in a drawing-room how to cleanse linen of ink-stain how the world be make who invent gun-powder and how to restore the drowned i recite these from memory not have at hand either of my own two copy of this valuable work upon myself mr pott be never to call in vain for to I she be a important card miraculously shuffle into the right place in the game it be the custom of miss caroline also to sign gladly for whatsoever mr pott signify would be to she advantage she give the handbook of science to clem who be strongly move by any group of figure over six rejoice passionately to read the weight of the earth in net ton and to dwell upon those vastly extensive distance affect by astronomer but abroad in the town there be not enough of this complaisance nor of this passion for mere numeral to prevent worry from crease the brow of solon denney the good god help he once but it look like he would have to help himself now say uncle billy mccormick the day he refuse to subscribe for a improve book on the ground that the clock-shelf would not hold another one and this view of the situation come also to be the desperate view of solon himself that he suffer a black hour each week when mr pott read the _ argus _ to he with correction to make it square with one hundred common error and with good taste in no way lessen the feeling against he if he sustain a injury peculiar to he call it seem probable that he would the sooner be move to action little arcady do not know what he could do but it have faith that he would do something if he be push hard enough so the good people push and trust and push to those brutal enough to seek direct speech about it with solon he profess to be await only the right opportunity for a brilliant stroke and he counsel patience to I alone i think do he confide he utter lack of inspiration and yet though he seem to affect entire candor with I i be strangely enough puzzle by some reserve that still lurk beneath he manner i hope this mean that he be slowly find a way too good to be tell as yet even to he best friend something must be do cal he say on one occasion but you see here be the trouble -- she be a woman and i be a man that be a famous old trouble i remark and she be _ get _ to live though we ' keyt say he be not so sure of that -- he say i be lucky enough to have a earthquake make up especially for this case -- and if she live she must have way and means and then i have my own trouble say i never know i be so careless about my language until she come along she say only a iron will can correct it do you ever notice how she say ` i -- ron ' the way people say it when they be read poetry out loud i 'll bet if he have she help the author of ` one hundred common error ' could take a _ argus _ and run he list up to a hundred and fifty in no time she keep find common error there that i 'll bet this fellow never hear of you must not say ` by the sweat of the brow ' but ` by the perspiration ' -- perspiration be refine and sweat be coarse -- and to-day i learn for the first time that it be wrong to say ` mr henry peterby of plum creek _ ne _ jennie mccormick spend Sunday with she parent of this city ' it look right on the face of it but it seem you must not say ` ne ' for the first name -- only the last though it mean in french that that be she name before she be marry i tell you that woman be a stickler but what can i do well what _ can _ you do far be it from I to suggest that something must be do do you know cal sometimes i have think i would adopt a tone with she better be careful i caution mr pott be not a person that one should adopt a tone with except after long and prayerful deliberation oh i have consider it long enough -- in fact i have consider a lot of thing that woman have bother I in more way than one i tell you frankly she be such a fine woman splendid-looking capable a intellectual giant -- one i may say who make no common error -- and yet -- ah and yet -- there be then in solon 's eye that curious reserve i have before note -- a reserve that hint of some desperate but still secret design well there you be where well -- she seem to I to be a bear leader of man i see and you oh nothing -- only i be a man but something have get to be do we must use common sense in these matter it be early evening a week later when i again see solon one of those still serene evening of later summer when the light would yet permit a hour 's play at the game i hear a step but it be not she i long half-expected and wholly dreaded to see instead come solon and by he restore confidence of bear i know at a glance that something have be do or -- since he seem to be hurry -- that he be about to do it it be all over cal -- it be fix good -- how do you fix it well -- uh -- i adopt a tone that be brave solon no other man on god 's earth would have dare -- a tone i be about to say -- he break in a little uncomfortably i think -- which i have long contemplated adopt if i could tell you just how that woman have impress herself upon I you would understand what i mean when i say that she have _ power _ but i suppose you can not understand it can you he tone curiously enough be almost plead it be not necessary that i should i can at least understand that you be the boss of little arcady once more boss of nothing -- that be all over cal i have abdicate -- i be not even boss of myself why solon -- you can not possibly mean -- i do though mr pott be go to marry I and -- uh -- put a end to everything with this rather curious finish he hold out he hand expectantly well you certainly _ do _ something solon we have to use common sense in these matter he say with a effort to control he excitement but look into he eye i see reason to shake he warmly by the hand what be my own poor opinion at a crisis like this certainly nothing to be obtrude upon my friend it be clear that he have do a thing which he earnestly want and have earnestly dread to do -- and that the dread be past i be pretty happy cal -- that be all of course you 'll soon know how it be yourself he refer here to the well-known fact that i be much in the company of miss lansdale but this be a thing to be turn oh the game be teach I resignation to a solitary life i say with a affectation of disinterest that must have irritated he for he ask bluntly : -- say calvin how long do you intend to keep up that damned nonsense when everybody know -- this interesting sentence be cut off by miss kate lansdale who appear around the corner and pause politely before we with a look of trained and admirable deafness ah miss lansdale say solon urbanely i be just about to speak of you dear I say the young woman simply i think she be aghast yes -- but it be not worth repeat -- or finish miss lansdale seem to be relieve by this assurance and now i must hurry off add solon good evening we both say it seem to be of a stuff from which curtain be sometimes make white with little colored figure in it but the design would have require at least a column of the most technical description in a magazine i have subscribe for that summer there be lace at the throat and i should say that the thing have be construct with the need of miss lansdale 's slender but complete figure solely and clearly in mind chapter xxix in which all rule be break swiftly i appraise the cool perfection of she attire scent the spice of the pink she have thrust at she belt and i suffer one heart-quickening look from she eye before she could lower they to I in that instant i be sting with a presentiment that we treaty be in peril -- that it might go fearfully to smash if i do not fortify myself it come to I that the creature have regard my past success in observe this treaty with a kind of provocative resentment i can not tell how i know it -- certainly through no recognize media of communication most formally i offer she a chair by the card-table and resume my own chair with what i mean for a air of inhospitable abstraction she decline the chair prefer to stand by the table as be she custom it be on this spot year ago i say lay down the second eight card that solon denney first tell I he be about to marry discursive gossip seem best i think two long yellow braid she remark it would be too much to say that she word be snap out and now he have tell I again -- i mean that he be go to marry again what do you do she ask more cordially study the card the first time i go to war i answer absently have to play up the ace and deuce of diamond i have never be able to care much for yellow hair she observe also study the card of course it be _ effective _ in a way but -- may i ask what you be go to do this time this time i be go to play the game again she study the card it be refining i insist it teach i be learn to be a sannyasin eight other card be down and i engrossed myself with they be a sannyasin rather dull in the bhagavad-gita i answer he be to be know as a sannyasin who do not hate and do not love anything how be you progress i feel she troubling eye full upon I and i suspect there be mockery in they depths oh well fairishly -- but of course i have not study as faithfully as i might i should think you could not afford to be negligent i play up the four of spade and put a king of heart in the space thus happily secure i have read i answer absently that a benevolent man should allow himself a few fault to keep he friend in countenance i must not be everything perfect you know do not restrain yourself in the least on my account you be my sole trouble i say play a black seven on a red eight she look off the table as i glance up at she i be a patient enough man i believe and i hope meek and lowly but i see suddenly that not all the beatitude should be take without reservation i repeat i say for she have not speak you presence be the most troubling thing i know it keep I back in my study there be a red five for that black six she observe thank you and i make the play then you be not a sannyasin yet i have nearly take the first degree sometimes after hard practice i can succeed in not hate anything for as much as a hour i deal eight more card and become to outward seeming i hope absorb in the new aspect of the game perseverance will be reward she say kindly you can not expect to learn it all at once you might try not to make it harder for I again have i be a third person of fair discernment i believe i should have swear that i catch in she eye a gleam of hardened relentless determination but she only point to a four of heart which i be neglect to play up why not play the game to win she ask and there be that in she voice which be like to undo I -- a tone and the merest fanning of my face by she loose sleeve as she point to the card suddenly i know that honor be not in I she walk within my line in imminent peril of the deadliest character but there be no sign of fear in the look she hold I with and i know she have not sense she danger you should play you stupid game to win she repeat terribly you be too ingenious at find balm in defeat that little golden roughness in she voice seem to grate on my bared heart i leave she eye with a last desperate appeal to the game my hand shake as it lay down the final eight card have i ever have any reason to think i could win i find i could ask this if i keep my eye upon the card she laugh a curious almost silent confidential little laugh through which a sigh of despair seem to breathe i look quickly up but again there be that strange gleam in she eye a gleam of sternest resolve i should have call it under other circumstance you see i exclaimed point with a tremble but triumphant finger at the card you see i be beat now in this game that seem easy up to the very last moment what could i hope for in a game where the card fall wretchedly from the very start if i hope now i would be a hopeless fool indeed -lrb- illustration : that will do i say severely remember there be a gentleman present -rrb- be you sure you know how to play this game there be a sort of finality in she word that sicken I i have abide always by the rule i answer doggedly and i do know the rule look -- this game be neatly block by one little four-spot on that queen if that queen be free i could finish everything oh oh -- i have tell you it be a stupid game with stupid rule -- and it make its player -- she do not complete that but go about on another tack -- with the danger note in she voice just now i overheard you caller say a thing -- ah i fear you overhear the arrogance of the gesture with which she interrupt I be splendid he say ` how long be you go to keep up that -- that -- ' that will do i say severely remember there be a gentleman present but my voice sound queerly indeed to the ear most familiar with its quality also it tremble for she gaze almost stern in its question have not release I but how long _ be _ you she own voice have tremble as mine do she might as well have use the avoid word she tone carry it far too intelligibly it be quite as bad as swearing i try twice before i succeed in find my voice i have _ tell _ you i say desperately can not you see -- that queen be not free swiftly -- i regret to say almost with a show of temper -- she snatch the four of diamond from its lawful place and lay it brazenly far outside the game the creature _ be _ free she say crisply -- but at once she arrogance be go and she droop visibly in weakness so quickly do i rise from the table that the card of the game be hurl into a meaningless confusion i stand at she side i have lose myself little miss -- oh little miss i have a thousand arm all cry for you slowly she make she eye come to mine -- not without effort for we be close i be glad we leave you -- she have mean to say that arm i judge but there be a break in she voice a swift movement and she suddenly say _ this _ arm with a little shudder in which she could not meet my eye for such as the arm be she have finish she speech from within it close i hold she like a witless moonling forget all resolve all lesson all treaty -- all but that she be not a dream woman oh little miss be all i could say and she -- calvin blake as if it be a phrase of endearment little miss that loss have put I out but never have it be the hardship it be now -- one arm i have not think it possible for she to come nearer but a successful nestle movement be she answer i feel the need of a thousand arm and yet they strength be -- be in this one she complete my sentence with she own nestle emphasis for this one can you believe now little miss yes -- you give it to I again can you believe that i -- i -- _ that _ be never hard i believe that the first evening i see you a womanish thing to say -- i do not know it myself but she laugh to I laugh still as i bring she face nearer -- so near only then do she parted lip close tensely in the woman fear of what she read in my eye i have reason to believe that she would have master this fear but at that instant miss caroline cough rather alarmingly you should do something for that right away i say as we strike ourselves apart you let a cough like that run along and you do not know what it may end in whereupon have kiss no one on this occasion i now kiss miss caroline -- without difficulty i may add i have be mean to do it for a year i explain i must remind you that they be far less deliberate in _ my _ day say she with a delicate hint of reminiscence in she tone whereupon she look searchingly at each of we in turn then with a little gasp she weep daintily upon my love 's shoulder i have long suspect that tear be a mere aesthetic refreshment with miss caroline i have never know she weaken to they when there seem to be far better reason for it than the present occasion furnished i must take she home say my love without speak _ do _ i urge likewise in silence but understandably and i must be alone she call as they step out on to the lawn so must i it have not occur to I but i could see thought with which my mind need at once to busy itself i watch they go slowly into the dusk i think miss caroline seem to be recover when they have go i step out to look up at the strange new star the measure of my dream be full and run over to stand there and breathe full and laugh aloud -- that be my prayer of gratitude nor do i lack the presence of mind to hope that in ascend it might in some way advantage the soul of j rodney pott that humble tool with which the god have work such wonder it be no longer a dream no vision brief as a summer 's night when the light fade late to come again too soon before in that dream time i see that i have draw water like the danaide in a pitcher full of hole but now -- i wonder how long she would find it good to be alone i feel that i have be alone long enough and that seven minute or possibly eight might suffice even she she come almost with the thought though i believe she do not hurry after she see that i observe she i have to be alone a long time to think well about it -- to think it all out she say simply i think it unnecessary to state the precise number of minute this have require instead i show she all those strange new star above we and together we survey the replenish heaven how light it be -- and so late she murmur absently come back to we porch there for the first time in its green life my vine come into its natural right of screen lover in its shade my love cast down she eye but intrepidly lift she lip miss caroline be still where she should have remain in the first place i be very happy little miss you shall be still happier calvin blake i have not wait this long without know -- nor i i know too i hope jim will be glad she suggest he 'll be delighted and vastly relieved it have puzzle he fearfully of late to see you live away from I we sit down for there seem much to say i believe more than you do with all you game she taunt I but you break the rule anybody can believe anything if he can break all the rule i would a dreadful time show you that i mean to i shall not detail a conversation that could have but little interest to other indeed i remember it but poorly i only know that it seem magically to feed upon itself yet wax to little substance for the memory one thing however i retain vividly enough in a moment when we both be silent renew we amazement at the star there burst upon the night a volume of song that i instantly identify she sleep my lady sleep sing the clear tenor of arthur updyke my lady sleep -- she sleep sing three other voice in well-blended corroboration after which the four discourse upon this interesting theme we be down from the star at once but i see nothing to laugh at and say as much we might take they out some sandwich and thing to drink persist my little miss but the starlight have show I a gleam in she eye that be too outrageously peavey we will _ not _ i chant firmly to the music 's mellow accompaniment i be free to say now that the thing must be stop but you shall do it less brutally -- to-morrow or next day oh well if you -- she nestle again so soon have this habit seem to fasten upon she adaptable nature it be wonderful what one arm can do she say and in the darkness she feel for the close hand of it to draw it yet more firmly about she it have the spirit of all the arm in the world little miss -- oh my little miss -- my dream woman come true she nestle again with a sigh of old day end you _ can not _ get any closer i admonished _ here _ she whisper insistingly so that i feel the breath of it chapter xxx by another hand a wanderer from little arcady in early day return to its placid shades after many year draw thither by a little quick-born yearning to walk the old street again but he find such strangeness in these that he memory be put to prodigious feat of reconstruction ere it could make they seemly as of yore to the west away from the river the town have grope beyond a prairie frontier that have once be sacred to boyish game and the family cow now so thickly be it build with neat white house that only with strenuous clairvoyance could famous old locality be identify : the ball-ground the marshy stretch that make skating in winter or in spring a fascinating place to catch cold by wade the grassy common where shinny be play by day and yellow horn by night the enchanted spot where the circus build airy castle of canvas and where on the day after one might plant one 's foot squarely in the magic ring on the veritable spot perchance where the clown have superhumanly ridden the difficult trick-mule after local volunteer have fail so entertainingly barn in this once wild country have fail amazingly only one of any character be leave and it have shrink of old a structure of possibility intensely romantic it be now dingy pitiable insignificant no reasonable person would consider hold a circus there -- admission ten pin for boy and five pin for girl orchard too have suffer acre of they once know to they last tree include the safest route of approach by day or night have be cut down to make space for substantial but unexciting house quite like the house in anybody 's town other orchard have shrink to a few poor unproductive tree so little prize by they owner that they could no longer excite evil thought in the young indeed almost everything have shrink the church steeple once of a inconceivable height be now but a scant sixty foot and the building beneath they that once have vie with old-world cathedral be see to be but toy church especially have garden shrink one that boast the widest area in day when it must be hoe for the advantage of potato insanely plant there be now a plot so tiny that the return wanderer amazedly stare at it abandon all effort to make it occupy its old place in he memory north and south be dozen of strange prim house to puzzle up the street the street-signs another innovation be truly need of old it have be enough to say down toward the depot out by the mccormick place next to the presbyterian church up around the schoolhouse or down by the lumber yard but now it be plain that one have to know first second and third street washington adam and jefferson street socially as well the town have change not only be the native stock more travel speaking -- entirely without a air -- of trip to the yellowstone to europe chicago or santa barbara but a new element have invade the little country it go in the fall but it come again each summer draw by the green beauty of the spot and it have leave its impress the revisit wanderer observe as in a dream a immaculate coup with a couple of man on the box who behave quite as if they be about to enter the park in the full glare of fifty-ninth street and fifth avenue though they be but on a street of the little country among farm wagon the outfit be ascertain to belong to a summer resident who be say by common report to have wine right on the table at every meal no one bear out of little arcady can appraise the revolutionary character of this circumstance at anything like its true value further in the line of vehicular sensationalism a modish wicker-bodied phaeton and a minute pony-cart be see on a pleasant afternoon to issue from a driveway far up a street that now have a name but which use to be adequately identify by say up toward the fair grounds the phaeton be occupy by two lady one rather old to whom a couple of half-grown child in the pony-cart kiss they hand and shout they be not permit to follow the phaeton however as they seem to have wish its shock-headed pony drive by a aged negro who scold both child with a worn and practice garrulity be turn in another direction one of the child a little dark-faced girl of eight or nine call little miss by the driver be repeatedly threaten in the fiercest tone by he because of she perilous twisting to look back at the phaeton the cart be follow by a liver-and-white setter a young dog it seem from he frenzied capering and he manner of appear to think of something else in the midst of every important moment there prove to be two papers in the town as of old but the _ argus _ be now publish twice a week wednesday and saturday the wanderer eagerly scan its column for familiar name and for something of the town 's old tone but with little success say one item a string of electric light on a street lead up one of we hill look like a necklace of brilliant on the bosom of the night old little arcady have not electric light nor the _ argus _ this exuberance of simile again : this new game of golf that the summer folk play seem to have too much walk for a good game and just enough game to spoil a good walk golf in the little country the advent of musical culture be signify by this : at least thirty girl in this town can play the first part of ` narcissus ' pretty well but when they come to the second part they mangle the key for a minute and then say ' i do not care much for that second part -- do you ' why do not some of they learn it and give we a chance to judge the _ argus _ have acquire a woman 's department conduct by mr aurelia pott denney wife of the editor -- a public-spirited woman prominent in club circle and say to be of great assistance to she husband in he editorial duty the town be proud of she and send she as delegate to the federation of woman 's club she name indeed have be print in full more than once even by chicago newspaper some say that wisely she might give more attention to she twin son haye and wheeler denney but this likely be ill-natured carping for haye and wheeler seem not more lawless than other twin of eight and carper to a certainty do exist in little arcady one westley keyt for example lounging in the doorway of he meat-shop renew acquaintance with the wanderer who remember he as a glum-faced but not bad-hearted chap name recall and hand shake mr keyt begin to lament the simple way of a elder day glance meanwhile with honest disapproval at a newly install competitor across the street the shop itself be something of a affront its gilt name more -- the bon ton market mr keyt pronounce bon ton in he own fashion but he contempt be ably and amply express sound like one of they fancy name for a corset or a patent lamp he complain it be this here summer business that do it they swarm in here with they private hack and they hire help all tog out till you would think they be general in the army and they play that game of sissy-shinny -lrb- drop-the-handkerchief for mine if _ i _ get to play any such game -rrb- and they be such great hand to kite around night when folk have ought to be in they bed i tell you my friend it be not do this town one bit of good the idea of a passel of strong husky young man settin ' around on porch in they white pants and call it ` pass the summer ' _ i _ be not never find time to pass any summer the wanderer express a proper regret for this decadence mr keyt revert bitterly to the bon ton market : -- good name for a tooth powder or a patent necktie or a egg-beater but a butcher-shop -- why it be a _ hell _ of a name for a butcher-shop the wanderer express perfect sympathy with this view of the shop legend and remark by the way whose big house be that with the column in front up where the prouse and old blake house use to be the face of mr keyt become pleasanter oh that -- that be cal blake 's -- major blake 's you know he marry a girl that come in here from the south with she mother i guess that be after you get out of here they tear down the two house and build that big one they say it be like they southern house but i do not know it seem awful plain up the front of it cal 's all right though i guess mebbe he build the house kind of bare that way to please he wife and he mother-in-law i 'll bet if he would have he own way there would be some bracket and fret work on the front to liven it up some but i would a do just like he in he place i would by gee so would you if you see he wife _ say _ but never mind you wait right here she 'll drive up to git cal from he office at four-thirty -- it be right across there over the bank where that young fellow be settin ' in the window -- that be young cal denney studyin ' law with blake you just wait and see -- she 'll drive up in about six minute the wanderer wait out of pure cordiality to mr keyt the prospect be not exciting but the simple faith of the villager that outsider must share they interest in local concern have always seem too touch a thing to wreck within the six minute mention by mr keyt the diurnal happen to which he attach such importance be observe a woman -lrb- the younger of the two see in the phaeton -rrb- drive up for major calvin blake a youngish rather than a young woman slight with a effect of stateliness and not unattractive she husband a tall and pleasant enough look man come down the stair and when he see the woman he face light swiftly -- and rather wonderfully when one consider that she be not unexpected they drive away the wanderer be not dispose to minimize the incident however far he might fall short of westley keyt 's appreciation but he have be long absent from the little country and the people of to-day be strange and unimportant he prefer to revive as best he might the day of he own simple faith in the town 's sufficiency day when the world beyond the little country be but a place from which to order merchandise or into which at the most adventurous arcadian dare brief journey for profit or a doubtful pleasure the day of a boy 's little arcady that exist no more save as a wraith in remember mind end of project gutenberg 's the boss of little arcady by harry leon wilson
