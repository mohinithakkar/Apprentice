the end of the first act of the first night of the sultana and every member of the lester comic opera company from lester himself down to the wardrobe woman 's son who would have have to work if he mother lose she place be sick with anxiety there be perhaps only one other place as feverish as it be behind the scene on the first night of a comic opera and that be a newspaper office on the last night of a presidential campaign when the return be be flash on the canvas outside and the mob be howl and the editor-in-chief be expect to go to the court of st jame if the election come he way and the office-boy be bet he wages that it will not such night as these try man 's soul but van bibber pass the stage-door man with as calmly polite a nod as though the piece have be run a hundred night and the manager be think up souvenir for the one hundred and fiftieth and the prima donna have as usual begin to hint for a new set of costume the stage-door keeper hesitate and be lose and van bibber step into the unsuppressed excitement of the place with a pleased sniff at the familiar smell of paint and burning gas and the dusty odor that come from the scene-loft above for a moment he hesitate in the cross-light and confusion about he fail to recognize in they new costume he old acquaintance of the company but he see kripp the stage-manager in the center of the stage perspire and in he shirt-sleeve as always wildly wave a arm to some one in the fly and beckon with the other to the gas-man in the front entrance the stage hand be strike the scene for the first act and fight with the set for the second and drag out a canvas floor of tessellated marble and run a throne and a practical pair of step over it and aim the high quake wall of a palace and abuse at whoever come in they way now then van bibber shout kripp with a wild glance of recognition as the white-and-black figure come towards he you know you be the only man in new york who get behind here to-night but you can not stay lower it lower it can not you this to the man in the fly any other night go but not this night i can not have it i -- where be the backing for the center entrance do not i tell you man -- van bibber dodge two stage hand who be steer a scene at he step over the carpet as it unrolled and brush through a group of anxious whispering chorus people into the quiet of the star 's dressing-room the star see he in the long mirror before which he sit while he dresser tug at he boot and throw up he hand desperately well he cry in mock resignation be we in it or be we not be they in they seat still or have they flee how be you john say van bibber to the dresser then he drop into a big arm-chair in the corner and get up again with a protest sigh to light he cigar between the wire around the gas-burner oh it be go very well i would not have come around if it be not if the rest of it be as good as the first act you need not worry van bibber 's unchallenged freedom behind the scene have be a source of much comment and perplexity to the member of the lester comic opera company he have make he first appearance there during one hot night of the long run of the previous summer and have continue to be a almost nightly visitor for several week at first it be suppose that he be back the piece that he be the angel as those weak and wealthy individual be call who allow themselves to be lead into supply the finances for theatrical experiment but as he never peer through the curtain-hole to count the house nor make frequent trip to the front of it to look at the box sheet but be on the contrary just as undisturbed on a rainy night as on those when the standing room only sign block the front entrance this supposition be discard as untenable nor do he show the least interest in the prima donna or in any of the other pretty woman of the company he do not know they nor do he make any effort to know they and it be not until they inquire concern he outside of the theater that they learn what a figure in the social life of the city he really be he spend most of he time in lester 's dressing-room smoking listen to the reminiscence of lester 's dresser when lester be on the stage and this seclusion and he clerical attire of evening dress lead the second comedian to call he lester 's father confessor and to suggest that he come to the theater only to take the star to task for he sin and in this the second comedian be unknowingly not so very far wrong lester the comedian and young van bibber have know each other at the university when lester 's voice and gift of mimicry have make he the leader in the college theatricals and later when he have go upon the stage and have be cut off by he family even after he have become famous or on account of it van bibber have go to visit he and have find he as simple and sincere and boyish as he have be in the day of he hasty-pudding success and lester for he part have find van bibber as likable as do every one else and welcome he quiet voice and youthful knowledge of the world as a grateful relief to the boisterous _ camaraderie _ of he professional acquaintance and he allow van bibber to scold he and to remind he of what he owe to himself and to touch even whether it hurt or not upon he better side and in time he admit to find he friend 's occasional comment on stage matter of value as come from the point of view of those who look on at the game and even kripp the veteran regard he with respect after he have tell he that he could turn a set of purple costume black by throw a red light on they to the company after he come to know they he be gravely polite and to those who know he if they have overhear amusingly commonplace in he conversation he understand they better than they do themselves and make no mistake the woman smile on he but the man be suspicious and shy of he until they see that he be quite as shy of the woman and then they make he a confidant and tell he all they woe and trouble and exhibit all they little jealousy and ambition in the innocent hope that he would repeat what they say to lester they be simple unconventional light-hearted folk and van bibber find they vastly more entertaining and preferable to the silence of the desert club where the matting be down and from whence the regular _ habitués _ have depart to the other side or to newport he like the swing of the light bright music as it come to he through the open door of the dressing-room and the glimpse he get of the chorus people crowd and push for a quick charge up the iron stairway and the feverish smell of oxygen in the air and the picturesque disorder of lester 's wardrobe and the wig and sword and the mysterious article of make-up all mix together on a tray with half-finished cigar and autograph book and newspaper notice and he often wish he be clever enough to be a artist with the talent to paint the unconsciously graceful group in the sharply divide light and shadow of the wing as he see they the brilliantly color fantastically clothed girl lean against the bare brick wall of the theater or whispering together in circle with they arm close about one another or read apart and solitary or work at some piece of fancy-work as soberly as though they be in a rocking-chair in they own flat and not lean against a scene brace with the glare of the stage and the applause of the house just behind they he like to watch they coquet with the big fireman detail from the precinct engine-house and clinging desperately to the curtain wire or with one of the chorus man on the stair or tease the phlegmatic scene-shifter as they try to catch a minute 's sleep on a pile of canvas he even forgive the prima donna 's smile at he from the stage as he stand watch she from the wing and smile back at she with polite cynicism as though he do not know and she do not know that she smile be not for he but to disturb some more interested one in the front row and so in time the company become so well accustomed to he that he move in and about as unnoticed as the stage-manager himself who prowl around hiss hush on principle even though he be the only person who could fairly be say to be make a noise the second act be on and lester come off the stage and run to the dressing-room and beckon violently come here he say you ought to see this the child be do they turn you want to hear they they be great van bibber put he cigar into a tumbler and step out into the wing they be crowd on both side of the stage with the member of the company the girl be tiptoe with they hand on the shoulder of the man and make futile little leap into the air to get a better view and other be rest on one knee that those behind might see over they shoulder there be over a dozen child before the footlights with the prima donna in the center she be sing the verse of a song and they be follow she movement and join in the chorus with high piping voice they seem entirely too much at home and too self-conscious to please van bibber but there be one exception the one exception be the smallest of they a very very little girl with long auburn hair and black eye such a very little girl that every one in the house look at she first and then look at no one else she be apparently as unconcerned to all about she except the pretty prima donna as though she be by a piano at home practise a singing lesson she seem to think it be some new sort of a game when the prima donna raise she arm the child raise hers when the prima donna courtesy she stumble into one and straighten herself just in time to get the curl out of she eye and to see that the prima donna be laugh at she and to smile cheerfully back as if to say _ we _ be do we best anyway be not we she have big gentle eye and two wonderful dimple and in the excitement of the dancing and the singing she eye laugh and flash and the dimple deepen and disappear and reappear again she be as happy and innocent look as though it be nine in the morning and she be play school at a kindergarten from all over the house the woman be murmur they delight and the man be laugh and pull they mustach and nudge each other to look at the littlest one the girl in the wing be rapturous in they enthusiasm and be call she absurdly extravagant title of endearment and make so much noise that kripp stop grin at she from the entrance and look back over he shoulder as he look when he threaten fine and call for early rehearsal and when she have finish finally and the prima donna and the child run off together there be a roar from the house that go to lester 's head like wine and seem to leap clear across the footlights and drag the child back again that settle it cry lester in a suppress roar of triumph i know that child would catch they there be four encore and then the child and elise broughten the pretty prima donna come off jubilant and happy with the littlest girl 's arm full of flower which the management have with kindly forethought prepare for the prima donna but which that delightful young person and the delighted leader of the orchestra have pass over to the little girl well gasp miss broughten as she come up to van bibber laughing and with one hand on she side and breathing very quickly will you kindly tell I who be the lead woman now be i the prima donna or be i not i be not in it be i you be not say van bibber he turn from the pretty prima donna and hunt up the wardrobe woman and tell she he want to meet the littlest girl and the wardrobe woman who be flutter wildly about and as delighted as though they be all she own child tell he to come into the property-room where the child be and which have be change into a dressing-room that they might be by themselves the six little girl be in six different state of dishabille but they be too little to mind that and van bibber be too polite to observe it this be the little girl sir say the wardrobe woman excitedly proud at be the means of bring together two such prominent people she name be madeline speak to the gentleman madeline he want to tell you what a great big hit youse make the little girl be seat on one of the cushion of a double throne so high from the ground that the young woman who be pull off the child 's silk stocking and put woollen one on in they place do so without stoop the young woman look at van bibber and nod somewhat doubtfully and ungraciously and van bibber turn to the little girl in preference the young woman 's face be one of a type that be too familiar to be pleasant he take the littlest girl 's small hand in he and shake it solemnly and say i be very glad to know you can i sit up here beside you or do you rule alone yes ma'am -- yes sir answer the little girl van bibber put he hand on the arm of the throne and vault up beside the girl and pull out the flower in he button-hole and give it to she now prompt the wardrobe woman what do you say to the gentleman thank you sir stammer the little girl she be not much use to gentleman 's society explain the woman who be pull on the stocking i see say van bibber he do not know exactly what to say next and yet he want to talk to the child very much so much more than he generally want to talk to most young woman who show no hesitation in talk to he with they he have no difficulty whatsoever there be a doll lie on the top of a chest near they and he pick this up and survey it critically be this you doll he ask no say madeline point to one of the child who be much taller than herself it be ` at ` ittle durl 's my doll he be dead dear I say van bibber he make a mental note to get a live one in the morning and then he say : that be very sad but dead doll do come to life the little girl look up at he and survey he intently and critically and then smile with the dimple show as much as to say that she understand he and approve of he entirely van bibber answer this sign language by take madeline 's hand in he and ask she how she like be a great actress and how soon she would begin to storm because _ that _ photographer have not send the proof the young woman understand this and deign to smile at it but madeline yawn a very polite and sleepy yawn and close she eye van bibber move up closer and she lean over until she bare shoulder touch he arm and while the woman button on she absurdly small shoe she let she curly head fall on he elbow and rest there any number of people have show confidence in van bibber -- not in that form exactly but in the same spirit -- and though he be use to be trust he feel a sharp thrill of pleasure at the touch of the child 's head on he arm and in the warm clasp of she finger around he and he be conscious of a keen sense of pity and sorrow for she rise in he which he crush by think that it be entirely waste and that the child be probably perfectly and ignorantly happy look at that now say the wardrobe woman catch sight of the child 's closed eyelid just look at the rest of the little dear all that excite they can not stand still to get they hat on and she just as unconcerned as you please and after make the hit of the piece too she be not use to it you see say the young woman knowingly she do not know what it mean it be just that much play to she this last be say with a question glance at van bibber in whom she still fear to find the disguised agent of a child 's aid society van bibber only nod in reply and do not answer she because he find he could not very well for he be look a long way ahead at what the future be to bring to the confide little be at he side and of the evil knowledge and temptation that would mar the beauty of she quaintly sweet face and its strange mark of gentleness and refinement outside he could bear he friend lester shout the refrain of he new topical song and the laughter and the hand-clapping come in through the wing and open door break but tumultuous do she come of professional people van bibber ask drop into the vernacular he speak softly not so much that he might not disturb the child but that she might not understand what he say yes the woman answer shortly and bent she head to smooth out the child 's stage dress across she knee van bibber touch the little girl 's head with he hand and find that she be asleep and so let he hand rest there with the curl between he finger be -- be you she mother he ask with a slight inclination of he head he feel quite confident she be not at least he hope not the woman shake she head no she say who be she mother the woman look at the sleep child and then up at he almost defiantly ida clare be she mother she say van bibber 's protect hand leave the child as suddenly as though something have burn it and he draw back so quickly that she head slip from he arm and she awake and raise she eye and look up at he questioningly he look back at she with a glance of the strangest concern and of the deepest pity then he stoop and draw she towards he very tenderly put she head back in the corner of he arm and watch she in silence while she smile drowsily and go to sleep again and who take care of she now he ask the woman straighten herself and seem relieved she see that the stranger have recognize the child 's pedigree and know she story and that he be not go to comment on it i do she say after the divorce ida come to I she say speak more freely i use to be in she company when she be do ` aladdin '

third act she explain that madie would not appear in the last act only the two larger girl so she let she sleep with the cape of van bibber 's cloak around she van bibber sit there for several long minute think and then look up quickly and drop he eye again as quickly and say with a effort to speak quietly and unconcernedly : if the little girl be not on in this act would you mind if i take she home i have a cab at the stage-door and she be so sleepy it seem a pity to keep she up the sister you speak of or some one could put she to bed yes the woman say doubtfully ada 's home yes you can take she around if you want to she give he the address and he spring down to the floor and gather the child up in he arm and step out on the stage the prima donna have the center of it to herself at that moment and all the rest of the company be wait to go on but when they see the little girl in van bibber 's arm they make a rush at she and the girl lean over and kiss she with a great show of rapture and with many gasp of delight do not say van bibber he could not tell just why do not why not ask one of the girl look up at he sharply she be asleep you have waken she he say gently but he know that be not the reason he step into the cab at the stage entrance and put the child carefully down in one corner then he look back over he shoulder to see that there be no one near enough to hear he and say to the driver to the berkeley flat on fifth avenue he pick the child up gently in he arm as the carriage start and sit look out thoughtfully and anxiously as they flash past the light shop-window on broadway he be far from certain of this errand and nervous with doubt but he reassure himself that he be act on impulse and that he impulse be so often good the hall-boy at the berkeley say yes mr caruther be in and van bibber give a quick sigh of relief he take this as a omen that he impulse be a good one the young english servant who open the hall door to mr caruther 's apartment suppress he surprise with a effort and watch van bibber with alarm as he lay the child on the divan in the hall and pull a covert coat from the rack to throw over she just say mr van bibber would like to see he he say and you need not speak of the little girl have come with I she be still sleep and van bibber turn down the light in the hall and stand look down at she gravely while the servant go to speak to he master will you come this way please sir he say you have better stay out here say van bibber and come and tell I if she wake mr caruther be stand by the mantel over the empty fireplace wrap in a long loose dressing-gown which he be tie around he as van bibber enter he be partly undressed and have be just on the point of get into bed mr caruther be a tall handsome man with dark reddish hair turn below the temple into gray he moustache be quite white and he eye and face show the sign of either dissipation or of great trouble or of both but even in the formless dressing-gown he have the look and the confident bearing of a gentleman or at least of the man of the world the room be very rich-looking and be fill with the medley of a man 's choice of good painting and fine china and paper with irregular row of original drawing and sign etching the window be open and the light be turn very low so that van bibber could see the many gas lamp and the dark roof of broadway and the avenue where they cross a few block off and the bunch of light on the madison square garden and to the light on the boat of the east river from below in the street come the rattle of hurry omnibus and the rush of the hansom cab if mr caruther be surprise at this late visit he hide it and come forward to receive he caller as if he presence be expect excuse my costume will you he say i turn in rather early to-night it be so hot he point to a decanter and some soda bottle on the table and a bowl of ice and ask will you have some of this and while he open one of the bottle he watch van bibber 's face as though he be curious to have he explain the object of he visit no i think not thank you say the younger man he touch he forehead with he handkerchief nervously yes it be hot he say mr caruther fill a glass with ice and brandy and soda and walk back to he place by the mantel on which he rest he arm while he clink the ice in the glass and look down into it i be at the first night of ` the sultana ' this evening say van bibber slowly and uncertainly oh yes assent the elder man politely and tasting he drink lester 's new piece be it any good i do not know say van bibber yes i think it be i do not see it from the front there be a lot of child in it -- little one they dance and sing and make a great hit one of they have never be on the stage before it be she first appearance he be turn one of the glass around between he finger as he speak he stop and pour out some of the soda and drink it down in a gulp and then continue turn the empty glass between the tip of he finger it seem to I he say that it be a great pity he look up interrogatively at the other man but mr caruther meet he glance without any return show of interest i say repeat van bibber -- i say it seem a pity that a child like that should be allow to go on in that business a grown woman can go into it with she eye open or a girl who have have decent training can too but it be different with a child she have no choice in the matter they do not ask she permission and she be not old enough to know what it mean and she get use to it and fond of it before she grow to know what the danger be and then it be too late it seem to I that if there be any one who have a right to stop it it would be a very good thing to let that person know about she -- about this child i mean the one who make the hit -- before it be too late it seem to I a responsibility i would not care to take myself i would not care to think that i have the chance to stop it and have let the chance go by you know what the life be and what the temptation a woman -- van bibber stop with a gasp of concern and add hurriedly i mean we all know -- every man know mr caruther be look at he with he lip press closely together and he eyebrow draw into the shape of the letter v he lean forward and look at van bibber intently what be all this about he ask do you come here mr van bibber simply to tell I this what have you to do with it what have i to do with it why do you come because of the child what child you child say van bibber young van bibber be quite prepared for a outbreak of some sort and mentally brace himself to receive it he rapidly assure himself that this man have every reason to be angry and that he if he mean to accomplish anything have every reason to be considerate and patient so he face mr caruther with shoulder square as though it be a physical shock he have to stand against and in consequence he be quite unprepared for what follow for mr caruther raise he face without a trace of feeling in it and with he eye still fix on the glass in he hand set it carefully down on the mantel beside he and gird himself about with the rope of he robe when he speak it be in a tone of quiet politeness mr van bibber he begin you be a very brave young man you have dare to say to I what those who be my best friend -- what even my own family would not care to say they be afraid it might hurt I i suppose they have some absurd regard for my feeling they hesitate to touch upon a subject which in no way concern they and which they know must be very painful to I but you have the courage of you conviction you have no compunction about tear open old wound and you come here unasked and uninvited to let I know what you think of my conduct to let I understand that it do not agree with you own idea of what i ought to do and to tell I how i who be old enough to be you father should behave you have rush in where angel fear to tread mr van bibber to show I the error of my way i suppose i ought to thank you for it but i have always say that it be not the wicked people who be to be fear in this world or who do the most harm we know they we can prepare for they and checkmate they it be the well-meaning fool who make all the trouble for no one know he until he disclose himself and the mischief be do before he can be stop i think if you will allow I to say so that you have demonstrate my theory pretty thoroughly and have do about as much needless harm for one evening as you can possibly wish and so if you will excuse I he continue sternly and move from he place i will ask to say good-night and will request of you that you grow older and wiser and much more considerate before you come to see I again van bibber have flush at mr caruther 's first word and have then grow somewhat pale and straighten himself visibly he do not move when the elder man have finish but clear he throat and then speak with some little difficulty it be very easy to call a man a fool he say slowly but it be much harder to be call a fool and not to throw the other man out of the window but that you see would not do any good and i have something to say to you first i be quite clear in my own mind as to my position and i be not go to allow anything you have say or can say to annoy I much until i be through there will be time enough to resent it then i be quite well aware that i do a unconventional thing in come here -- a bold thing or a foolish thing as you choose -- but the situation be pretty bad and i do as i would have wish to be do by if i have have a child go to the devil and do not know it i should have be glad to learn of it even from a stranger however he say smile grimly and pull he cape about he there be other kindly disposed people in the world besides father there be a aunt perhaps or a uncle or two and sometimes even to-day there be the chance samaritan van bibber pick up he high hat from the table look into it critically and settle it on he head good-night he say and walk slowly towards the door he have he hand on the knob when mr caruther raise he head wait just one minute please mr van bibber ask mr caruthers van bibber stop with a prompt obedience which would have lead one to conclude that be might have put on he hat only to precipitate matter before you go say mr caruther grudgingly i want to say -- i want you to understand my position oh that be all right say van bibber lightly open the door no it be not all right one moment please i do not intend that you shall go away from here with the idea that you have try to do I a service and that i have be unable to appreciate it and that you be a much-abused and much-misunderstood young man since you have do I the honor to make my affair you business i would prefer that you should understand they fully i do not care to have you discuss my conduct at club and afternoon tea with young woman until you -- van bibber draw in he breath sharply with a peculiar whistle sound and open and shut he hand oh i would not say that if i be you he say simply i beg you pardon the older man say quickly that be a mistake i be wrong i beg you pardon but you have try I very sorely you have intrude upon a private trouble that you ought to know must be very painful to I but i believe you mean well i know you to be a gentleman and i be willing to think you act on impulse and that you will see to-morrow what a mistake you have make it be not a thing i talk about i do not speak of it to my friend and they be far too considerate to speak of it to I but you have put I on the defensive you have make I out more or less of a brute and i do not intend to be so far misunderstand there be two side to every story and there be something to be say about this even for I he walk back to he place beside the mantel and put he shoulder against it and face van bibber with he finger twist in the cord around he waist when i marry say mr caruther i do so against the wish of my people and the advice of all my friend you know all about that god help we who do not he add bitterly it be very rich rare reading for you and for every one else who see the daily papers and we give they all they want of it i take she out of that life and marry she because i believe she be as good a woman as any of those who have never have to work for they living and i be bind that my friend and you friend should recognize she and respect she as my wife have a right to be respect and i take she abroad that i might give all you sensitive fine people a chance to get use to the idea of be polite to a woman who have once be a burlesque actress it begin over there in

the life she have lead and in the life man like you and I have teach she to live and it have to come out the muscle of mr caruther 's face be move and beyond he control but van bibber do not see this

then and god help I i love that woman still he cover he face with he hand and sit lean forward and breathe heavily as he rock himself to and fro van bibber still stand look gravely out at the light

unbroken silence for a moment and then it be van bibber who be the first to speak i come here as you say on impulse he say but i be glad i come for i have you decisive answer now about the little girl

necessary and support this child instead child be worth more than horse and a man who save a soul as it say -- he flush slightly and look up with a hesitate deprecatory smile -- somewhere wipe out a multitude of sin and it may be i would like to try and get rid of some of mine i know just where to send she i know the very place it be down in evergreen bay on long island they be tenant of mine there and very nice farm sort of people who will be very good to she they would not know anything about she and she would forget what little she know of this present life very soon and grow up with the other child to be one of they and then when she get older and become a young lady she could go to some school -- but that be a bit too far ahead to plan for the present but that be what i be go to do though say the young man confidently and as though speak to himself that theatrical boarding-house person could be buy off easily enough he go on quickly and lester will not mind let she go if i ask it and -- and that be what i 'll do as you say it be a good deal of a experiment but i think i 'll run the risk he walk quickly to the door and disappear in the hall and then come back kick the door open as he return and hold the child in he arm this be she he say quietly he do not look at or notice the father but stand with the child asleep in the bend of he left arm gaze down at she this be she he repeat this be you child there be something cold and satisfied in van bibber 's tone and manner as though he be congratulating himself upon the engaging of a new groom something that place the father entirely outside of it he might have be a disinterested looker-on she will need to be feed a bit van bibber run on cheerfully they do not treat she very well i fancy she be thin and peaked and tired-looking he draw up the loose sleeve of she jacket and show the bare forearm to the light he put he thumb and little finger about it and close they on it gently it be very thin he say and under she eye if it be not for the paint he go on mercilessly you could see how deep the line be this red spot on she cheek he say gravely be where mary vane kiss she to-night and this be where alma stantley kiss she and that lee girl you have hear of they perhaps they will never kiss she again she be go to grow up a sweet fine beautiful woman -- be you not he say gently draw the child higher up on he shoulder until she face touch he and still keep he eye from the face of the older man she do not look like she mother he say she have she father 's auburn hair and straight nose and finer-cut lip and chin she look very much like she father it seem a pity he add abruptly she will grow up he go on without know he or who he be -- or be if he should die she will never speak with he or see he or take he hand she may pass he some day on the street and will not know he and he will not know she but she will grow to be very fond and to be very grateful to the simple kind-hearted old people who will have care for she when she be a little girl the child in he arm stir shiver slightly and awake the two man watch she breathlessly with silent intentness she raise she head and stare around the unfamiliar room doubtfully then turn to where she father stand look at he a moment and pass he by and then look up into van bibber 's face recognize he and give a gentle sleepy smile and with a sigh of content and confidence draw she arm up closer around he neck and let she head fall back upon he breast the father spring to he foot with a quick jealous gasp of pain give she to I he say fiercely under he breath snatch she out of van bibber 's arm she be mine give she to I van bibber close the door gently behind he and go jump down the wind stair of the berkeley three step at a time and a hour later when the english servant come to he master 's door he find he still awake and sit in the dark by the open window hold something in he arm and look out over the sleep city jame he say you can make up a place for I here on the lounge miss caruther my daughter will sleep in my room to-night van bibber 's man-servant van bibber 's man walter be the envy and admiration of he friend he be english of course and he have be train in the household of the marquis bendinot and have travel in he younger day as the valet of young lord upton he be now rather well on in year although it would have be impossible to say just how old he be walter have a dignified and repellent air about he and he brush he hair in such a way as to conceal he baldness and when a smirking slavish youth with red cheek and awkward gesture turn up in van bibber 's livery he friend be naturally surprised and ask how he have come to lose walter van bibber could not say exactly at least he could not rightly tell whether he have dismiss walter or walter have dismiss himself the fact of the unfortunate separation be like this : van bibber give a great many dinner during the course of the season at delmonico 's dinner hardly formal enough to require a private room and yet too important to allow of he run the risk of keep he guest stand in the hall wait for a vacant table so he conceive the idea of send walter over about half-past six to keep a table for he as everybody know you can hold a table yourself at delmonico 's for any length of time until the other guest arrive but the rule be very strict about servant because as the head waiter will tell you if servant be allow to reserve a table during the big rush at seven o'clock why not messenger boy and it would certainly never do to have half a dozen large table securely hold by minute messenger while the hungry and impatient wait they turn at the door but walter look as much like a gentleman as do many of the diner and when he seat himself at the largest table and tell the waiter to serve for a party of eight or ten he do it with such a air that the head waiter come over himself and take the order walter know quite as much about order a dinner as do he master and when van bibber be too tired to make out the menu walter would look over the card himself and order the proper wine and side dish and with such a carelessly severe air and in such a masterly manner do he discharge this high function that the waiter look upon he with much respect but respect even from you equal and the satisfaction of have you fellow-servant mistake you for a member of the few hundred be not enough walter want more he want the further satisfaction of enjoy the delicious dish he have order of sit as a coequal with the people for whom he have keep a place of complete the deception he practice only up to the point where it become most interesting it certainly be try to have to rise with a subservient and unobtrusive bow and glide out unnoticed by the real guest when they arrive to have to relinquish the feast just when the feast should begin it would not be pleasant certainly to sit for a hour at a big empty table order dish fit only for epicure and then just as the waiter bear down with the little neck clam so nicely iced and so cool and bitter-looking to have to rise and go out into the street to a _ table d'hôte _ around the corner this be walter 's state of mind when mr van bibber tell he for the hundredth time to keep a table for he for three at delmonico 's walter wrap he severe figure in a frock-coat and brush he hair and allow himself the dignity of a walking-stick he would have like to act as a substitute in a evening dress-suit but van bibber would not have allow it so walter walk over to delmonico 's and take a table near a window and say that the other gentleman would arrive later then he look at he watch and order the dinner it be just the sort of dinner he would have order have he order it for himself at some one else 's expense he suggest little neck clam first with chabli and pea-soup and caviare on toast before the oyster crab with johannisberger cabinet then a _ entrée _ of calf ' brain and rice then no roast but a bird cold asparagus with french dress camembert cheese and turkish coffee as there be to be no woman he omit the sweet and add three other wine to follow the white wine it strike he as a particularly well-chosen dinner and the longer he sit and think about it the more he wish he be to test its excellence and then the people all around he be so bright and happy and seem to be enjoy what they have order with such a refinement of zest that he feel he would give a great deal could he just sit there as one of they for a brief hour at that moment the servant deferentially hand he a note which a messenger boy have bring it say : dinner off call out town send clothes and thing after I to young 's boston van bibber walter rise involuntarily and then sit still to think about it he would have to countermand the dinner which he have order over half a hour before and he would have to explain who he be to those other servant who have always regard he as such a great gentleman it be very hard and then walter be tempt he be a very good servant and he know he place as only a english servant can and he have always accept it but to-night he be tempt -- and he fall he meet the waiter 's anxious look with a grave smile the other gentleman will not be with I to-night he say glancing at the note but i will dine here as i intend you can serve for one that be perhaps the proudest night in the history of walter he have always feel that he be bear out of he proper sphere and to-night he be assure of it he be a little nervous at first lest some of van bibber 's friend should come in and recognize he but as the dinner progress and the warm odor of the dish touch he sense and the rich wine run through he vein and the woman around he smile and bent and move like beautiful bird of beautiful plumage he become content grandly content and he half close he eye and imagine he be give a dinner to everybody in the place vain and idle thought come to he and go again and he eye the other about he calmly and with polite courtesy as they do he and he feel that if he must later pay for this moment it be worth the pay then he give the waiter a couple of dollar out of he own pocket and write van bibber 's name on the check and walk in state into the _ café _ where he order a green mint and a heavy black and expensive cigar and seat himself at the window where he feel that he should always have sit if the fate have be just the smoke hang in light cloud about he and the light shine and glisten on the white cloth and the broad shirt-front of the smart young man and distinguish foreign-looking older man at the surround table and then in the midst of he dreaming he hear the soft careless drawl of he master which sound at that time and in that place like the awful voice of a condemn judge van bibber pull out a chair and drop into it he side be towards walter so that he do not see he he have some man with he and he be explain how he have miss he train and have come back to find that one of the party have eat the dinner without he and he wonder who it could be and then turn easily in he seat he see walter with the green mint and the cigar tremble behind a copy of the london _ graphic _ walter say van bibber what be you do here walter look he guilt and rise stiffly he begin with a feeble if you please sir -- go back to my room and wait for I there say van bibber who be too decent a fellow to scold a servant in public walter rise and leave the half-finished cigar and the mint with the ice melting in it on the table he one evening of sublimity be over and he walk away bend before the glance of he young master and the smile of he master 's friend when van bibber come back he find on he dressing-table a note from walter state that he could not of course expect to remain longer in he service and that he leave behind he the twenty-eight dollar which the dinner have cost if he have only go off with all my waistcoat and scarf-pin i would have like it better say van bibber than he leave I cash for infernal dinner why a servant like walter be worth twenty-eight-dollar dinner -- twice a day the hungry man be feed young van bibber break one of he rule of life one day and come down-town this unusual journey into the mart of trade and finance be in response to a call from he lawyer who want he signature to some papers it be five year since van bibber have be south of the north side of washington square except as a transient traveller to the ferry on the elevated road and as he walk through the city hall square he look about he at the new building in the air and the bustle and confusion of the street with as much interest as a lately arrive immigrant he rather enjoy the novelty of the situation and after he have complete he business at the lawyer 's office he try to stroll along lower broadway as he do on the avenue but people bump against he and cart and dray try to run he down when he cross the side street and those young man whom he know seem to be in a great hurry and express such amuse surprise at see he that he feel very much out of place indeed and so he decide to get back to he club window and its quiet as soon as possible hello van bibber say one of the young man who be speed by what bring you here have you lose you way i think i have say van bibber if you 'll kindly tell I how i can get back to civilization again be oblige to you take the elevated from park place say he friend from over he shoulder as he nod and dive into the crowd the visitor from up-town have not a very distinct idea as to where park place be but he strike off broadway and follow the line of the elevated road along church street it be at the corner of vesey street that a miserable-looking dirty and red-eyed object stand still in he track and begged van bibber for a few cent to buy food i have come all the way from chicago say the object and i have not taste food for twenty-four hour van bibber draw away as though the object have a contagious disease in he rag and hand he a quarter without wait to receive the man 's blessing poor devil say van bibber fancy go without dinner all day he could not fancy this though he try and the impossibility of it impress he so much that he amiably determine to go back and hunt up the object and give he more money van bibber 's idea of a dinner be rather exalt he do not know of place where a quarter be good for a square meal include one roast three vegetable and pie he hardly consider a quarter a sufficiently large tip for the waiter who serve the dinner and decidedly not enough for the dinner itself he do not see he man at first and when he do the man do not see he van bibber watch he stop three gentleman two of whom give he some money and then the object approach van bibber and repeat he sad tale in a monotone he evidently do not recognize van bibber and the clubman give he a half-dollar and walk away feel that the man must surely have enough by this time with which to get something to eat if only a luncheon this retracing of he footstep have confuse van bibber and he make a complete circuit of the block before he discover that he have lose he bearing he be stand just where he have start and gaze along the line of the elevated road look for a station when the familiar accent of the object again salute he when van bibber face he the beggar look uneasy he be not sure whether or not he have approach this particular gentleman before but van bibber conceive a idea of much subtlety and deceive the object by again put he hand in he pocket nothing to eat for twenty-four hour dear I drawl the clubman sympathetically have not you any money either not a cent groan the object a ' i be just faint for food sir s ` help I i hate to beg sir it be not the money i want it be jest food i be starvin ' sir well say van bibber suddenly if it be just something to eat you want come in here with I and i 'll give you you breakfast but the man hold back and begin to whine and complain that they would not let the likes of he in such a fine place oh yes they will say van bibber glancing at the bill of fare in front of the place it seem to be extremely cheap beefsteak fifteen cent for instance go in he add and there be something in he tone which make the object move ungraciously into the eating-house it be a very queer place van bibber thought and the people stare very hard at he and he glove and the gardenia in he coat and at the tramp accompany he you be not go to eat two breakfast be yer ask one of the very tough-looking waiter of the object the object look uneasy and van bibber who stand beside he chair smile in triumph you be mistaken he say to the waiter this gentleman be starve he have not taste food for twenty-four hour give he whatever he ask for the object scowl and the waiter grin behind he tin tray and have the impudence to wink at van bibber who recover from this in time to give the man a half-dollar and so to make of he a friend for life the object order milk but van bibber protest and order two beefsteak and fry potato hot roll and two omelette coffee and ham with bacon holy smoke watcher think i be yell the object in desperation hungry say van bibber very gently or else a impostor and you know if you should happen to be the latter i should have to hand you over to the police van bibber lean easily against the wall and read the sign about he and keep one eye on a policeman across the street the object be choke and cursing through he breakfast it do not seem to agree with he whenever he stop van bibber would point with he stick to a still unfinished dish and the object after a husky protest would attack it as though it be poison the people sit about be laugh and the proprietor behind the desk smile grimly there darn ye say the object at last i have eat all i can eat for a year you think you be mighty smart do not ye but if you choose to pay that high for you fun i s ` pose you can afford it only do not let I catch you around these street after dark that be all and the object start off shake he fist wait a minute say van bibber you have not pay they for you breakfast have not what shout the object pay 'em how could i pay he youse ask I to come in here and eat i do not want no breakfast do i youse 'll have to pay for you fun yerself or they 'll throw yer out do not try to be too smart i give you say van bibber slowly seventy-five cent with which to buy a breakfast this check call for eighty-five cent and extremely cheap it be he add with a bow to the fat proprietor several other gentleman on you representation that you be starve give you other sum to be expend on a breakfast you have the money with you now so pay what you owe at once or i 'll call that officer across the street and tell he what i know and have you put where you belong i 'll see you blow first gasp the object van bibber turn to the waiter kindly beckon to that officer say he the waiter run to the door and the object run too but the tough waiter grab he by the back of he neck and hold he lemme go yell the object lemme go a ' i 'll pay you everybody in the place come up now and form a circle around the group and watch the object count out eighty-five cent into the waiter 's hand which leave he just one dime to himself you have forget the waiter who serve you say van bibber severely point with he stick at the dime no you do not groan the object oh yes say van bibber do the decent thing now or i 'll -- the object drop the dime in the waiter 's hand and van bibber smile and easy make he way through the admire crowd and out into the street i suspect say mr van bibber later in the day when recount he adventure to a fellow-clubman that after i leave fellow try to get tip back from waiter for i see he come out of place very suddenly you see and without touch pavement till he light on back of he head in gutter he be most remarkable waiter van bibber at the race young van bibber have never spend a fourth of July in the city as he have always understand it be give over to army of small boy on that day who sit on all the curbstone and set off fire-cracker and that the thermometer always show ninety degree in the shade and cannon boom and bell ring from daybreak to midnight he have refuse all invitation to join any fourth-of-july party at the seashore or on the sound or at tuxedo because he expect he people home from europe and have to be in new york to meet they he be accordingly greatly annoy when he receive a telegram say they would sail in a boat a week later he finish he coffee at the club on the morning of the fourth about ten o'clock in absolute solitude and with no one to expect and nothing to anticipate so he ask for a morning paper and look up the amusement offer for the fourth there be plenty of excursion with brass band and refreshment serve on board baseball match by the hundred athletic meeting and picnic by the dozen but nothing that seem to exactly please he the race sound attractive but then he always lose such a lot of money and the crowd push so and the sun and the excitement make he head ache between the eye and spoil he appetite for dinner he have vow again and again that he would not go to the race but as the day wear on and the solitude of the club become oppressive and the silence of the avenue begin to tell on he he change he mind and make he preparation accordingly first he send out after all the morning papers and read they tip on the probable winner very few of they agree so he take the horse which most of they seem to think be best and determine to back it no matter what might happen or what new tip he might get later then he put two hundred dollar in he pocket-book to bet with and twenty dollar for expense and send around for he field-glass he be rather late in start and he make up he mind on the way to morri park that he would be true to the list of winner he have write out and not make any side bet on any suggestion or inside information give he by other he vow a solemn vow on the rail of the boat to plunge on each of the six horse he have select from the newspaper tip and on no other he hope in this way to win something he do not care so much to win but he hate to lose he always feel so flat and silly after it be over and when it happen as it often do that he have pay several hundred dollar for the afternoon 's sport he sentiment do he credit i shall probably or rather certainly be tramp on and shove soliloquize van bibber i shall smoke more cigar than be good for I and drink more than i want owe to the unnatural excitement and heat and i shall be late for my dinner and for all this i shall probably pay two hundred dollar it really seem as if i be a young man of little intellect and yet thousand of other be go to do exactly the same thing the train be very late one of the man in front say they would probably just be able to get they money up in time for the first race a horse name firefly be van bibber 's choice and he take one hundred dollar of he two hundred to put up on she he have it already in he hand when the train reach the track and he hurry with the rest towards the bookmaker to get he one hundred on as quickly as possible but while he be cross the lawn back of the stand he hear cheer and wild yell that tell he they be run the race at that moment raceland raceland raceland by a length shout the crowd who be second a fat man shout at another fat man firefly call back the second joyously and i have get she for a place and i win eight dollar ah say van bibber as he slip he one hundred dollar back in he pocket good thing i get here a bit late what would you win van bibber ask a friend who rush past he clutch he ticket as though they be precious stone i win one hundred dollar answer van bibber calmly as he walk on up into the box it be delightfully cool up there and to he satisfaction and surprise he find several people there whom he know he go into she box and accept some _ pâté _ sandwich and iced champagne and chat and laugh with she so industriously and so much to the exclusion of all else that the horse be at the starting-post before he be aware of it and he have to excuse himself hurriedly and run to put up he money on bugler the second on he list he decide that as he have win one hundred dollar on the first race he could afford to plunge on this one so he count out fifty more and put this with the original one hundred dollar crowd into the betting-ring and say a hundred and fifty on bugler straight bugler 's just be scratch say the bookie lean over van bibber 's shoulder for a greasy five-dollar bill will you play anything else he ask as the young gentleman stand there irresolute no thank you say van bibber remember he vow and turn hastily away well he muse i be one hundred and fifty dollar better off than i might have be if bugler have not be scratch and have not win one hundred and fifty dollar add to one hundred make two hundred and fifty dollar that put I ` way ahead of the game i be fifty dollar better off than when i leave new york i be play in great luck so on the strength of this he buy out the man who sell bouquet and order more champagne to be send up to the box where she be sit and they all congratulate he on he winnings which be suggest by he generous and sudden expenditure you must have a great eye for pick a winner say one of the older man grudgingly y-e-s say van bibber modestly i know a horse when i see it i think and he add to himself that be about all he horse for the third race be rover and the odds be five to one against he van bibber want very much to bet on pirate king instead but he remember he vow to keep to the list he have originally prepared whether he lose or win this run after strange god be always a lose business he take one hundred dollar in five-dollar bill and go down to the ring and put the hundred up on rover and return to the box the horse have be weigh in and the bugle have sound and three of the racer be make they way up the track when one of they plunge suddenly forward and go down on he knee and then stretch out dead van bibber be confident it be rover although he have no idea which the horse be but he know he horse would not run there be a great deal of excitement and people who do not know the rule which require the return of all money if any accident happen to a horse on the race-track between the time of weigh in and arrive at the post be needlessly alarmed van bibber walk down to the ring and receive he money back with a smile i be just one hundred dollar better off than i be three minute ago he say i have really have a most remarkable day mayfair be he choice for the fourth race and she be sell at three to one van bibber determine to put one hundred and seventy-five dollar up on she for as he say he have not lose on any one race yet the girl in the box be very interesting though and van bibber find a great deal to say to she he interrupt himself once to call to one of the messenger-boy who run with bet and give he one hundred and seventy-five dollar to put on mayfair several other gentleman give the boy large sum as well and van bibber continue to talk earnestly with the girl he raise he head to see mayfair straggle in a bad second and shrug he shoulder how much do you lose she ask oh ` bout two hundred dollar say van bibber but it be the first time i have lose to-day so i be still ahead he bent over to continue what he be say when a rude commotion and loud talking cause those in the box to raise they head and look around several gentleman be point out van bibber to one of the pinkerton detective who have a struggle messenger-boy in he grasp these gentleman say you give this boy some money sir say the detective he try to do a welsh with it and i catch he just as he be get over the fence how much and on what horse sir van bibber show he memorandum and the officer hand he over one hundred and seventy-five dollar now let I see say van bibber shut one eye and calculate intently one hundred and seventy-five to three hundred and fifty dollar make I a winner by five hundred and twenty-five dollar that be purty good be not it i 'll have a great dinner at delmonico 's to-night you would better all come back with I but she say he have much better come back with she and she party on top of the coach and take dinner in the cool country instead of the hot close city and van bibber say he would like to only he do wish to get he one hundred dollar up on at least one race but they say no they must be off at once for the ride be a long one and van bibber look at he list and see that he choice be jack frost a very likely winner indeed but nevertheless he walk out to the enclosure with they and mount the coach beside the girl on the back seat with only the two coachman behind to hear what he choose to say and just as they finally be all harness up and the horn sound the crowd yell they be off and van bibber and all of they turn on they high seat to look back magpie win say the whip and jack frost 's last say another and i win my one hundred dollar say van bibber it be really very curious he add turn to the girl i start out with two hundred dollar to-day i spend only twenty-five dollar on flower i win six hundred and twenty-five dollar and i have only one hundred and seventy-five dollar to show for it and yet i have have a very pleasant fourth a experiment in economy of course van bibber lose all the money he save at the race on the fourth of July he go to the track the next day and he see the whole sum melt away and in he vexation try to get back with the usual result he plunge desperately and when he have reach he room and run over he loss he find he be a financial wreck and that he as he sport friend express it would have to smoke a pipe for several year to come instead of indulge in regalia he could not conceive how he have come to make such a fool of himself and he wonder if he would have enough confidence to spend a dollar on luxury again it be awful to contemplate the amount he have lose he feel as if it be sinful extravagance to even pay he car-fare up-town and he contemplate give he landlord the rent with keen distress it almost hurt he to part with five cent to the conductor and as he look at the hansom dash by with lucky winner inside he groan audibly i have get to economize he soliloquize no use talk must economize i 'll begin to-morrow morning and keep it up for a month then i 'll be on my foot again then i can stop economize and enjoy myself but no more race never never again he be delighted with this idea of economize he like the idea of self-punishment that it involve and as he have never deny himself anything in he life the novelty of the idea charm he he roll over to sleep feeling very much happier in he mind than he have be before he determination be take and quite eager to begin on the morrow he arise very early about ten o'clock and recall he idea of economy for a month as a saving clause to he have lose a month 's spending money he be in the habit of take he coffee and roll and a parsley omelette at delmonico 's every morning he decide that he would start out on he road of economy by omit the omelette and order only a pot of coffee by some rare intuition he guess that there be place up-town where thing be cheaper than at he usual haunt only he do not know where they be he stumble into a restaurant on a side street finally and order a cup of coffee and some roll the waiter seem to think that be a very poor sort of breakfast and suggest some nice chop or a bit of steak or ham and egg sah all of which make van bibber shudder the waiter finally conclude that van bibber be poor and could not afford any more which as it happen to be more or less true worried that young gentleman so much so indeed that when the waiter bring he a check for fifteen cent van bibber hand he a half-dollar and tell he to keep the change the satisfaction he feel in this wear off very soon when he appreciate that while he have economize in he breakfast he vanity have be very extravagantly pampered and he feel how absurd it be when he remember he would not have spend more if he have go to delmonico ' in the first place he want one of those large black regalia very much but they cost entirely too much he go carefully through he pocket to see if he have one with he but he have not and he determine to get a pipe pipe be always cheap what sort of a pipe sir say the man behind the counter a cheap pipe say van bibber but what sort persist the man van bibber think a brier pipe with a amber mouth-piece and a silver band would about suit he fancy the man have just such a pipe with trade-mark on the brier and hall-mark and sterling on the silver band it lay in a very pretty silk box and there be another mouth-piece you could screw in and a cleaner and top piece with which to press the tobacco down it be most complete and only five dollar be not that a good deal for a pipe ask van bibber the man say be entirely unprejudiced that he think not it be cheaper he say to get a good thing at the start it last longer and cheap pipe bite you tongue this seem to van bibber most excellent reasoning some oxford-cambridge mixture attract van bibber on account of its name this cost one dollar more as he leave the shop he see a lot of pipe brier and corn-cob and sallie michael in the window mark any of these for a quarter this make he feel badly and he be conscious he be not make a success of he economy he start back to the club but it be so hot that he think he would faint before he get there so he call a hansom on the principle that it be cheaper to ride and keep well than to walk and have a sunstroke he see some people that he know go by in a cab with a pile of trunk on the top of it and that remind he that they have ask he to come down and see they off when the steamer leave that afternoon so he wave he hand when they pass and bow to they and cry see you later before he count the consequence he do not wish to arrive empty-handed so he stop in at a florist 's and get a big basket of flower and another of fruit and pile they into the hansom when be come to pay the driver he find the trip from thirty-fifth street to the foot of liberty be two dollar and a half and the fruit and flower come to twenty-two dollar he be greatly distressed over this and could not see how it have happen he ride back in the elevated for five cent and feel much better then some man just back from a yachting trip join he at the club and order a great many thing to drink and of course he have to do the same and seven dollar be add to he economy fund he argue that this do not matter because he sign a check for it and that he would not have to pay for it until the end of the month when the necessity of economize would be over still he conscience do not seem convinced and he grow very desperate he feel he be not do it at all properly and he determine that he would spend next to nothing on he dinner he remember with a shudder the place he have take the tramp to dinner and he vow that before he would economize as rigidly as that he would starve but he have hear of the _ table d'hôte _ place on sixth avenue so he go there and wander along the street until he find one that look clean and nice he begin with a heavy soup shove a rich fat fried fish over he plate and follow it with a queer _ entrée _ of spaghetti with a tomato dress that satisfied he hunger and kill he appetite as if with the blow of a lead pipe but he go through with the rest of it for he feel it be the truest economy to get he money 's worth and the limp salad in bad oil and the ice-cream of sour milk make he feel that eating be a positive pain rather than a pleasure and in this state of mind and body drug and disgust he light he pipe and walk slowly towards the club along twenty-sixth street he look in at the _ café _ at delmonico 's with envy and disgust and go disheartenedly on pass the dining-room window that be wide open and show the heavy white linen the silver and the woman coolly dress and everybody happy and then there be a wild wave of arm inside and white hand beckon he and he see with mingled feeling of regret that the whole party of the fourth of July be inside and motion to he they make room for he and the captain 's daughter help he to olive and the chaperon tell how they have come into town for the day and have be telegraph for he and edgar and fred and dear bill and the rest say they be so glad to see he because they know he could appreciate a good dinner if any one could but van bibber only groan and the awful memory of the lead-like spaghetti and the bad oil and the queer cheese make he shudder and turn thing before he into a tantalus feast of rare cruelty there be little neck clam delicious cold consommé and white fish and french chop with a dress of truffle and roman punch and woodcock to follow and crisp lettuce and toast crackers-and-cheese with a most remarkable combination of fruit and ice and van bibber could eat nothing and sit unhappily look at he plate and shake he head when the waiter urge he gently economy he say with disgusted solemnity it be all tommy rot it would not have cost I a cent to have eat this dinner and yet i have pay half a dollar to make myself ill so that i can not if you know how to economize it may be all right but if you do not understand it you must leave it alone it be dangerous i 'll economize no more and he accordingly break he vow by take the whole party up to see the lady who would not be photograph in tights and put they in a box where they be gag by the comedian and where the soubrette smile on they and all go well mr traver 's first hunt young traver who have be engage to a girl down on long island for the last three month only meet she father and brother a few week before the day set for the wedding the brother be a master of hound near southampton and share the expense of import a pack from england with van bibber the father and son talk horse all day and until one in the morning for they own fast thoroughbred and enter they at the sheepshead bay and other race-track old mr paddock the father of the girl to whom traver be engage have often say that when a young man ask he for he daughter 's hand he would ask he in return not if he have live straight but if he could ride straight and on he answering this question in the affirmative depend he gain she parent 's consent traver have meet miss paddock and she mother in europe while the man of the family be at home he be invite to they place in the fall when the hunting season open and spend the evening most pleasantly and satisfactorily with he _ fiancée _ in a corner of the drawing-room but as soon as the woman have go young paddock join he and say you ride of course traver have never ridden but he have be prompt how to answer by miss paddock and so say there be nothing he like better as he express it he would rather ride than sleep that be good say paddock i 'll give you a mount on satan to-morrow morning at the meet he be a bit nasty at the start of the season and ever since he kill wallis the second groom last year none of we care much to ride he but you can manage he no doubt he 'll just carry you weight mr traver dream that night of take large desperate leap into space on a wild horse that snort forth flame and that rise at solid stone wall as though they be hayrick he be tempt to say he be ill in the morning -- which be consider he state of mind more or less true -- but conclude that as he would have to ride sooner or later during he visit and that if he do break he neck it would be in a good cause he determine to do he best he do not want to ride at all for two excellent reason -- first because he want to live for miss paddock 's sake and second because he want to live for he own the next morning be a most forbid and doleful-looking morning and young traver have great hope that the meet would be declare off but just as he lay in doubt the servant knock at he door with he ride thing and he hot water he come down-stair look very miserable indeed satan have be take to the place where they be to meet and traver view he on he arrival there with a sickening sense of fear as he see he pull three groom off they foot traver decide that he would stay with he foot on solid earth just as long as he could and when the hound be throw off and the rest have start at a gallop he wait under the pretence of adjust he gaiter until they be all well away then he clench he tooth cram he hat down over he ear and scramble up on to the saddle he foot fall quite by accident into the stirrup and the next instant he be off after the other with a indistinct feeling that he be on a locomotive that be jump the tie satan be in among and have pass the other horse in less than five minute and be so close on the hound that the whippers-in give a cry of warning but traver could as soon have pull a boat back from go over the niagara fall as satan and it be only because the hound be well ahead that save they from have satan ride they down traver have take hold of the saddle with he left hand to keep himself down and saw and sway on the rein with he right he shut he eye whenever satan jump and never know how he happen to stick on but he do stick on and be so far ahead that no one could see in the misty morning just how badly he ride as it be for daring and speed he lead the field and not even young paddock be near he from the start there be a broad stream in front of he and a hill just on its other side no one have ever try to take this at a jump it be consider more of a swim than anything else and the hunter always cross it by the bridge towards the left traver see the bridge and try to jerk satan 's head in that direction but satan keep right on as straight as a express train over the prairie fence and tree and furrow pass by and under traver like a panorama run by electricity and he only breathe by accident they go on at the stream and the hill beyond as though they be ride at a stretch of turf and though the whole field set up a shout of warning and dismay traver could only gasp and shut he eye he remember the fate of the second groom and shiver then the horse rise like a rocket lifting traver so high in the air that he think satan would never come down again but he do come down with he foot bunch on the opposite side of the stream the next instant he be up and over the hill and have stop pant in the very center of the pack that be snarl and snap around the fox and then traver show that he be a thoroughbred even though he could not ride for he hastily fumble for he cigar-case and when the field come pound up over the bridge and around the hill they see he seat nonchalantly on he saddle puff critically at a cigar and give satan patronize pat on the head my dear girl say old mr paddock to he daughter as they ride back if you love that young man of yours and want to keep he make he promise to give up ride a more reckless and more brilliant horseman i have never see he take that double jump at the gate and that stream like a centaur but he will break he neck sooner or later and he ought to be stop young paddock be so delighted with he prospective brother-in-law 's great ride that that night in the smoking-room he make he a present of satan before all the man no say traver gloomily i can not take he you sister have ask I to give up what be dearer to I than anything next to herself and that be my ride you see she be absurdly anxious for my safety and she have ask I to promise never to ride again and i have give my word a chorus of sympathetic remonstrance rise from the man yes i know say traver to she brother it be rough but it just show what sacrifice a man will make for the woman he love love I love my dog young van bibber have be stay with some people at southampton li where the fall before he friend traver make he reputation as a cross-country rider he do this it may be remember by shut he eye and hold on by the horse 's mane and let the horse go as it please he recklessness and courage be still speak of with awe and the place where he clear the water jump that every one else avoid be point out as traver 's leap to visit horseman who look at it gloomily and shake they head miss arnett whose mother be give the house-party be a attractive young woman with a admiring retinue of youth who give attention without intention and for none of whom miss arnett show particular preference she whole interest indeed be centre in a dog a scotch collie call duncan she allow this dog every liberty and make a decide nuisance of he for every one around she he always go with she when she walk or trot beside she horse when she ride he stretch himself before the fire in the dining-room and startle people at table by place he cold nose against they hand or put he paw on they gown he be generally vote a most annoying adjunct to the arnett household but no one dare hint so to miss arnett as she only love those who love the dog or pretend to do it on the morning of the afternoon on which van bibber and he bag arrive the dog disappear and could not be recover van bibber find the household in a state of much excitement in consequence and he welcome be necessarily brief the arrive guest be not to be consider at all with the depart dog the man tell van bibber in confidence that the general relief among the guest be something ecstatic but this be mar later by the gloom of miss arnett and she inability to think of anything else but the finding of the lose collie thing become so feverish that for the sake of rest and peace the house-party propose to contribute to a joint purse for the return of the dog as even nuisance as it be it be not so bad as have they visit spoil by miss arnett 's abandonment to grief and crossness i think say the young woman after luncheon that some of you man might be civil enough to offer to look for he i be sure he can not have go far or if he have be steal the man who take he could not have go very far away either now which of you will volunteer i be sure you 'll do it to please I mr van bibber now : you say you be so clever we be all the time hearing of you adventure why do not you show how full of expedient you be and rise to the occasion the suggestion of scorn in this speech nettle van bibber i be sure i never pose as be clever he say and find a lose dog with all long island to pick and choose from be not a particularly easy thing to pull off successfully i should think i do not suppose you would take a dare like that van bibber say one of the man why it be just the sort of thing you do so well yes say another i 'll back you to find he if you try thanks say van bibber dryly there seem to be a disposition on the part of the young man present to turn I into a dog-catcher i doubt whether this be altogether unselfish i do not say that they would rather remain indoors and teach the girl how to play billiards but i quite appreciate they reason for not wish to roam about in the snow and whistle for a dog however to oblige the despondent mistress of this valuable member of the household i will risk pneumonia and i will at the same time in order to make the event interesting to all concern back myself to bring that dog back by eight o'clock now then if any of you unselfish youth have any sport blood you will just name the sum they name one hundred dollar and arrange that van bibber be to have the dog back by eight o'clock or just in time for dinner for van bibber say he would not miss he dinner for all the dog in the two hemisphere unless the dog happen to be he own van bibber put on he great-coat and tell the man to bring around the dog-cart then he fill he pocket with cigar and place a flask of brandy under the seat and wrap the robe around he knee i feel just like a relief expedition to the north pole i think i ought to have some lieutenant he suggest well cry one of the man suppose we make a pool and each chip in fifty dollar and the man who bring the dog back in time get the whole of it that bet of mine stand do not it ask van bibber the man say it do and go off to put on they ride thing and four horse be saddle and bring around from the stable each of the four explorer be furnish with a long rope to tie to duncan 's collar and with which he be to be lead back if they find he they be cheer ironically by the maiden they have desert on compulsion and be smile upon severally by miss arnett then they separate and take different road it be snow gently and be very cold van bibber drive aimlessly ahead look to the right and leave and scanning each back yard and side street every now and then he hail some pass farm wagon and ask the driver if he have see a stray collie dog but the answer be invariably in the negative he soon leave the village in the rear and plunge out over the downs the wind be bitter cold and sweep from the water with a chill that cut through he clothes oh this be great say van bibber to the patient horse in front of he this _ be _ sport this be the next time i come to this part of the world i 'll be drag here with a rope nice hospitable people those arnett be not they ask you to make yourself at home chase dog over a ice fjord do not know when i have enjoy myself so much every now and then he stand up and look all over the hill and valley to see if he could not distinguish a black object run over the white surface of the snow but he see nothing like a dog not even the track of one twice he come across one of the other man shiver and swearing from he saddle and with tooth chatter well say one of they shudder you have not find that dog yet i see no say van bibber oh no i have give up look for the dog i be just drive around enjoy myself the air 's so invigorating and i like to feel the snow settle between my collar and the back of my neck at four o'clock van bibber be about as nearly freeze as a man could be after he have swallow half a bottle of brandy it be so cold that the ice form on he cigar when he take it from he lip and he foot and the dashboard seem to have become stick together i think i 'll give it up he say finally as he turn the horse 's head towards southampton i hate to lose three hundred and fifty dollar as much as any man but i love my fair young life and i be not go to turn into a equestrian statue in ice for anybody 's collie dog he drive the cart to the stable and unharnessed the horse himself as all the groom be out scour the country and then go upstairs unobserved and lock himself in he room for he do not care to have the other know that he have give out so early in the chase there be a big open fire in he room and he put on he warm thing and stretch out before it in a great easy-chair and smoked and sip the brandy and chuckle with delight as he think of the four other man race around in the snow they may have more nerve than i he soliloquize and i do not say they have not but they can have all the credit and reward they want and i 'll be satisfy to stay just where i be at seven he see the four rider come back dejectedly and without the dog as they pass he room he hear one of the man ask if van bibber have get back yet and another say yes he have as he have leave the cart in the stable but that one of the servant have say that he have start out again on foot he have have he say the voice well he be get sport blood and he 'll need to keep it at fever heat if he expect to live i be freeze so that i can not bend my finger van bibber smile and move comfortably in the big chair he have doze a little and be feel very contented at half-past seven he begin to dress and at five minute to eight he be ready for dinner and stand look out of the window at the moonlight on the white lawn below the snow have stop fall and everything lay quiet and still as though it be cut in marble and then suddenly across the lawn come a black bedraggled object on four leg limp painfully and lift its foot as though there be lead on they great heaven cry van bibber it be the dog he be out of the room in a moment and down into the hall he hear the murmur of voice in the drawing-room and the sympathetic tone of the woman who be pity the man van bibber pull on he overshoe and a great-coat that cover he from he ear to he ankle and dash out into the snow the dog have just enough spirit leave to try and dodge he and with a leap to one side go off again across the lawn it be as van bibber know but three minute to eight o'clock and have the dog he must and would the collie spring first to one side and then to the other and snarled and snapped but van bibber be keen with the excitement of the chase so he plunge forward recklessly and tackle the dog around the body and they both roll over and over together then van bibber scramble to he foot and dash up the step and into the drawing-room just as the people be in line for dinner and while the minute-hand stand at a minute to eight o'clock how be this shout van bibber hold up one hand and clasp the dog under he other arm miss arnett fly at the collie and embrace it wet as it be and ruin she gown and all the man glance instinctively at the clock and say : you have win van but you must be freeze to death say miss arnett look up at he with gratitude in she eye yes yes say van bibber begin to shiver i have have a terrible long walk and i have to carry he all the way if you 'll excuse I i 'll go change my thing he reappear again in a suspiciously short time for one who have to change outright and the man admire he endurance and pay up the bet where do you find he van one of they ask oh yes they all chorus where be he that say mr van bibber be a thing know to only two being duncan and myself duncan can not tell and i will not if i do you would say i be try to make myself out clever and i never boast about the thing i do eleanore cuyler miss eleanore cuyler have dine alone with she mother that night and she be now sit in the drawing-room near the open fire with she glove and fan on the divan beside she for she be go out later to a dance she be read a somewhat weighty german review and the contrast which the smartness of she gown present to the seriousness of she occupation make she smile slightly as she pause for a moment to cut the leaf and when the bell sound in the hall she put the book away from she altogether and wonder who it might be it might be young wainwright with the proof-sheet of the new story he have promise to let she see or flower for the dance from bruce-brice of the english legation at washington who for the time be be practise diplomatic move in new york or some of she working-girl with a new perplexity for she to unravel or only one of the man from the stable to tell she how she hunter be get on after he fall it might be any of these and more the possibility be diverse and all of interest and she acknowledge this to herself with a little sigh of content that it be so for she find she pleasure in do many thing and in the fact that there be so many she rejoice daily that she be free and she own mistress in everything free to do these many thing deny to other young woman and that she have the health and position and cleverness to carry they on and through to success she do they all and equally well and gracefully whether it be the rejection of a too ambitious devotee who dare to want to have she all to himself or the planning of a woman 's luncheon or the push of a bill to provide kindergarten in the public school but it be rather a relief when the man open the curtain and say mr wainwright and wainwright walk quickly towards she tug at he glove you be very good to see I so late he say speaking as he enter but i have to see you to-night and i be not ask to that dance i be go away he go on take he place by the fire with he arm rest on the mantel he have a trick of stand there when he have something of interest to say and he be tall and well-looking enough to appear best in that position and she be use to it he be the most frequent of she visitor go away she repeat smile up at he not for long i hope where be you go now i be go to london he say they cable I this morning it seem they have take the play and be go to put it on at once he smile and blush slightly at she exclamation of pleasure yes it be rather nice it seem ` jilt ' be a failure and they have take it off and be go to put on ` school ' with the old cast until they can get my play rehearse and they want I to come over and suggest thing she stop he with another little cry of delight that be very sweet to he and full of moment oh how glad i be she say how proud you must be now why do you pretend you be not and i suppose tree and the rest of they will be in the cast and all that dreadful american colony in the stall and you will make a speech -- and i will not be there to hear it she rise suddenly with a quick graceful movement and hold out she hand to he which he take laugh and conscious-look with pleasure she sink back on the divan and shake she head doubtfully at he when will you stop she say do not tell I you mean to be a admirable crichton you be too fine for that he look down at the fire and say slowly it be not as if i be try my hand at a entirely different kind of work no i do not think i do wrong in dramatize it the papers all say when the book first come out that it would make a good play and then so many man write to I for permission to dramatize it that i think i might as well try to do it myself no i think it be in line with my other work i do not think i be stray after strange god you should not she say softly the old one have be so kind to you but you take I too seriously she add i be afraid sometimes he answer that you do not know how seriously i do take you yes i do she say quickly and when i be serious that be all very well but to-night i only want to laugh i be very happy it be such good news and after the new york manager refuse it too they will _ have _ to take it _ now _ now that it be a london success well it be not a london success yet he say dryly the book go well over there because the kind of western thing i write about meet they idea of this country -- cowboy and prairie and indian maiden and all that and so i rather hope the play will suit they for the same reason and you will go out a great deal i hope she say oh you will have to you will find so many people to like almost friend already they be talk about you even when i be there and i use to shine in reflect glory because i know you yes i can fancy it he say but i should like to see something of they if i have time lowe want I to stay with they and i suppose i will he would feel hurt if i do not he have a most absurd idea of what i do for he on the ranche when he have the fever that time and ever since he go back to enjoy he ill-gotten gain and he title and all that he have keep write to I to come out yes i suppose i will stay with they they be in town now miss cuyler 's face be still light with pleasure at he good fortune but she smile be less spontaneous than it have be that will be very nice i quite envy you she say i suppose you know about he sister the honorable evelyn he ask yes he use to have a photograph of she and i see some other the other day in a shop-window on broadway she be a very nice girl miss cuyler say thoughtfully i wonder how you two will get along and then she add as if with sudden compunction but i be sure you will like she very much she be very clever besides i do not know how a professional beauty will wear if one see she every day at breakfast he say one always associate they with function and varnish day and lawn-party you will write to I will you not he add that sound she say as though you mean to be go such a very long time he turn one of the ornament on the mantel with he finger and look at it curiously it depend he say slowly -- it depend on so many thing no he go on look at she it do not depend on many thing just on one miss cuyler look up at he questioningly and then down again very quickly and reach meaninglessly for the book beside she she see something in he face and in the rigidity of he position that make she breathe more rapidly she have not be afraid of this from he because she have always take the attitude towards he of a very dear friend and of one who be older not in year but in experience of the world for she have live abroad while he have go from the university to the west which he have make he own in book they be both very young she do not want he to say anything she could only answer he in one way and in a way that would hurt and give pain to they both she have hope he could remain just as he be a very dear friend with a suggestion sometimes in the background of he become something more she be of course too experience to believe in a long platonic friendship uppermost in she mind be the thought that no matter what he urge she must remember that she want to be free to live she own life to fill she own sphere of usefulness and she must not let he tempt she to forget this she have next to consider he and that she must be hard and keep he from speak at all and this be very difficult for she care for he very dearly she strengthen she determination by thinking of he go away and of how glad she would be when he have go that she have commit herself to nothing this absence would be a test for both of they it could not have be better have it be arrange on purpose she have idea of what she could best do for those around she and she must not be control and curb no matter how strongly she might think she wish it she must not give way to the temptation of the moment or to a pass mood and then there be other man she have they photograph on she dressing-table and like each for some quality the other do not possess in such a degree but she like they all because no one of they have the right to say must or even you might to she and she fancy that the moment she give one of they this right she would hate he cordially and would fly to the other for sympathy and she be not a young woman who think that matrimony mean freedom to fly to any one but she husband for that but this one of the man be a little the worst he make it harder for she to be quite herself she notice that when she be with he she talk more about she feeling than with the other man with whom she be satisfy to discuss the play or what girl they want to take into dinner she have touch of remorse after these confidence to wainwright and write he brisk friendly note the next morning in which the word you friend be always sure to appear either markedly at the beginning or at the end or tuck away in the middle she think by this to unravel the web she might have weave the day before but she have apparently fail she stand up suddenly from pure nervousness and cross the room as though she mean to go to the piano which be a very unfortunate move as she seldom play and never for he she sit down before it nevertheless rather hopelessly and cross she hand in front of she he have turn and follow she with he eye they be very bright and eager and she own falter as she look at they you do not show much interest in the one thing that will bring I back he say he speak reproachfully and yet a little haughtily as though he have already half suspect she have guess what he mean to say ah you can not tell how long you will be there she say lightly you will like it much more than you think i -- she stop hopelessly and glance without mean to do so at the clock-face on the mantel beside he oh he say with quick misunderstanding i beg you pardon i be keep you i forget how late it be and you be go out he come towards she as though he mean to go she stand up and make a quick impatient gesture with she hand he be make it very hard for she fancy she say you know i want to talk to you what do the dance matter why be you so unlike yourself she go on gently and it be we last night too the tone of she word seem to reassure he for he come nearer and rest he elbow beside she on the piano and say then you be sorry that i be go it be very hard to be unyielding to he when he speak and look as he do then but she repeat to herself he will be go to-morrow and then i shall be so thankful that i do not bind myself -- that i be still free he will be go and i shall be so glad it will only be a minute now before he go and if i be strong i will rejoice at leisure so she look up at he without a sign of the effort it cost she frankly and openly and say sorry of course i be sorry one do not have so many friend that one can spare they for long even to have they grow famous i think it be very selfish of you to go for you be famous enough already as he look at she and hear she word run on smoothly and meaninglessly he know that it be quite useless to speak and he grow suddenly colder and sick and furious at once with a confused anger and bitterness and then for he be quite young so young that he think it be the manly thing to do to carry he grief off lightly instead of rather be proud of he love however she might hold it -- he draw himself up and begin pull carefully at he glove yes he say slowly i fancy the change will be very pleasant he be not thinking of he word or of how thoughtless they must sound he be only anxious to get away without show how deeply he be hurt if he have not do this if he have let she see how miserable he be and that play and book and such thing be nothing to he now and that she be just all there be in the whole world to he it might have end differently but he be untried and young so he button the left glove with careful scrutiny and say they always start those boat at such absurd hour the tide never seem to suit one you have to go on board without breakfast or else stay on board the night before and that be so unpleasant well i hope you will enjoy the dance and tell they i be very much hurt that i be not ask he hold out he hand quite steadily i will write you if you will let I he go on and send you word where i be as soon as i know she take he hand and say good-by and i hope it will be a grand success : i know it will and come back soon and yes do write to I i hope you will have a very pleasant voyage he have reach the door and stop uncertainly at the curtain thank you he say and oh he add politely will you say good-by to you mother for I please she nod she head and smile and say yes i will not forget good-by she do not move until she hear the door close upon he and then she turn towards the window as though she could still follow he through the closed blind and then she walk over to the divan and pick up she fan and glove and remain look down at they in she hand the room seem very empty she glance at the place where he have stand and at the darkened window again and sink down very slowly against the cushion of the divan and press she hand against she cheek she do not hear the rustle of she mother 's dress as she come down the stair and part the curtain be you ready eleanore she say briskly tell I how do this lace look i think there be entirely too much of it \* \* \* \* \* it be a month after this simultaneously with the announcement by cable of the instant success in london of a western idyl that miss cuyler retire from the world she know and disappear into darkest new york by the way of rivington street she have discover one morning that she be not ill nor run down nor overtax but just mentally tired of all thing and that what she need be change of air and environment and unselfish work for the good of other and less thought of herself she mother 's physician suggest to she after a secret and hasty interview with mr cuyler that change of air be good but that the air of rivington street be not of the best and she friend both man and woman assure she that they appreciate she much more than the people of the east side possibly could do and that they be much more worthy of she consideration and in a fair way of improvement yet if she would only continue to shine upon and before they but she be determine in she purpose and regard the college settlement as the one opening and refuge for the energy which have too long be give to the arrangement of paper chase across country and the routine of society and dilettante interest in kindergarten life have become for she real and earnest and she reject bruce-brice of the british legation with the sad and hopeless kindness of one who almost contemplate take the veil and to whom the thing of this world outside of tenement be hollow and unprofitable she find a cruel disappointment at first for the woman of the college settlement have rule and idea of they own and have see enthusiast like herself come into rivington street before and depart again she have think she would nurse the sick and visit the prisoner on the island and bring cleanliness and hope into miserable life but she find that this be the work of woman try in the service who understand it and who make she first serve she apprenticeship by read the german bible to old woman whose eye be dim but who be as hopelessly clean and quite as self-respecting in they way as herself the heroism and the self-sacrifice of a father damien or a florence nightingale be not for she older and wiser young woman see to that work with a quiet matter-of-fact cheerfulness and a common-sense that bewilder she and they treat she kindly but indulgently as a outsider it take she some time to understand this and she do not confess to herself without a struggle that she be disappoint in she own usefulness but she bring herself to confess it to she friend uptown when she visit that delightful country from which she be self-exiled she go there occasionally for a afternoon 's rest or to a luncheon or a particularly attractive dinner but she always return to the settlement at night and this throw a additional interest about she to she friend -- a interest of which she be ashamed for she know how little she be really do and that she sacrifice be one of discomfort merely the good she do now it be humiliating to acknowledge be in no way proportionate to that which she influence have work among people of she own class and what make it very hard be that wherever she go they seem to talk of he now it would be a girl just from the other side who have meet he on the terrace of the lower house where he seem to know every one and another have drive with he to ascot where he have hold the rein and have show they what a man who have guide a mail-coach one whole winter over the mountain for a living could do with a coach for pleasure and many of the man have meet he at the club and at house party in the country and they declare with enthusiastic envy that he be no end of a success she english friend all write of he and want to know all manner of little thing concern he and hint that they understand they be very great friend the papers seem to be always have he do something and there be apparently no one else in london who could so properly respond to the toast of america at all the public dinner she have have letter from he herself -- of course bright clever one -- that suggest what a wonderfully full and happy life he be but with no reference to he return he be live with he young friend lord lowe and go everywhere with he and he people and then as a final touch which she have already anticipate people begin to speak of he and the honorable evelyn what could be more natural they say he have save she brother 's life while out west half a dozen time at least from all account and he be rich and well-looking and well-born and rapidly become famous a young married woman announce it at a girl ' luncheon she have it from she friend the marchioness of pelby who be evelyn 's first-cousin so far only the family have be tell but all london know it and it be say that lord lowe be very much pleased one of the girl at the table say you never could tell about those thing she have no doubt the marchioness of pelby be a authority but she would wait until she get they wedding-card before she believe it for some reason this girl do not look at miss cuyler and miss cuyler feel grateful to she and think she be a nice bright little thing and then another girl say it be only turn about the englishman have take all the attractive american girl and it be only fair that the english girl should get some of the nice american man this girl be a old friend of eleanore 's but she be surprise at she make such a speech and wonder why she have not notice in she before similar exhibition of bad taste she walk back to rivington street from the luncheon compose the letter she would write to he congratulating he on he engagement she compose several some of they be very short and cheery and other rather longer and full of reminiscence she wonder with sudden fierce bitterness how he could so soon forget certain walk and afternoon they have spend together and the last note which she compose in bed be a very sad and scornful one and so pathetic as a work of composition that she cry a little over it and go to sleep full of indignation that she have cry she tell herself the next morning that she have cry because she be frankly sorry to lose the companionship of so old and good a friend and because now that she have be give much more important work to do she be naturally sadden by the life she see around she and weaken by the foul air of the court and street and the dreary environment of the tenement as for he she be happy in he happiness and she picture how some day when he proudly bring he young bride to this country to show she to he friend he would ask after she and they would say : who eleanore cuyler why do not you know while you be on you honeymoon she be in the slum where she take typhoid fever nursing a child and die or else some day when she have grow into a beautiful sweet-faced old lady with white hair he wife would die and he would return to she never have be very happy with he first wife but have nobly hide from she and from the world he true feeling he would find she working among the poor and would ask she forgiveness and she could not quite determine whether she would forgive he or not these picture comfort she even while they sadden she and she go about she work feeling that it be now she life 's work and that she be in reality a old old woman the rest she be sure be but a weary wait for the end \* \* \* \* \* it be about six month after this in the early spring while miss cuyler be still in rivington street that young van bibber invite he friend traver to dine with he and go on later to the people 's theater on the bowery where irve willis the boy actor be play nick of the wood traver despatch a hasty and joyous note in reply to this to the effect that he would be on hand he then go off with a man to try a horse at a ride academy and easily and promptly forget all about it he do remember as he be dress for dinner that he have a appointment somewhere and take some consolation out of this fact for he consider it a decide step in advance when he could remember that he have a engagement even if he could not recall what it be the stern mental discipline necessary to do this latter would he hope come in time so he dine unwarily at home and be in consequence seize upon by he father who send he to the opera as a substitute for himself with he mother and sister while he go off delightedly to he club to play whist traver do not care for the opera and sit in the back of the box and doze and wonder moodily what so many nice man see in he sister to make they want to talk to they it be midnight and just as he have tumble into bed when the nature of he original engagement come back to he and he anger and disappointment be so intense that he kick the clothes over the foot of he bedstead as for van bibber he know he friend too well to wait for he and occupy a box at the people 's theater in solitary state and from its depths gurgle with delight whenever the boy actor escape be run over by a real locomotive or in turn rescue the stout heroine from six red shirted cowboy there be quite as many sudden death and lofty sentiment as he have expect and he leave the theater with the pleased satisfaction of a evening well spend and with a pity sympathy for traver who have miss it the night be pleasant and fill with the softness of early spring and van bibber turn down the bowery with a cigar between he tooth and no determine purpose except the one that he do not intend to go to bed the street be still crowd and the light show the many type of this thief ' highway with which van bibber in he many excursion in search of mild adventure have become familiar they be so familiar that the unfamiliarity of the hurry figure of a girl of he own class who pass in front of he down grand street bring he abruptly wonder to a halt she have pass directly under a electric light and she dress and walk and bearing he seem to recognize but as belong to another place what a girl well-born and well-dressed could be do at such a hour in such a neighborhood arouse he curiosity but it be rather with a feeling of _ noblesse oblige _ and a hope of be of use to one of he own people that he cross to the opposite side of the street and follow she she be evidently go somewhere that be write in every movement of she regular quick walk and she steadfast look ahead she veil hide the upper part of she face and the pass crowd shut she sometimes entirely from view but van bibber himself unnoticed succeed in keep she in sight while he speculate as to the nature of she errand and she personality at eldridge street she turn sharply to the north and without a change in she hurrying gait pass on quickly and turn again at rivington oh say van bibber with relieved curiosity one of the college settlement and stop satisfied but the street have now become desert and though he dislike the idea of follow a woman even though she might not be aware of he do so he dislike even more the idea of leave she to make she way in such a place alone and so he start on again and as there be now more likelihood of she see he in the empty street he drop farther to the rear and keep in the shadow and as he do so he see a man whom he have before notice on the opposite side of the street quicken he pace and draw nearer to the girl it seem impossible to van bibber that any man could mistake the standing of this woman and the evident purpose of she haste but the man be apparently settle he pace to match hers as if only wait a opportunity to approach she van bibber tuck he stick under he arm and move forward more quickly it be midnight and the street be utterly strange to he from the light of the lamp he could see sign in hebrew and the double eagle of russium paint on the window of the saloon long row of truck and dray stand range along the pavement for the night and on some of the stoop and fire-escape of the tenement a few dwarfish specimen of the polish jew sit squabbling in they native tongue but it be not until they have reach orchard street and when rivington street be quite empty that the man draw up uncertainly beside the girl and bend over stare up in she face and then walk on at she side survey she deliberately from head to foot for a few step the girl move on as apparently unmindful of he near presence as though he be a stray dog run at she side but when he step directly in front of she she stop and back away from he fearfully the man hesitate for a instant and then come on after she laughing van bibber have be some distance in the rear he reach the curb beside they just as the girl turn back with the man still follow she and step in between they he have come so suddenly from out of the darkness that they both start van bibber do not look at the man he turn to the girl and raise he hat slightly and recognize eleanore cuyler instantly as he do so but as she do not seem to remember he he do not call she by name but simply say with a jerk of he head be this man annoy you miss cuyler seem to wish before everything else to avoid a scene he -- he just speak to I that be all she say i live only a block below here if you will please let I go on alone i would be very much obliged certainly do go on say van bibber but i shall have to follow you until you get in-door you need not be alarm no one will speak to you then he turn to the man and say in a lower tone you wait here till i get back will you i want to talk to you the man pay no attention to he whatsoever he be so far mislead by van bibber 's appearance as to misunderstand the situation entirely oh come now he say smile knowingly at the girl you can not shake I for no dude he put out he hand as he speak as though he mean to touch she van bibber pull he stick from under he arm and toss it out of he way and strike the man twice heavily in the face he be very cool and determine about it and punish he in consequence much more effectively than if he indignation have make he excite the man give a howl of pain and stumble backwards over one of the stoop where he drop moan and swearing with he finger press against he face _ please _ now beg van bibber quickly turn to miss cuyler i be very sorry but if you have _ only _ go when i ask you to he motion impatiently with he hand will you please go but the girl to he surprise stand still and look past he over he shoulder van bibber motion again for she to pass on and then as she still hesitate turn and glance behind he the street have the blue-black look of a new york street at night there be not a light window in the block it seem to have grow suddenly more silent and dirty and desolate-looking he could see the glow of the elevated station at allen street and it seem fully a half-mile away save for the girl and the groan fool on the stoop and the three figure close in on he he be quite alone the foremost of the three man stop run and come up briskly with he finger hold interrogatively in front of he he stop when it be within a foot of van bibber 's face be you look for a fight he ask there be enough of the element of the sport in van bibber to enable he to recognize the same element in the young man before he he know that this be no whimpering blackguard who follow woman into side street to insult they this be one of the purest specimen of the tough of the east-side water-front and he and he companion would fight as readily as van bibber would smoke -- and they would not fight fair the adventure have take on a grim and serious turn and van bibber give a imperceptible shrug and a barely audible exclamation of disgust as he accept it because continue he new opponent with business-like briskness if you be look for a fight you can set right to I you need not think you can come down here and run thing -- you -- he follow this with a easy roll of oath intend to goad he victim into action a reform prize-fighter have once tell van bibber that there be six rule to observe in a street fight he say he have forget the first five but the sixth one be to strike first van bibber turn he head towards miss cuyler you have better run he say over he shoulder and then turn quickly he bring he left fist with all the strength and weight of he arm and body back of it against the end of the new-comer 's chin this be a most effective blow this be so because the lower jaw be anatomically loose and when it be strike heavily it turn and jar the brain and the man who be strike feel as though the man who strike he have open the top of he skull and take he brain in he hand and wrench they as a brakeman wrench a brake if you shut you tooth hard and rap the tip of you chin sharply with you knuckle you can get a idea of how effective this be when multiply by a arm and all the muscle of a shoulder the man throw up he arm and go over backwards grope blindly with he hand van bibber hear a sharp rap behind he frequently repeat he could not turn to see what it be for one of the remain man be engage he in front and the other be kick at he knee-cap and striking at he head from behind he be no longer cool he be grandly and viciously excited and rush past he opponent he catch he over he hip with he left arm across he breast and so toss he use he hip for a lever a man in this position can be throw so that he will either fall as lightly as a baby fall from he pillow to the bed or with sufficient force to break he rib van bibber be excite throw he the latter way see this the second man who have so far fail to find van bibber 's knee-cap back rapidly away with he hand in front of he here he cry lem ` I alone i be not in this oh yes you be cry van bibber gasping but with fierce politeness excuse I but you be put up you hand i be go to kill _ you _ he have a throbbing feeling in the back of he head and he breathing be difficult he could still hear the heavy irregular rap behind he but it have become confuse with the throbbing in he head put up you hand he pant the third man still back away place he arm in a position of defense and van bibber beat they down savagely and catch he by the throat and pound he until he arm be tired and he have to drop he at he foot as he turn dizzily he hear a sharp answering rap down the street and see come towards he the burly figure of a policeman run heavily and throw he night-stick in front of he by its leather thong so that it strike reverberate echo out of the pavement and then he see to he amazement that miss cuyler be still with he stand by the curb and beat it with he heavy walking-stick as calmly as though she be play golf and look keenly up and down the street for possible aid van bibber gaze at she with breathless admiration good heaven he pant do not i ask you _ please _ to go home the policeman pass they and dive uncertainly down a dark area-way as one depart figure disappear into the open doorway of a tenement on he way to the roof and the leg of another dodge between the line of dray where would they fellow go gasp the officer instantly reappear up the step of the basement how should i know answer van bibber and add with ill-timed lightness they do not leave any address the officer stare at he with severe suspicion and then disappear again under one of the truck i be very very much oblige to you miss cuyler van bibber say he try to raise he hat but the effort of the gentleman who have strike he from behind have be successful and the hat come off only after a wrench that make he wince you be very brave he go

malicious satisfaction they do you up any way he suggest yes they do I up assent van bibber cheerfully and if you would come a little sooner they would do you up too he step to miss cuyler 's side and they walk on down the street to the college settlement in silence the policeman follow uncertainly in the rear i have not thank you mr van bibber say miss cuyler it be really fine of you and most

to blame if the world would be wicked and its people unrepentant and ungrateful corrigan on the third floor be drunk again and promise trouble he voice ascend to the room in which she sit and make she nervous for she be feel the reaction from the excitement of the night before there be heavy footstep on the stair and a child 's shrill voice cry she be in there and suspect it might be corrigan she look up fearfully and then the door open and she see the most magnificent and the handsomest be in the world he magnificence be due to a bond street tailor who have show how very small a waist will go with very broad shoulder and if he be handsome that be the tan of a week at sea but it be not the tan nor the unusual length of he coat that eleanore saw but the eager confident look in he face -- and all she could say be oh mr wainwright feebly wainwright wave away all such trifling barrier as mister and miss he come towards she with he face stern and determine eleanore he say i have a hansom at

they be marry in may and lord lowe act as best man and he sister send she warmest congratulation and a pair of silver candlestick for the dinner-table which wainwright thought be very handsome indeed but which miss cuyler consider a little showy van bibber and traver be usher and indeed it be van bibber himself who close the door of the carriage upon they as they be start forth after the wedding mr wainwright say something to she husband and he laugh and say van mr wainwright say she be much obliged yes say van bibber pleased and eager put he head through the window of the carriage what for

there you be and all we have to do be to agree to go somewhere else i wonder say van bibber dreamily as he watch the carriage disappear down the avenue what bring a man to the propose point some other man say traver promptly some man he think have more to do for the girl than he like who persist van bibber innocently do you think be the man in that case how should i know exclaimed traver impatiently wave away such unprofitable discussion with a sweep of he stick and come down to the serious affair of life what i want to know be to what theater we be go -- that be what i want to know a recruit at christmas young lieutenant claflin leave the brooklyn navy-yard at a early hour and arrive at the recruiting-office at ten o'clock it be the day before christmas and even the bowery the thief ' highway have take on the emblem and spirit of the season and the young officer smile grimly as he see a hard-faced proprietor of a saloon direct the hanging of wreath and cross over the door of he palace and tell the assistant barkeeper to make the red holly berry show up better the cheap lodging-house have trail the green over they illuminate transom and even on mott street the chinaman have hang up string of evergreen over the door of the joss-house and the gambling-house next door and the tramp and good-for-nothing just back from the island have a animated expectant look as though something certainly be go to happen lieutenant claflin nod to corporal goddard at the door of the recruiting-office and startle that veteran 's rigidity and keep he cotton-gloved hand at he visor longer than the regulation require by say wish you merry christmas as he jump up the stair the recruiting-office be a dull blank-looking place the view from the window be not inspiring and the sight of the plump and black-eyed jewess in front of the pawn-shop across the street who be a vision of delight to corporal goddard have no attraction to the officer upstairs he put on he blue jacket with the black braid down the front light a cigar and write letter on every other than official matter and forget about recruit he be to have leave of absence on christmas and though the other have denounce he for leave the mess-table on that day they have forgive he when he explain that he be go to spend it with he people at home the other have home as far away as san francisco and as far inland as milwaukee and some call the big ship of war home but claflin 's people live up in connecticut and he could reach they in a few hour he be a very lucky man the other say and he feel very cheerful over it and forget the blank-looking office with its rule and regulation and color print of uniform and model of old war-ship and tin box of official document which be to be fill out and send to the honorable the secretary of the navy corporal goddard on the stoop below shift from one foot to the other and chafe he gloved hand softly together to keep they warm he have no time to write letter on unofficial writing-paper nor to smoke cigar or read novel with he foot on a chair with the choice of look out at the queer stream of human life move by below the window on the opposite side of the bowery he have to stand straight which come easily to he now and to answer question and urge doubtful mind to join the rank of the government 's marine a drunken man gaze at ogden 's color picture of the american infantry cavalry and marine uniform that hang before the door and place a unsteady finger on the cavalry-man 's picture and say he choose to be one of those corporal goddard tell he severely to be off and get sober and grow six inch before he think of such a thing and frown he off the stoop then two boy from the country ask about the service and go off very quickly when they find they would have to remain in it for three year at least a great many more stop in front of the gay picture and gaze admiringly at corporal goddard 's bright brass button and brilliant complexion which they innocently attribute to exposure to the sun on long weary march but no one come to offer himself in earnest at one o'clock lieutenant claflin change he coat and go down-town to luncheon and come back still more content and in feeling with the season and light another cigar but just as he have settle himself comfortably he hear corporal goddard 's step on the stair and a less determined step behind he he take he foot down from the ring of the other chair pull he undress jacket into place and take up a pen corporal goddard salute at the door and introduce with a wave of he hand the latest applicant for uncle sam 's service the applicant be as young as lieutenant claflin and as good-looking but he be dirty and unshaven and he eye be set back in the socket and he finger twitch at he side lieutenant claflin have see many applicant in this stage he call it the remorseful stage and be use to it name say lieutenant claflin as he pull a print sheet of paper towards he the applicant hesitate then he say walker -- john walker the lieutenant notice the hesitation but he merely remark to himself it be none of my business and add aloud nationality and write united state before the applicant answer the applicant say he be unmarried be twenty three year old and have be bear in new york city even corporal goddard know this last be not so but it be none of he business either he move the applicant up against the wall under the measuring-rod and bring it down on he head so he measure and weigh the applicant and test he eyesight with print letter and bit of color yarn and the lieutenant keep tally on the sheet and bit the end of he pen and watch the applicant 's face there be a great many applicant and few be choose but none of they have quite the air about he which this one have lieutenant claflin think corporal goddard be just a bit too callous in the way he handle the applicant and too peremptory in he question but he could not tell why corporal goddard treat they all in that way then the young officer notice that the applicant 's white face be flush and that he bite he lip when corporal goddard push he towards the weighing-machine as he would have move a barrel of flour you 'll answer say lieutenant claflin glance at the sheet you average be very good all you have get to do now be to sign this and then it will be over but he do not let go of the sheet in he hand as he would have do have he want it over neither do the applicant move forward to sign after you have sign this say the young officer keep he eye down on the paper before he you will have become a servant of the united state you will sit in that other room until the office be close for to-day and then you will be lead over to the navy-yard and put into a uniform and from that time on for three year you will have a number the same number as the one on you musket you and the musket will both belong to the government you will clean and load the musket and fight with it if god ever give we the chance and the government will feed you and keep you clean and fight with you if needful the lieutenant look up at the corporal and say you can go goddard and the corporal turn on he heel and walk downstairs wonder you may spend the three year continue the officer still without look at the applicant which be the best year of a young man 's life on the sea visit foreign port or you may spend it march up and down the brooklyn navy-yard and cleaning brass-work there be some man who be mean to clean brass-work and to march up and down in front of a stone arsenal and who be fit for nothing else but to every man be give something which should tell he that he be put here to make the best of himself every man have that even the man who be only fit to clean brass rod but some man kill it or try to kill it in different way generally by rum and they be as generally successful if they keep the process up long enough the government of which i be a very humble representative be always glad to get good man to serve she but it seem to I -lrb- and i may be wrong and i be quite sure that i be speak contrary to regulation -rrb- that some of she man can serve she better in other

the road where the mud show through the snow he intend to put a yellow sky behind this and a house with smoke come out of the chimney and with red light shine through the window and call it _ winter _ a horse and buggy stop just back of he and he be conscious from the shadow on the snow that the driver be look down from he perch carstair pay no attention to he spectator he be use to work with park policeman and nursery-maid look over he shoulder and make audible criticism or giggle hysterically so he sketch on and become unconscious of the shadow fall on the snow in front of he and when he look up about a quarter of a hour later and notice that the shadow be still there he smile at the tribute such mute attention pay he work when the sketch be finish he lean back and close one eye and move he head from side to side and survey it critically then he hear a voice over he shoulder say in sympathetic tone purty good be not it he turn and smile at he critic and find he to be a fat red-faced old gentleman wrap in a great fur coat with fur driving-glove and fur cap you do not mind my watch you do you ask the old gentleman carstair say no he do not mind the other say that it must be rather cold drawing in such weather and carstair say yes it be but that you could not get winter and snow in June exactly say the driver you have get to take it as it come how be you go back carstair say he

about trot by he comment on the mare in front of he this seem to please the old gentleman and he beam on carstair approvingly he ask he a great many question about he work and tell he that he own several good picture himself but admit that it be at he wife 's and daughter 's suggestion that he have purchase they they make I get 'em when we be in paris he say and they cost a lot of money and a heap more before i get 'em through the custom-house he mention the name of the artist who have paint they and ask carstair if he have ever hear of they and carstair say yes that he know of they all and have study under some of they they be purty high up i guess suggest the driver tentatively oh yes carstair answer lend himself to the other 's point of view you need not be afraid of ever lose on you investment those picture will be worth more every year this seem to strike the older man as a very sensible way to take he gallery and he say when they have reach the studio that he would like to see more of mr carstair and to look at he picture he name he say be cole carstair smilingly ask he if he be any relation to the railroad king of whom the papers speak as king cole and be somewhat embarrassed when the old gentleman reply gravely that he be that king cole himself carstair have a humorous desire to imprison he in he studio and keep he for ransom some one hold the horse and the two man go up to the sixth floor and into carstair 's studio where they discover pretty mrs carstair in the act of sew a new collar-band on one of she husband 's old shirt she go on at this while the railroad king who seem a very simple kindly old gentleman wander around the studio and turn over the picture but make no comment it have be a very cold drive and carstair feel chill so he take the hot water he wife have for she tea and some scotch whiskey and a bit of lemon and fill a glass with it for he guest and for himself mr carstair rise and put some sugar in king cole 's glass and stir it for he and taste it out of the spoon and cough which make the old gentleman laugh then he light a cigar and sit back in a big arm-chair and ask many question until before they know it the young people have tell he a great deal about themselves -- almost everything except that they be poor he could never guess that they think because the studio be so handsomely furnish and in such a proper neighborhood it be late in the afternoon and quite dark when they guest depart without have make any comment on the painting he have see and certainly without express any desire to purchase one mr carstair say when she husband tell she who they guest have be that they ought to have hold a pistol to he head and make he make out a few check for they while they have he about billionaire do not drop in like that every day say she i really do not think we appreciate we opportunity they be very much surprise a few day later when the railroad king ring at the door and beg to be allow to come in and get warm and to have another glass of hot scotch he do this very often and they get to like he very much he say he do not care for he club and he room at home be too strongly suggestive of the shop on account of the big thing he have think over there but that they studio be so bright and warm and they remind he he say of the day when he be first marry before he be rich they try to imagine what he be like when he be first married and fail utterly mrs carstair be quite sure he be not at all like she husband \* \* \* \* \* there be a youth who come to call on the miss cole who have a great deal of money and who be a dilettante in art he have have a studio in paris where he have spend the last two year and he want one so he say at dinner one day in new york old mr cole be seat but one place away from he and be wonder when the course would stop and he could get upstairs he do not care for the dinner he wife give but she always make he come to they he never could remember whether

get rid of he picture and he and he wife be go back to vermont to live i feel rather sorry for the chap for he be really very clever and only need a start it be almost impossible for a young artist to get on here i imagine unless he know people or unless some one who be know buy he work yes say miss cole politely do not you say you meet the whelen girl before you leave paris be they really such a success at homburg mr cole do not eat any more dinner but sit thoughtfully until he be allow to go then he go out into the hall and put on he overcoat and hat the carstairse be dismantle the studio they have be at it all day and they be very tired it seem so much harder work to take the thing down and pack they away than it do to unpack they and put they up in appropriate corner and where they would show to the best advantage the studio look very bare indeed for the rug and altar cloth and old curtain have be strip from the wall and the picture and arm and plaque lay scatter all over the floor it be only a week before christmas and it seem a most inappropriate time to evict one 's self and it be hardest say carstair as he roll up a great daghestan rug and sit on it to go back and own up that you be a failure a what cry young mr carstair indignantly be not you ashamed of yourself you be not a failure it be the new yorker who do not know what be good when it be show they they 'll buy all those nasty french picture because they be expensive and showy and they can not understand what be true and good they be not educate up to it and they will not be for fifty year yet fifty year be a long time to wait say she husband resignedly but if necessary we can give they that much time and we be to have go abroad and take dinner at bignon 's and have a studio in montmartre well you need not talk about that just now say mr carstair as she shake out a old shawl it be not cheerful there come a knock at the door and the railroad king walk in cover with snow goodness I exclaim king cole what be you do they tell he they be go back to vermont to spend christmas and the rest of the winter you might have let I know you be go say the king i have something most important to say to you and you almost give I the slip he seat himself very comfortably and light a fat black cigar which he chew as he smoke you know he say that i be bring up in connecticut i own the old homestead there still and a tenant of mine life in it i have get a place in london or i mean my wife have and one in scotland and one in brittany a château and one in -- well i have a good many here and there i keep 'em close till i want 'em i have never be to the shooting-place in scotland -- my son go there -- nor to the london house but i have to the french place and i like it next best to only one other place on earth because it be among big tree and on a cliff where you can see the ship all day and the girl in color petticoat catch those little fish you eat with brown bread i go there in the summer and sit on the cliff and smoke and feel just as good as though i own the whole coast and all the sea in sight i buy a number of picture of brittany and the girl have the place photograph by a fellow from pari with the trap in the front yard and themselves and they friend on the front terrace in group but it never seem to I to be just what i remember of the place and so what i want to ask be if you 'll go up to my old place in connecticut and paint I a picture of it as i use to know it when i be a boy so that i can have it by I in my room a picture with the cow-path lead up from the pool at the foot of the hill and the stone wall and the corn pile on the field and the pumpkin lie around and the sun setting behind the house paint it on one of these cold snappy afternoon when you blood tingle and you feel good that you be alive and when you get through with that i would like you to paint I a picture to match it of the château and as many little sketch of the fisherman and the girl with the big white hat and bare leg and red petticoat as you choose you can live in the homestead till that picture 's do and then you can cross over and live in the château i do not see that there be anything wrong in paint a picture to order be there you paint a portrait to order why should not you paint a old house or a beautiful castle on a cliff with the sea beyond it if you wish i 'll close with you now and call it a bargain mr carstair have be stand all this time with a unframed picture in one hand and a dust brush in the other and she husband have be sit on the rolled-up turkish rug and try not to look at she i would like to do it very well he say simply well that be good reply the railroad king heartily you 'll need a retain fee i suppose like lawyer do and you put you best work on the two picture and remember what they mean to _ I _ and put the spirit of home into they it be my home you be paint do you understand i think you do that be why i ask you instead of ask any of the other now you know how i feel about it and you put the feeling into the picture and as to the price you ask whatever you please and you live at my house and at my expense until the work be do if i do not see you again he say as he lay a check down on the table among the brush and paint tube and cigar i will wish you a merry christmas then he hurry out and bang the door behind he and escape they thanks and leave they alone together the picture of breton life and landscape be exhibit a year later in pari and in the winter in new york and as they bear the significant numeral of the salon on the frame they be immediately appreciate and many people ask the price but the attendant say they be already sell to mr cole the railroad king who have purchase also the great artistic success of the exhibition -- a old farm-house with a wintry landscape and the word home print beneath it andy m ` gee 's chorus girl andy m ` gee be a fireman and be detail every evening to theater duty at the grand opera house where the ada howard burlesque and comic opera company be play pocahonta he have nothing to do but to stand in the first entrance and watch the border light and see that the stand light in the wing do not set fire to the canvas he be a quiet shy young man very strong-looking and with a handsome boyish face miss agne carroll be the third girl from the right in the first semi-circle of amazon and very beautiful by rights she should have be on the end but she be so proud and haughty that she would smile but seldom and never at the man in front brady the stage manager who be also the second comedian say that a girl on the end should at least look as though she be enjoy herself and though he do not expect she to talk across the footlights she might at least look over they once in a while just to show there be no ill feeling miss carroll do not agree with he in this and so she be relegate to the third place and another girl who be more interested in the audience and less in the play take she position when miss carroll be not on the stage she use to sit on the carpeted step of the throne which be not in use after the opening scene and read novel by the duchess or knit on a pair of blue woollen wristlet which she keep wrap up in a towel and give to the wardrobe woman to hold when she go on one night there be a quicker call than usual owing to ada howard 's fail to get she usual encore for she waltz song and brady hurry they the wardrobe woman be not in sight so agne hand she novel and she knitting to m ` gee and say : will you hold these for I until i come off she look at he for the first time as she hand he the thing and he feel as he have feel several time before that she beauty be of a distinctly disturbing quality there be something so shy about she face when she be not on the stage and something so kindly that he stand hold the piece of blue wool still warm from she hand without move from the position he have hold when she give they to he when she come off he give they back to she and touch the visor of he cap as she thank he one of the other beautiful amazon laugh and whisper agne have a mash on the fire laddie which make the retire mr m ` gee turn very red he do not dare to look and see what effect it have on miss carroll but the next evening he take off he hat to she and she say good-evening quite boldly after that he watch she a great deal he think he do it in such a way that she do not see he but that be only because he be a man for the other woman notice it at once and make humorous comment on it when they be in the dressing-room old man sander who have be in the chorus of different comic-opera company since he be twenty year old and who be something of a pessimist use to take great pleasure in abuse the other member of the company to andy m ` gee and in tell anecdote concern they which be extremely detrimental to they character he could not find anything good to say of any of they and m ` gee begin to believe that the stage be a very terrible place indeed he be more sorry for this and he could not at first understand why until he discover that he be very much interested in miss agne carroll and she character be to he a thing of great and poignant importance he often wish to ask old sander about she but he be afraid to do so partly because he think he ought to take it for grant that she be a good girl and partly because he be afraid sander would tell he she be not but one night as she pass they as proud and haughty look as ever old sander grunt scornfully and m ` gee feel that he be grow very red now there be a girl say the old man who ought to be out of this business she be too good for it and she 'll never get on in it not that she could not keep straight and get on but because she be too little interested in it and show no heart in the little she have to do she can sing a little bit but she can not do the step then why do she stay in it say andy m ` gee well they tell I she be get a brother to support he be too young or too lazy to work or a cripple or something she try give singing lesson but she could not get any pupil and now she support herself and she brother with this andy m ` gee feel a great load lift off he mind he become more and more interested in miss agne carroll and he begin to think up little speech to make to she which be intend to show how great he respect for she be and what a agreeable young person he might be if you only grow to know he but she never grow to know he she always answer he very quietly and very kindly but never with any show of friendliness or with any approach to it and he feel that he would never know she any better than he do on the first night she speak to he but three or four time he find she watch he and he take heart at this and from something he believe he see in she manner and in the very reticence she show he count up how much of he pay he have save and conclude that with it and with what he receive monthly he could very well afford to marry when he decide on this he become more devoted to she and even the girl stop laugh about it now they see it be grow very serious indeed one afternoon there be a great fire and he and three other fall from the roof and be burn a bit and the boy ambulance surgeon lose he head and say they be seriously injured which fact get into the afternoon papers and when andy turn up as usual at the opera house there be great surprise and much rejoicing and the next day one of the wounded fireman who have have to remain in the hospital overnight tell andy that a most beautiful lady have come there and ask to see he and have then say : this be not the man the papers say mr m ` gee be hurt she have refuse to tell she name but have go away greatly relieved andy dare to think that this have be agne carroll and that night he try to see she to speak to she but she avoid he and go at once to she dressing-room whenever she be off the stage but andy be determine to speak to she and wait for she at the stage door instead of go back at once to the engine house to make out he report which be entirely wrong and which cost he a day 's pay it be Tuesday night and salary have just be give all around and the man and girl leave the stage door with the envelope in they hand and discuss the different restaurant at which they would fitly celebrate the weekly walk of the ghost agne come out among the last veil and move quickly through the crowd of half-grown boy and man about town and poor relation who lay in wait and hover around the lamp over the stage door like moth about a candle andy step forward quickly to follow she but before he could reach she side a man step up to she and she stop and speak to he in a low tone and retreat as she speak andy hear he with a sharp jealous doubt in he heart and stand still then the man reach for the envelope in the girl 's hand and say give it to I do you hear and she draw back and start to run but he seize she arm then andy jump at he and knock he down and pick he up again by the collar and beat he over the head stop the girl cry stop stop like -- say andy stop do you hear cry the woman again he have a right to the money he be my husband andy ask to be take off theater duty and the captain do what he ask after that he grow very morose and unhappy and be as cross and disagreeable as he could be so that the other man say they would like to thrash he just once but when there be a fire he act like another man and be so reckless that the captain mistaking foolhardiness for bravery hand in he name for promotion and as he political backing be very strong he be give the white helmet and become foreman of another engine-house but he do not seem to enjoy life any the more and he be most unpopular the winter pass away and the summer come and one day on fifth avenue andy meet old man sander whom he try to avoid because the recollection he bring up be bitter one but sander buttonhole he and tell he he have be read about he get the bennett medal and insist on he take a drink with he and by the way say sander just as andy think he have finally succeed in shake he off do you remember agne carroll it seem she be marry to a drunken good-for-nothing lout who beat she well he take a glass too much one night and walk off a ferry-boat into the east river drink be a terrible thing be not it they say the paddle-wheel knock the -- and he wife gasp andy she be with we yet say sander we be at the bijou this week come in and see the piece brady the stage manager wave a letter at the acting manager letter from carroll he say send in she notice go to leave the stage she say go to get marry again she be a good girl he add with a sigh and she sing well enough but she could not do the dance step a little bit a leander of the east river hefty burke be one of the best swimmer in the east river there be no regular way open for he to prove this as the gentleman of the harlem boat-club under whose auspices the annual race be give call he a professional and would not swim against he they will not keep company with I on land hefty complain bitterly and they can not keep company with I in the water so i lose both way young burke hold these gentleman of the rowing club in great contempt and they outrigger and low-necked and picturesque rowing clothes as well they be fond of lie out of the current with the oar pull across at they back for support smoking and comment audibly upon the other oarsman who pass they by perspire uncomfortably and conscious that they be be criticise hefty say that these amateur oarsman and swimmer be only pretty boy and that he could give they two hundred yard start in a mile of rough or smooth water and pass they as easily as a tug pass a lighter he be quite right in this latter boast but as they would call he a professional and would not swim against he there be no way for he to prove it he idea of a race and they idea of a race differ they have a committee to select prize and open a book for entry and when the day of the race come they have a judge ' boat with gay bunt all over it and a badly frightened referee and a host of reporter and police boat to keep order but when hefty swim he two backer who have challenge some other young man through a sport paper row in a boat behind he and yell and swear direction advice warning and encouragement at he and in they excitement drink all of the whiskey that have be intend for he and the other young man 's backer who have put up ten dollar on he and a tugboat fill with other rough young man keg of beer and three italian with two fiddle and one harp follow close in the wake of the swimmer it be most exciting and though hefty never have any prize to show for it he always come in first and so win a great deal of local reputation he also gain renown as a life-saver for if it have not be for he many a venturesome lad would have end he young life in the water of the east river for this he receive ornate and very thin gold medal with very little gold spread over a large extent of medal from grateful parent and admire friend these be real medal and give to he and not pay for by himself as be rag raegan 's who always buy himself a medal whenever he assault a reputable citizen and the case be up before the court of general session it be the habit of mr raegan 's friend to fall overboard for he whenever he be in difficulty of this sort and allow themselves to be save and to present raegan with the medal he have prepare and this act of heroism would get into the papers and raegan 's lawyer would make the most of it before the judge rag have be hefty 's foremost rival among the swimmer of the east side but since the retirement of the former into reputable and private life hefty be the acknowledged champion of the river front hefty be not at all a bad young man -- that be he do not expect he people to support he -- and he work occasionally especially about election time and what he make in bet and in back himself to swim supply he with small change then he fall in love with miss casey and the trouble and happiness of he life come to he hand and hand together and as this human feeling do away with class distinction i need not feel i must apologize for he any longer but just tell he story he meet she at the hon pc mcgovern 's fourth ward association 's excursion and picnic at which he be one of the twenty-five vice-president on this occasion hefty have jump overboard after one of the rag gang whom the member of the half-hose social club have in a spirit of merriment drop over the side of the boat this action and the subsequent rescue and ensue intoxication of the half-drowned member of the rag gang have fill miss casey 's heart with admiration and she tell hefty he be a good one and ought to be proud of himself on the follow Sunday he walk out avenue a to tompkin square with mary and he also spend a great deal of time every day on she stoop when he be not work for he be work now and make ten dollar a week as a assistant to a ice-driver they have promise to give he fifteen dollar a week and a seat on the box if he prove steady he have even dream of wedding mary in the spring but casey be a particularly objectionable man for a father-in-law and he objection to hefty be equally strong he honestly think the young man no fit match for he daughter and would only promise to allow he to keep company with mary on the condition of he live steadily so it become hefty 's duty to behave himself he find this a little hard to do at first but he confess that it grow easier as he see more of miss casey he attribute he reform to she entirely she have make the semi-political semi-social organization to which he belong appear stupid and especially so when he lose he money play poker in the club-room -lrb- for the club have only one room -rrb- when he might have put it away for she he like to talk with she about the neighbor in the tenement and he chance of political advancement to the position of a watchman at the custom-house wharf and hear she play mary and john on the melodeon he boast that she could make it sound as well as it do on the barrel-organ he be very polite to she father and very much afraid of he for he be a most particular old man from the north of ireland and object to hefty because he be a good catholic and fond of street fight he also ask pertinently how hefty expect to support a wife by swim from one pier to another on the chance of win ten dollar and point out that even this precarious means of livelihood would be shut off when the winter come he much prefer patsy moffat as a prospective son-in-law because moffat be one of the proprietor in a local express company with a capital stock of three wagon and two horse miss casey herself so it seem to hefty be rather fond of moffat but he could not tell for whom she really care for she be very shy and would as soon have think of speak a word of encouragement as of speak with unkindness there be to be a ball at the palace garden on Wednesday night and hefty have promise to call for mary at nine o'clock she tell he to be on time and threaten to go with she old love patsy moffat if he be late on Monday night the foreman at the livery stable of the ice company appoint hefty a driver and as he wages would now be fifteen dollar a week he conclude to ask mary to marry he on Wednesday night at the dance he be very much elated and very happy he fellow-workmen hear of he promotion and insist on he standing treat which he do several time until the other become flippant in they remark and careless in they conduct in this innocent but somewhat noisy state they start home and on the way be injudicious enough to say ah there to a policeman as he issue from the side door of a saloon the policeman naturally pound the nearest of they on the head with he club and as hefty happen to be that one and as he object he be arrest he give a false name and next morning plead not guilty to the charge of assault a officer and cause a crowd to collect he sentence be thirty day in default of three hundred dollar and by two o'clock he be on the boat to the island and by three he have discard the blue shirt and red suspenders of a iceman for the gray stiff cloth of a prisoner he take the whole trouble terribly to heart he know that if old man casey as he call he hear of it there would be no win he daughter with he consent and he fear that the girl herself would have grave doubt concern he he be especially cast down when he think of the dance on Wednesday night and of how she would go off with patsy moffat and what make it worse be the thought that if he do not return he would lose he position at the ice company 's stable and then marriage with mary would be quite impossible he grieve over this all day and speculate as to what he family would think of he he circle of friend be so well know to other mutual friend that he do not dare to ask any of they to bail he out for this would have certainly come to casey 's ear he could do nothing but wait and yet thirty day be a significant number to he friend and a absence of that duration would be hard to explain on Wednesday morning two day after he arrest he be put to work with a gang of twenty man break stone on the roadway that lead from the insane quarter to the penitentiary it be a warm sunny day and the city lie just across the narrow channel never look more beautiful it seem near enough for he to reach out he hand and touch it and the private yacht and big excursion-boat that pass bang out popular air and alive with bunt make hefty feel very bitter he determine that when he get back he would go look up the policeman who have assault he and break he head with a brick in a stock this plan cheer he somewhat until he think again of mary casey at the dance that night with patsy moffat and this excited he so that he determine madly to break away and escape he first impulse be to drop he crowbar and jump into the river on the instant but he cooler judgment decide he to wait at the northern end of the island the grass run high and there be no house of any sort upon it it reach out into a rocky point where it touch the still terribly swift eddy of hell gate and its sharp front divide the water and direct it towards astorium on the east and the city on the west hefty determine to walk off from the gang of workman until he could drop into this grass and to lie there until night this would be easy as there be only one man to watch they for they be all there for only ten day or one month and the idea that they should try to escape be hardly consider so hefty edge off farther from the gang and then while the guard be busy light he pipe drop into the long grass and lay there quietly after first rid himself of he shoe and jacket at six o'clock a bell toll and the guard march away with he gang shamble after he hefty guess they would not miss he until they come to count head at supper-time but even now it be already dark and light be show on the opposite bank he have select the place he mean to swim for -- a green bank below a row of new tenement a place where a few bush still stand and where the boy of harlem hide they clothes when they go in swim \* \* \* \* \* at half-past seven it be quite dark so dark in fact that the three lantern which come toss towards he tell hefty that he absence have be discover he rise quickly and step cautiously instead of diving into the river for he be fearful of hidden rock the current be much stronger than he have imagine and he hesitate for a moment with the water pull at he knee but only for a moment for the man be hunting for he in the grass he draw the gray cotton shirt from he shoulder and throw it back of he with a exclamation of disgust and of relief at be a free man again and strike he broad bare chest and the biceps of he arm with a little gasp of pleasure in they perfect strength and then bent forward and slide into the river the current from the opening at hell gate catch he up as though he have be a plank it toss he and twist he and suck he down he beat he way for a second to the surface and gasp for breath and be draw down again striking savagely at the eddy which seem to twist he limb into useless heavy mass of flesh and muscle then he dive down and down seek a possibly less rapid current at the muddy bottom of the river but the current draw he up again until he reach the top just in time so it seem to he to breathe the pure air before he lung split with the awful pressure he be gloriously and fiercely excite by the unexpected strength of he opponent and the probably fatal outcome of he adventure he stop struggle that he might gain fresh strength and let the current bear he where it would until he see that it be carry he swiftly to the shore and to the rock of the island and then he dive again and beat he way along the bottom clutch with he hand at the soft thick mud and rise only to gasp for breath and sink again he eye be smart hotly and he head and breast ache with pressure that seem to come from the inside and threaten to burst its way out he arm have grow like lead and have lose they strength and he leg be sweep and twist away from he control and be numb and useless he assure himself fiercely that he could not have be in the water for more than five minute at the longest and remind himself that he have often before live in it for hour and that this power which be so much greater than he own could not outlast he but there be no sign of abatement in the swift cruel uncertainty of its movement and it bear he on and down or up as it please the light on the shore become indistinct and he finally confuse the two shore and give up hope of reach the new york side except by accident and hope only to reach some solid land alive he do not go over all of he past life but the vision of mary casey do come to he and how she would not know that he have be innocent it be a little thing to distress himself about at such a time but it hurt he keenly and then the light grow blur and he feel that he be make heavy mechanical stroke that barely keep he lip above the water-line he feel the current slacken perceptibly but he be too much exhaust to take advantage of it and drift forward with it splash feebly like a dog and hold he head back with a desperate effort a huge black shadow only a shade blacker than the water around he loom up suddenly on he right and he see a man 's face appear in the light of a hatchway and disappear again help he cry help but he voice sound far away and barely audible he strike out desperately against the current and turn on he back and try to keep himself afloat where he be help he call again feebly grudging the strength it take to call even that help quick for god 's sake help I something heavy black and wet strike he sharply in the face and fall with a splash on the water beside he he clutch for it quickly and clasp it with both hand and feel it grow taut and then give up thinking and they pull he on board when he come to himself the captain of the canal-boat stooped and take a fold of the gray trousers between he thumb and finger then he raise he head and glance across at the big black island where light be still move about on the shore and whistle softly but hefty look at he so beseechingly that he arise and come back with a pair of old boot and a suit of blue jeans will you send these back to I to-morrow he ask sure say hefty and what 'll i do with these say the captain hold up the gray trousers anything you want except to wear 'em say mr burke feebly with a grin \* \* \* \* \* one hour later miss casey be stand up with mr patsy moffat for the grand march of the grand ball of the jolly fellow ' pleasure club of the fourteenth ward hold at the palace garden the band be just start the boulanger march and mr moffat be say wittily that it be warm enough to eat ice when mr hefty burke shoulder in between he and miss casey he be dress in he best suit of clothes and he hair be conspicuously damp excuse I patsy say mr burke as he take miss casey 's arm in he but this march be promise to I i be sorry i be late and i be sorry to disappoint you but you be like the lad that drive the hansom cab see -- you be not in it but indeed say miss casey later you should not have keep I a-waiting it be not civil i know assented hefty gloomily but i come as soon as i could i even go widout I supper so be to get here a ' they wuz expectin ' I to stay to supper too how hefty burke get even hefty burke be once club by a policeman name mccluire who excuse the club to he honor by swearing that hefty have be drunk and disorderly which be not true hefty get away from the island by swim the east river and swear to get even with the policeman this story tell how he get even mr carstair be a artist who have make he first great success by painting figure and landscape in brittany he have a studio at fifty-eighth street and sixth avenue and be engage on a historical subject in which there be three figure one be a knight in full armor and the other be a moor and the third be the figure of a woman the suit of armor have be purchase by mr carstair in pari and be believe to have be worn by a brave nobleman one of whose extravagant descendant have sell everything belong to he family in order to get money with which to play baccarat carstair be at the sale and pay a large price for the suit of armor which the marquis de neuville have worn and set it up in a corner of he studio it be in eight or a dozen piece and quite heavy but be wonderfully carve and inlay with silver and there be dent on it that show where a saracen 's scimetar have be dull and many a brave knight 's spear have strike mr carstair have pay so much for it that he think he ought to make a better use of it if possible than simply to keep it dust and show it off to he friend so he begin this historical picture and engage hefty burke to pose as the knight and wear the armor hefty 's feature be not exactly the sort of feature you would imagine a marquis de neuville would have but as he visor be down in the picture it do not make much material difference and as he figure be superb he answer very well hefty drive a ice-wagon during business hour and as a personal favor to mr carstair agree to pose for he for a consideration two afternoon of each week and to sleep in the studio at night for it be fill with valuable thing the armor be a never-ending source of amazement and bewilderment to hefty he could not understand why a man would wear such a suit and especially when he go out to fight it be the last thing in the world he would individually have select in which to make war ef i be goin ' to scrap wid anybody he say to mr carstair i would as lief tie meself up wid dumb-bell as take to carry all this stuff on I a man wid a baseball bat and swimmin ' tights on could dance all around youse and knock spot out of one of these thing the other lad would not be in it why before he could lift he leg or get he hand up you cud hit he on he helmet and he would not know what kill he they must hev sit down to fight in they day mr carstair paint on in silence and smile grimly i would like to have see a go with the party fix out in a pair of these thing continue hefty i would bet on the lad that get in the first whack he would not have to do nothing but shove the other one over on he back and fall on he why i guess this weigh half a ton if it weigh a ounce for all he contempt hefty have a secret admiration for the ancient marquis who have worn this suit and have be strong enough to carry its weight and demolish he enemy besides the mark on the armor interested he greatly and he be very much impressed one day when he find what he declare to be blood-stain on the lining of the helmet i guess the old feller that wear this be a sport eh he say proudly shake the piece on he arm until they rattle i guess he do 'em up pretty well for all these handicap i 'll bet when he get to fall around on 'em and but 'em with this fire helmet he make 'em purty tired do not youse think so young carstair say he do not doubt it for a moment the small hour social club be to give a prize masquerade ball at the palace garden on new year 's night and hefty have decide to go every gentleman dancer be to get a white silk badge with a gold tassel and every committeeman receive a blue badge with committee write across it in brass letter it cost three dollar to be a committeeman but only one dollar for self and lady there be three prize one of a silver water-pitcher for the handsomest-costumed lady dancer a accordion for the best-dressed gent and a cake for the most original idea in costume whether worn by gent or lady hefty as well as many other make up he mind to get the accordion if it cost he as much as seven dollar which be half of he week 's wages it be not the prize he want so much but he think of the impression it would make on miss casey whose father be the well-known janitor of that name they have be engage for some time but the engagement hang fire and hefty thought that a become and appropriate costume might hasten matter a little he be undecided as to whether he should go as a indian or as a courtier of the time of charle ii auchmuty stein of the bowery who supply costume and wig at reasonable rate be of the opinion that a neat sailor suit of light blue silk and decorate with white anchor be about the brettiest thing in the shop and sheap at fife dollar but hefty say he never see a sailor in silk yet and he do not think they ever wear it he could not see how they could keep the tar and salt-water from ruin it the charle ii court suit be very handsome and consist of red cotton tights blue velveteen doublet and a blue cloak line with pale pink silk a yellow wig go with this and a jewelled sword which would not come out of the scabbard it could be have for seven dollar a night hefty be still in doubt about it and be much perplexed auchmuty stein tell he charlie macklin the third avenue ticket-chopper be after the same suit and that he have better take it while he could get it but hefty say he would think about it the next day be he day for pose and as he stand array in the marquis de neuville 's suit of mail he chance to see himself in one of the long mirror and be for the first time so strike with the ferocity of he appearance that he determine to see if old man stein have not a suit of imitation armor which would not be so heavy and would look as well but the more hefty thought of it the more he believe that only the real suit would do its association its blood-stain and the real silver tracing haunt he and he half decide to ask mr carstair to lend it to he but then he remember overhear carstair tell a brother-artist that he have pay two thousand franc for it and though he do not know how much a franc might be two thousand of anything be too much to wear around at a masquerade ball but the thing haunt he he be sure if miss casey see he in that suit she would never look at charlie macklin again they would not be in the same town with I say hefty and i would get two of the prize sure he be in great perplexity when good luck or bad luck settle it for he burke say mr carstair mr carstair and i be go out of town for new year 's day and will be go until Sunday take a turn through the room each night will you as well as the studio and see that everything be all right that clinch the matter for hefty he determine to go as far as the palace garden as the marquis de neuville and say nothing whatever to mr carstair about it stuff mcgovern who drive a night-hawk and who be a particular admirer of hefty 's even though as a cabman he be in a higher social scale than the driver of a ice-cart agreed to carry hefty and he half-ton of armor to the garden and call for he when the ball be over holee smoke gasp mr mcgovern as hefty stumble heavily across the pavement with a overcoat over he armor and he helmet under he arm do you expect to do much dancing in that sheet-iron it be the look of the thing i be gamble on say hefty i look like a locomoteeve when i get this stovepipe on I head hefty put on he helmet in the cab and pull down the visor and when he alight the crowd around the door be too greatly awed to jeer but stand silent with breathless admiration he have great difficulty in mount the somewhat steep flight of stair which lead to the dancing-room and consider gloomily that in the event of a fire he would have a very small chance of get out alive he make so much noise come up that the committeeman think some one be roll some one else down the stair and come out to see the fight they observe hefty 's approach with whisper awe and amazement wot be you ask the man at the door youse need not give you real name he explain politely but you have get to give something if youse be try for a prize see i be the black knight say hefty in a hoarse voice the marquis de newveal and when it come to scrappin ' wid der perlice i be de best in der business this last statement be entirely impromptu and inspire by the presence of policeman mccluire who with several other have be detail to keep order mccluire take this challenge calmly and look down and smile at hefty 's foot he look like a stove on two leg he say to the crowd the crowd as a matter of policy laugh you 'll look like a fool standing on he head in a snow-bank if you talk impudent to I say hefty epigrammatically from behind the barrier of he iron mask what might have happen next do not happen because at that moment the music sound for the grand march and hefty and the policeman be sweep apart by the crowd of indian mexican courtier negro minstrel and clown hefty stamp across the wax floor about as lightly as a safe could do it if a safe could walk he find miss casey after the march and disclose he identity she promise not to tell and be plainly delighted and flattered at be see with the distinct sensation of the ball say hefty she say they just be not in it with you you 'll take the two prize sure how do i look out o ' sight say hefty never see you lookin ' better that be good say miss casey simply and with a sigh of satisfaction hefty be undoubtedly a great success the man come around he and paw he and feel the dent in the armor and try the weight of it by hold up one of he arm and handle he generally as though he be a freak in a museum let 'em alone say hefty to miss casey i be not sayin ' a word let the judge get on to the sensation i be a-makin ' and i 'll walk off with the prize the crowd be wid I sure at midnight the judge pound on a table for order and announce that after much debate they give the first prize to miss lizzie cannon of hester street for have the most handsomest costume on the floor that of columbium the fact that mr buck master who be one of the judge and who be engage to miss cannon have say that he would pound thing out of the other judge if they give the prize elsewhere be not know but the decision meet with as general satisfaction as could well be expect the second prize say the judge go to the gent call himself the black knight -- he in the iron leggings -- and the other prize for the most original costume go to he too half the crowd cheer at this and only one man hiss hefty fill with joy and with the anticipation of the elegance the ice-pitcher would lend to he flat when he marry miss casey and how conveniently he could fill it turn on this gentleman and tell he that only goose hiss the gentleman who have spend much time on he costume and who have be assure by each judge on each occasion that evening when he have treat he to beer that he would get the prize tell hefty to go lie down it have never be explain just what horrible insult lie back of this advice but it be a very dangerous thing to tell a gentleman to do hefty lift one foot heavily and bear down on the disappointed masker like a ironclad in a heavy sea but before he could reach he policeman mccluire mindful of the insult put upon he by this stranger spring between they and say : here now no scrap here get out of this and shove hefty back with he hand hefty utter a mighty howl of wrath and long-cherished anger and lurch forward but before he could reach he old-time enemy three policeman have he around the arm and by the leg and he be as effectually stop as though he have be chained to the floor let go o ' I say hefty wildly you be smotherin ' I give I a fair chance at he but they would not give he any sort of a chance they rush he down the steep stair and while mccluire run ahead two more push back the crowd that have surge uncertainly forward to the rescue if hefty have declare he identity the police would have have a very sad time of it but that he must not get mr carstair 's two-thousand-franc suit into trouble be all that fill hefty 's mind and all that he want be to escape three policeman walk with he down the street they say they know where he live and that they be only go to take he home they say this because they be afraid the crowd would interfere if it imagine hefty be be lead to the precinct station-house but hefty know where he be go as soon as he turn the next corner and be start off in the direction of the station-house there be still quite a small crowd at he heel and stuff mcgovern be drive along at the side anxious to help but fearful to do anything as hefty have tell he not to let any one know who he fare have be and that he incognito must be preserve the blood rush to hefty 's head like hot liquor to be arrest for nothing and by that thing mccluire and to have the noble coat-of-mail of the marquis de neuville lock up in a dirty cell and probably ruin and to lose he position with carstair who have always treat he so well it be terrible it could not be he look through he visor to the right and to the leave a policeman walk on each side of he with he hand on he iron sleeve and mccluire march proudly before the dim lamp of mcgovern 's night-hawk shone at the side of the procession and show the crowd trail on behind suddenly hefty throw up he visor stuff he cry be youse with I he do not wait for any answer but swing back he two iron arm and then bring they forward with a sweep on to the back of the neck of the two policeman they go down and forward as if a lamp-post have fall on they but be up again in a second but before they could rise hefty set he tooth and with a gurgle of joy but he iron helmet into mccluire 's back and send he fly forward into a snow-bank then he throw himself on he and bury he under three hundred pound of iron and flesh and blood and beat he with he mail hand over the head and choke the snow and ice down into he throat and nostril you 'll club I again will you he cry you 'll send I to the island the two policeman be pound he with they night-stick as effectually as though they be rap on a door-step and the crowd see this fall on they from behind lead by stuff mcgovern with he whip and roll they in the snow and try to tear off they coat-tail which mean money out of the policeman 's own pocket for repair and hurt more than broken rib as the police benefit society pay for they now then boy get I into a cab cry hefty they lift he in and obligingly blow out the light so that the police could not see its number and stuff drive hefty proudly home i guess i be even with that cop now say hefty as he stand at the door of the studio building perspire and happy but if they cop ever find out who the black knight be i 'll go away for six month on the island i guess he add thoughtfully i 'll have to give they two prize up outside the prison it be about ten o'clock on the night before christmas and very cold christmas eve be a very-much-occupied evening everywhere in a newspaper office especially so and all of the twenty and odd reporter be out that night on assignment and conway and bronson be the only two remain in the local room they be the very best of friend in the office and out of it but as the city editor have give conway the christmas-eve story to write instead of bronson the latter be jealous and they relation be strain i use the word story in the newspaper sense where everything write for the paper be a story whether it be a obituary or a reading notice or a dramatic criticism or a descriptive account of the crowded street and the light shop-window of a christmas eve conway have finish he story quite half a hour before and should have send it out to be mutilate by the blue pencil of a copy editor but as the city editor have twice appear at the door of the local room as though look for some one to send out on another assignment both conway and bronson keep on steadily write against time to keep he off until some one else come in conway have write he conclude paragraph a dozen time and bronson have conscientiously polish and repolish a three-line personal he be write concern a gentleman unknown to fame and who would remain unknown to fame until that paragraph appear in print the city editor block the door for the third time and look at bronson with a faint smile of sceptical appreciation be that very important he ask bronson say not very doubtfully as though he do not think he opinion should be trust on such a matter and eye the paragraph with critical interest conway rush he pencil over he paper with the tip of he tongue show between he tooth and become suddenly absorb well then if you be not _ very _ busy say the city editor i wish you would go down to moyamense they release that bank-robber quinn to-night and it ought to make a good story he be sentence for six year i think but he have be commute for good conduct and bad health there be a preliminary story about it in the paper this morning and you can get all the fact from that it be christmas eve and all that sort of thing and you ought to be able to make something of it there be certain story write for a philadelphium newspaper that circle into print with the regularity of the season there be the first Sunday in the park for example which come on the first warm Sunday in the spring and which be make up of a talk with a park policeman who guess at the number of people who have pass through the gate that day and announcement of the re-painting of the boat-house and the near approach of the open-air concert you end this story with a allusion to the presence in the park of the wan-faced child of the tenement and the worthy workingman -lrb- if it be a one-cent paper which the workingman be likely to read -rrb- and tell how they worship nature in the open air instead of say that in place of go properly to church they sit around in they shirt-sleeve and scatter egg-shell and empty beer bottle and greasy Sunday newspaper over the green grass for which the worthy man who do not work pay tax then there be the hottest Sunday in the park which come up a month later when you increase the park policeman 's former guess by fifteen thousand and give it a news value by add a list of the small boy drown in bathing the first haul of shad in the delaware be another reliable story as be also the first ice fit for skating in the park and then there be always the thanksgiving story when you ask the theatrical manager what they have to be thankful for and have they tell you for the best season that this theater have ever know sir and offer you a pass for two and there be the new year 's story when you interview the local celebrity as to what they most want for the new year and turn they commonplace reply into something clever there be also a story on christmas day and the one conway have just write on the street scene of christmas eve after you have write one of these story two or three time you find it just as easy to write it in the office as anywhere else one gentleman of my acquaintance do this most unsuccessfully he write he christmas-day story with the aid of a directory and the file of a last year 's paper from the year-old file he obtain the name of all the charitable institution which make a practice of give they charge present and christmas tree and from the directory he draw the name of they president and board of director but as he be unfortunately lack in religious knowledge and a sense of humor he include all the jewish institution on the list and they write to the paper and rather object to be represent as decorate christmas tree or in any way celebrate that particular day but of all stale flat and unprofitable story this release of prisoner from moyamense be the worst it seem to bronson that they be always release prisoner he wonder how they possibly leave themselves enough to make a county prison worth while and the city editor for some reason always choose he to go down and see they come out as they be release at midnight and never do anything of moment when they be release but to immediately cross over to the nearest saloon with all they disreputable friend who have gather to meet they it be try to one whose regard for the truth be at first unshaken and whose imagination at the last become exhaust so when bronson hear he have to release another prisoner in pathetic descriptive prose he lose heart and patience and rebel andy he say sadly and impressively if i have write that story once i have write it twenty time i have describe moyamense with the moonlight fall on its wall i have describe it with the wall shine in the rain i have describe it cover with the pure white snow that fall on the just as well as on the criminal and i have make the bloodhound in the jail-yard howl dismally -- and there be no bloodhound as you very well know and i have make release convict declare they intention to lead a better and a purer life when they only say ` if youse put anything in the paper about I i 'll lay for you ' and i have make they fall on the neck of they weep wife when they only ask ` do you bring I some tobacco i be sick for a pipe ' and i will not write any more about it and if i do i will do it here in the office and that be all there be to it oh yes i think you will say the city editor easily let some one else do it bronson plead -- some one who have not do the thing to death who will get a new point of view -- conway who have stop write and have be grin at bronson over the city editor 's back grow suddenly grave and absorb and begin to write again with feverish industry conway now he be great at that sort of thing he be -- the city editor lay a clipping from the morning paper on the desk and take a roll of bill from he pocket there be the preliminary story he say conway write it and it move several good people to stop at the business office on they way down-town and leave something for the release convict 's christmas dinner the story be a very good story and impress they he go on count out the bill as he speak to the extent of fifty five dollar you take that and give it to he and tell he to forget the past and keep to the narrow road and leave jointed jimmy alone that money will give you a excuse for talk to he and he may say something grateful to the paper and comment on its enterprise come now get up i have spoil you two boy you have be sulk all the evening because conway get that story and now you be sulk because you have get a better one think of it -- get out of prison after four year and on christmas eve it be a beautiful story just as it be but he add grimly you 'll try to improve on it and grow maudlin i believe sometimes you would turn a red light on the die gladiator the conscientiously industrious conway now that he fear of be send out again be at rest laugh at this with conciliatory mirth and bronson smile sheepishly and peace be restore between they but as bronson capitulate he try to make condition can i take a cab he ask the city editor look at he watch yes he say you would better it be late and we go to press early to-night remember and can i send my stuff down by the driver and go home bronson go on i can write it up there and leave the cab at fifteenth street near we house i do not want to come all the way down-town again no say the chief the driver might lose it or get drunk or something then can i take gallegher with I to bring it back ask bronson gallegher be one of the office-boy the city editor stare at he grimly would not you like a type-writer and conway to write the story for you and a hot supper send after you he ask no gallegher will do bronson say gallegher have he overcoat on and a night-hawk at the door when bronson come down the stair and stop to light a cigar in the hallway go to moyamensing say gallegher to the driver gallegher look at the man to see if he would show himself sufficiently human to express surprise at they visit such a place on such a night but the man only gather up he rein impassively and gallegher step into the cab with a feeling of disappointment at have miss a point he rub the frosted pane and look out with boyish interest at the pass holiday-maker the pavement be full of they and they bundle and the street as well with waver line of medical student and clerk blow joyfully on the horn and push through the crowd with one hand on the shoulder of the man in front the christmas green hang in long line and only stop where a street cross and the shop front be so brilliant that the street be as light as day it be so light that bronson could read the clipping the city editor have give he what be it we be go on ask gallegher gallegher enjoy many privilege they be give he principally i think because if they have not be give he he would have take they he be very young and small but sturdily build and he have a general knowledge which be entertaining except when he happen to know more about anything than you do it be impossible to force he to respect you year for he know all about you from the number of line that have be cut off you last story to the amount of you very small salary and there be a awful simplicity about he and a certain sympathy or it may have be merely curiosity which show itself towards every one with whom he come in contact so when he ask bronson what he be go to do bronson read the clipping in he hand aloud ` henry quinn ' bronson read ` who be sentence to six year in moyamensing prison for the robbery of the second national bank at tacony will be liberate to-night he sentence have be commute owe to good conduct and to the fact that for the last year he have be in very ill health quinn be night watchman at the tacony bank at the time of the robbery and as be show at the trial be in reality merely the tool of the robber he confess to complicity in the robbery but disclaim have any knowledge of the later whereabouts of the money which have never be recover this be he first offence and he have up to the time of the robbery bear a very excellent reputation although but lately marry he married life have be a most unhappy one he friend claim that he wife and she mother be the most to blame quinn take to spend he evening away from home and see a great deal of a young woman who be suppose to have be the direct cause of he dishonesty he admit in fact that it be to get money to enable he to leave the country with she that he agree to assist the bank-robber the paper acknowledge the receipt of ten dollar from mjc to be give to quinn on he release also two dollar from cash and three from mary gallegher 's comment on this be one of disdain there be not much in that he say be there just a man that be do time once and they be let he out now if it be kid mccoy or billy porter or some one like that -- eh gallegher have as high a regard for a string of alias after a name as other have for a double line of kcb 's and csl 's and a man who have offend but once be not worthy of he consideration and you will work in those bloodhound again too i suppose he say gloomily the reporter pretend not to hear this and to doze in the corner and gallegher whistle softly to himself and twisted luxuriously on the cushion it be a half-hour later when bronson awake to find he have doze in all seriousness as a sudden current of cold air cut in he face and he see gallegher standing with he hand on the open door with the gray wall of the prison rise behind he moyamense look like a prison it be solidly awfully suggestive of the sternness of its duty and of the hopelessness of its fail in it it stand like a great fortress of the middle age in a quadrangle of cheap brick and white dwelling-house and a few mean shop and tawdry saloon it have the tower of a fortress the pillar of a egyptian temple but more impressive than either of these be the awful simplicity of the bare uncompromising wall that shut out the prying eye of the world and enclose those who be no longer of the world it be hard to imagine what effect it have on those who remain in the house about it one would think they would sooner live overlook a graveyard than such a place with its mystery and hopelessness and unending silence its hundred of human inmate whom no one can see or hear but who one feel be there bronson as he look up at the prison familiar as it be to he admit that he feel all this by a frown and a slight shrug of the shoulder you be to wait here until twelve he say to the driver of the nighthawk do not go far away bronson and the boy walk to a oyster-saloon that make one of the line of house face the gate of the prison on the opposite side of the street and seat themselves at one of the table from which bronson could see out towards the northern entrance of the jail he tell gallegher to eat something so that the saloon-keeper would make they welcome and allow they to remain and gallegher climb up on a high chair and hear the man shout back he order to the kitchen with a faint smile of anticipation it be eleven o'clock but it be even then necessary to begin to watch as there be a tradition in the office that prisoner with influence be sometimes release before they sentence be quite fulfil and bronson eye the release prisoner ' gate from across the top of he paper the electric light before the prison show every stone in its wall and turn the icy pavement into black mirror of light on a church steeple a block away a round clock-face tell the minute and bronson wonder if they drag so slowly to he how tardily they must follow one another to the man in the prison who could not see the clock 's face the office-boy finish he supper and go out to explore the neighborhood and come back later to say that it be grow colder and that he have find the driver in a saloon but that he be to all appearance still sober bronson suggest that he have better sacrifice himself once again and eat something for the good of the house and gallegher assent listlessly with the comment that one might as well be eatin ' as doin ' nothin ' he go out again restlessly and be go for a quarter of a hour and bronson have re-read the day 's paper and the sign on the wall and the clipping he have read before and be think of go out to find he when gallegher put he head and arm through the door and beckon to he from the outside bronson wrap he coat up around he throat and follow he leisurely to the street gallegher halt at the curb and point across to the figure of a woman pacing up and down in the glare of the electric light and make a conspicuous shadow on the white surface of the snow that lady say gallegher ask I what door they let the release prisoner out of a ' i say i do not know but that i know a young fellow who do bronson stand consider the possible value of this for a moment and then cross the street slowly the woman look up sharply as he approach but stand still if you be wait to see quinn bronson say abruptly he will come out of that upper gate the green one with the iron spike over it the woman stand motionless and look at he doubtfully she be quite young and pretty but she face be draw and wearied-looking as though she be a

not help he say that could i if he do then he -- then this come she nod to the jail and they blame _ I _ for it they say that i stand in with the bank-robber and be work with they they say they use I for to get he to help they she lift she face to the boy and the man and they see that she eye be wet and that she face be quiver that be likely be not it she demand with a sob she stand for a moment

something against he come out i only get three dollar a week and my keep but i have save one hundred and thirty dollar up to last April and then i take sick and it all go to the doctor and for

not try to get well what do you think bronson shake he head and clear he throat as if he be go to speak but say nothing gallegher be look up at the girl with large open eye bronson wonder if any woman

they say he be change so i wonder if i be change much she say i have fall off since i be ill she pass she hand slowly over she face with a touch of vanity that hurt bronson somehow and he wish he might tell she how pretty she still be do you think he 'll know I she ask do you think she 'll let I speak to he i do not know how can i tell say the reporter sharply he be strangely nervous and upset he could see no way out of it the girl seem to be tell the truth and yet the man 's wife be with he and by he side as she should be and this woman have no place on the scene and could mean nothing but trouble to herself and to every one else come he say abruptly we have better be get up there it be only five minute of twelve the girl turn with a quick start and walk on ahead of they up the drive lead between the snow-covered grass-plot that stretch from the pavement to the wall of the prison she move unsteadily and slowly and bronson see that she be shiver either from excitement or the cold i guess say gallegher in a awed whisper that there be go to be a scrap shut up say bronson they stop a few yard before the great green double gate with a smaller door cut in one of its half and with the light from a big lantern shine down on they they could not see the clock-face from where they stand and when bronson take out he watch and look at it the girl turn she face to he appealingly but do not speak it will be only a little while now he say gently he think he have never see so much trouble and fear and anxiety in so young a face and he move towards she and say in a whisper as though those inside could hear he control yourself if you can and then add doubtfully and still in a whisper you can take my arm if you need it the girl shake she head dumbly but take a step nearer he as if for protection and turn she eye fearfully towards the gate the minute pass on slowly but with intense significance and they stand so still that they could hear the wind play through the wire of the electric light back of they and the clicking of the icicle as they drop from the edge of the prison wall to the stone at they foot and then slowly and laboriously and like a knell the great gong of the prison sound the first stroke of twelve but before it have count three there come suddenly from all the city about they a great chorus of clang bell and the shriek and tooting of whistle and the booming of cannon from far down town the big bell of the state-house with its prestige and historic dignity back of it try to give the time but the other bell race past it and beat out on the cold crisp air joyously and uproariously from kensington to the schuylkill and from far across the neck over the marsh and frozen pond come the dull roar of the gun at the navy-yard and from the delaware the hoarse tooting of the ferry-boat and the sharp shriek of the tug until the heaven seem to rock and swing with the great welcome gallegher look up quickly with a queer awed smile it be christmas he say and then he nod doubtfully towards bronson and say merry christmas sir it have come to the wait holiday crowd down-town around the state-house to the captain of the tug fog-bound on the river to the engineer sweeping across the white field and sound he welcome with he hand on the bell-cord to the prisoner beyond the wall and to the child all over the land watch they stocking at the foot of they bed and then the three be instantly draw down to earth again by the near sharp click of open bolt and lock and the green gate swing heavily in before they the jail-yard be light with whitewash and two great lamp in front of round reflector shine with blind force in they face and make they start suddenly backward as though they have be catch in the act and hold in the circle of a policeman 's lantern in the middle of the yard be the carriage in which the prisoner 's wife and she mother have come and around it stand the warden and turnkey in they blue and gold uniform they see they dimly from behind the glare of the carriage lamp that shine in they face and see the horse move slowly towards they and the driver hold up they head as they slip and slide on the icy stone the girl put she hand on bronson 's arm and clinch it with she finger but she eye be on the advance carriage the horse slip nearer to they and pass they and the light from the lamp now show they back and the paving stone beyond they and leave the cab in partial darkness it be a four-seated carriage with a movable top opening into two half at the center it have be close when the cab first enter the prison a few hour before but now its top be throw back and they could see that it hold the two woman who sit face each other on the farther side and on the side nearer they stretch from the forward seat to the top of the back be a plain board coffin prison-made and painted black the girl at bronson 's side give something between a cry and a shriek that turn he sick for a instant and that make the office-boy drop he head between he shoulder as though some one have strike at he from above even the horse shy with sudden panic towards one another and the driver pull they in with a oath of consternation and throw himself forward to look beneath they hoof and as the carriage stop the girl spring in between the wheel and throw she arm across the lid of the coffin and lay she face down upon the board that be already damp with the fall snow henry henry henry she moan the surgeon who attend the prisoner through the sickness that have cheat the country of three hour of he sentence run out from the hurry crowd of warden and draw the girl slowly and gently away and the two woman move on triumphantly with they sorry victory \* \* \* \* \* bronson give he copy to gallegher to take to the office and gallegher lay it and the roll of money on the city editor 's desk and then so the chief related afterwards move off quickly to the door the chief look up from he proof and touch the roll of money with he pencil here what be this he ask would not he take it gallegher stop and straighten himself as though about to tell with proper dramatic effect the story of the night 's adventure and then as though the awe of it still hang upon he back slowly to the door and say confusedly no sir he be -- he do not need it a unfinished story mr trevelyan as she take she seat shoot a quick glance down the length of she table and at the arrangement of she guest and try to learn if she lord and master approve but he be listen to something lady arbuthnot who sit on he right be say and be a man fail to catch she meaning and only smile unconcernedly and cheerfully back at she but the wife of the austrian minister who be she very dearest friend saw and appreciate and give she a quick little smile over she fan which say that the table be perfect the people most interesting and that she could possess she soul in peace so mrs trevelyan pull at the tip of she glove and smile upon she guest mr trevelyan be not use to question she power but this dinner have be almost impromptu and she have be in doubt it be quite unnecessary for she dinner carry with it the add virtue of be the last of the season a encore to all that have go before -- a special number by request on the social program it be not one of many other stretch on for week for the summer 's change and leisure begin on the morrow and there be nothing hanging over she guest that they must go on to later they know that they luggage stand ready lock and strap at home they could look before they to the whole summer 's pleasure and they be relax and ready to be pleased and break simultaneously into a low murmur of talk and laughter the window of the dining-room stand open from the floor and from the tiny garden that surround the house even in the great mass of stucco and brick of encircle london come the odor of flower and of fresh turf a soft summer-night wind move the candle under they red shades and gently as though they rise from afar and not only from across the top of the high wall before the house come the rumble of the omnibus pass farther into the suburb and the occasional quick rush of a hansom over the smooth asphalt it be a most delightful choice of people gather at short notice and to do honor to no one in particular but to give each a chance to say good-by before he or she meet the yacht at southampton or take the club train to homburg they all know each other very well and if there be a guest of the evening it be one of the two american -- either miss egerton the girl who be to marry lord arbuthnot whose mother sit on trevelyan 's right or young gordon the explorer who have just come out of africa miss egerton be a most strikingly beautiful girl with a strong fine face and a earnest interested way when she speak which the english find most attractive in appearance she have be variously liken by trevelyan who be paint she portrait to a druidess a vestal virgin and a greek goddess and lady arbuthnot 's friend who think to please the girl assure she that no one would ever suppose she to be a american -- they idea of the american young woman have be gather from those who pick out tune with one finger on the piano in the public parlor of the métropole miss egerton be say to be intensely interested in she lover 's career and be as ambitious for he success in the house as he be himself they be both very much in love and show it to other as little as people of they class do the other at the table be general sir henry kent phillip the novelist the austrian minister and he young wife and trevelyan who paint portrait for large sum of money and figure piece for art and some simply fashionable smart people who be good listener and who be rather disappoint that the american explorer be no more sun-burned than other young man who have stay at home and who have go in for tennis or yachting the worst of gordon be that he make it next to impossible for one to lionize he he have be back in civilization and london only two week unless cairo and shepheard 's hotel be civilization and he have be ask everywhere and for the first week have go everywhere but whenever he hostess look for he to present another and not so recent a lion he be generally find either humbly carry a ice to some neglect dowager or talk big game or international yachting or tailor to a circle of younger son in the smoking-room just as though several hundred attractive and distinguished people be not wait to fling the speech they have prepare on africa at he in the drawing-room above he have suddenly disappear during the second week of he stay in london which be also the last week of the london season and manager of lecture tour and publisher and lion-hunter and even friend who care for he for himself have fail to find he at he lodgings trevelyan who have know he when he be a travel correspondent and artist for one of the great weekly have find he at the club the night before and have ask he to he wife 's impromptu dinner from which he have at first beg off but on learning who be to be there have change he mind and accept mr trevelyan be very glad he have come she have always speak of he as a nice boy and now that he have become famous she like he none the less but do not show it before people as much as she have be use to do she forget to ask he whether he know he beautiful compatriot or not but she take it for grant that they have meet if not at home at least in london as they have both be make so much of and at the same house the dinner be well on its way towards its end and the woman have begin to talk across the table and to exchange banker ' address and to say be sure and look we up in paris and when do you expect to sail from cowe they be enliven and interested and the present odor of the food and flower and wine and the sense of leisure before they make it seem almost a pity that such a well-suited gathering should have to separate for even a summer 's pleasure the austrian minister be say this to he hostess when sir henry kent who have be talk across to phillip the novelist lean back in he place and say as though to challenge the attention of every one i can not agree with you phillip i be sure no one else will dear I complain mr trevelyan plaintively what have you be say now mr phillip he always have such debatable theory she explain on the contrary mr trevelyan answer the novelist it be the other way it be sir henry who be make all the trouble he be attack one of the oldest and dearest platitude i know he pause for the general to speak but the older man nod he head for he to go on he have just say that fiction be stranger than truth continue the novelist he say that i -- that people who write could never interest people who read if they write of thing as they really be they select he say -- they take the critical moment in a man 's life and the crisis and want other to believe that that be what happen every day which it be not so the general say he think that life be commonplace and uneventful -- that be uneventful in a picturesque or dramatic way he admit that woman 's life be save from drown but that they be not save by they lover but by a longshoreman with a wife and six child who accept five pound for do it that be it be it not he ask the general nodded and smile what i say to phillip be he explain that if thing be related just as they happen they would not be interesting people do not say the dramatic thing they say on the stage or in novel in real life they be commonplace or sordid -- or disappointing i have see man die on the battle-field for instance and they never cry ' i die that my country may live ' or ' i have get my promotion at last ' they just stare up at the surgeon and say ` have i get to lose that arm ' or ' i be kill i think ' you see when man be die around you and horse be plunge and the battery be firing one do not have time to think up the appropriate remark for the occasion i do not believe now that pitt 's last word be ` roll up the map of europe ' a man who could change the face of a continent would not use he die breath in make epigram it be one of he secretary or one of the doctor who say that and the man who be capable of write home ` all be lose but honor ' be just the sort of a man who would lose more battle than he would win no you phillip say the general raise he voice as he become more confident and conscious that be hold the center of the stage and you trevelyan do not write and paint every-day thing as they be you introduce something for a contrast or for a effect a red coat in a landscape for the bit of color you want when in real life the red coat would not be within mile or you have a band of music play a popular air in the street when a murder be go on inside the house you do it because it be effective but it be not true now mr caithness be tell we the other night at the club on this very matter -- oh that be hardly fair laugh trevelyan you have rehearse all this before you have come prepared no not at all frown the general sweeping on he say that before he be raise to the bench when he practice criminal law he have bring word to a man that he be to be reprieve and to another that he be to die now you know exclaim the general with a shrug and appeal to the table how that would be do on the stage or in a novel with the prisoner bind ready for execution and a gallop horse and a flutter piece of white paper and all that well now caithness tell we that he go into the man 's cell and say ` you have be reprieve john ' or william or whatever the fellow 's name be and the man look at he and say : ` be that so that be good -- that be good ' and that be all he say and then again he tell one man whose life he have try very hard to save : ` the home secretary have refuse to intercede for you i see he at he house last night at nine o'clock ' and the murderer instead of say ` my god what will my wife and child do ' look at he and repeat ` at nine o'clock last night ' just as though that be the important part of the message well but general say phillip smile that be dramatic enough as it be i think why -- yes interrupt the general quickly and triumphantly but that be not what you would have make he say be it that be my point there be a man tell I once lord arbuthnot begin leisurely -- he be a great chum of mine and it illustrate what sir henry have say i think -- he be engage to a girl and he have a misunderstanding or a understanding with she that open both they eye at a dance and the next afternoon he call and they talk it over in the drawing-room with the tea-tray between they and agree to end it on the stage he would have rise and say ` well the comedy be over the tragedy begin or the curtain fall ' and she would have go to the piano and play chopin sadly while he make he exit instead of which he get up to go without say anything and as he rise he upset a cup and saucer on the tea-table and say ` oh i beg you pardon ' and she say ` it be not break ' and he go out you see the young man add smile there be two young people whose heart be break and yet they talk of teacup not because they do not feel but because custom be too strong on we and too much for we we do not say dramatic thing or do theatrical one it do not make interesting reading but it be the truth exactly cut in the austrian minister eagerly and then there be the prerogative of the author and of the playwright to drop a curtain whenever he want to or to put a stop to everything by end the chapter that be not fair that be a advantage over nature when some one accuse some one else of do something dreadful at the play down come the curtain quick and keep thing at fever point or the chapter end with a lot of star and the next page begin with a description of a sunset two week later to be true we ought to be tell what the man who be accuse say in the reply or what happen during those two week before the sunset the author really have no right to choose only the critical moment and to shut out the commonplace every-day life by a sort of literary closure that be if he claim to tell the truth phillip raise he eyebrow and look carefully around the table do any one else feel call upon to testify he ask it be awful be not it phillip laugh trevelyan comfortably to find that the photographer be the only artist after all i feel very guilty you ought to pronounce the general gayly he be very well satisfy with himself at have hold he own against these clever people and i be sure mr gordon will agree with I too he go on confidently with a bow towards the younger man he have see more of the world than any of we and he will tell you i be sure that what happen only suggest the story it be not complete in itself that it always need the author 's touch just as the rough diamond -- oh thanks thanks general laugh phillip my feeling be not hurt as badly as that gordon have be turn the stem of a wineglass slowly between he thumb and he finger while the other be talk and look down at it smile now he raise he eye as though he mean to speak and then drop they again i be afraid sir henry he say that i do not agree with you at all those who have say nothing feel a certain satisfaction that they have not commit themselves the austrian minister try to remember what it be he have say and whether it be too late to retreat and the general look blankly at gordon and say indeed you should not have call on that last witness sir henry say phillip smile you case be very good as it be i be quite sure say gordon seriously that the story phillip will never write be a true story but he will not write it because people would say it be impossible just as you have all see sunset sometimes that you know would be laugh at if any one try to paint they we all know such a story something in we own life or in the life of we friend not ghost story or story of adventure but of ambition that come to nothing of people who be reward or punish in this world instead of in the next and love story phillip look at the young man keenly and smile especially love story he say gordon look back at he as if he do not understand tell it gordon say mr trevelyan yes say gordon nod he head in assent i be think of a particular story it be as complete i think and as dramatic as any of those we read it be about a man i meet in africa it be not a long story he say look around the table tentatively but it end badly there be a silence much more appreciate than a polite murmur of invitation would have be and the simply smart people settle themselves rigidly to catch every word for future use they realize that this would be a story which have not as yet appear in the newspaper and which would not make a part of gordon 's book mr trevelyan smile encouragingly upon she former protégé she be sure he be go to do himself credit but the american girl choose this chance when all the other eye be turn expectantly towards the explorer to look at she lover we be on we return march from lake tchad to the mobangus say gordon we have be travel over a month sometimes by water and sometimes through the forest and we do not expect to see any other white man besides those of we own party for several month to come in the middle of a jungle late one afternoon i find this man lie at the foot of a tree he have be cut and beat and leave for dead it be as much of a surprise to I you understand as it would be to you if you be drive through trafalgar square in a hansom and a african lion should spring up on you horse ' haunch we believe we be the only white man that have ever succeed in get that far south crampel have try it and no one know yet whether he be dead or alive doctor schleman have be eat by cannibal and major bethume have turn back two hundred mile farther north and we could no more account for this man 's presence than if he have be drop from the cloud lieutenant royce my surgeon go to work at he and we halt where we be for the night in about a hour the man move and open he eye he look up at we and say ` thank god ' -- because we be white i suppose -- and go off into unconsciousness again when he come to the next time he ask royce in a whisper how long he have to live he be not the sort of a man you have to lie to about a thing like that and royce tell he he do not think he could live for more than a hour or two the man move he head to show that he understand and raise he hand to he throat and begin pull at he shirt but the effort send he off into a fainting-fit again i open he collar for he as gently as i could and find that he finger have clinch around a silver necklace that he wear about he neck and from which there hang a gold locket shape like a heart gordon raise he eye slowly from the observation of he finger-tip as they rest on the edge of the table before he to those of the american girl who sit opposite she have hear he story so far without any show of attention and have be watch rather with a touch of fondness in she eye the clever earnest face of arbuthnot who be follow gordon 's story with polite interest but now at gordon 's last word she turn she eye to he with a look of awful indignation which be follow when she meet he calmly polite look of inquiry by one of fear and almost of entreaty when the man come to continue gordon in the same conventional monotone he beg I to take the chain and locket to a girl whom he say i would find either in london or in new york he give I the address of she banker he say : ` take it off my neck before you bury I tell she i wear it ever since she give it to I that it have be a charm and loadstone to I that when the locket rise and fall against my breast it be as if she heart be press against mine and answer the beating and throbbing of the blood in my vein ' gordon pause and return to the thoughtful scrutiny of he finger-tip the man do not die he say raise he head royce bring he back into such form again that in about a week we be able to take he along with we on a litter but he be very weak and would lie for hour sleep when we rest or mumble and rave in a fever we learn from he at odd time that he have be try to reach lake tchad to do what we have do without any means of do it he have have not more than a couple of dozen porter and a corporal 's guard of senegalese soldier he be the only white man in the party and he man have turn on he and leave he as we find he carry off with they he stock of provision and arm he have undertake the expedition on a promise from the french government to make he governor of the territory he open up if he succeed but he have have no official help if he fail he get nothing if he succeed he do so at he own expense and by he own endeavor it be only a wonder he have be able to get as far as he do he do not seem to feel the failure of he expedition all that be lose in the happiness of get back alive to this woman with whom he be in love he have be three day alone before we find he and in those three day while he wait for death he have think of nothing but that he would never see she again he have resign himself to this have give up all hope and we come seem like a miracle to he i have read about man in love i have see it on the stage i have see it in real life but i never see a man so grateful to god and so happy and so insane over a woman as this man be he rave about she when he be feverish and he talk and talk to I about she when he be in he sens the porter could not understand he and he find I sympathetic i suppose or else he do not care and only want to speak of she to some one and so he tell I the story over and over again as i walk beside the litter or as we sit by the fire at night she must have be a very remarkable girl he have meet she first the year before on one of the italian steamer that ply from new york to gibraltar she be travel with she father who be a invalid go to tangier for he health from tangier they be to go on up to nice and canne and in the spring to pari and on to london for this season just over the man be go from gibraltar to zanzibar and then on into the congo they have meet the first night out they have separate thirteen day later at gibraltar and in that time the girl have fall in love with he and have promise to marry he if he would let she for he be very proud he have to be he have absolutely nothing to offer she she be very well know at home i mean she family be : they have live in new york from its first day and they be very rich the girl have live a life as different from he as the life of a girl in society must be from that of a vagabond he have be a engineer a newspaper correspondent a officer in a chinese army and have build bridge in south america and lead they little revolution there and have see service on the desert in the french army of algier he have no home or nationality even for he have leave america when he be sixteen he have no family have save no money and be trust everything to the success of this expedition into africa to make he know and to give he position it be the story of othello and desdemona over again he blackness lay from she point of view or rather would have lie from the point of view of she friend in the fact that he be as helplessly ineligible a young man as a cowboy and he really have live a life of which he have no great reason to be proud he have exist entirely for excitement as other man live to drink until they kill themselves by it nothing he have do have count for much except he bridge they be still stand but the thing he have write be lose in the column of the daily papers the soldier he have fight with know he only as a man who care more for the fighting than for what the fighting be about and he have be as ready to write on one side as to fight on the other he be a rolling stone and have be a rolling stone from the time he be sixteen and have run away to sea up to the day he have meet this girl when he be just thirty yet you can see how such a man would attract a young impressionable girl who have meet only those man whose action be bound by the court of law or wall street or the younger set who drive coach and who live the life of the club she have go through life as some people go through picture-gallery with they catalogue mark at the best picture she know nothing of the little fellow whose work be ski who be try to be know who be not of she world but who toil and pray and hope to be famous this man come into she life suddenly with he story of adventure and strange people and strange place of thing do for the love of do they and not for the reward or reputation and he bewilder she at first i suppose and then fascinate and then win she you can imagine how it be these two walk the deck together during the day or sit side by side when the night come on the ocean stretch before they the daring of he present undertake the absurd glamour that be throw over those who have go into that strange country from which some traveller return and the picturesqueness of he past life it be no wonder the girl make too much of he i do not think he know what be come he do not pose before she i be quite sure from what i know of he that he do not indeed i believe he when he say that he have fight against the more than interest she have begin to show for he he be the sort of man woman care for but they have not be of this woman 's class or calibre it come to he like a sign from the heaven it be as if a goddess have stoop to he he tell she when they separate that if he succeed -- if he open this unknown country if he be reward as they have promise to reward he -- he might dare to come to she and she call he she knight-errant and give he she chain and locket to wear and tell he whether he fail or succeed it mean nothing to she and that she life be he while it last and she soul as well i think gordon say stop abruptly with a air of careful consideration that those be she word as he repeat they to I he raise he eye thoughtfully towards the face of the girl opposite and then glance past she as if he be try to recall the word the man have use the fine beautiful face of the woman be white and draw around the lip and she give a quick appealing glance at she hostess as if she would beg to be allow to go but mr trevelyan and she guest be watch gordon or toy with the thing in front of they the dinner have be serve and not even the soft movement of the servant interrupt the young man 's story you can imagine a man gordon go on more lightly find a hansom cab slow when he be ride from the station to see the woman he love but imagine this man urge himself and the rest of we to hurry when we be in the heart of africa with six month ' travel in front of we before we could reach the first limit of civilization that be what this man do when he be still on he litter he use to toss and turn and abuse the bearer and porter and myself because we move so slowly when we stop for the night he would chafe and fret at the delay and when the morning come he be the first to wake if he sleep at all and eager to push on when at last he be able to walk he work himself into a fever again and it be only when royce warn he that he would kill himself if he keep on that he submit to be carry and force himself to be patient and all the time the poor devil keep say how unworthy he be of she how miserably he have waste he year how unfitted he be for the great happiness which have come into he life i suppose every man say that when he be in love very properly too but the worst of it be in this man 's case that it be so very true he be unworthy of she in everything but he love for she it use to frighten I to see how much he care well we get out of it at last and reach alexandrium and see white face once more and hear woman 's voice and the strain and fear of failure be over and we could breathe again i be quite ready enough to push on to london but we have to wait a week for the steamer and during that time that man make my life miserable he have do so well and would have do so much more if he have have my equipment that i try to see that he receive all the credit due he but he would have none of the public reception and the audience with the khedive or any of the fuss they make over we he only want to get back to she he spend the day on the quay watch they load the steamer and count the hour until she be to sail and even at night he would leave the first bed he have sleep in for six month and would come into my room and ask I if i would not sit up and talk with he until daylight you see after he have give up all thought of she and believe himself about to die without see she again it make she all the dearer i suppose and make he all the more fearful of lose she again he become very quiet as soon as we be really under way and royce and i hardly know he for the same man he would sit in silence in he steamer-chair for hour look out at the sea and smile to himself and sometimes for he be still very weak and feverish the tear would come to he eye and run down he cheek ` this be the way we would sit ' he say to I one night ` with the dark purple sky and the strange southern star over we head and the rail of the boat rise and sink below the line of the horizon and i can hear she voice and i try to imagine she be still sit there as she do the last night out when i hold she hand between mine ' gordon pause a moment and then go on more slowly : i do not know whether it be that the excitement of the journey overland have keep he up or not but as we go on he become much weaker and sleep more until royce become anxious and alarmed about he but he do not know it himself he have grow so sure of he recovery then that he do not understand what the weakness mean he fall off into long spell of sleep or unconsciousness and wake only to be feed and would then fall back to sleep again and in one of these spell of unconsciousness he die he die within two day of land he have no home and no country and no family as i tell you and we bury he at sea he leave nothing behind he for the very clothes he wear be those we have give he -- nothing but the locket and the chain which he have tell I to take from he neck when he die gordon 's voice have grow very cold and hard he stop and run he finger down into he pocket and pull out a little leather bag the people at the table watch he in silence as he open it and take out a dull silver chain with a gold heart hang from it this be it he say gently he lean across the table with he eye fix on those of the american girl and drop the chain in front of she would you like to see it he say the rest move curiously forward to look at the little heap of gold and silver as it lay on the white cloth but the girl with she eye half close and she lip press together push it on with she hand to the man who sit next she and bow she head slightly as though it be a effort for she to move at all the wife of the austrian minister give a little sigh of relief i should say you story do end badly mr gordon she say it be terribly sad and so unnecessarily so i do not know say lady arbuthnot thoughtfully -- i do not know it seem to I it be better as mr gordon say the man be hardly worthy of she a man should have something more to offer a woman than love it be a woman 's prerogative to be love any number of man may love she it be nothing to they credit : they can not help themselves well say general kent if all true story turn out as badly as that one do i will take back what i say against those the story-writer tell i prefer the one anstey and jerome make up i call it a most unpleasant story but it be not finish yet say gordon as he lean over and pick up the chain and locket there be still a little more oh i beg you pardon say the wife of the austrian minister eagerly but then she add you can not make it any better you can not bring the man back to life no say gordon but i can make it a little worse ah i see say phillip with a story-teller 's intuition -- the girl the first day i reach london i go to she banker 's and get she address continue gordon and i write say i want to see she but before i could get a answer i meet she the next afternoon at a garden-party at least i do not meet she she be point out to I i see a very beautiful girl surround by a lot of man and ask who she be and find out it be the woman i have write to the owner of the chain and locket and i be also tell that she engagement have just be announce to a young englishman of family and position who have know she only a few month and with whom she be very much in love so you see he go on smile that it be better that he die believe in she and in she love for he mr phillip now would have let he live to return and find she married but nature be kinder than writer of fiction and quite as dramatic phillip do not reply to this and the general only shake he head doubtfully and say nothing so mrs trevelyan look at lady arbuthnot and the lady rise and leave the room when the man have leave they a young girl go to the piano and the other woman seat themselves to listen but miss egerton say that it be warm step out through one of the high window on to the little balcony that overhang the garden it be dark out there and cool and the rumble of the encircle city sound as distant and as far off as the reflection seem that its million light throw up to the sky above the girl lean she face and bare shoulder against the rough stone wall of the house and press she hand together with she finger lock and unlock and she ring cut through she glove she be tremble slightly and the blood in she vein be hot and tingling she hear the voice of the man as they enter the drawing-room the momentary cessation of the music at the piano and its renewal and then a figure block the light from the window and gordon step out of it and stand in front of she with the chain and locket in he hand he hold it towards she and they face each other for a moment in silence will you take it now he say the girl raise she head and draw herself up until she stand straight and tall before he have you not punish I enough she ask in a whisper be you not satisfied be it brave be it manly be that what you have learn among you savage -- to torture a woman she stop with a quick sob of pain and press she hand against she breast gordon observe she curiously with cold consideration what of the suffering of the man to whom you give this he ask why not consider he what be you bad quarter of a hour at the table with you friend around you to the year he suffer danger and physical pain for you -- for you remember the girl hide she face for a moment in she hand and when she lower they again she cheek be wet and she voice be change and softer they tell I he be dead she say then it be deny and then the french papers tell of it again and with horrible detail and how it happen gordon take a step nearer she and do you love come and go with the edition of the daily papers he ask fiercely if they say to-morrow morning that arbuthnot be false to he principle or he party that he be a bribe-taker a man who sell he vote will you believe they and stop love he he give a sharp exclamation of disdain or will you wait he go on bitterly until the liberal organ have have time to deny it be that the love the life and the soul you promise the man who -- there be a soft step on the floor of the drawing-room and the tall figure of young arbuthnot appear in the opening of the window as he look doubtfully out into the darkness gordon take a step back into the light of the window where he could be see and lean easily against the railing of the balcony he eye be turn towards the street and he notice over the wall the top of a pass omnibus and the glow of the man 's pipe who sit on it miss egerton ask arbuthnot he eye still blind by the light of the room he have leave be she here oh be that you he say as he see the movement of the white dress i be send to look for you he say they be afraid something be wrong he turn to gordon as if in explanation of he lover-like solicitude it have be rather a hard week and it have keep one pretty well on the go all the time and i think miss egerton look tire at dinner the moment he have speak the girl come towards he quickly and put she arm inside of he and take he hand he look down at she wonderingly at this show of affection and then draw she nearer and say gently you be tire be not you i come to tell you that lady arbuthnot be go she be wait for you it strike gordon as they stand there how handsome they be and how well suit they take a step towards the window and then the young nobleman turn and look out at the pretty garden and up at the sky where the moon be struggle against the glare of the city it be very pretty and peaceful out here he say be it not it seem a pity to leave it good-night gordon and thank you for you story he stop with one foot on the threshold and smile and yet do you know he say i can not help think you be guilty of do just what you accuse phillip of do i somehow think you help the true story out a little now do not you be it all just as you tell it or be i wrong no gordon answer you be right i do change it a little in one particular and what be that may i ask say arbuthnot the man do not die gordon answer arbuthnot give a quick little sigh of sympathy poor devil he say softly poor chap he move he left hand over and touch the hand of the girl as though to reassure himself of he own good fortune then he raise he eye to gordon 's with a curious puzzle look in they but then he say doubtfully if he be not dead how do you come to get the chain the girl 's arm within he own move slightly and she finger tighten they hold upon he hand oh say gordon indifferently it do not mean anything to he you see when he find he have lose she and it could not mean anything to she it be of no value it mean nothing to any one -- except perhaps to I the end end of project gutenberg 's van bibber and other by richard harding davi
