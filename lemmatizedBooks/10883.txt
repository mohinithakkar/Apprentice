rule of a few after this they revert to nothing more nor less than a state of monarchy again although cæsar have a plan to lay down he arm and entrust affair to the senate and the populace he hold a consultation on the subject with agrippa and mæcenas to whom he communicate all he secret agrippa first of the two answer he as follow : -- -lrb- -2 - -rrb- be not surprised cæsar if i try to turn you mind away from monarchy in spite of the fact that i might enjoy many advantage from it if you hold the place if it be go to prove serviceable to you i should be thoroughly enthusiastic for it but those who hold supreme power be not in a like position with they friend : the latter without incur jealousy or danger reap all the benefit they please whereas jealousy and danger be the lot of the former i have think it right as in other case to look forward not for my own interest but for yours and the public 's let we consider leisurely all the feature of the system of government and turn whichever way we reflection may direct we for it will not be assert that we ought to choose it under any and all circumstance even if it be not advantageous otherwise we shall seem to have be unable to bear good fortune and to have go mad through we success or else to have be aim at it long since to have use we father and we devotion to he as a mere screen to have put the people and the senate forward as a excuse we object will seem to have be not to free they from conspirator but to enslave they to ourselves either supposition entail censure who would not be indignant to see that we have speak word of one tenor but to ascertain that we have have something different in mind how much more would he hate we now than if we have at the outset lay bare we desire and aim straight at the monarchy it have come to be generally believe that to adopt some violent course belong somehow to the nature of man even if it involve take a unfair advantage every person who excel in any business think it right that he should enjoy more advantage than he inferior if he meet with a success he ascribe it to the force of he individual temperament and if he fail in anything he refer it to the workings of the supernatural a man however who try to gain advancement by plot and injury be in the first place hold to be crafty and crooked malicious and vicious : -lrb- and this i know you would allow no one to say or think about you even if you might rule the whole world by it -rrb- : again if he succeed he be think to have gain a unjust advantage and if he fail to have meet with merit misfortune -lrb- -3 - -rrb- this be so any one might reproach we quite as much even if we have nothing of the sort in mind at the beginning and be to begin to devise it only now for to let the situation get the better of we and not restrain ourselves and not make a right use of the gift of fortune be much worse than for a man to do wrong through ill-luck the latter sort be often compel by they very disaster and in consideration of they own need of profit to behave against they will in a irregular way : the other voluntarily abandon self-control even if to do so be contrary to they own interest and when man neither have any love of simplicity in they soul nor be able to show moderation in regard to the blessing bestow upon they how could one expect that they would either rule well over other or behave themselves uprightly in trouble let we make we decision on the basis that we be in neither of the class mention and do not desire to act in any way unreasonably but will choose whatever course after deliberation appear to we best i shall speak quite frankly for i could not for my part express myself in any other way and i be aware that you do not enjoy hear lie mingle with flattery -lrb- -4 - -rrb- equality before the law have a pleasant name and its result be a triumph of justice if you take man who have receive the same nature be of kindred race to one another have be bring up under the same institution have be train in law that be alike and yield in common the service of they body and of they mind to the same state be it not just that they should have all other thing too in common be it not best that they should secure no superior honor except as a result of excellence equality of birth strive for equality of possession and if it attain it be glad but if it miss be displeased and human nature everywhere because it be spring from the god and be to return to the god gaze upward and be not content to be rule forever by the same person nor will it endure to share in the toil the danger the expenditure and be deprive of partnership in higher matter or if it be force to submit to such condition it hate the power which have apply coercion and if it obtain a opportunity take vengeance on what it hate all man think they ought to rule and for this reason submit to be rule in turn they do not wish to be defraud and therefore do not insist on defraud other they be pleased with honor bestow by they peer and approve the penalty inflict by they law if they conduct they government on these line and believe that profit and the opposite shall be share in common they wish no harm to happen to any one of the citizen and devoutly hope that all good thing may fall to the lot of all of they if one of they himself possess any excellence he make it know without hesitation practice it enthusiastically and exhibit it very gladly : or if he see it in another he readily advance it be eager to increase it and honor it most brilliantly on the other hand if any one deteriorate everybody hate he if one meet misfortune everybody pity he each person regard the loss or shame that such cause to be a common detriment to the city -lrb- -5 - -rrb- this be the constitution of democracy under tyranny exactly the opposite condition be find it be useless to go at length into all of the detail but the chief feature be that no one be willing to seem to know or possess anything good because the whole ruling power generally become hostile to he in such a case every one else take the tyrant 's behavior as a standard of life and pursue whatever object he may hope to gain through he by take advantage of he neighbor while incur no danger himself consequently the majority of the people have a eye only to they own interest and hate all other citizen : they esteem they neighbor 's good fortune as a personal loss and he misfortune as a personal gain such be the state of the case i do not see what could possibly incite you to become sole ruler besides the fact that that system be disagreeable to democracy it would be far more unpleasant still to yourself you surely see how the city and its affair be even now in a state of turmoil it be difficult also to overthrow we populace which have live during so many year in freedom and difficult since so many enemy confront we round about to reduce again to slavery the ally and the subject nation which from of old have be democratic community and be set free by we own self -lrb- -6 - -rrb- to begin first with the smallest matter it will be requisite that you procure a large supply of money from all side it be impossible that we present revenue should suffice for the very expense and particularly for the support of the soldier this need exist also in democracy for it be not possible to organize any government without expense but under such a system many give largely in addition to what be require and do it frequently make it a matter of rivalry and secure proper honor for they liberality or if perchance there be compulsory levy upon everybody they endure it because they can persuade themselves that it be wise and because they be contribute in they own behalf under sovereignty they think that the ruling power alone to which they credit boundless wealth should bear the expense : they be very ready to search out the ruler 's source of income but do not make a similar careful calculation about the outgo they be not incline to pay out anything extra personally and of they own free will nor will they hear of voluntary public contribution the former course no one would choose because he would not readily admit that he be rich and it be not to the advantage of the ruler to have it happen so liberal a citizen would immediately acquire a reputation for patriotism among the mass of the people would become conceited and cause a disturbance in politics on the other hand a general levy weigh heavily upon they all and chiefly because they endure the loss whereas other take the gain in democracy those who contribute money as a general rule also serve in the army so that in a way they get it back again but in monarchy one set of people usually farm manufacture carry on maritime enterprise engage in politics -- the principal pursuit by which fortune be secure -- and a different set be under arm and draw pay this single necessity then which be of such importance -lrb- -7 - -rrb- will cause you trouble here be another it be by all means essential that whoever from time to time commit a crime should pay some penalty the majority of man be not bring to reason by suggestion or by example but it be absolutely requisite to punish they by disenfranchisement by exile and by death and this often happen in so great a empire and in so large a multitude of man especially during a change of government now if you appoint other man to judge these wrongdoer they would acquit they speedily particularly all whom you may be think to hate for judge secure a pretended authority when they act in any way contrary to the wish of the ruling power if again any be convict they will believe they have be condemn on account of instruction for which you be responsible however if you sit as judge yourself you will be compel to chastise many of the peer -- and this be not favorable -- and you will certainly be think to be set some of they right in anger rather than in justice no one believe that those who have the power to use compulsion can execute judgment with justice but everybody think that out of shame they spread out a mere phantom and rough picture of government in front of the truth in order that under the legitimate name of court they may fulfill they desire this be what happen in monarchy in democracy when any one be accuse of commit a private wrong he be make defendant in a private suit before judge who be he equal : or if he be accuse for a public crime such a man have empanel a jury of he peer whoever the lot shall designate it be easier for man to bear they decision since they do not think that any verdict render be due to the power of the judge or have be wring from he as a favor -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- -8 - -rrb- then again there be many apart from any criminal some pride themselves on birth other on wealth other on something different in general not bad man who be by nature oppose to the conception of monarchy if a ruler allow they to become strong he can not live in safety and if he undertake to impose a check on they he can not do so justly what then shall he do with they how shall he treat they if you root out they family diminish they wealth humble they pride you will lose the good-will of you subject how can it be otherwise if no one be permit to be bear nobly or to grow rich honestly or to become strong brave or learn but if you allow all the separate class to grow strong you will not be able to deal with they easily if you alone be sufficient for carry on politics and war well and opportunely and need no assistant for any of they it would be a different story as the case stand however it be quite essential for you to have many helper since they must govern so large a world : and they all ought to be both brave and prudent now if you hand over the legion and the office to such man there will be danger that both you and you government will be overthrow it be not possible for a valuable man to be produce without good sense and he can not acquire any great good sense from servile practice but again if he become a man of sense he can not fail to desire liberty and to hate all master if on the other hand you entrust nothing to these man but put affair in charge of the worthless and chance comer you will very quickly incur the anger of the first class who think themselves distrust and you will very quickly fail in the greatest enterprise what good could a ignorant or low-born person accomplish what enemy would not hold he in contempt what ally would obey he who even of the soldier themselves would not disdain to be rule by such a man what evil be wont to result from such a condition i do not need to describe to you for you know they thoroughly i feel oblige to say only this that if such a assistant do nothing right he would injure you far more than the enemy : if he do anything satisfactorily he lack of education would cause he to lose he head and he would be a terror to you -lrb- -9 - -rrb- such a question do not arise in democracy the more man there be who be wealthy and brave so much the more do they vie with one another and up-build the city the latter use they and be glad unless any one of they wish to find a tyranny : he the citizen punish severely that this be so and that democracy be far superior to monarchy the experience of greece make clear as long as the people have the monarchical government they effect nothing of importance : but when they begin to live under the democratic system they become most renowned it be show also by the experience of other branch of mankind those who be still conduct they government under tyranny be always in slavery and always plot against they ruler but those who have president for a year or some longer period continue to be both free and independent yet why need we use foreign example when we have some of we own we roman ourselves after try a different social organization at first later when we have go through many bitter experience feel a desire for liberty and have secure it we attain we present eminence strong in no advantage save those that come from democracy through which the senate debate the people ratify the force under arm show zeal and the commander be fire with ambition none of these thing could be do under a tyranny for that reason indeed the ancient roman detest it so much as to impose a curse upon that form of government -lrb- -10 - -rrb- aside from these consideration if one be to speak about what be disadvantageous for you personally how could you endure the management of so many interest by day and night alike how could you hold out in you enfeebled state how could you participate in human enjoyment how could you be happy if deprive of they what could cause you real pleasure when would you be free from bite grief it be quite inevitable that the man who hold so great a empire should reflect deeply be subject to many fear enjoy very little pleasure but hear and see perform and suffer always and everywhere what be most disagreeable that be why i think both greek and some barbarian would not accept government by a king when offer to they know this beforehand take good counsel before you enter upon such a existence for it be disgraceful or rather impossible after you have once plunge into it to rise to the upper air again do not be deceive by the greatness of the authority nor the abundance of possession nor the mass of body-guard nor the throng of courtier man who have great power have great trouble : those who have large possession be oblige to spend largely : the crowd of body-guard be gather because of the crowd of conspirator : and the flatterer would be more glad to destroy than to save any one consequently in view of these fact no sensible man would desire to become supreme ruler -lrb- -11 - -rrb- if the fact that such ruler can enrich and preserve other and perform many other good deed and that by jupiter they may also outrage other and injure whomsoever they please lead any one to think that tyranny be worth strive for he be utterly mistaken i need not tell you that to live licentiously and to do evil be base and hazardous and hate of both god and man you be not that sort of man and it be not for these reason that you would choose to be sole ruler i have elect to speak now not of everything which one might accomplish who handle affair badly but of what even the very best be compel to do and endure when they adopt the system the other point -- that one may bestow abundant favor -- be worthy of zeal to be sure : yet when this disposition be indulge in private capacity it be noble August glorious and safe whereas in monarchy it be first of all not a sufficient offset to the other more disagreeable matter that any one should choose monarchy for this especially when one be to grant to other the benefit to be derive therefrom and accept himself the unpleasantness involve in the rest of the conduct of the office -lrb- -12 - -rrb- in the next place the matter be not simple as people think no one could render assistance enough to satisfy all who need help those who think they ought to receive some gift from the sovereign be practically all mankind even though no favor can at once be see to be due they every one naturally have he own approbation and wish to enjoy some benefit from he who be able to give but the present which can be give they -- i mean honor and office and sometimes money -- can be count quite easily as compare with so great a multitude this be so more hatred would fall to the monarch 's lot from those who fail to get what they want than friendship from such as obtain they desire the latter take what they regard as due to they and think there be no particular reason for be very thankful to the one who give it since they be get no more than they expect moreover they actually shrink from such behavior for fear they may appear in the light of person undeserve of generous treatment the other who be disappointed of they hope be grieve for two cause first they feel that they be rob of what belong to they for by nature all person think that everything which they desire be they own : second they feel as if they be find themselves guilty of some wrong if they show resignation at not obtain what they expect the man who give such great gift rightly of course investigate before all else each person 's worth : some he honor other he neglect as a result then of he judgment some be fill with pride and other with vexation by they own consciousness of its correctness if any one be to wish to guard against this outcome and distribute he present without system he would fail utterly the base be honor contrary to they desert would become worse for they would decide either that they be approve as be good or if not so that they be court as dangerous person : the excellent on attain no higher place than they but hold merely in equal honor with the base would be more indignant at they reduction to the latter 's level than the other would rejoice to be deem valuable accordingly they would give up the practice of better principle and strive to emulate less worthy man thus even as a result of the very honor those who bestow they would reap no benefit and those who receive they would become worse than before so that this consideration which would please some person most in the monarchical constitution have be prove to be a most difficult problem for you to deal with -lrb- -13 - -rrb- reflect on these fact and the rest which i mention a little earlier be prudent while you may and restore to the people the arm the province the office and the fund if you do it at once and voluntarily you will be the most famous of man and the most secure but if you wait for some force to be apply perhaps you might suffer some disaster together with ill repute here be evidence marius sullum metellus and pompey at first when they get control of affair refuse to become prince and by this attitude escape harm cinna however and strabo -lrb- 2 -rrb- the second marius sertorius and pompey himself at a later date through they desire for sovereignty perish miserably it be hard for this city which have be under a democracy for so many year and rule so many human being to be willing to be a slave to any one you have hear that the people banish camillus when he use white horse for he triumph : you have hear that they overthrow scipio after condemn he for some fraudulent procedure : you remember how they behave toward you father because they have some suspicion that he want monarchy yet there have never be any better man than these moreover i do not advise you merely to relinquish dominion but to accomplish beforehand all that be advantageous for the public and by decree and law to settle definitely whatever business need attention just as sullum do for even if some of he ordinance be subsequently overthrow yet the majority of they and the more important still hold they ground do not say that even then some will indulge in factional quarrel or i may be tempt to say again that all the more the roman would not submit to a single ruler if we be to review all the calamity that might befall a nation it would be most unreasonable for we to fear dissension which be the outgrowth of democracy rather then the tyranny which spring from monarchy regard the terrible nature of the latter i have not even undertake to say a word it have be my wish not merely to inveigh against a proposition so capable of censure but to show you this -- that it be naturally such a régime that not even the most excellent man -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- -14 - -rrb- they can not easily persuade by frank argument man who possess less power or succeed in they enterprise because they subject be not in accord with they hence if you have any care at all of you country for whom you have fight so many war for whom you would gladly surrender you life attune she to greater moderation and order she affair with that in view for the privilege of do and save precisely what one please become in the case of sensible people if you examine it a cause of prosperity to all : but in the case of the foolish a cause of disaster therefore he who confer authority upon such man be hold out a sword to a child and a madman but he who give it to the prudent besides perform other service preserve the object of he liberality themselves though they may be unwilling therefore i ask you not to be deceive by regard fine-sounding name but to look forward to the result that spring from they and so to put a end to the insolence of the populace and to impose the management of public affair upon yourself and the most excellent of the remainder of the community then the most prudent may deliberate those most qualify for general become commander and the strongest and most needy man serve as soldier and draw pay in this way all zealously discharge the duty appertain to they office and pay without hesitation the debt they owe one another they will not be aware of they inferiority and lack of certain advantage and will secure the real democracy and a safe sort of freedom the boast freedom of the mob prove to be the most bitter servitude of the best element and bring a common destruction upon both the other which i advocate honor responsible man everywhere and bestow equal advantage upon all so far as they be worthy : thus it render prosperous all alike who possess it -lrb- -15 - -rrb- do not think that i be advise you to enslave the people and the senate and then play the tyrant this plan i should never dare to suggest nor you to execute it would notwithstanding be well and useful both for you and for the city that you should yourself establish all proper law with the approval of the best man without any oppose talk or resistance on the part of the mass that you and you counselor should arrange the detail of war accord to you unite wish while all the rest straightway obey order that the choice of official should be in the power of the cabinet to which you belong and that the same man should also determine honor and penalty then whatever please you after consult the peer will be immediately a law and war against enemy may be wage with secrecy and at a opportune time those to whom a trust be commit will be appoint because of excellence and not by lot and strife for office the good will be honor without jealousy and the bad punish without opposition thus what be do would be accomplish in the best way not refer to the public nor talk over openly not commit to packed committee nor endanger by rivalry we should reap the benefit of the blessing that belong to we with enjoyment -lrb- 4 -rrb- not enter upon dangerous war nor impious civil dispute these two drawback be find in every democracy : the more powerful desire first place and hire the weaker man turn everything continually upside down they have be most frequent in we epoch and there be no other way save the one i propose that will put a stop to they the proof of my word be that we have be war abroad and fight among ourselves for a inconceivably long time : the cause be the multitude of man and the magnitude of the interest at stake the man be of all sort in respect to both race and nature and have the most diversified temper and desire the interest have become so vast that it be very difficult to attempt to administer they -lrb- -16 - -rrb- witness to the truth of my word be bear by we past while we be but few we have no important quarrel with we neighbor get along well with we government and subjugate almost all of italy but ever since we spread beyond the peninsula and cross to many foreign land and island fill the whole sea and the whole earth with we name and power nothing good have be we lot in the first place we dispute in clique at home and within we wall and later we export this plague to the camp therefore we city like a great merchantman full of a crowd of every race bear without a pilot these many year through rough water roll and shoot hither and thither because it be without ballast do not then allow she to be longer expose to the tempest for you see that she be waterlogged and do not let she split upon a reef -lrb- 5 -rrb- for she timber be rotten and will not be able to hold out much longer but since the god have take pity on this land and have set you up as she arbiter and chief do not betray you country through you she have now revive a little : if you be faithful she may live with safety for age to come -lrb- -17 - -rrb- that i do right to urge you to be sole ruler of the people i think you have long ere this be persuade if so then be ready and eager to assume the leadership of the state or rather do not let it slip for we be not deliberate about take something but about not lose it and about run hazard in addition who will spare you if you commit matter to the people as they be and to some other man see that there be great number whom you have injure all of whom or nearly all will lay claim to the sovereignty no one of they will fail to wish to punish you for what you have do or will care to have you survive as a rival there be evidence of this in the case of pompey who when he withdraw from he supremacy become the victim of scorn and of plot : he find himself unable to win back he place and so perish also cæsar you father who do this very same thing be slay for he trouble marius and sullum would certainly have endure a like fate have they not die too soon indeed some say that sullum anticipate this very end by make away with himself many of the provision of he constitution at any rate begin to be abolish while he be still alive you too must expect to find that many lepidus sertorius brutus cassius will arise against you -lrb- -18 - -rrb- see these fact and reflect on the other interest involve do not abandon yourself and you country out of fear that you may seem to some to be pursue the office of set purpose first of all even if any one do suspect it the desire be not one repugnant to human nature and the danger from it be a noble danger second be any one unaware of the necessity under which you be lead to take this action hence if there be any blame attach to it one might most justly censure you father 's slayer therefor for if they have not murder he in so unjust and pitiable a fashion you would not have take up arm would not have gather you legion would not have make a compact with antony and lepidus and would not have take measure against those very man that you be right and be justify in do all this no one be unaware if any slight error have be commit at least we can not safely make any further change therefore for we own sake and for that of the city let we obey fortune who give you the supremacy let we be very thankful to she that she have not simply fill we with civil woe but have put the reorganization of the government in you hand by pay due reverence to she you may show all mankind that whereas other work disturbance and injury you be a upright man do not i beg you fear the magnitude of the empire the greater its extent the more be the preservative influence it possess also to guard anything be a long way easier than to acquire it toil and danger be need to win over what belong to other but a little prudence suffice to retain what be already yours moreover do not be afraid that you will not live quite safely in the midst of it and enjoy all the blessing extant among man if you be willing to arrange all the detail as i shall advise you and do not think that i be make my appeal depart from the subject in hand if i shall speak at some length about the project i shall not do this merely to hear myself talk but to the end that you may be positively assure that it be both possible and easy for a man of sense at least to govern well and without danger -lrb- -19 - -rrb- i maintain therefore first of all that you ought to pick out you friend in the senatorial body and then subject it to a sift process because some who be not fit have become senator on account of civil dispute : such of they as possess any excellence you ought to retain but the rest you should erase from the roll do not however get rid of any man of worth because of poverty but give he the money that he need in the place of those who have be drop introduce the noblest the best the richest man obtainable select they not only from italy but from the ally and subject nation in this way you will not be employ many assistant and you will insure a correct attitude on the part of the chief man from all the province these district have no renowned leader will not be dispose to rebel and they prominent man will entertain affection for you because they have be make sharer in you empire take precisely these same measure in the case of the knight by enrol in the equestrian class such as hold second place everywhere in birth excellence and wealth register as many in both class as may please you not trouble at all about they number the more man of repute you have as you associate the more easily will you yourself settle everything in case of need and persuade you subject that you be treat they not as slave nor in any way as inferior to we but be share with they besides all the other blessing that belong to we the chief magistracy also that so they may be devote to it as they own possession i be so far from assume this to be a mistaken policy that i say they ought all to be give a share in the government thus have a equal allotment in it they might be faithful ally of ours believe that they inhabit one single city own in common by all of we and this _ really _ a city and regard field and village as they individual property but about this and what ought to be do so as not to grant they absolutely everything we shall reflect in greater detail at another time -lrb- -20 - -rrb- it be proper to put man on the roll of the knight at eighteen year of age for at that period of life physical condition be at its best and suitability of temperament can be discern but for the senate they should wait till they be twenty-five year old be it not disgraceful and hazardous to entrust public business to man younger than this when we will commit none of we private affair to any one before he have reach such a age after they have serve as quæstors and ædiles or tribune let they be prætors when they have attain they thirtieth birthday these office and that of consul be the only one at home which i maintain you ought to recognize and that be for the sake of remembrance of ancestral custom and in order not to seem to be change the constitution altogether do you however yourself choose all who be to hold they and not put any of these office longer in charge of the rabble or the populace -- for they will surely quarrel -- nor in charge of the senate for its member will contend for the prize moreover do not keep up the ancient power of these position for fear history may repeat itself but preserve the honor attach while abate the influence to such a extent as will enable you to deprive each place of none of its esteem but to forestall any desire of insubordination this can be do if you require the incumbent to stay in town and do not permit any of they to handle arm either during they period of office or immediately afterward but only after the lapse of some time as much as you think sufficient in each instance in this way none of they will rebel because they become to a extent by they title master of army and they irritation will be assuage by they faring as private citizen for a time let these magistrate conduct such of the festival as would naturally belong to they office and let they all individually try case save those of homicide during they tenure of office in rome court should also be make up of the senator and knight but the final appeal should be to the aforesaid official -lrb- -21 - -rrb- let a præfectus urbus be appoint from the rank of the prominent man and from such as have previously pass through the necessary office he duty should not be to govern when the consul be somewhere out of town but to exercise at all time a general supervision of the city 's interest and to decide the case refer to he by all the other magistrate i mention both those demand final decision and such as may be appeal together with any that involve the death penalty and he must have authority in all of they that concern man both in the city -lrb- except such as i shall name -rrb- and those dwelling outside to the distance of seven hundred and fifty stade still another magistrate ought to be choose himself also from a similar class to investigate and watch the matter of family property and moral of senator and knight alike of man and of the child and wife belong to they -lrb- 6 -rrb- he should also set right such behavior as properly entail no punishment yet if neglect become the cause of many great evil the more important detail he must report to you this duty ought to be assign to some senator and to the most distinguished one after the præfectus urbus rather than to one of the knight he would naturally receive he name from you authority as censor -lrb- for you must certainly be the dictator of the census -rrb- so that he might be call sub-censor -lrb- 7 -rrb- -- let these two hold office for life unless either of they deteriorate in any way or become sick or superannuated by reason of the permanence of they position they would do nothing dangerous for one would be entirely unarmed and the other would have but a few soldier and be act for the most part under you eye by reason of they rank they would shrink from come into collision with any one and would be afraid to do any act of violence for they would foresee they retirement to ordinary citizenship and the supremacy of other in they stead let they also draw a certain salary to compensate they for the time consume and to increase they reputation this be the opinion i have to give you in regard to these official let those who have be prætors hold some office among the subject nation before they have be prætors i do not think they should have this privilege let those who have not yet be prætors serve for one or two term as lieutenant to such person as you may have designate then under these condition let they be consul if they continue to govern rightly and after that let they take the greater position of command -lrb- -22 - -rrb- the follow be the way i advise you to arrange it divide up all of italy which be over seven hundred and fifty stade from the city and all the rest of the territory which own we sway both on the continent and in the island -- divide it up everywhere accord to race and nation and pursue the same course with as many city as be important enough to be rule by one man with full power then establish soldier and a governor in each one and send out one of the ex-consul to take charge of all and two of the ex-prætors one of the latter fresh from the city should have the care of private business and the supply of provision : the other should be one of those who have have this training who will attend to the public interest of the city and will govern the soldier except in case that concern disenfranchisement or death these must be refer only to the ex-consul who be governor except in regard to the centurion who be on the list and to the foremost private individual in every place do not allow any other person than yourself to punish either of these class so that they may never be impel by fear of any one else to take any action against you as for my proposition that the second of the ex-prætors should be put in charge of the soldier it be subject to the follow limitation if only a few be in service in foreign fort or in one native post it be well enough for this to be so but if two citizen legion be winter in the same province -lrb- and more than this number i should not advise you to trust to one commander -rrb- it will be necessary for the two ex-prætors to superintend they each have charge of one besides manage the remain political and private interest therefore let the ex-consul -lrb- 8 -rrb- these matter and likewise on the case both those subject to appeal and those already refer which be send up to he from -lrb- 9 -rrb- he prætors and do not be surprise that i recommend to you to divide italy also into such section it be large and populous and so be incapable of be well manage by the governor at the capital the governor of any district ought to be always present and no duty should be lay upon we city magistrate -lrb- 10 -rrb- that be impossible of fulfillment -lrb- -23 - -rrb- let all these man to whom affair outside the city be commit receive pay the greater one more the inferior one less those of medium importance a medium amount they can not in a foreign land live on they own resource nor as now stand a unlimited and uncalculated expense let they govern not less than three year -lrb- unless any one of they commit a crime -rrb- nor more than five these limit be because annual and short-time appointment after teach person what they need to know send they back again before they can display any of they knowledge : and on the other hand longer and more lasting position fill many with conceit and incline they to rebellion hence i think that the greater post of authority ought not to be give to person consecutively without interval for it make no difference whether a man be governor in the same province or in several in succession if he hold office longer than be proper appointee improve when a period of time be allow to elapse and they return home and live as ordinary citizen the senator accordingly i affirm ought to discharge these duty and in the way describe -lrb- -24 - -rrb- of the knight the two best should command the body-guard which protect you to entrust it to one man be hazardous and to several be sure to breed turmoil let these prefect therefore be two in number in order that if one of they suffer any bodily harm you may still not lack a person to guard you : and let they be appoint from those who have be on many campaign and have be active also in many other capacity let they have command both of the pretorian and of all the remain soldier in italy with such absolute power that they may put to death such of they as do wrong except in the case of the centurion and any other who have be assign to member of the senate hold office these should be try by the senatorial magistrate themselves in order that the latter may have authority both to honor and to chastise they dependent and so be able to count on they unhesitating support over all the other soldier in italy those prefect should have dominion -lrb- aid of course by lieutenant -rrb- and further over the cæsarians both such as wait upon you and all the rest that be of any value these duty will be both fitting and sufficient for they to discharge -lrb- 11 -rrb- they should not have more labor lay upon they than they will be able to dispose of effectively that they may not be weigh down by the press of work or find it impossible to see to everything these man ought to hold office for life like the præfectus urbus and the sub-censor let some one else be appoint night watchman and still another commissioner of grain and of the other market produce both of these from the foremost knight after those mention and appoint to hold they post for a definite time like the magistrate elect from the senatorial class -lrb- -25 - -rrb- the disposition of the fund also -- of both the people and the empire i mean whether in rome or in the rest of italy or outside -- should be entirely in the hand of the knight these treasurer also as well as all of the same class who have the management of anything should draw pay some more and some less with reference to the dignity and magnitude of they employment the reason be that it be not possible for they since they be poorer than the senator to spend they own means while engage in no business in rome and then again it be neither possible nor advantageous for you that the same man should be make master of both the troops and the finances furthermore it be well that all the business of the empire should be transact through a number of agent in order that many may receive the benefit of it and become experienced in affair in this way you subject reap a multiform enjoyment from the public treasure will be better disposed toward you and you will have a abundant supply of the best man on each occasion for all necessary line of work one single knight with as many subordinate -lrb- draw from the knight and from you freedman -rrb- as the need of the case demand be sufficient for every separate form of business in the city and for each province outside you need to have these assistant along with they in order that you service may contain a prize of excellence and that you may not lack person from whom you may learn the truth even contrary to the wish of they superior in case there be anything irregular happen if any one of the knight after pass through many form of service distinguish himself enough to become a senator he age ought not to hinder he at all from be enrol in the senate let some of those even be register who have hold the post of company leader in citizen force unless it be one who have serve in the rank and file for it be both a shame and a reproach to have on the list of the senate any of these person who have carry loaded pannier and charcoal basket but in the case of such as be originally centurion there be nothing to prevent the most distinguish of they from be advance to a better class -lrb- -26 - -rrb- with regard to the senator and the knight this be my advice to you and by jupiter i have this to say further while they be still child they should attend school and when they come out of childhood into youth they should turn they mind to horse and arm and have pay public teacher in each of these two department in this way from very boyhood they will both learn and practice all that they must themselves do on become man and so they will prove far more serviceable to you for every work the best ruler who be of any value must not only himself perform all he required task but also look forward to see how the rest shall become also as excellent as possible and this name can be yours not if you allow they to do whatever they please and then censure those who err but if before any mistake occur you teach they everything which when practice will render they more useful both to themselves and to you and afford nobody any excuse whatever either wealth or birth or anything else that accompany excellence for affect indolence or effeminacy or any other behavior that be not genuine many person fear that on account of some such possession they may incur jealousy or danger do much that be unworthy of themselves expect by such behavior to live in greater security as a consequence they commiserate themselves believe themselves wrong in this very particular that they be not allow to appear to live aright they ruler also suffer a loss because he be deprive of the service of good man and suffer ill repute for the censure impose upon they therefore never permit this to be do and have no fear that any one bring up and educate as i propose will ever adopt a rebellious policy quite the reverse it be only the ignorant and licentious that you need suspect such person be easily influence to behave most disgracefully and abominably in absolutely every way first toward they own self and next toward other people those however who have be well bring up and educate be purpose not to wrong any one and least of all he who care for they rearing and education if any one accordingly show himself wicked and ungrateful do not entrust he with any such position as will enable he to effect any harm : if even so he rebel let he be try and punish do not be afraid that any one will blame you for this if you carry out all my injunction for in take vengeance on the wrongdoer you will be guilty of no sin any more than the physician who burn and cut all will pronounce the man justly treat because after partaking of the same rearing and education as the rest he plot against you -- this be the course of action i advise in the case of the senator and knight -lrb- -27 - -rrb- a standing army should be support draw from the citizen the subject nation and the ally in one case more in another less province by province as the necessity of the case demand and they ought to be always under arm and make a practice of warfare continually they must have secure winter-quarter at the most opportune point and serve for a definite time so that a certain period of active life may remain for they before old age for separate so far as we be from the frontier of the empire with enemy live near we on every side we should otherwise no longer be able to count on auxiliary in the case of emergency again if we allow all those of military age to have arm and to practice warlike pursuit quarrel and civil war will always be arise among they however if we prevent they from do this and then need they assistance at all in battle we shall always have to face danger with inexperienced and untrained soldier at we back for this reason i submit the proposition that most of they live without arm and away from fort but that the hardiest and those most in need of a livelihood be register and keep in practice they themselves will fight better by devote they leisure to this single business and the rest will the more easily farm manage ship and attend to the other pursuit of peace if they be not force to be call out for service but have other to stand as they guardian the most active and vigorous element that be which be oftenest oblige to live by robbery will be support without harm other and all the rest of the population will lead a life free from danger -lrb- -28 - -rrb- from what source then will the money come for these warrior and for the other expense that will be find necessary i shall make this point clear with only the short preliminary statement that even be we under a democracy we should in any case need money we can not survive without soldier and without pay none of they will serve hence let we not feel downheart in the belief that the compulsory collection of money appertain only to monarchy and let we not turn away from the system for that reason but conduct we deliberation with a full knowledge of the fact that in any case it be necessary for we to obtain fund whatsoever form of government we may adopt consequently i maintain that you should first of all sell the goods which be in the public treasury -- and i notice that these have become numerous on account of the war -- except a few which be exceedingly useful and necessary to you : and you should loan all this money at some moderate rate of interest in this way the land will be work be deliver to man who will cultivate it themselves and the latter will obtain a starting-point and so grow more prosperous while the treasury will have a sufficient and perpetual revenue this amount should be compute together with all the rest of the revenue that can be derive from the mine and with certainty from any other source and after that we ought to reckon on not only the military service but everything else which contribute to the successful life of a city and further how much it will be necessary to lay out in campaign at short notice and other critical occurrence which be wont to take place then to make up the deficiency in income we ought to levy upon absolutely all instrument which produce any profit for the man who possess they and we should exact tax from all whom we rule it be both just and proper that no one of they should be exempt from taxation -- individual or people -- because they be destine to enjoy the benefit of the tax in common with the rest we should set over they tax-collector in every case to manage the business so that they may levy from all source of revenue everything that fall due during they term of management the follow plan will render it easier for the officer to gather the tax and will be of no little service to those who contribute they i mean that they will bring in whatever they owe in a appoint order and little by little instead of remain idle a short time and then have the entire sum demand of they in one payment -lrb- -29 - -rrb- i be not unaware that some of the income and tax establish will be dislike but i know this too -- that if the people secure immunity from any further abuse and believe in reality that they will be contribute all of this for they own safety and for reap subsidiary benefit in abundance and that most of it will be obtain by no other than man of they own district some by govern other by manage other by army service they will be very grateful to you give as they do a small portion of large possession the profit of which they enjoy without oppression especially will this be true if they see that you live temperately and spend nothing foolishly who if he see you very economical of you own means and very lavish of the public fund would not willingly contribute and deem you possession of wealth to constitute he safety and prosperity by these mean a very large amount of money would be on hand -lrb- -30 - -rrb- the rest i urge you to arrange in the following way adorn this city in the most expensive manner possible and add brilliance by every form of festival it be fitting that we who rule many people should surpass all in everything and such spectacles tend in a way to promote respect on the part of we ally and alarm on the part of enemy the affair of other nation you should order in this fashion first let the various tribe have no power in any matter nor meet in assembly at all they would decide nothing good and would always be create more or less turmoil hence i say that even we own populace ought not to gather at court or for election or for any other such meeting where any business be to be transact next they should not indulge in number of house of great size and beyond what be necessary and they should not expend money upon many and all kind of contest : so they will neither be wear out by vain zeal nor become hostile through unreasonable rivalry they ought however to have certain festival and spectacles -lrb- apart from the horse-race hold among we -rrb- but not to such a extent that the treasury or private estate will be injure or any stranger be compel to spend anything whatever in they midst or food for a lifetime be furnish to all who have merely win in some contest it be unreasonable that the well-to-do should submit to compulsory expenditure outside they own country and for the athlete the prize for each event be sufficient this ruling do not apply to any one of they who might come out victor in the olympian or pythian game or some contest here at rome -lrb- 12 -rrb- such be the only person who ought to be feed and then the city will not exhaust themselves without avail nor anybody practice save those who have a chance of win since one can follow some other pursuit that be more advantageous both to one 's self and to one 's country this be my decision about these matter -- now to the horse-race which be hold without gymnastic contest i think that no other city but ours should be allow to hold they so that vast sum of money may not be dissipate recklessly nor man go miserably frantic -- and most of all that the soldier may have a plentiful supply of the best horse this therefore i would forbid altogether that those race should take place anywhere else than here the other amusement i have determine to moderate so that all organization should make the enjoyment of entertainment for eye and ear inexpensive and man thereby live more temperately and free from discontent let none of the foreigner employ they own coinage or weight or measure but let they all use ours and they should send no embassy to you unless it involve a point for decision let they instead present to they governor whatever they please and through he forward to you all such request of theirs as he may approve in this way they will neither spend anything nor effect they object by crooked practice but receive they answer at first hand without any expenditure or intrigue -lrb- -31 - -rrb- moreover in respect to other matter you would seem to be order thing in the best way if you should in the first place introduce before the senate the embassy which come from the enemy and from those under truce both king and people for it be awe-inspiring and impressive to let the senate appear to be master of all situation and to exhibit many adversary prepare for petitioner who be guilty of double deal next have all the law enact by the senator and do not impose a single one upon all the people alike except the decree of that body in this way the dignity of the empire would be the more confirm and the decision make in accordance with the law would prove indisputable and evident to all alike thirdly it would be well in case the senator who be serve in the city they child or they wife be ever charge with any serious crime so that a person convict would receive a penalty of disenfranchisement or exile or even death that you should set the situation before the senate without any previous condemnation and commit to that body the entire decision at first hand regard it thus those guilty of any crime would be try before all they peer and punish without any ill-feeling against you the rest see this would improve in character for fear of be themselves publicly apprehend i be speak here about those offence regard which law be establish and judgment be render accord to the law as for talk that some one have abuse you or speak in a unfitting way about you do not listen to any one who bring such a accusation nor investigate it it be disgraceful to believe that any one have wantonly insult you who be do no wrong and benefit all only those who rule badly will credit these report because of they own conscience they surmise that the matter have be state truthfully it be a shame to be angry at complaint for which if true one have better not have be responsible and about which if false one ought not to pretend to care many in time past by angry behavior have cause more thing and worse to be say against they this be my opinion about those accuse of utter some insult you personality should be too strong and too lofty to be assail by any insolence and you should never allow yourself to think nor lead other into think that any person can be indecent toward you thus they will think of you as of the god that you be sacrosanct if any one should be accuse of plot against you -lrb- such a thing might happen -rrb- do not yourself sit as judge on a single detail of the case nor reach any decision in advance -- for it be absurd that the same man should be make both accuser and judge -- but take he to the senate and make he plead he defense if he be convict punish he though moderate the sentence so far as be feasible in order that belief in he guilt may be foster it be very difficult to make most man believe that any unarmed person will plot against he who be armed and the only way you could gain credence would be by punish he not in anger nor overwhelmingly if it be possible -- this be aside from the case of one who have a army and should revolt directly against you it be not fitting that such a one be try but that he be chastise as a enemy in this way refer to the senate these matter and -lrb- -32 - -rrb- most of the highly important affair that concern the commonwealth public interest you must administer publicly it be also a inbred trait of human nature for individual to delight in mark of esteem from a superior which seem to raise one to equality with he and to approve everything which the superior have determine after consult they as if it be they own proposal and to cherish it as if it be they own choice consequently i affirm that such business ought to be bring before the senate -- in regard to most case all those senator present ought equally to state they opinion : but when one of they number be accuse not all of they should do so unless it be some one who be not yet a senator or be not yet in the rank of the ex-quæstors that be be try and indeed it be absurd that one who have not yet be a tribune or a ædile should cast a vote against such as have already fill these office or by jupiter that any one of the latter should vote against the ex-prætors or they against the ex-consul let the last name have authority to render a decision in all case but the rest only in the case of they peer and they subordinate -lrb- -33 - -rrb- you yourself must try in person the refer and the appeal case which come to you from the higher official from the procurator from the præfectus urbus from the sub-censor and the prefect both the commissioner of grain -lrb- 13 -rrb- and the night-watch -lrb- 14 -rrb- no single one of they should have such absolute power of decision and such independence that a case can not be appeal from he you should be the judge therefore in these instance and also when knight be concerned and properly enrol centurion and the foremost private citizen if the trial involve death or disenfranchisement let these be you business alone and for the reason mention let no one else on he own responsibility render a decision in they you should always have associate with you for discussion the most honor of the senator and of the knight and further certain other from the rank of the ex-consul and ex-prætors some at one time and some at another in this association you will become more accurately acquaint with they character beforehand and so be able to put they to the right kind of employment and they by come in contact with you habit and wish will have they in mind on go out to govern the province do not however openly ask they opinion when a rather careful consideration be require for fear that they be outside they accustomed sphere may hesitate to speak freely but let they record they view on tablet to these you alone should have access that they may become know to no one else and then order the write to be immediately erase in this way you may best get at each man 's exact opinion when they believe that it can not be identify among all the rest moreover for the lawsuit letter and decree of the city for the consideration of the demand of individual and everything else which belong to the administration of the empire you must have supporter and assistant from among the knight everything will move along more easily in this way and you will neither err through want of fairness nor become exhaust by do everything yourself grant every one who wish to make any suggestion whatever to you the right of speak freely and fearlessly if you approve what he say it will be of great service : and if you be not persuade it will do no harm those who obtain you favorable judgment you should both praise and honor since by they device you will receive glory : and those who fail of it you should never dishonor or censure it be proper to look at they intention and not to find fault because they plan be unavailable guard against this same mistake when war be concerned be not enrage at any one for involuntary misfortune nor jealous of he good fortune to the end that all may zealously and gladly run risk for you confident that if they make a slip they will not be punish nor if successful become the object of intrigue there be many who through fear of jealousy on the part of those in power have choose to meet reverse rather than to effect anything as a result they retain they safety but the loss fall upon they own head you who be sure to reap the principal benefit from both class alike -- the inferior and the superior -- ought never to choose to become nominally jealous of other but really of yourself -lrb- -34 - -rrb- whatever you wish you subject to think and do _ you _ must say and do you can better educate they in this way than if you should desire to terrify they by the severity of the law the former course inspire emulation the latter fear and any one can more easily imitate superior conduct when he actually see it in some life than he can guard against low behavior which he merely hear to be prohibit by edict act in every way yourself with circumspection not condone any mistake of you own for be well assure that all will straightway learn everything you say and do you will live as it be in a kind of theater whose audience be the whole world : and it will not be possible for you to escape detection if you commit the very smallest error no act of yours will ever be in private but all of they will be perform in the midst of many person and all the remainder of mankind somehow take the greatest delight in be officious with respect to what be do by they ruler hence if they once ascertain that you be urge they to one course and follow a different one yourself they will not fear you threat but will imitate you deed have a eye to the life of other but do not carry you investigation unpleasantly close decide case which be bring before you by outsider but do not pretend to notice conduct that receive no outspoken censure from any one except irregularity not consonant with public interest the latter ought to be properly rebuke even if no one have aught to say against they other private failing you ought to know in order to avoid make a mistake some day by employ a assistant unsuitable for a particular duty : do not however take individual to task they nature impel many person to commit various violation of the law if you make a unsparing campaign against they you might leave scarcely one man unpunished but if you humanely mingle consideration with the strict command of the law you may perhaps bring they to they sens for the law though necessarily severe in its punishment can not always conquer nature some man if permit to think they be unobserved or if moderately admonish improve some through shame at be discover and other through fear of failure the next time whereas when they be openly denounce and throw compunction to the wind or where they be chastise beyond measure they overturn and trample under foot all law and order and obey slavishly the impulse of they nature therefore it be not easy to discipline all of they nor be it fitting to allow some of they to continue publicly they outrageous conduct this be the way i advise you to treat people 's offence except the very desperate case : and you should honor even beyond the desert of the deed whatever they do rightly in this way you can best make they refrain from baser conduct by kindliness and cause they to aim at what be better by liberality have no dread that either money or other means of reward those who do well will ever fail you i think those deserving of good treatment will prove far fewer than the reward since you be lord of so much land and sea and fear not that any who be benefit will commit some act of ingratitude nothing so captivate and conciliate any one be he foreigner or be he foe as freedom from wrong and likewise kindly treatment -lrb- -35 - -rrb- this be the attitude which i urge you to assume toward other for you own part allow no extraordinary or overweening distinction to be give you through word or deed by the senate or by anybody else to other honor which you confer lend adornment but to you own self nothing can be give that be greater than what you already have and it would arouse no little suspicion of failure in straightforwardness none of the ordinary people willingly approve of have any such distinction vote to the man in power as he receive everything of the kind from himself he not only obtain no praise for it but become a laughing-stock instead any additional brilliance then you must create for yourself by you good deed never permit gold or silver image of yourself to be make they be not only costly but they give rise to plot and last but a brief time : you must build in the very heart of man other out of benefit confer which shall be both unalloyed and undying again do not ever allow a temple to be raise to yourself large amount of money be spend uselessly on such object which have better be lay out upon necessary improvement great wealth be gather not so much by acquire a great deal as by not spend a great deal nor do a temple contribute anything to any one 's glory excellence raise many man to the level of the god but nobody ever yet be make a god by show of hand hence if you be upright and rule well the whole earth will be you precinct all city you temple all mankind you statue in they thought you will ever be enshrine and surround by good repute those who administer they power in any other way be not only not magnify by site and edifice of worship though these be the choicest in all the city but erect for themselves therein mute detractor which become trophy of they baseness memorial of they injustice and the longer these last the more steadfastly do the ill-repute of such sovereign abide -lrb- -36 - -rrb- therefore if you desire to become in very truth immortal act in this way and further reverence the divine power yourself everywhere in every way follow we father ' belief and compel other to honor it those who introduce strange idea about it you should both hate and punish not only for the sake of the god -lrb- because if a man despise they he will esteem naught else sacred -rrb- but because such person by bring in new divinity persuade many to adopt foreign principle of law as a result conspiracy faction and club arise which be far from desirable under a monarchy accordingly do not grant any atheist or charlatan the right to be at large the art of soothsaying be a necessary one and you should by all means appoint some man to be diviner and augur to whom people can resort who desire to consult they on any matter but there ought to be no worker of magic at all such man tell partly truth but mostly lie and frequently inspire many of they follower to rebel the same thing be true of many who pretend to be philosopher hence i urge you to be on you guard against they do not because you have come in contact with such thoroughly admirable man as areus and athenodorus think that all the rest who say they be philosopher be like they some use this profession as a screen to work untold harm to both populace and individual -lrb- -37 - -rrb- you spirit then because you have no desire for anything more than you possess ought to be most peaceful whereas you equipment should be most warlike in order that no one ordinarily may either wish or try to harm you but if he should that he may be punish easily and instantly for these and other reason it be requisite for some person to keep they ear and eye open to everything appertaining to you position of authority in order that you may not fail to notice anything which need guard against or set right remember however that you must not trust merely to all they say but investigate they word carefully there be many who some through hatred of certain person other out of desire for what they possess or as a favor to some one or because they ask money and do not receive it oppress other under the pretext that the latter be rebellious or be guilty of harbor some design or utter some statement against the supreme ruler therefore it be not right to pay immediate or ready attention to they but to enquire into absolutely everything if you be slow in believe anybody you will suffer no great harm but if you be hasty you may make a mistake which can not easily be repair now it be both right and necessary for you to honor the excellent both among the freedman and among the rest of you associate this will afford you great renown and security they must however not have any extraordinary power but all carefully moderate they conduct that so you may not be ill speak of through they for everything they do whether well or ill will be accredit to you and the estimate of yourself to be make by all man will depend upon what you permit these person to do do not then allow the influential either to make unjust gain or to concern themselves with blackmail : and let no one be complain of for ` have influence ' even if he be otherwise irreproachable defend the mass vigorously when they be wrong and do not attend too easily to accusation against they examine every deed on its merit not be suspicious of every one who be prominent nor believe every one who be lower in the social scale those who be active and be the author of any useful device you must honor but the idle or such as busy themselves with petty foolishness you must hate thus you subject will be incline to the former conduct because of the benefit attach and will refrain from the latter on account of the penalty and will become better as individual and more serviceable for you employment in the public service it be a excellent achievement also to render private dispute as few as possible and they settlement as rapid as may be but it be best of all to cut short the impetuosity of community and if under guise of some appeal to you sovereignty and safety and good fortune they undertake to use force upon anybody or to undertake exploit or expenditure that be beyond they power not to permit it you should abolish altogether they enmity and rivalry among themselves and not authorize they to create any empty title or anything else which will breed difference between they all will readily obey you both in this and in every other matter private and public if you never permit any one to transgress this rule non-enforcement of law make null and void even wisely frame precept consequently you should not allow person to ask for what you be not accustom to give try to compel they to avoid diligently this very practice of petition for something prohibit this be what i have to say on that subject -lrb- -38 - -rrb- i advise you never to make use of you authority against all the citizen at once nor to deem it in any way curtail if you do not do absolutely everything that be within you power but in proportion as you be able to carry out all you wish you must be anxious to wish only what be proper make always a self-examination to see whether what you be do be right or not what conduct will cause people to love you and what not in order that you may perform the one set of act and avoid the other do not admit the thought that you will sufficiently escape the reputation of act contrary to this rule if only you hear no one censure you and do not look for any one to be so mad as to reproach you openly for anything no one would do this not even if he should be violently wrong quite the reverse -- many be compel in public to praise they oppressor and while engage in opposition not to manifest they wrath the ruler must infer the disposition of people not from what they say but from the way it be natural for they to feel -lrb- -39 - -rrb- this and a similar policy be the one i wish you to pursue i pass over many matter because it be not feasible to speak of they all at one time and within present limit one suggestion therefore i will make to sum up both previous remark and whatever be lack if you yourself by you own motion do whatever you would wish some one else who rule you to do you will make no mistake and will be always successful and consequently you life will be most pleasant and free from danger how can all fail to regard you and to love you as father and preserver when they see you be orderly lead a good life good at warfare but a man of peace : when you be not wanton do not defraud : when you meet they on a footing of equality and do not yourself grow rich while demand money from other : be not yourself give to luxury while impose hardship upon other : be not yourself unbridled while reprove other : when instead you life in every way without exception be precisely like theirs be of good cheer for you have in you own hand a great safeguard by never wrong another and believe I when i tell you that you will never be the object of hatred or plot since this be so you must quite inevitably lead a pleasant life what be pleasanter what be more conducive to prosperity than to enjoy in a rightful way all the blessing among man and to have the power of grant they to other -lrb- -40 - -rrb- with this in mind together with all the rest that i have tell you heed my advice and let not that fortune slip which have choose you out of all and set you at the head of all if you would choose the substance of monarch but fear the name of ` kingdom ' as accursed then refrain from take possession of the latter and be satisfy to employ merely the title of ` cæsar ' if you need any further appellation they will give you that of _ imperator _ as they give it to you father they will reverence you also by still another name so that you may obtain all the advantage of a kingdom without the disfavor that attach to the term itself -lrb- -41 - -rrb- mæcenas thus bring he speech to a end cæsar thank they both heartily for they many idea the exhaustiveness of they exposition and they frankness he rather inclined however to the proposition of mæcenas yet he do not immediately put into practice all of the other 's suggestion for fear that he might meet with some setback if he want to reform man in multitude so he make some change for the better at once and other later he leave some thing also for those who should come to the head of the state afterward to do as might be find more opportune in the progress of time agrippa coöperated with he in all he project quite zealously in spite of have state a contrary opinion just as if he have be the one to propose the plan cæsar do this and what i have record earlier in the narrative in that year when he be consul for the seventh time and add the title of _ imperator _ i do not refer to the title anciently grant some person for victory -- this he receive many time before and many time later for he deed themselves so that he have the name of imperator twenty-one time -- but to the other one which signify supreme power just as they have vote to he father cæsar and to the child and descendant of the same -lrb- -42 - -rrb- after this he enter upon a censorship with agrippa and besides set aright some other business he investigate the senate many knight and many foot-soldier too who do not deserve it be in the senate as a result of the civil war so that the total of that body amount to a thousand these he wish to remove but do not himself erase any of they name urge they to become they own judge out of the consciousness of they family and they life so first he persuade fifty of they to retire voluntarily from the assemblage and then compel one hundred and forty other to imitate they example he disenfranchise none of they but post the name of the second division in the case of the first because they have not delay but have straightway obey he he remit the reproach and they identity be not make public these accordingly return willingly to private life he oust quintus statilius very much against the latter 's will from the tribuneship to which he have be appoint some other he make senator and he count among the ex-consul two man of the senatorial class -- a certain cluvius and gaius furnius -- because they have be appoint first though certain other have take possession of they office so that they be unable to become consul he add to the class of patrician the senate allow he to do this because most of its member have perish no element be exhaust so fast in civil war as the nobility or be deem to be so necessary for the continuance of ancestral custom in addition to the above measure he forbid all person in the senate to go outside of italy unless he himself should order or permit any one of they to do so this custom be still keep up at the present day except that he may visit sicily and gallia narbonensis no senator be allow to go anywhere out of the country as these region be close at hand and the population be unarmed and peaceful those who have any possession there have be grant the right to take trip to they as often as they like without ask leave -- since also he see that many of the senator and of the other who have be devote to antony still maintain a attitude of suspicion toward he and as he be afraid they might cause some uprising he announce that all the letter find in he rival 's chest have be burn some of they as a matter of fact have perish but the majority of they he take pain to preserve and do not even hesitate to use they later -lrb- -43 - -rrb- besides these act related he also settle carthage anew because lepidus have lay waste a part of it and for that reason he maintain that the colonist ' rights of settlement have be abrogate he summon antiochus of commagene to appear before he because this prince have treacherously slay a envoy despatch to rome by he brother who be at variance with he cæsar bring he before the senate where he be condemn and the sentence of death impose capreæ be also obtain from the neapolitan to whom it have anciently belong in exchange for other land it lie not far from the mainland opposite surrentum and be good for nothing but have a name even now on account of tiberius 's sojourn there --

approve from very early time deliver to agrippa he colleague the bundle of rod which belong to a incumbent of the consulship while he himself use the other on complete he term he have the oath administer accord to ancestral custom whether he ever do this again i do not know agrippa he honor exceedingly even go so far as to give he he niece in marriage and to provide he with a tent similar to he own whenever they go on a campaign together and the watchword be give by both of they at that particular time besides attend to the ordinary run of business he finish the taking of the census in which he be call _ princep senatus _ as have be deem proper under the real democracy he further complete and dedicate the temple of apollo on the palatine the precinct surround it and the store of book and he celebrate in company with agrippa the festival in honor of the victory win at actium which have be vote : in it he have the horse-race between boy and between man of the nobility this celebration every five year as long as it last be in charge of the four priesthood in succession -- i mean the pontifice and augur and the so-called septemvirus and quindecimvirus a gymnastic contest be also hold at that time -- a wooden stadium be build in the campus martius -- and there be a armed combat of captive this continue for several day without a break in spite of cæsar 's fall sick for even so agrippa fill he place -lrb- -2 - -rrb- cæsar spend some of he private means upon the festival and when money be need for the public treasury he borrow it and supply the want for the management of this branch of the service he order two annual magistrate to be choose from among the ex-prætors to the populace he distribute a quadruple allowance of grain and make a present of money to some of the senator for many of they have grow so poor as not to be willing to be even ædile on account of the great expense moreover the court which belong to the ædileship be to be assign to the prætors as have be the custom the more important to the prætor urbanus and the other to the prætor peregrinus again he himself appoint the prætor urbanus as he often do subsequently the pledge deposit with the public treasury before the battle of actium he release save any that involve house property and burn the old acknowledgment of those who owe the state anything egyptian rite he do not admit within the pomerium but pay great attention to the temple of egyptian deity such as have be build by private individual he order they child and descendant if any survive to repair and the rest he restore himself he do not however appropriate the credit for they building but allow it to rest with those who have originally construct they and since very many unlawful and unjust ordinance have be pass during the internecine strife and in the war and particularly in the dual reign of antony and lepidus he abolish they all by one promulgation set he sixth consulship as the limit of they existence as he obtain approbation and praise for this act he desire to exhibit another instance of magnanimity that by such a policy he might be honor the more and that he supremacy might be voluntarily confirm by the people which would enable he to avoid the appearance of have force they against they will as a consequence after apprise those senator with whom he be most intimate of he design he enter the senatorial body in he seventh consulship and read the follow document -lrb- bc 27 -lrb- _ a u _ 727 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -3 - -rrb- i be sure that i shall seem to some of you conscript father to have make a incredible choice for what each one of my hearer would not wish to do himself he do not like to believe when another state it as accomplish this be chiefly because every one be jealous of every one who surpass he and be more or less inclined to distrust anything say that be higher than he own standard -lrb- 1 -rrb- moreover i know this that those who make apparently untrustworthy statement not only persuade nobody but further have the appearance of cheat and indeed if it be a case of announce something that i be not intend to do immediately i should hesitate very much about make it public for fear of obtain some unworthy charge against I instead of gratitude but as it be when the performance will follow the promise this very day i feel entirely confident not only of avoid any shame for prevarication but of surpass all mankind in good repute -lrb- -4 - -rrb- you all see that i be so situate that i could rule you perpetually all the revolutionist either have be discipline and be make to halt or have have pity show they and so have come to they sens my helper have be make devote by a recompense of benefit and steadfast by a participation in the government : therefore they do not desire any political innovation and if anything of the sort should take place the man to assist I be even more ready for it than the instigator of rebellion my military be in prime condition we have good-will strength money and ally and chiefest of all you and the people be so disposed toward I that you would be quite willing to have I at you head however i will lead you no longer nor shall any one say that all the act of my previous career have be with the object of sole rulership i give up the entire domain and i restore to you absolutely everything -- the arm the law and the province -- not only all those which you commit to I but also all that i myself subsequently acquire for you thus by my deed themselves you may ascertain that i do not from the outset desire any position of power but wish in very truth to avenge my father cruelly murder and to extricate the city from great and continuous evil -lrb- -5 - -rrb- i would that i have never take charge of affair even to the present extent that be i would that the city have never need I for any such purpose but that we of this age have from the outset live in peace and harmony as we father once do but since a inflexible fate as it seem bring you to a place where there be need even of I though i be still young and i be put to the test i be always ready to labor zealously at everything even beyond what be expect of my year so long as the situation demand my help and i accomplish everything with good fortune even surpass my power there be not one consideration out of all that might be cite which could turn I from aid you when you be in danger not toil or fear or threat of foe or prayer of friend or the number of the confederate or the desperation of we adversary i give myself to you unsparingly for all the task that fall to we lot and my performance and suffering you know from it i myself have derive no gain except that i cause my country to survive but you be both preserved and in you sober sens since then the gracious act of fortune have restore to you by my hand peace without treachery and harmony without turmoil receive back also liberty and democracy take possession of the arm and the subject nation and conduct the government as have be you wont -lrb- -6 - -rrb- you should not be surprise at my attitude when you see my right conduct in other way my mildness and freedom from meddle and reflect moreover that i have never accept any extraordinary privilege beyond what the majority might gain though you have often vote many of they to I do not again condemn I for folly because when it be in my power to rule over you and hold so great a sovereignty over this great world i be unwilling examine the merit of the situation i deem it most just for you to manage you own affair : examine the advantage i regard it as most advantageous to myself to be free from trouble from jealousy from plot and for you to conduct a free government with moderation and love : examine where the glory lie -lrb- for the sake of which man often choose to enter war and danger -rrb- will it not add most to my reputation to resign so great a dominion will it not be most glorious to leave so exalt a sovereignty and voluntarily become a plain citizen so if any one of you doubt that any one else could show true moderation in this and bring himself to speak out let he at all event believe I for though i could recite many great benefit which have be confer upon you by I and by my father for which you would naturally love and honor we above all the rest i could say nothing greater and i should take pride in nothing else more than this that he would not accept the monarchy which you strive to give he and that i hold it lay it aside -lrb- -7 - -rrb- what need to set side by side he separate exploit -- the conquest of gaul the subduing of moesia the subjugation of egypt the enslaving of pannonium or again pharnace juba phraate the campaign against the briton the cross of the rhine yet these be greater and more important deed than all we forefather perform in all previous time still any of these accomplishment scarcely deserve a place beside my present act nor yet indeed do the fact that the civil war the greatest and most diverse that have occur in the history of man we fight to a successful finish and that we make humane term overcome all who withstand we as enemy and save alive all who yield as friend -lrb- so that if we city should ever again be fate to suffer from disaffection we might pray that the quarrel should follow this same course -rrb- for that in spite of we possess such great power and standing at the summit of excellence and good fortune so that we might govern you willing or unwilling we should neither lose we head nor desire sole supremacy but that instead he should reject it when offer and i return it when give be a superhuman achievement i speak in this way not for idle boasting -- i should not have say it at all if i be to derive any advantage whatever from it -- but in order that you may see that whereas there be many public benefit to we credit and we have in private many lofty title we take greatest pride in this that what other desire to gain even by do violence to they neighbor we surrender without any compulsion -lrb- -8 - -rrb- who could be find more magnanimous than i -lrb- not to mention again my father decease -rrb- or whose conduct more godlike with so many fine soldier at my back and citizen and ally -lrb- o jupiter and hercule -rrb- that love I supreme over the entire sea within the pillar of hercule except a very few tribe possess both city and province on all the continent at a time when there be no longer any foreign enemy oppose I and there be no disturbance at home but you all be at peace harmonious and strong and greatest of all be willingly obedient -- under such condition i voluntarily of my own motion resign so great a dominion and alienate so vast a property for if horatius mucius curtius regulus the decius wish to encounter danger and death with the object of seem to have do a great and noble deed why should i not even more desire to do this as a result of which i shall while alive excel both they and all the rest of mankind in glory no one of you should think that whereas the ancient roman pursue excellence and good repute all manliness have now become extinct in the city again do not entertain a suspicion that i wish to betray you and confide you to any base fellow or expose you to mob rule from which nothing good but all the most terrible evil always result to mankind upon you upon you the most excellent and prudent i lay all public interest the other course i should never have follow have it be necessary for I to die or even to become monarch ten thousand time this policy i adopt for my own good and for that of the city i myself have undergo both labor and hardship and i can no longer hold out either in mind or in body furthermore i foresee the jealousy and hatred which rise in the breast of some against the best man and the plot which result from those feeling and for that reason i choose rather to be a private citizen with glory than to be a monarch in danger and the public business would be manage much better if carry on publicly and by many people at once than if it be dependent upon any one man -lrb- -9 - -rrb- for these reason then i supplicate and beseech all of you both to commend my course and to coöperate heartily with I reflect upon all that i have do for you in war and in government you will be pay I all the thanks due for it by allow I now at last to lead a life of quiet thus you will come to know that i understand not only how to rule but to be rule and that all command which i have lay upon other i can endure to have lay upon I i must surely expect to live in security and to suffer no harm from any one by either deed or word such be the confidence -lrb- base upon the consciousness of my own rectitude -rrb- that i have in you good-will i may of course meet with some catastrophe as happen to many for it be not possible for a man to please everybody especially when he have be involve in so great war some foreign and some civil and have have affair of such magnitude entrust to he : yet even so i be quite ready to choose to die as a private citizen before my appoint time rather than to become immortal as a sole ruler that very circumstance will bring I fame -- that i not only murder no one in order to hold possession of the sovereignty but even die untimely in order to avoid become monarch the man who have dare to slay I will certainly be punish by heaven and by you as take place in the case of my father he be declare to be equal to a god and obtain eternal honor whereas those who slew he perish the evil man in evil plight we could not become deathless yet by live well and by die well we do in a sense gain this boon therefore i who possess the first requisite and hope to possess the second return to you the arm and the province the revenue and the law i make only this final suggestion that you be not dishearten through fear of the magnitude of affair or the difficulty of handle they nor neglect they in disdain with the idea that they can be easily manage -lrb- -10 - -rrb- i have indeed no objection to suggest to you in a summary way what ought to be do in each of the lead category and what be these suggestion first guard vigilantly the established law and change none of they what remain fixed though it be inferior be more advantageous than what be always subject to innovation even though it seem to be superior next whatever injunction these law lay upon you be careful to perform and to refrain from whatever they forbid and do this scrupulously not only in word but also in deed not only in public but in private that you may obtain not penalty but honor the office both of peace and of war you should entrust to those who be each time the most excellent and sensible without jealousy of any person and enter into rivalry not that this man or that man may reap some advantage but that the city may be preserve and prosperous such man you must honor but chastise those who show any different spirit in politics make you private means public property of the city and keep you hand off public money as you would off you neighbor ' goods keep careful watch over what belong to you but be not eager for that upon which you can have no claim treat the ally and subject nation with neither insolence nor rapacity and neither wrong nor fear the enemy have you arm always in hand but do not use they against one another nor against a peaceful population give the soldier a sufficient support so that they may not on account of want desire anything which belong to other keep they together and discipline they to prevent they do any damage through audacity but why need i make a long story by go into everything which it be you duty to do you may easily understand from this how the remain business must be conduct i will close with this one remark if you conduct the government in this way you will enjoy prosperity yourselve and you will gratify I who find you in the midst of wretched dishonor and have render you such as you be if you prove impotent to carry out any single branch as you should you will cause I regret and you will cast the city again into many war and great danger -lrb- -11 - -rrb- while cæsar be engage in set he decision before they a varied feeling take possession of the senator a few of they know he real intention and as a result they keep applaud he enthusiastically of the rest some be suspicious of what be say and other believe in it and therefore both marvel equally the one class at he great artifice and the other at the determination that he have reach one side be displeased at he involved scheming and the other at he change of mind for already there be some who detest the democratic constitution as a breeder of factional difficulty be please at the change of government and take delight in cæsar consequently though the announcement affect different person differently they view in regard to it be in each case the same as for those who believe he sentiment to be genuine any who wish it could not rejoice because of fear nor the other lament because of hope and as many as disbelieved it do not venture to accuse he and confute he some because they be afraid and other because they do not care to do so hence they all either be compel or pretend to believe he as for praise he some do not have the courage and other be unwilling even in the midst of he reading there be frequent shout and afterward many more the senator beg that a monarchy be establish and direct all they remark to that end until -lrb- naturally -rrb- they force he to assume the rein of government at once they see to it that twice as much pay be vote to the man who be to compose he body-guard as to the rest of the soldier that this might incite the man to keep a careful watch of he then he begin to show a real interest in set up a monarchy -lrb- -12 - -rrb- in this way he have he headship ratify by the senate and the people as he wish even so to appear to be democratic in principle he accept all the care and superintendence of public business on the ground that it require expert attention but say that he should not personally govern all the province and those that he do govern he should not keep in he charge perpetually the weaker one because -lrb- as he say -rrb- they be peaceful and free from war he give over to the senate but the more powerful he hold in possession because they be slippery and dangerous and either have enemy in adjoining territory or on they own account be able to cause a great uprising he pretext be that the senate should fearlessly gather the fruit of the finest portion of the empire while he himself have the labor and danger : he real purpose be that by this plan the senator be unarmed and unprepared for battle while he alone have arm and keep soldier africa and numidium asia and greece with epirus the dalmatian and macedonian territory sicily crete and libya adjacent to cyrene bithynium with the adjoining pontus sardinium and baetica be consequently hold to belong to the people and the senate cæsar 's be -- the remainder of spain the neighborhood of tarraco and lusitanium all gaul -lrb- the narbonensian and the lugdunensian the aquitanus and the belgæ -rrb- both themselves and the alien among they some of the celta whom we call germanus have occupy all the belgic territory near the rhine and cause it to be call germania the upper part extend to the source of the river and the lower part reach to the ocean of britain these province then and the so-called hollow syrium phoenicium and cilicium cyprus and the egyptian fall at that time to cæsar 's share later he give cyprus and gaul adjacent to narbo back to the people and he himself take dalmatium instead this be also do subsequently in the case of other province as the progress of my narrative will show i have enumerate these in such detail because now each one of they be rule separately whereas in old time and for a long period the province be govern two and three together the other i have not mention because some of they be acquire later and the rest even if they have be already subdue be not be govern by the roman but either be leave to enjoy they own law or have be turn over to some kingdom or other all of they that after this come into the roman empire be attach to the possession of the man temporarily in power -- this then be the division of the province -lrb- -13 - -rrb- wish to lead the roman still further away from the idea that he look upon himself as absolute monarch cæsar undertake the government of the region give he for ten year in the course of this time he promise to reduce they to quiet and he carry he playfulness to the point of say that if they should be sooner pacify he would deliver they sooner to the senate thereupon he first appoint the senator themselves to govern both class of province except egypt this land alone for the reason mention he assign to the knight previously name -lrb- 2 -rrb- next he ordain that the ruler of senatorial province should be annual magistrate elect by lot unless any one have the special privilege accord to a large number of child or marriage they be to be send out by the assembly of the senate as a body with no sword at they side nor wear the military garb the name proconsul be to belong not only to the two ex-consul but also to the rest who have serve as prætors or who at least hold the rank of ex-prætors both class be to employ as many lictor as be usual in the capital he order further that they be to put on the insignia of they office immediately on leave the pomerium and be to wear they continually until they should return the head of imperial province on the other hand be to be choose by himself and be he agent and they be to be name proprætors even if they be from the rank of the ex-consul of these two name which have be extremely common under the democracy he give that of prætor to the class choose by he because from very early time war have be they care and he call they also proprætors : the name of consul he give to the other because they duty be more peaceful and call they in addition proconsul these particular name of prætor and consul he continue in italy and speak of all official outside as govern as they representative he cause the class of he own choose to employ the title of proprætor and to hold office for as much longer than a year as should please he wear the military costume and have a sword with which they be empower to punish soldier no one else proconsul or proprætor or procurator who be not empower to kill a soldier have be give the privilege of wear a sword it be permit not only to senator but also to knight who have this function this be the condition of the case -- all the proprætors alike employ six lictor : as many of they as do not belong to the number of ex-consul be name from this very number -lrb- 3 -rrb- both class alike assume the decoration of they position of authority when they enter they appoint district and lay they aside immediately upon finish they term -lrb- -14 - -rrb- it be thus and on these condition that governor from among the ex-prætors and ex-consul have be customarily send to both kind of province the emperor would send one of they on he mission whithersoever and whenever he wish many while act as prætors and consul secure the presidency of province as sometimes happen at the present day in the case of the senate he privately give africa and asia to the ex-consul and all the other district to the ex-prætors he publicly forbid all the senator to cast lot for anybody until five year after such a candidate have hold office in the city for a short time all person that fulfil these requirement even if they be more numerous than the province draw lot for they later as some of they do not govern well this i appointment too revert to the emperor thus they also in a sense receive they position from he and he ordain that only a number equal to the number of province shall draw lot and that they shall be whatever man he please some emperor have send man of they own choosing there also and have allow certain of they to hold office for more than a year : some have assign certain province to knight instead of to senator these be the custom thus establish at that time in regard to those senator that be authorize to execute the death penalty upon they subject some who have not this authority be send out to the province call province of the senate and the people -- namely such quæstors as the lot may designate and man who be co-assessor with those who hold the actual authority this would be the correct way to speak of these associate with reference not to the ordinary name but to they duty : other call these also _ presbeutai _ use the greek term about this title enough have be say in the foregoing narrative each separate official choose he own assessor the exprætors select one from either they peer or they inferior and the ex-consul three from among those of equal rank subject to the approval of the emperor there be certain innovation make also in regard to these man but since they soon lapse this be sufficient to say here -lrb- -15 - -rrb- this be the method follow in regard to the province of the people to the other call province of the emperor which have more than one citizenlegion lieutenant be send choose by the ruler himself generally from the ex-prætors but in some instance already from the ex-quæstors or those who have hold some office between the two those position then appertain to the senator from among the knight the emperor himself despatch some to the citizen post alone but other to foreign place -lrb- accord to the custom then institute by -lrb- the same -rrb- cæsar -rrb- the military tribune the prospective senator and the remainder concern whose difference in rank i have previously speak in the narrative -lrb- 4 -rrb- the procurator -lrb- a name that we give to the man who collect the public revenue and spend what be order -rrb- he send to all the province alike he own and the people 's and some of these officer belong to the knight other to the freedman by way of exception the proconsul levy the tribute upon the people they govern the emperor give certain injunction to the procurator the proconsul and the proprætors in order that they may proceed to they place of office on fixed condition both this practice and the give of salary to they and to the remain employee of the government be make the custom at this period in old time some by contract for work to be pay for from the public treasury furnish themselves with everything need for they office it be only in the day of cæsar that these particular person begin to receive something definite this salary be not assign to all of they in equal amount but as need demand the procurator get they very name a dignified one from the amount of money give into they charge the follow law be lay down for all alike -- that they should not make up list for service or levy money beyond the amount appoint unless the senate should so vote or the emperor so order : also that when they successor should arrive they be immediately to leave the province and not to delay on they return but to be back within three month -lrb- -16 - -rrb- these matter be so ordain at that time -- or at least one might say so in reality cæsar himself be destine to hold absolute control of all of they for all time because he command the soldier and be master of the money nominally the public fund have be separate from he own but in fact he spend the former also as he see fit when he decade have come to a end there be vote he another five year then five more after that ten and again another ten and a like number the fifth time -lrb- 5 -rrb- so that by a succession of ten-year period he continue monarch for life consequently the subsequent emperor though no longer appoint for a specified period but for they whole life at once nevertheless have be wont to hold a festival every ten year as if then renew they sovereignty once more : this be do even at the present day cæsar have receive many honor previously when the matter of decline the sovereignty and that regard the division of the province be under discussion for the right to fasten the laurel in front of he royal residence and to hang the oak-leaf crown above the door be then vote he to symbolize the fact that he be always victorious over enemy and preserve the citizen the royal building be call palatium not because it be ever decree that that should be its name but because cæsar dwelt on the palatine and have he headquarters there and he house secure some renown from the mount as a whole by reason of the former habitation of romulus there hence even if the emperor reside somewhere else he dwelling retain the name of palatium when he have really complete the detail of administration the name augustus be finally apply to he by the senate and by the people they want to call he by some name of they own and some propose this while other choose that cæsar be exceedingly anxious to be call romulus but when he perceive that this cause he to be suspect of desire the kingship he no longer insist on it but take the title of augustus signify that he be more than human all most precious and sacred object be term _ augusta _ therefore they salute he also in greek as _ sebastós _ mean a _ August _ person from the verb _ sebazesthaus _ -lrb- -17 - -rrb- in this way all the power of the people and that of the senate revert to augustus and from he time there be a genuine monarchy monarchy would be the truest name for it no matter how much two and three hold the power together this name of monarch the roman so detest that they call they emperor neither dictator nor king nor anything of the sort yet since the management of the government devolve upon they it can not but be that they be king the office that commonly enjoy some legal sanction be even now maintain except that of censor still everything be direct and carry out precisely as the emperor at the time may wish in order that they may appear to hold this power not through force but accord to law the ruler have take possession -- name and all -- of every position -lrb- save the dictatorship -rrb- which under the democracy be of mighty influence among the citizen who bestow the power they very frequently become consul and be always call proconsul whenever they be outside the pomerium the title of imperator be invariably give not only to such as win victory but to all the rest to indicate the complete independence of they authority instead of the name king or dictator these particular name they have never assume since the term first fall out of use in the senate but they be confirm in the prerogative of these position by the appellation of imperator by virtue of the title mention they get the right to make enrollment to collect money declare war make peace rule foreign and native territory alike everywhere and always even to the extent of put to death both knight and senator within the pomerium and all the other privilege once grant to the consul and other official with full power by virtue of the office of censor they investigate we life and character and take the census some they list in the equestrian and senatorial class and other they erase from the roll as please they by virtue of be consecrate in all the priesthood and furthermore have the right to give the majority of they to other and from the fact that _ one _ of the high priest -lrb- if there be two or three hold office at once -rrb- be choose from they number they be themselves also master of holy and sacred thing the so-called tribunician authority which the man of very greatest attainment use to hold give they the right to stop any measure bring up by some one else in case they do not join in approve it and to be free from personal abuse moreover if they be think to be wrong in even the slightest degree not merely by action but even by conversation they may destroy the guilty party without a trial as one polluted they do not think it lawful to be tribune because they belong altogether to the patrician class but they assume all the power of the tribuneship undiminished from the period of its greatest extent and thereby the enumeration of the year they have hold the office in question go forward on the assumption that they receive it year by year along with the other who be successively tribune thus by these name they have secure these privilege in accordance with all the various usage of the democracy in order that they may appear to possess nothing that have not be give they -lrb- -18 - -rrb- they have gain also another prerogative which be give to none of the ancient roman outright to apply to all case and it be through this alone that it would be possible for they to hold the above office and any other besides they be free from the action of the law as the very word in latin indicate that be they be liberate from every consideration of compulsion and be subject to none of the write ordinance so by virtue of these democratic name they be clothe in all the strength of the government and have all that appertain to king except the vulgar title cæsar or augustus as a mode of address confer upon they no distinct privilege of its own but show in the one case the continuance of they family and in the other the brilliance and dignity of they position the salutation father perhaps give they a certain authority over we which father once have over they child it be not use however for this purpose in the beginning but for they honor and to admonish they to love they subject as they would they child while the subject be to respect they as they respect they father such be the number and quality of the title to which those in power be accustomed accord to the and accord to what have now become tradition at present all of they be as a rule bestow upon the ruler at once except the title of censor : to the earlier emperor they be vote separately and from time to time some of the emperor take the censorship in accordance with ancient custom and domitian take it for life this be however no longer do at the present day they possess its power and be not choose for it and do not employ its name except in the census -lrb- -19 - -rrb- thus be the constitution make over at that time for the better and in a way to provide greater security it be doubtless absolutely impossible for the people to be preserve under a democracy event after this however can not be say to be similar to those precede this period formerly everything be refer to the senate and the people even if it occur at a distance hence all learn of it and many record it consequently the truth of happening no matter with how much fear and gratitude and friendship and enmity toward any one they be related have be find at least in the work of those who write of they and to a certain extent also in the public record but after this time business begin to be transact more often with concealment and secrecy nowadays even if anything be make public it be distrust because it can not be prove it be suspect that all speech and act be to meet the wish of the man at the time in power and of they associate as a result much that never occur be noised abroad and much that really happen be unknown nearly everything be report in a different form from what really take place yet the magnitude of the empire and the number of event render accuracy in regard to they most difficult in rome there be many operation go on and so in its subject territory as well as against hostile tribe always and every day so to speak clear information about which no one can easily get except those actively concern there be great number who do not hear at all of what have take place hence all that follow which will require mention i shall narrate as it have be publish whether it be so in truth or be really somewhat different in addition however my own opinion so far as possible will be state in matter where i have be able to deduce something else than the common report from the many thing i have read or hear or see -lrb- -20 - -rrb- cæsar as i have say receive the further designation of augustus and a sign of no little moment in regard to he occur that very night the tiber overflow and occupy all of rome that be build in the plain country so that it be submerge from this the soothsayer infer that he would rise to great height and keep the whole city subservient while different person be rival to show he excessive honor one sextus pacuvius or as other say apudius -lrb- 6 -rrb- surpass they all in the open senate he consecrate himself to he after the fashion of the spaniard and advise the rest to do the same when augustus hinder he he rush out to the crowd standing near by and -lrb- as he be tribune -rrb- compel they and next all the rest who be wander about through the street and lane to consecrate themselves to augustus from this episode we be wont even now to say in appeal to the sovereign we have consecrate ourselves to you pacuvius order all to offer sacrifice for this occurrence and before the people he once say he should make augustus he inheritor on equal term with he son this be not because he possess anything much but because he wish to get more and he desire be accomplish -lrb- -21 - -rrb- augustus attend with considerable zeal to all the business of the empire to make it appear that he have receive it in accordance with the wish of all and he also enact many law -lrb- i need not go into each one of they in detail except those which have a bearing upon my history this same course i shall follow in the case of later event in order not to become wearisome by introduce all such matter as not even those who specialize on they most narrowly know with accuracy -rrb- not all of these law be enact on he sole responsibility : some of they he bring before the public in advance in order that if any featured cause displeasure he might learn it in time and correct they he urge that any one at all give he advice if any one could think of anything better he accord they full liberty of speech and some provision he actually do alter most important of all he take as adviser for six month the consul or the consul -lrb- when he himself also hold the office -rrb- one of each of the other kind of official and fifteen man choose by lot from the remainder of the senatorial body through they he be accustom to a certain extent to communicate to all the rest the provision of he law some feature he bring before the entire senate he deem it better however to consider most of the law and the greater one in company with a few person at leisure and act accordingly sometimes he try case with they assistance the entire senate by itself sit in judgment as formerly and transact business with occasional group of envoy and herald from both people and king furthermore the people and the pleb come together for the election but nothing be do that would not please cæsar some of those who be to hold office he himself choose out and nominate and other he put accord to ancient custom in the power of the people and the pleb yet take care that no unfit person should be appoint nor by factious clique nor by bribery in this way he control the entire empire -lrb- -22 - -rrb- i shall relate also in detail all he act that need mention together with the name of the consul under whom they be perform in the year previously name see that the road outside the wall have become through neglect hard to traverse he order different senator to repair different one at they own expense he himself attend to the flaminian way since he be go to lead a army out by that route this operation be finish forthwith and image of he be accordingly erect on arch on the bridge over the tiber and at ariminum the other road be repair later either at public expense -lrb- for none of the senator like to spend money on it -rrb- or by augustus as one may wish to state i can not distinguish they treasure in spite of the fact that augustus coin into money some silver statue of himself make by he friend and by certain of the tribe purpose thereby to make it appear that all the expenditure which he say he make be from he own means therefore i have no opinion to record as to whether a ruler at any particular time take money from the public treasury or whether he ever give it himself for both of these thing be often do why should any one list such thing as either expenditure or donation when the people and the emperor be constantly make both the one and the other in common these be the act of augustus at that time he also set out apparently to make a campaign into britain but on come to the province of gaul linger there for the briton seem likely to make term with he and gallic affair be still unsettled as the civil war have begin immediately after they subjugation he make a census of the people and set in order they life and government -lrb- bc 26 -lrb- _ a u 728 _ -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -23 - -rrb- from there he come to spain and reduce that country also to quiet after this he become consul for the eighth time with statilius taurus and agrippa dedicate the so-called for he have not promise to repair any road this edifice in the campus martius have be construct by lepidus by the addition of portico all about for the tribal election and agrippa adorn it with stone tablet and painting name it julian from augustus the builder incur no jealousy for it but be greatly honor both by augustus himself and by all the rest of the people the reason be that he give he master the most kindly the most distinguish the most beneficial advice and coöperation yet claim not even a small share of the consequent glory he use the honor which cæsar give not for personal gain or enjoyment but for the benefit of the giver himself and of the public -- on the other hand cornelius gallus be lead to insolent behavior by honor he talk a great deal of idle nonsense against augustus and be guilty of many sly reprehensible action throughout nearly all egypt he set up image of himself and he inscribe upon the pyramid a list of he achievement for this he be accuse by valerius largus he comrade and intimate and be disenfranchise by augustus so that he be prevent from live in the emperor 's province after this take place other attack he and bring many indictment against he the senate unanimously vote that he should be convict in the court be deprive of he property and be exile that he possession be give to augustus and that they should sacrifice ox in overwhelming grief at this gallus commit suicide before the decree take effect -lrb- -24 - -rrb- the false behavior of most man be evidence by this fact that they now treat the man whom they once use to flatter in such a way that they force he to die by he own hand to largus they show devotion because he star be begin to rise -- though they be sure to vote the same measure against he if anything similar should ever occur in he case proculeius however feel so toward he that on meeting he once he clap he hand over he nose and he mouth thereby signify to the bystander that it be not safe even to breathe in the man 's presence another person although unknown approach he with witness and ask if largus recognize he when the one question say no he record he denial on a tablet thus make it beyond the power of the rascal to inform against a person at least whom he have not previously know thus we see that most man emulate the exploit of other though they be evil instead of guard against they fate so also at this time there be marcus egnatius rufus who have be a ædile : the majority of he deed have be good and with he own slave and with some other that be hire he lend aid to the house that take fire during he year of office in return he receive from the people the expense incur in he position and by a suspension of the law be make prætor elate at these mark of favor he despise augustus so much as to record that he -lrb- rufus -rrb- have deliver the city unimpaired and entire to he successor all the foremost man and augustus himself most of all become indignant at this he prepare therefore to teach the upstart a lesson in the near future not to exalt he mind above the mass of man for the time be he issue a edict to the ædiles to see to it that no building take fire and if aught of the kind do happen to extinguish the blaze -lrb- -25 - -rrb- in this same year also polemon who be king of pontus be enrol among the friend and ally of the roman people front seat for the senator be provide in all the theater of the emperor 's whole domain augustus finding that the briton would not come to term wish to make a expedition into they country but be detain by the salassus who have revolt against he and by the cantabrus and asture who have be make hostile the former dwell close under the alp as have be herein state -lrb- 7 -rrb- whereas both of the latter tribe hold the strongest region of the pyrenee on the spanish side and the plain which be below it for these reason augustus now in he ninth consulship with marcus silanus send terentius varro against the salassus -lrb- bc 25 -lrb- _ a u _ 729 -rrb- -rrb- the latter invade they territory at many point at once in order that they might not unite and become harder to subdue and have a very easy time in conquer they because they attack he only in small group have force they to capitulate he demand a fix sum of money allow it to be suppose that he would impose no other punishment after that he send soldier everywhere apparently to attend to the collection of the indemnity and arrest those of military age whom he sell under a agreement that none of they should be liberate within twenty year the best of they land be give to member of the pretorian and come to include a city call augusta prætoria -lrb- 8 -rrb- augustus himself wage war upon the asture and upon the cantabrus at the same time these refuse to yield because of confidence in they position on the height and would not come to close quarter owe to they inferior number and the fact that most of they be javelin thrower but they cause he much trouble whenever he make any movement by always seize the higher ground in advance and place ambuscade in depression and in wooded spot he find himself therefore quite unable to cope with the difficulty and have fall ill from weariness and worry retire to tarraco and there remain sick meantime gaius antistius fight against they accomplish considerable not because he be a better general than augustus but because the barbarian feel contempt for he and thus join battle with the roman and be defeat in this way he capture some point and afterward titus -lrb- 9 -rrb- carisius take lancium the principal fortress of the asture which have be abandon and win to he side many town -lrb- -26 - -rrb- at the conclusion of this war augustus dismiss the more aged of he soldier and give they a city to settle in lusitanium -- the so-called augusta emerita for those who be still of the military age he arrange some spectacles right among the legion through the agency of tiberius and marcellus as ædiles to juba he give portion of gætulia in return for the prince 's ancestral domain -lrb- for the majority of the inhabitant have be enrol as member of the roman polity -rrb- and also the possession of bocchus and bogud on the death of amynta he do not entrust the country to the child of the deceased but make it a part of the subject territory thus gaul together with lycaonium obtain a roman governor the region of pamphylium formerly assign to amynta be restore to they own district -- about this same time marcus vinicius in make reprisal against the celtæ because they have arrest and destroy roman who have enter they country to have friendly dealings with they himself give the name of imperator to augustus for this and for the other achievement of the time a triumph be vote to cæsar but as he do not care to celebrate it a arch bear a trophy be construct in the alp for he glory and authority be give he to wear always on the first day of the year both the crown and the triumphal garb after these success in the war augustus close the precinct of janus which have be open because of the strife -lrb- -27 - -rrb- meanwhile agrippa have be beautify the city at he own expense first in honor of the naval victory he build over the so-called _ portico of neptune _ and lend it further brilliance by the painting of the argonaut secondly he repair the laconian sudatorium he give the name laconian to the gymnasium because the lacedæmonians have in those day a greater reputation than anybody else for strip naked and exercise smear with oil also he complete the so-called _ pantheon _ it have this name perhaps because it receive the image of many god and among they the statue of mar and venus but my own opinion be that the name be due to its round shape like the sky agrippa desire to place augustus also there and to take the designation of the structure from he title but as he master would not accept either honor he place in the temple itself a statue of the former cæsar and in the anteroom representation of augustus and himself this be do not from any rivalry and ambition on agrippa 's part to make himself equal to augustus but from he superabundant devotion to he and he perpetual affection for the commonwealth hence augustus so far from censure he for it honor he the more for be unable through sickness to superintend at that time the marriage of he daughter julium and he nephew marcellus he commission agrippa to hold the festival in he absence and when the house on the palatine hill which have formerly be antony 's but be later give to agrippa and messalum be burn down he make a grant of money to messalum and give agrippa equal rights of domicile the latter not unnaturally gain high distinction as a result of this and one gaius toranius also acquire a good reputation because while tribune he bring he father though some one 's freedman into the theater and make he sit beside he upon the tribune 's bench publius servilius too make a name for himself because while prætor he cause to be kill at a festival three hundred bear and other libyan wild beast equal in number -lrb- bc 24 -lrb- _ a u _ 730 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -28 - -rrb- augustus now enter upon office for the tenth time with gaius norbanus and on the first day of the month the senate take oath confirm he deed when he be announce as draw near the city -lrb- he sickness have delay he -rrb- he promise to give the people a hundred denarius each and issue instruction that the document concern the money should not be bulletine until the senate also should approve they have free he from all compulsion of the law to the end as i have state -lrb- 10 -rrb- that be really independent and possess of full power over both himself and the law he should follow all of they that he wish and not follow any that he do not wish this right be vote to he while still absent on he arrival in rome there be various event in honor of he preservation and return and marcellus be accord the right to be a senator of the class of ex-prætors and to be a candidate for the consulship ten year earlier than be customary tiberius be permit in a similar fashion to be a candidate five year before the age set for each office the latter be at once appoint quæstor and the former ædile as the quæstors need to serve in the province be prove insufficient all draw lot for the place who for ten year previous have be name quæstors without the duty of the office these then be the occurrence in the city worthy of note that year -lrb- -29 - -rrb- as soon as augustus have depart from spain leave behind lucius æmilius -lrb- 11 -rrb- as governor of it the cantabrus and asture make a uprising they send to æmilius before anything about it become know to he and say they wish to give the army grain and some other present then have secure a number of soldier who be presumably to carry the supplies they lead they to suitable place and butcher they they pleasure however do not last long when they country have be devastate and some fort burn and chiefest of all the hand of every one that be catch be cut off they be quickly subdue while this be go on another new campaign have its beginning and end it be lead by ælius gallus governor of egypt against the so-called _ arabium felix _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- of which sabo be king at first he encounter no one at all yet do not proceed without effort the desert the sun and the water -lrb- which have some peculiar nature -rrb- distressed they greatly so that the majority of the army perish the disease prove to be dissimilar to any ordinary complaint and fall upon the head which it cause to wither this kill most of they at once but in the case of the survivor it descend to the leg skip all the intervene part of the body and work injury to they there be no remedy for it except by both drinking and rub on olive oil mix with wine this be in the power of only a few of they to do for the country produce neither of these article and the man have not provide a large supply of they beforehand in the midst of this trouble the barbarian also fall upon they for a while the enemy be defeat whenever they join battle and lose some place : later however with the disease as a ally they win back they own possession and drive the survivor of the expedition out of the country these be the first of the roman -lrb- and i think the only one -rrb- who traverse so much of this part of arabium in warfare they have advance as far as the so-named athlulum a famous locality -lrb- bc 23 -lrb- _ a u _ 731 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -30 - -rrb- augustus be for the eleventh time consul with calpurnius piso when he fall so sick once more as to have no hope of save he life he accordingly arrange everything in the idea that he be about to die and gather about he the official and the other foremost senator and knight he appoint no successor though they be expect that marcellus would be prefer before all for the position after converse briefly with they about public matter he give piso the list of the force and the public revenue write in a book and hand he ring to agrippa the emperor become unable to do even the very simplest thing yet a certain antonius musa manage to restore he to health by means of cold bath and cold drink for this he receive a great deal of money from both augustus and the senate as well as the right to wear gold ring -- he be a freedman -- and secure exemption from tax for both himself and the member of he profession not only those then live but also those of come generation but he who assume the power of fortune and fate be destine soon after to be well worsted augustus have be save in this manner : but marcellus fall sick not much later be treat in the same way by musa and die augustus give he a public burial with the usual eulogy place he in the monument which be be build and honor he memory by call the theater the foundation of which have already be lay by the former cæsar the theater of marcellus he order also that a gold image of the decease a golden crown and he chair of office be carry into the theater at the ludus romanus and be place in the midst of the official have charge of the function this he do later -lrb- -31 - -rrb- after be restore to health on this occasion he bring he will into the senate and wish to read it by way of show people that he have leave no successor to he position he do not however read it for no one would permit that quite every one however be astonish at he in that since he love marcellus as son-in-law and nephew yet he fail to trust he with the monarchy but preferred agrippa before he he regard for marcellus have be show by many honor among they he lending aid in carry out the festival which the young man give as ædile the brilliance of this occasion be show by the fact that in midsummer he sheltered the forum by curtain overhead and introduce a knight and a woman of note as dancer in the orchestra but he final attitude seem to show that he be not yet confident of the youth 's judgment and that he either want the people to get back they liberty or agrippa to receive the leadership from they he understand well that agrippa and the people be on the best of term and he be unwilling to appear to be deliver the supreme power with he own hand -lrb- -32 - -rrb- when he recover therefore and learn that marcellus on this account be not friendly toward agrippa he immediately despatch the latter to syria so that no delay and desultory dispute might arise by they be in the same place agrippa forthwith start from the city but do not make he way to syrium but proceed even more moderately than usual he send he lieutenant there and himself linger in lesbo besides do this augustus appoint ten prætors feel that he do not require any more this number remain constant for several year some of they be intend to fulfill the same duty as of yore and two of they to have charge of the administration of the finances each year have settle these detail he resign the consulship and go to albanum he himself ever since the constitution have be arrange have hold office for the entire year as have most of he colleague and he wish now to interrupt this custom again in order that as many as possible might be consul he resignation take place outside the city to prevent he be hinder in he purpose for this act he receive praise as also because he choose to take he place lucius sestius who have always be a enthusiastic follower of brutus have campaign with the latter in all he war and even at this time make mention of he have he image and deliver eulogy so far from dislike the friendly and faithful quality of the man the emperor even honor he the senate consequently vote that augustus be tribune for life and that he might bring forward at each meeting of the senate any business he like concern any one matter even if he should not be consul at the time and allow he to hold the office of proconsul once for all perpetually so that he have neither to lay it down on enter the pomerium nor to take it up again outside the body also grant he more power in subject territory than the several governor possess as a result both he and subsequent emperor gain a certain legal right to the use of the tribunican authority in addition to they other power but the actual name of tribune neither augustus nor any other emperor have hold -lrb- -33 - -rrb- and it seem to I that he then acquire these rights as describe not from flattery but as a mark of real honor in most way he behave toward the roman as if they be free citizen for when tiridate in person and envoy from phraate arrive to settle they mutual dispute he introduce they to the senate after this when the decision of the question have be entrust to he by that body he refuse to surrender tiridate to phraate but send back to he he son whom tiridate have formerly receive from the other and be keep on condition that the captive and the military standard take in the disaster of crassus and of antony be return in this same year one of the inferior ædiles die and gaius calpurnius succeed he in spite of have serve previously as one of the patrician ædiles this be not mention as have occur in the case of any other man during the feriæ there be two præfecti urbi each day and one of they who be not yet admit to the standing of a youth nevertheless hold office livium however be accuse of have cause the death of marcellus because he have be prefer before she son this suspicion become a matter of controversy both in that year and in the follow which prove so unhealthful that great number perish during its progress and as it usually happen that some sign occur before such event so on this occasion a wolf have be catch in the city fire and storm damage many building and the tiber rise wash away the wooden bridge and render the city submerge for three day -lrb- footnote 1 : follow

city and many object be strike by thunderbolt among they the statue in the pantheon and the spear even fall from the hand of augustus the pestilence rage throughout italy so that no one till the land and i think that the same be the case in foreign part the roman therefore reduce to dire strait by disease and by famine think that this have happen to they for no other reason than that they do not have augustus for consul this time also they accordingly wish to elect he as dictator and shut the senate up within its hall they force it to vote this measure by threaten to burn down the building next they take the twenty-four rod and accost augustus beg he both to be name dictator and to become commissioner of grain as pompey have once be he accept the latter duty under compulsion and order two man from among those who have serve as prætors five year or more previously in every instance to be choose annually to attend to the distribution of grain as for the dictatorship however he would not hear of it and go so far as to rend he clothing when he find himself unable to restrain they in any other way either by reasoning or by prayer as he already have authority and honor even beyond that of dictator he do right to guard against the jealousy and hatred which the title would arouse -lrb- -2 - -rrb- he course be the same when they wish to elect he censor for life without enter upon the office himself he immediately designate other as censor namely paulus æmilius lepidus and lucius munatius plancus the latter a brother of that plancus who have be proscribe and the former a person who at that time have himself be under sentence of death these be the last private citizen to hold the appointment as be at once make manifest by the man themselves the platform on which they be intend to perform the ceremony pertain to they position fall to the ground in piece when they have ascend it on the first day of they office after that there be no other censor appoint together as they have be even at this time augustus in spite of they have be choose take care of many matter which properly belong to they of the public mess he abolish some altogether and reform other so that greater temperance prevail he commit the charge of all the festival to the prætors command that a appropriation be give they from the public treasury moreover he forbid they to spend from they own means on these occasion more than they receive from the other source or to have arm combat under any other condition than if the senate should vote for it and even then there be to be not more than two such contest in each year and they should consist of not more than one hundred and twenty man to the curule ædiles he entrust the extinguishment of conflagration for which purpose he grant they six hundred slave assistant and since knight and woman of note have thus early appear in the orchestra he forbid not only the child of senator to whom the prohibition have even previously extend but also they grandchild who naturally find a place in the equestrian class to do anything of the sort again -lrb- -3 - -rrb- in these ordinance he let both the substance and the name of the lawgiver and emperor be see in other matter he be more moderate and even come to the aid of some of he friend when they conduct be subject to official scrutiny but a certain marcus primus be accuse of have make war upon the odrysa while he be governor of macedonium who say at one time that he have do it with the approval of augustus and again with that of marcellus the emperor thereupon come of he own accord into the court and when interrogate by the prætors as to whether he have instruct the man to make war enter a denial the advocate of primus licinius murena in the course of some rather disrespectful remark that he make to he enquire : what be you do here and who summon you to this augustus only reply : the public good for this he receive praise from sensible person and be even give the right to convene the senate as often as he please some of the other look down upon he indeed not a few vote for the acquittal of primus and other unite to form a plot against cæsar fannius cæpio be at the head of it though other have a share murena also be say whether truly or by way of calumny to have be one of the conspirator since he be insatiate and unsparing in he outspokenness to all alike these man do not appear for trial in court but be convict by default on the supposition that they intend to flee shortly after however they be put to death murena find neither he brother proculeius nor mæcenas he sister 's husband of any avail though they be the recipient of distinguished honor from augustus and as some of the juryman actually vote to acquit these conspirator the emperor make a law that vote should not be cast secretly in case by default and that the person on trial must receive a unanimous conviction that he authorize these provision not in anger but as really conducive to the public good he give overwhelming evidence cæpio 's father liberate one of he slave who have accompany he son on he flight because he have wish to defend the younger man when he meet he death but a second slave who have betray he the father lead through the middle of the forum with a inscription make know the reason why he should be kill and after that crucify he : yet at all this the emperor show no indignation he would have allay all the criticism of those not please with the course of event have he not allow sacrifice as for some victory to be both vote and offer -lrb- -4 - -rrb- it be at this period that he restore both cyprus and gallium narbonensis to the people as province no longer need he administration of martial law thus proconsul begin to be send to these place also he also dedicate the temple of jupiter tonan concern which event these two tradition survive -- that at the time thunder occur during the ritual and that later augustus have a dream which i shall proceed to describe he think that the throng have come to do reverence to the deity partly attract by the novelty of he name and form and partly because he have be put in place by augustus but chiefest of all because they encounter he first when they ascend the capitol and he dream that jupiter in the great temple be angry because he be now reduce to second place and that he himself thereupon say to the offended god -lrb- as he report the story -rrb- that he have tonan as a advance guard when it become day he attach a bell to the statue by way of confirm the vision for those who guard apartment house by night carry a bell in order to be able to signal the inhabitant whenever they wish -- these event then take place at rome -lrb- -5 - -rrb- about this same period the cantabrus and the asture break out into war again the action of the asture be due to the haughtiness and cruelty of carisius the cantabrus on the other hand take the field because they learn that the other tribe be in revolt and because they despise they governor gaius furnius since he have but lately arrive and they conceive he to be unacquainted with condition in they territory he do not however show himself that sort of man in action for both tribe be defeat and reduce to slavery by he carisius even receive help from he not many of the cantabrus be capture as they have no hope of freedom they do not choose to live but some after set the fort on fire stab themselves and other let themselves be consume with the work while still other in the sight of all take poison thus the most of they and the fiercest faction perish as for the asture as soon as they have be repulse in a siege at some point and have subsequently be beat in battle they make no further resistance but be straightway subdue about this same time the ethiopian who dwell beyond egypt advance as far as the city call elephantine with candace as they leader ravage the whole region that they traverse on learn that gaius -lrb- 1 -rrb- petronius the governor of egypt be approach and somewhere near they hastily retreat hope to make good they escape overtaken on the road however they suffer defeat and then draw he on into they own country there too he contend nobly and take among other city napata the royal residence of that tribe this town be raze to the ground and a garrison leave at another post for petronius not be able to advance farther on account of the sand and the heat nor to remain conveniently on the spot with he entire army withdraw take the most of it with he at that the ethiopian attack the garrison but he again proceed against they rescue he own man and compel candace to make term with he -lrb- bc 21 -lrb- _ a u _ 733 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -6 - -rrb- while this be go on augustus go to sicily in order to settle the affair of that island and of other country as far as syrium while he be still there the roman populace fall to dispute over a election of the consul this incident show clearly that it be impossible for they to be safe under a democracy for with the little power that they have over election and in regard to office even they begin rioting the place of one of the consul be be keep for augustus and in this way at the beginning of the year marcus lollius alone enter upon office as the emperor would not accept the place quintus lepidus and lucius silvanus become rival candidate and throw everything into such turmoil that augustus be invoke by those who still retain they sens he would not return however and send they back when they come to he rebuke they and bid they cast they vote during the absence of both claimant this do not promote peace any the more but they begin to quarrel and dispute again vehemently so that it be long before lepidus be choose augustus be displeased at this for he could not spend all he time at rome alone and he do not dare to leave the city without a head seek therefore for some one to set over it he judge agrippa to be most suitable for the purpose and as he wish to clothe he in some greater dignity than common in order that this might help he to govern the people more easily he summon he compel he to divorce he wife -lrb- although she be cæsar 's own niece -rrb- and to marry julium and forthwith send he to rome to attend both to the wedding and to the administration of the city this step be say to have be due partly to the advice of mæcenas who in conversation with he upon these very matter say : you have make he so great that he should either become you son-in-law or be kill -- agrippa heal the sore which he find still festering and repel the advance of the egyptian rite which be return once more to the city forbid any one to perform they even in the suburb within eight half-stadium a disturbance arise regard the election of the præfectus urbus -- the one choose on account of the feriæ -- and he do not attempt to quell it but they live through that year without that official this be what _ he _ accomplish -lrb- -7 - -rrb- augustus after settle various affair in sicily and make syracuse together with certain other city roman colony cross over into greece the lacedæmonians he honor by give they cythera and attend they public mess because livium when she flee from italy with she husband and son pass some time there from the athenian as some say he take away ægina and eretrium the produce of which they be enjoy because they have espouse the cause of antony moreover he forbid they to make any one a citizen for money it seem to they that what happen to the statue of athena have tend to they misfortune place on the acropoli face the east it have turn about to the west and spat blood -lrb- bc 20 -lrb- _ a u _ 734 -rrb- -rrb- as for augustus after set the greek world in order he sail to samo pass the winter there and in the spring when marcus apuleius and publius silius become consul proceed to asia and give he attention to matter there and in bithynium though these and the foregoing province be regard as belong to the people he do not make light of they but accord they the very best of care as if they be he own he institute all reform that seem desirable and make a present of money to some while other he instruct to collect a amount in excess of the tribute the people of cyzicus he reduce to slavery because during a uprising they have flog and put to death some roman and when he reach syrium he take the same action in the case of the people of tyre and sidon on account of they uprising -lrb- -8 - -rrb- meanwhile phraate fear that he might lead a expedition against he because as yet none of the agreement have be carry out send back to he the standard and all the captive save a few who in shame have destroy themselves or by elude detection have remain in the country augustus receive they with the appearance of have conquer the parthian in some war he take great pride in the event say that what have be lose in former battle he have recover without a struggle indeed in honor of he success he both command sacrifice to be vote and perform they besides construct a temple of mar ultor on the capitol in imitation of jupiter feretrius for the offer up of the standard moreover he ride into the city on a charger and be with a arch carry a trophy that be what be do later in commemoration of the event at this time he be choose commissioner of the highway round about rome set up the so-called golden milestone and assign road-builder from the rank of the ex-prætors with two lictor to take care of the various street julium also give birth to a child who receive the name gaius and a sacrifice of kine be permit forever upon he birthday now this be do like everything else in pursuance of a decree : privately the ædiles have a horse-race and slaughter of wild beast on the birthday of augustus -- these be the occurrence in the city -lrb- -9 - -rrb- augustus ordain that the subject territory should be manage accord to the custom of the roman but permit ally country to be govern accord to they own ancestral usage he do not think it desirable that there should be any addition to the former or that any new region should be acquire but deem it best for the people to be thoroughly satisfy with what they already possess and he communicate this opinion to the senate therefore he begin no war at this time but give out certain sovereignty -- to iamblichus son of iamblichus he ancestral dominion over the arabian and to tarcondimotus son of tarcondimotus the kingdom of cilicium which he father hold except a few coast district for these together with lesser armenia he grant to archelaus because the median king who have previously rule they be dead to herod he entrust the tetrarchy of a certain zenodorus and to one mithridate though a mere lad commagene since the king of it have kill he father and as the other armenian have prefer charge against artax and have summon he brother tigrane who be in rome the emperor send for tiberius to cast the former out of he kingdom and restore the latter to it once more nothing be accomplish however worthy of the preparation he have make for the armenian slew artax before he arrival still tiberius assume a lofty bearing as if he have effect something by he own ability and all the more when sacrifice be vote in honor of the result and he now begin to have thought about obtain the monarchy when as he be approach philippus a outcry be hear from the field of battle as if come from a army and fire of its own accord shoot up from the altar found by antony upon the rampart these thing contribute to the exalted feeling of tiberius augustus return to samo and once more pass the winter there as a recompense for he stay he award the islander freedom and he attend to many kind of business great number of embassy come to he and the indus who have previously open negotiation about friendship now make term send among other gift tiger which be then for the first time see by the roman as also i think by the greek they likewise present to he a boy without shoulder -lrb- like the statue of herme that we now see -rrb- yet this creature in spite of he anatomy make perfect use of he foot and hand : he would stretch a bow for they shoot missile and sound the trumpet -- how i do not know i merely record the story one of the indus zarmarus whether he belong to the class of sophist and be ambitious on this account or because he be old and be follow some immemorial custom or because he wish to make a display for augustus and the athenian -lrb- for it be there that he have obtain a audience -rrb- choose to die he be therefore initiate into the service of the two goddess -- although it be not the proper time it be say for the ritual -lrb- 2 -rrb- -- through the influence of augustus and have become a initiate he throw himself alive into the fire -lrb- bc 19 -lrb- _ a u _ 735 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -10 - -rrb- the consul that -lrb- 2 -rrb- year be gaius sentius when it be find necessary that a colleague be appoint to hold office with he -- for augustus again refuse to accept the post which be be save for he -- a uprising once more break out in rome and assassination occur so that the senator vote sentius a guard when he express himself as oppose to use it they send envoy to augustus each with two lictor as soon as the emperor learn this and feel assure that nothing but evil would come of it he do not adopt a attitude like he former one toward they but appoint consul from among the envoy themselves quintus lucretius though this man 's name have be post among the proscribed and he hasten to rome himself for this and he other action while absent from the city many honor of all sort be vote none of which he would accept save the founding of a temple to fortuna redux -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- this be the name they apply to she -rrb- and that the day on which he arrive should be number among the thanksgiving day and be call augustalium since even then the magistrate and the rest make preparation to go out to meet he he enter the city by night and on the follow day he give tiberius the rank of the ex-prætors and allow drusus to become a candidate for office five year earlier than custom allow the quarrelsome behavior of the people during he absence do not accord at all with they conduct influence by fear when he be present he be accordingly invite and elect to be commissioner of moral for five year hold the authority of the censor for the same length of time and that of the consul for life be allow to use the twelve rod always and everywhere and to sit in the chair of office in the midst of the consul of any year after vote these measure they beg he to set right all these matter and to enact what law he like and whatever ordinance might be compose by he they call from that very moment _ lege augustæ _ and desire to take a oath that they would abide by they he accept they principal proposition believe they to be necessary but absolve they from the requirement of a oath if they should vote for a measure that suit they he know well that they would observe it even if they make no agreement to that effect otherwise they would not pay any attention to it even if they should take ten thousand pledge to secure it -- augustus do this of the ædiles one voluntarily resign he office by reason of poverty -lrb- -11 - -rrb- agrippa on be send at this time as describe from sicily to rome transact whatever business be urgent and be later assign to the gaul the inhabitant there be at war among themselves and be be harshly use by the celtæ after settle those trouble he go over to spain for the cantabrus who have be capture alive in the war and have be sell severally kill they master return home and unite many for a revolt with the aid of these accession they occupy available site wall they about and concoct scheme against the roman garrison it be against this tribe that agrippa lead a expedition but he have some trouble also with the soldier not a few of they be too old exhaust by the succession of war and in fear of the cantabrus whom they regard as hard to subdue and they consequently would not obey he however by admonition exhortation and the hope that he hold out -lrb- 4 -rrb- he soon make they yield obedience : in fight the cantabrus on the other hand he meet with many failure they have the advantage of experience in affair since they have be slave to the roman and of despair of ever gain safety again in case of capture agrippa lose number of he soldier and degraded numerous other because they have be defeat among other action he prohibit a whole division call the augustan from be so name any longer still after a long time he destroy nearly all of the enemy who be of age for warfare he deprive the rest of they arm and make they go down from the height to the flat land yet he make no communication about they to the senate and do not accept the triumph although vote in accordance with instruction from augustus in these matter he show moderation as be he wont and when ask once by the consul for a opinion in a case concern he brother he would not give it at he own expense he bring in the so-called parthenian water-supply and name it the augustan in this the emperor take so great delight that once when a great scarcity of wine have arise and person be make a terrible to-do about it he declare that agrippa have carefully see to it that they should never perish of thirst -lrb- -12 - -rrb- such be the character of this man of the rest many both make a triumph they object and celebrate it not for render these same service but some for have arrest robber and other for quiet city that be in a state of turmoil for augustus at first at least bestow these reward lavishly upon some and honor a very great number with public burial those person then gain splendor by these fêtes but agrippa be advance by he to a position of comparative independence augustus see that the public business require strict attention and fear that he might as often happen in such case become the victim of plot -lrb- bc 18 -lrb- a u 736 -rrb- -rrb- the breastplate which he often wear beneath he dress even on enter the senate itself he expect would be of small and slight assistance to he in that case therefore he himself first add five year to he term as supreme ruler when the ten-year period have expire -lrb- this take place in the consulship of publius and gnaeus lentulus -rrb- and then he give agrippa many rights almost equal to he own together with the tribunician authority for the same length of time he then say that so many year would suffice they not much later he obtain the remain five belong to he imperial sovereignty so that the number of year become ten again -lrb- -13 - -rrb- when he have do this he next investigate the senatorial body the member seem to he even now to be numerous and he see danger in so large a throng while he feel a hatred for not only such as be notorious for some baseness but also those who be distinguish for they flattery and when no one as previously would resign willingly nor wish alone to incur accusation he himself select the thirty best man -lrb- a point which he confirm by oath -rrb- and bid they after first take the same oath to choose and write down group of five outside of they relative on tablet after this he subject the group of five to a casting of lot with the arrangement that the one man in each who draw a lot should himself be a senator and enroll five other on the same condition there would of course properly be thirty of those choose by other and by those who draw a lot and since some of they be out of town other draw as substitute and attend to what should have be they duty at first this go on so for several day but when some abuse creep in he no longer put the document in the charge of the quaestor nor submit the group of five to lot but he himself read whatever remain and he himself choose the member that be lack : and thus six hundred in all be appoint -lrb- -14 - -rrb- it have be he plan to make they three hundred as in old time and he think he ought to be well satisfied if he find so many of they worthy of the senate but he finally choose a list of six hundred because of the universal displeasure for it come out by reason of the fact that those whose name would be cancel would be many more than those who remain in the body that greater fear of become private citizen prevail among its member than expectation of be senator not even here do the matter rest since some unsuitable person be still enrol a certain licinius regulus after this indignant because he name have be erase whereas he son and several other to whom he think himself superior have be count in rent he clothing in the very senate lay bare he body enumerate he campaign and show they he scar and articuleius pætus one of the senator _ in posse _ besought earnestly that he might retire from he seat in the senate in place of he father who have be reject augustus then make a new organization get rid of some and choose other in they place since even so the name of many have be stricken out and some of they as usually happen in such a case charge that they have be drive out unjustly he immediately accord they the right to behold spectacles and join in festival in common with the senator wear the same garb and he permit they for the future to stand for office most of they come back in the course of time into the senate : some few be leave in a intermediate position regard as belong neither to the senate nor to the people -lrb- -15 - -rrb- after this many at once and many subsequently gain the reputation whether it be true or false of plot against both the emperor and agrippa it be not possible for one outside of such matter to have certain knowledge about they much of what a sovereign do by way of punishment either personally or through the senate on the ground that plot have be make against he be view with suspicion as probably a display of wanton power no matter how justly he may have act for that reason my intention be to record in all matter of this nature simply the regular version of the story not busy myself with aught beyond the public report except in perfectly patent case nor make any ulterior suggestion as to whether any act be just or unjust or any statement true or false let this principle apply to everything which i shall write after this at the time augustus execute a few : lepidus he hate because he son have be detect in a against he and have be punish as well as for other reason he do not however wish to kill he but keep insulting he now in one way now in another he order lepidus against he will to come down from the country to the city and always take he to gathering in order that the man might be subject to the greatest amount of jeer and insolence in view of the change from he former power and dignity he do not treat he in any way as worthy he consideration and at this time he afford he last of all the ex-consul the chance of vote to the rest he be wont to put the question in the order that belong to they but of the ex-consul he use to make one first another second and third and fourth and so on as he like this the consul also do thus it be that he treat lepidus and when antistius labeo enrol the latter among the man who be to be senator at the time the vote on this matter be take the emperor first declare that he have perjure himself and threaten to take vengeance thereupon the other reply : why what harm have i do by keep in the senate one whom you even now still permit to be high priest this answer quiet augustus 's anger for though he have often both privately and publicly be judge worthy of this priesthood he do not deem it right to take it while lepidus live the reply of antistius seem indeed to have be a rather happy one as be the case once when there be talk in the senate to the effect that they ought to take turn in guard augustus for he have say not daring to speak in opposition nor willing to agree : as for I i snore and so can not sleep at the door of he chamber -lrb- -16 - -rrb- among the law that augustus enact be one which provide that those who to gain office bribe any person should be debar from the say office for five year he lay heavier penalty upon the unmarried man and woman without husband and on the other hand offer prize for marriage and the procreation of child and since among the nobility there be far more male than female he allow those who please save the senator to marry freedwoman and order that the offspring of such a man should be deem legitimate at this period a clamor arise in the senate regard the disorderly conduct of the woman and the young man this be allege as a reason for the difficulty of persuade they to contract marriage and when they urge he to remedy this abuse also meanwhile indulge in sarcasm because he enjoy the favor of many woman at first he make answer that the most necessary restriction have be lay down and that anything further could not be define in a similar fashion then when he be drive into a corner he say : you ought to admonish and command you wife what you wish -- just as i myself do when they hear that they ply he with question all the more wish to learn the admonition which he say he give livium reluctantly thereupon he make a few remark about dress and about other adornment about go out and modest behavior on such occasion he care not at all that he do not make good he word in fact something of the sort he have do also while censor they bring before he a young man who have marry a woman after seduce she make the most violent accusation against he : augustus be at a loss what to do not daring to overlook the affair nor yet to administer any rebuke after a very long time he heave a deep sigh and say : the factional dispute have bear many terrible fruit : let we try to forget they and give we attention to the future to see that nothing of the sort occur again inasmuch too as certain infant be obtain by betrothal the honor of married couple but do not accomplish the object in view he order that no betrothal should be valid where a person do not marry before two year have pass that be any one betrothed must be certainly ten year old in order to reap any benefit from it twelve full year as i have say be require by custom for girl to reach the marriageable age -lrb- -17 - -rrb- besides these separate enactment there be one instruct those from time to time in office each to propose one of those who have be prætors three year previously to attend to the distribution of the grain and provide that of that number the four who secure the lot should give out grain in turn : and the præfectus urbus appoint for the feriæ be always to choose one of they the sibylline verse which have become indistinct through lapse of time he order the priest to copy out with they own hand in order that no one else should read they he allow the office to be throw open to all such as have property worth ten myriad denarius and be competent to hold office in accordance with the law this be the value which he at first set upon the senatorial rank : later he raise it to twenty-five myriad upon some of those who live upright life but possess less than ten myriad in the first case or twenty-five in the second he bestow the amount lack again he allow those prætors who so desire to spend on the festival besides what be give they from the public treasury three time as much again so that even if some be vex at the minuteness of he other regulation yet by reason of this one and also because he bring back from exile one pylade a dancer drive out on account of civil quarrel they remember they no longer hence pylade be say to have rejoin very cleverly when the emperor rebuke he for have quarrel with bathyllus a artist in the same line and a relative of mæcenas : it be to you advantage cæsar that the populace should exhaust its energy over we -- these be the occurrence of that year -lrb- bc 17 -lrb- _ a u _ 737 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -18 - -rrb- in the consulship of gaius furnius and gaius silanus agrippa again announce the birth of a son name lucius and augustus immediately adopt he together with he brother gaius not wait for they to become man but appoint they that very moment successor to he office in order that less plot might be direct against he the festival of honor and of virtus he transfer to the day which be at present theirs those that celebrate triumph he command to erect out of the spoil some public work to commemorate they deed the sæcularia he bring for the fifth time to a successful conclusion the orator he order be to give they service without pay on pain of a fine of quadruple the amount they might receive those whom the lot make juryman in any season he forbid to enter any person 's house during that year and since member of the senate show lack of interest in attend meeting of that body he increase the penalty for such as be late without some good excuse -lrb- bc 16 -lrb- _ a u _ 7386 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -19 - -rrb- next he start for gaul during the consulship of lucius domitius and publius scipio make a excuse of the war that have arise in that region for since he have become dislike by many as a result of he long stay in the capital and by inflict penalty offend many who commit some act contrary to the law lay down while he be compel in spare many other to transgress he own enactment he decide to leave the country somewhat after the manner of solon some suspect that he have go away on account of terentium the wife of mæcenas and intend because there be much talk make about they in rome to join she without any gossip during he trip abroad so great be he passion for she that he once have she enter a contest of beauty against livium before start he dedicate the temple of quirinus which he have build up anew by this i mean he have adorn it with seventy-six column equal to the total number of year he have live this consequently cause some to say that he have choose the number purposely and not by mere chance after the consecration of this edifice he arrange through tiberius and drusus for gladiatorial combat permission have be grant they by the senate then he commit to taurus the management of the city together with the rest of italy -- for agrippa have be despatch again to syrium and he no longer look with equal favor on mæcenas because of the latter 's wife -- and take tiberius though he be prætor along he set out on he journey tiberius have become prætor in spite of hold the honor of a ex-prætor and he entire office by a decree be place in the hand of drusus the night follow they departure the hall of youth burn to the ground this be not the only portent that have occur for a wolf have rush along the sacred way into the forum tear man to piece and at a distance from the forum ant be very plainly see together in swarm likewise a gleam all night long keep shooting from the south toward the north prayer be therefore offer for the safe return of augustus meantime they celebrate the quinquennial festival of he sovereignty the expense be bear by agrippa for the latter have be consecrate by he fellow priest to be one of the quindecimvirus to whom the oversight of the event fall in regular succession -lrb- -20 - -rrb- there be much other confusion too during that period the camunnus and vennone alpine tribe fly to arm but be conquer and subdue by publius silius the pannonian in company with the norici overran istrium and after suffer damage at the hand of silius and he lieutenant the former come to term again and be the cause of the norici fall into the same slavery the uprising in dalmatium and in spain be in a short time quell macedonium be ravage by the dentheletus and the scordiscus in thrace somewhat earlier marcus lollius while aid rhoemetalce the uncle and guardian of the child of coty have subjugate the bessus later lucius gallus conquer the sarmatæ in the same dispute and drive they back across the ister the greatest however of the war which at that time fall to the lot of the roman which also have something to do probably with augustus 's leave the city be against the celtæ the sugambrus usipete and tencterus have first seize in they own territory some of the roman and have crucify they after which they cross the rhine and plunder germanium and gaul when the roman cavalry approach they lay a ambush and by take to flight draw they assailant to follow they and though they fall in unexpectedly with the roman leader lollius they conquer even he on ascertain this augustus hasten against they but find no warfare to carry on for the barbarian learn that lollius be get ready and that the emperor be also head a expedition retire into they own territory and make peace give hostage -lrb- bc 15 -lrb- _ a u _ 739 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -21 - -rrb- on this account augustus have no need of arm but the demand of various other business consume the entire time of this year as well as of the next in which marcus libo and calpurnius piso be consul for much injury have be work by the celtæ and much by a certain licinnius -lrb- 5 -rrb- and of this i think the sea-monster have very plainly give they warn beforehand this creature twenty foot broad and three time as long and resemble a woman except for its head have be wash up on the land from the ocean now licinnius be originally a gaul but be capture bring among roman and make a slave to cæsar by whom he be set free and then by augustus he have be make procurator of gaul he have barbarian avarice and roman haughtiness and try to overthrow every person and thing deem superior to himself and to annihilate any power which temporarily appear strong it be he care to supply himself with plenty of fund for the requirement of he ministry as well as to secure a plenty for himself and for member of he family he abuse go so far that in some case where the population pay tribute by the month he make the month fourteen in number he declare that this month call December be really the tenth and for that reason it be necessary to count in also the two last month -lrb- of which he call one undecimber and the other duodecimber -rrb- and to contribute the money that be due for they these quibble bring he into danger the gaul secure the ear of augustus and make a terrible protest so that the emperor first share they indignation and next beg they to be patient of some of the extortion he say he be unaware and other he affect not to believe some thing he conceal be ashamed of have employ such a procurator licinnius however by devise another scheme be enable to laugh to scorn absolutely all they effort when find that augustus be displeased with he and that he be likely to be punish he take the emperor into he house and show he many treasure of silver and gold and many other valuable pile up in heap he say : i have gather these purposely master for you and for the rest of the roman to prevent the inhabitant from get control of so much money and therefore revolt you see i have keep it all for you and herewith give it to you thus the sophist be save by pretend that he have sap the strength of the barbarian to serve augustus -lrb- -22 - -rrb- drusus and tiberius meanwhile be concern with the follow undertaking the rhæti who dwell between noricum and gaul near the tridentine alp close to italy overrun a good part of the adjacent territory of gaul and carry plunder even out of italy such of the roman or they ally as use the road go through they country meet with depredation these action of theirs be of course more or less like those of any nation which have not accept term of peace but further they destroy all the male among they captive not only those who be apparent but also the embryo one in the womb of woman the sex of which they discover by some divination for these reason augustus first send drusus against they : he join battle with a detachment of theirs that meet he near the tridentine mountain and speedily have they route for this exploit he receive the honor belong to prætors later when the tribe have be repulse from italy but still harass gaul the emperor despatch tiberius in addition both of the leader then invade the rhætian country at many point at once -- the lieutenant lead such division as they do not command personally -- and tiberius even cross the lake -lrb- 6 -rrb- in boat in this way by encounter they separately the roman commander spread alarm and have no difficulty in overcome those who come near enough for fight at any time because they have only to deal with scattered force the remainder who have become weaker and more despondent through such tactic they capture and because the land have a large population of male and seem ripe for revolt they deport most of those of military age especially the strongest leave behind only so many as would be sufficient to inhabit the country but unable to make any uprising -lrb- -23 - -rrb- this same year vedius pollio die a man who in general have do nothing deserving notice be the son of libertus ranking as a knight without any achievement of consequence in he record but he have become exceedingly renowned for he wealth and he cruelty so that he have even win a place in history most of the thing that he do it would be wearisome to relate but i may mention that he keep in tank huge eel train to eat man and be accustom to throw to they the slave that he desire to put to death once when he be entertaining augustus the cupbearer shatter a crystal goblet and without respect to the guest he order that the fellow be throw to the eel hereupon the boy fall on he knee supplicate augustus who at first try to persuade pollio not to carry out he intention as he host would not yield the point the emperor say : bring all the rest of the drinking vessel which be of the same sort or any other of value that you may possess for i want to use they and when they be bring he order they to be break the master see this be of course vex but could no longer be angry over one cup consider the great number of other that be ruin and could not punish he servant for what augustus have do therefore reluctantly he take no action that be the sort of person this pollio be who die he leave various bequest to many different person and to augustus a good share of he inheritance together with pausilypum -lrb- 7 -rrb- a place between neapoli and puteolus with instruction that some public work of great beauty should be erect augustus raze he house to the foundation on the pretext that it be necessary for the preparation of the other structure but really with the purpose that he should have no monument in the city and build a colonnade inscribe on it the name not of pollio but of livium this he do later at the time mention he found a number of city as colony in gaul and in spain and restore to the people of cyzicus they freedom to the paphian who have suffer from a earthquake he give money and allow they by a decree to call they city augusta i have record this not because augustus himself and the senator fail to aid many other city both before and after this in case of similar misfortune -- if any one should attempt to mention they all the task of such a historian would be endless -- but my aim be to show that the senate assign name to city as a honor and the latter do not as be the usual procedure now compile for themselves -lrb- each separately -rrb- such list of name as they might choose -lrb- bc 14 -lrb- _ a u _ 740 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- the next year marcus crassus and gnæus cornelius become consul and the curule ædiles after resign they office because they have enter upon it under unfavorable augury take it back again contrary to precedent at another meeting of the assembly the portico of paulus be burn and the fire from it reach the temple of vesta so that the sacred object that this shrine contain be carry up to the palatine by all of the vestal virgin except the eldest -lrb- who have go blind -rrb- and be place in the house of the priest of jupiter the portico be afterward rebuild nominally by æmilius who be the representative of the family that have formerly erect it but really by augustus and the friend of paulus at this time the pannonian revolt and be again subdue and the maritime alp inhabit by ligurian call cometæ and still free even then be reduce to a slave district the revolt in the cimmerian bosporus be also quell one seribonius who maintain that he be a grandson of mithridate and have receive the kingdom from augustus after the death of asander marry the latter 's wife name dynami who be the daughter of pharnace and a grandchild of mithridate and obtain the power commit to she by she husband get control of bosporus agrippa on be inform of this send against he polemon king of the pontus near cappadocium he find seribonius no longer alive for the people of bosporus learning of he ambition have kill he beforehand but when these resist polemon out of fear that he might be allow to reign over they he engage they in a set battle the victory be he but he be unable to reduce they to order until agrippa come to sinope apparently with the intention of conduct a campaign against they at that they lay down they arm and be deliver to polemon the woman dynamis become he spouse -- of course with the sanction of augustus for this outcome sacrifice be make in the name of agrippa but he do not celebrate the triumph though vote to he nay he do not so much as write the senate anything about what have be accomplish as a result subsequent conqueror take he method as a law no longer send any word themselves to the legislative body and do not accept the celebration of a triumph for this reason no one else among he peer -lrb- so i be incline to think -rrb- be permit to do this but they enjoy merely the ornament of triumphal honor -lrb- -25 - -rrb- augustus finally finish order everything in the gaul the germania and the hispaniæ : upon special district he spend a great deal and levy a great deal upon other and to some he give freedom and citizenship whereas from other he take they away -lrb- bc 13 -lrb- _ a u _ 741 -rrb- -rrb- he then leave drusus in germanium and himself return to rome in the consulship of tiberius and of quintilius varus it chance that the news of he come reach the city during those day when cornelius balbus after dedicate the theater now call by he name be give spectacles at this he assume great importance as if it be he that be to bring augustus back though because of a flooding of the tiber there be so great a quantity of water in the theater that no one could enter it save in a boat and tiberius put the vote to balbus first as a honor for he build the theater the senate convene and among other decision resolve to place a altar in the senate-chamber itself to commemorate the return of augustus and that criminal who approach he as suppliant within the pomerium should be exempt from punishment however he accept neither of these honor and even escape a reception by the people on this occasion by be bring into the city under the cover of night this he do almost always whenever he have to go out to the suburb or anywhere else both on he way out and on he way back so that nobody should annoy he the follow day he greet the people on the palatine ascend the capitol and take off the laurel from around he rod he place it upon the knee of jupiter for that day he furnish the people with bath and barber free of charge after this he convene the senate and make no address himself by reason of hoarseness but give the book to the quaestor to read which enumerate he achievement and promulgated rule as to how many year the citizen should serve in the army and how much money they should receive at the end of they service in place of the land for which they be always wont to ask the object be that by be enlist on certain specify term from the very start they should find in they treatment no excuse for revolt the number of year be for the pretorian twelve and for the rest sixteen and the money to be distribute be less for some and more for other these measure cause the soldier neither pleasure nor anger for the time be because they have neither obtain all they be desire nor yet lose everything in the remainder of the population it arouse confident hope of not be deprive of they possession in the future -lrb- -26 - -rrb- he next action be to dedicate the theater call after marcellus in the festival hold on this account the patrician child as well as he grandson gaius perform the troy equestrian exercise and six hundred libyan wild beast be slaughter iullus the son of antony who be prætor celebrate the birthday of augustus with horse-race and slaughterlng of wild beast and entertain both he and the senate -lrb- follow a decree of that body -rrb- upon the capitol after this there be another reorganization of the senate at first the necessary value of they property have be limit to ten myriad denarius because many of they have be deprive by the war of they ancestral estate as time go on and man 's possession become larger it be advance to twenty-five myriad and no one be any longer find who want to be senator on the contrary some child and grandchild of senator of whom a part be really poor and another part have be bring low through calamity suffer by they ancestor not only fail to lay claim to the senatorial dignity but when already place on the list withdraw on oath therefore previous to this while augustus be still out of the city a decree have be pass that the so-called vigintus virus -lrb- 8 -rrb- should be appoint from the knight hence none of they be any long enrol in the senate without have secure some one of the other office that lead to it -- these twenty man be a part of the six-and-twenty -lrb- 9 -rrb- three of they have charge of capital case at law the next three attend to the coinage of the money four act as commissioner of the street in the city ten be put over the court that fall by lot to the _ centumvirus _ the two who be entrust with the road outside the wall and the four who be send to campanium have be abolish the senate have vote during the absence of augustus another measure besides this namely that since nobody could any longer be easily induce to become a candidate for the tribuneship they might appoint by lot some who have be quæstors and be not yet forty year old at this time the emperor make a scrutiny of the whole body of citizen those of they who be over thirty-five year of age he do not trouble but those under that age who have property of the requisite value he force to become senator except in the case of cripple they body he view himself but in regard to they property he accept swear statement the man themselves take the oath -lrb- with other to corroborate they allegation -rrb- and accounting for they lack of fund as well as for they habit of life -lrb- -27 - -rrb- nor do he while observe such strictness in ordinary public business neglect the conduct of he own family indeed he rebuke tiberius because he have seat gaius beside he at the thanksgiving festival which he give in honor of the emperor 's return : and he censure the people for honor he with applause and eulogy on the death of lepidus he be appoint high priest and the senate consequently wish to vote he certain honor -lrb- 10 -rrb- but he declare that he would not accept they and when the senator become urgent he rise and leave the gathering so that measure be not ratify and he receive no official residence but because it be absolutely essential that the high priest should live on public ground he make a portion of he own dwelling public property the house of the rex sacrificulus however he give to the vestal virgin because it be separate merely by a wall from they apartment cornelius sisenna be blame for the conduct of he wife and state in the senate that he have marry she with the knowledge and on the advice of the emperor -- whereat augustus grow exceedingly angry he indulge in no violence of word or action but hurry out of the senate-chamber and then a little later come back again choose rather to do this -lrb- as he say to he friend afterward -rrb- in spite of its not be right than to remain where he be and be compel to do some harm -lrb- bc 12 -lrb- _ a u _ 742 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -28 - -rrb- meantime he bestow upon agrippa who have come from syrium the great honor of the tribunician authority for another five year and send he out to pannonium which be ready for war allow he greater power than official outside of italy ordinarily possess agrippa make the campaign though it already be winter : marcus valerius and publius sulpicius be the consul as the pannonian become terror stricken at he approach and show no further sign of uprising he return and on reach campanium fall sick augustus happen to be give under the name of he child contest of armed warrior at the panathenaic festival and when he learn of agrippa 's condition he leave the country find he dead he convey he body to the capital and allow it to lie in state in the forum he also deliver the oration over the dead man with a curtain stretch in front of the corpse why he do this i know not yet some have say it be because he be high priest and other because he be discharge the function of censor both be mistake a high priest be not forbid to behold a corpse nor yet a censor except when he be about to put the finishing touch to the census then if he see such a object before he purification all he work be render null and void besides this oration augustus conduct he funeral procession in the way that he own be later conduct he bury he in he own tomb though the decease have a lot of he own in the campus martius -lrb- -29 - -rrb- such be the end of agrippa who have in every way prove himself clearly the noblest of the man of he day and use the friendship of augustus for the emperor 's own greatest benefit and for that of the commonwealth so much as he surpass other in excellence to such a extent do he voluntarily make himself lower than he patron he employ all he own skill and bravery for what would prove most profitable to augustus and expend all the honor and power receive from he on benefit other as a result he never become in the least troublesome to augustus nor the object of jealousy on the part of other he help he friend organize the monarchy like one who be really in love with the idea of supreme power and he win over the populace by he kindness show himself most truly a friend of the people at he death he leave they garden and the bath-house call after he name so that they might bathe free of charge and he give augustus certain land for this purpose the latter not only render these public property but distribute to the people also a hundred denarius apiece with the explanation that agrippa have order it he have inherit most of the decease 's property among the article of which be the hellespontine chersonese which have come i know not how into the possession of agrippa the emperor feel he loss for a very long time and therefore cause the populace to hold he in honor a posthumous son bear to he he call agrippa however he do not allow any of the citizen to omit any of the ancestral custom -lrb- although none of the more prominent man wish to present himself for the festival -rrb- and he personally superintend the gladiatorial combat they be often give too in he absence -- this demise of agrippa be not only a private loss to he own household but a public loss to all the roman as be show by the fact that portent occur on this occasion as great as be usually see before the most tremendous disaster owl gather in the capital and a bolt of lightning descend upon the house at albanum where the consul reside during the sacrifice -lrb- 11 -rrb- the star call comet stand for several day over the city and be finally dissolve into flash of light many building in the city be destroy by fire among they the tent of romulus which be set ablaze by crow drop upon it burn meat from some altar -- these be the matter of interest connect with agrippa -lrb- -30 - -rrb- after this augustus be choose supervisor and corrector of moral for another five year -- this also he receive for a limited period as he have the monarchy -- and he order the senator to burn incense as often as they have a sit and not to come to he residence : the first that they might show reverence to the god and the second that they might have no difficulty in convene inasmuch as very few become candidate for the tribuneship on account of its power have be abolish he make a law that magistrate should each nominate one of the knight who possess not less than twenty-five myriad the people should then choose from these the number lack and if the man desire to be senator afterward well and good otherwise they should return again to the rank of knight the province of asia also stand very greatly in need of some assistance on account of earthquake and he therefore pay into the public treasury from he own resource they annual tribute and assign they a governor for two year choose by lot and not arbitrarily select apuleius and mæcenas be at one time bitterly revile in some court of adultery not because they have themselves behave wantonly but because they have actively aid the man on trial thereupon augustus enter the courtroom and sit in the prætor 's chair : he do nothing violent but simply forbid the accuser to insult he relative or friend and then rise and leave the place for this action and other the senator honor he with statue pay for by private subscription and by give bachelor and spinster the right to behold spectacles with other people and to attend banquet on he birthday neither of these privilege be previously permit they -lrb- -31 - -rrb- when now agrippa whom he love for he excellence and not through any compulsion have die the emperor find that he need a assistant in the public business one who would far surpass the rest in both honor and power who might manage everything opportunely and be free from envy and plot therefore he reluctantly choose tiberius for he own grandson be at this time still minor he cause he also to divorce he wife though she be a daughter of agrippa by another marriage and have one child a infant and be soon to give birth to another and have betroth julium to he he send he out against the pannonian this people have for a time be quiet fear agrippa but now after he death they revolt tiberius subdue they have ravage considerable of they territory and do much injury to its inhabitant he have as enthusiastic ally the scordiscus who be neighbor of theirs and similarly equip he take away they arm and sell for export most of the male population that be of age for these achievement the senate vote he a triumph but augustus do not allow he to hold it grant he instead the triumphal honor -lrb- -32 - -rrb- drusus have this same experience the sugambrus and they ally owe to the absence of augustus and the fact that the gaul be restive under the yoke of slavery have become hostile and he therefore occupy the subject territory before they send for the foremost man on the pretext of the festival which they celebrate even now about the altar of augustus at lugdunum also he observe the celta cross the rhine and drive they back next he cross over to the land of the usipete opposite the very island of the batavus and from there march along the river to the sugambri country devastate vast stretch he sail along the rhine to the ocean conciliate the frisius and traverse the lake invade chauci where he run in danger as he boat be left high and dry at the ebb-tide of the ocean he be save at this time by the frisius -lrb- who join he expedition with infantry -rrb- and withdraw for it be now winter -lrb- bc 11 -lrb- _ a u _ 743 -rrb- -rrb- come to rome he be make aedile -lrb- 12 -rrb- in the consulship of quintus aelius and paulus fabius though he have already prætor 's honor -lrb- -33 - -rrb- at the opening of the spring he set out again to the war cross the rhine and subjugate the usipete he bridge the lupium invade the country of the sugambrus and advance through it into cherusci as far as the visurgi he be able to do this because the sugambrus in anger at the chattus the only tribe among they neighbor that have refuse to join they alliance have make a campaign of the whole population against they drusus take this opportunity to traverse they country unnoticed and he would nave cross also the visurgi have not provision grow scarce and the they country and though beat at first vanquish they in turn and ravage both that land and the territory of adjacent tribe which have take part in the uprising immediately he reduce all of they to subjugation gain control of some with they consent terrifying other into reluctant submission and engage in pitched battle with other later when some of they rebel he again enslave they and for this thanksgiving and triumphal honor be accord he -lrb- -35 - -rrb- while these event be occur augustus take a census reckoning in all the property that belong to he as a individual might do and also make a list of the senate as he see that many be not always present at the meeting he order that even less than four hundred might constitute a quorum for pass decree previously that have be the minimum number for ratify any measure the senate and the people again contribute money to be spend on image of himself but he would erect no such likeness and only set up representation of the public health of concord and of peace the citizen be always collect money for statue to he on the slightest excuse and at last they cease pay it privately as before but would come to he on the first day of the year and give some more some less he after add as much or more again would return it not only to the senator but to all the rest i have also hear the story that on one day of the year follow some oracle or dream he would assume the guise of a beggar and would accept money from those who pass this whether trustworthy or not be a prevail tradition that year he give julium in marriage to tiberius and he sister octavium die he cause she body to lie in state in the hero-shrine of julius on this occasion too he have a curtain over the corpse he himself deliver there the funeral speech and drusus have change he senatorial dress have a place on the platform for the mourning be a public affair she body be carry in procession by she son-in-law : not all the honor vote to she be accept by augustus at this same time the first priest of jupiter since -lrb- -36 - -rrb- merulum be appoint and the quaestor be order to pay careful heed to the decree pass from time to time because the tribune and the ædiles who have previously be entrust with this business transact it through they assistant and as a result some mistake and confusion take place it be vote moreover that the temple of janus geminus which be open should be close on the assumption that war have cease -lrb- bc 10 -lrb- _ a u _ 744 -rrb- -rrb- it be not close however for the dacian cross the ister on the ice take the crop of pannonium as booty and the dalmatian revolt at the imposition of tax against the latter tiberius be send from gaul whither he have go in company with augustus and he restore order the nation of the celtæ and especially the chattus be partly weaken and partly subdue by drusus the tribe mention have go to join the sugambrus have abandon they own country which the roman have give they to dwell in the emperor delay in lugduni where he could keep a sharp watch on affair as it be so near the celtæ the victor return to rome with augustus assume whatever dignity have be vote they by the senate and

the entire district this albi rise in the vandaliscan mountain and empty in a great flood into the ocean this side of the arctic sea drusus undertake to cross it but fail in the attempt set up trophy and withdraw for a woman taller than mankind confront he and say : whither be thou hasten insatiable drusus it be not fate that thou shalt see all this region depart for thee the end of labor and of life be already at hand it be strange to think that any such voice should have come to a person 's ear from the apparition yet i can not discredit the tale for he at once retire and as he be return in haste he die on the way of some disease before he reach the rhine proof of the story seem to I to lie in the fact that at the time of he death wolf prowl and yelp about the camp and two youth be see ride through the middle of the rampart a kind of lamentation in a woman 's voice be also hear and there be shoot star in the sky these be the noteworthy point -lrb- -2 - -rrb- augustus soon learn that he be sick -lrb- for he be not far off -rrb- send tiberius to he with speed the latter find he still breathe and on he death carry he body to rome cause the centurion and military tribune to convey he over the first stage -- as far as the winter quarter of the army -- and from there the foremost man of each city when the decease be lay in state in the forum a double funeral oration be deliver tiberius eulogize he there and augustus in the flaminian hippodrome since the latter have be abroad on a campaign it be impious for he to do otherwise than perform the fitting rite in honor of the exploit of drusus at the very entrance of the pomerium the body be carry to the campus martius by the knight both those who belong strictly to the equestrian order and those as well who be of senatorial family -lrb- 2 -rrb- then after be give to the flame it be deposit in the monument of augustus he and he child receive the title of germanicus and honor in the way of both image and a arch besides obtain a cenotaph close to the rhine itself tiberius while drusus be still alive have overcome the dalmatian and pannonian who be again a little restless have celebrate a triumph on horseback and have banquet the people a part on the capitol and a part in many other place at this time also livium and julium together entertain the woman same festivity be be make ready for drusus the feriæ be to be hold a second time on this account so that he might celebrate he triumph on the same occasion but he untimely death upset the plan as a consolation to livium image be award she and she be enrol among the mother of three child for upon such man or woman as be not grant so many offspring by heaven or at least upon some of they a law emanate formerly from the senate but now from the emperor bestow the dignity belong to parent of three child in this way they be not subject to the reproach for childlessness and may receive all but a few of the prize for fecundity not only man but god enjoy the privilege to the end that if any one die leave they anything they may take possession of it these be the fact of the matter -lrb- -3 - -rrb- augustus order that the sitting of the senate should be hold on specify day previously there have be no real system about they and some member on that account be often late therefore he appoint two regular monthly council so that those whom the law summon should be under compulsion to attend and in order that no other excuse for they absence should be within they power he command that no court or other meeting which require they attention should be hold at that time he make provision with respect to the number necessary for ratify decree under each separate category to put it briefly and he increase the fine impose upon those who without good excuse be not present at the gathering inasmuch as many such offence have generally go unpunished owe to the large number of those who have incur penalty he command that if many should do this they should draw lot and every fifth one to draw a lot should be hold liable to punishment -- the name of all the senator he have record on a white tablet and conspicuously post from the beginning make by he this be now annually do _ he _ intention in do it be to make it absolutely necessary for they to come together sometimes by some accident not so many might assemble as a special case demand this would be know because except on such day as the emperor himself might be present the number of those in attendance be both at this time and later carefully ascertain and with a great degree of accuracy under these circumstance they would deliberate and they decision would be record but it be not final be not ratify : instead _ auctorita _ be declare in order that they _ will _ might be evident -- for such be the force of this word to translate the term into greek by a single expression be not possible this same custom prevail in case they ever assemble through haste in a irregular place or on a day that be not fitting or without a legal summons or if because of the opposition of tribune a decree could not be pass but they opinion be not to be conceal later ratification be grant accord to ancestral precedent to the resolution in question and the latter obtain the name of _ senatus consultum _ this method strictly observe for a extremely long period by the man of old time have in a already become null and void -- as also the prerogative of the prætors for the latter be indignant that they might bring no proposition before the senate although they rank above the tribune in dignity and they receive from augustus the right of do so but in the course of time it be take away from they again -lrb- -4 - -rrb- these and other law which he at this time enact he inscribe on white tablet and submit to the senate before take any final action with regard to they and he allow the senator to read each one the article separately he object be that if any provision do not please they or if they could suggest anything better they might speak he be very desirous of be democratic and once when one of the companion of he campaign ask he to aid he in the capacity of advocate at first he pretend to be busy and bid one of he friend serve as advocate when however the petitioner grow angry and say : but as often as you need my assistance i do not send somebody else to you in place of myself but in person i encounter danger everywhere in you behalf the emperor then enter the courtroom and plead he cause he also stand by a friend of he who be defendant in a suit have first communicate this very purpose to the senate : he save the friend but be so far from be angry at he accuser although the latter speak most bluntly that when he have to undergo a scrutiny regard he moral the emperor acquit he say that he bluntness be a necessary thing on account of the out-and-out baseness of the mass of mankind augustus indeed punish other who be report to be conspire against they sovereign he have quæstors hold office in the coast district near the city and in certain other part of italy and this he do for several year yet at this time he be unwilling as i have remark -lrb- 3 -rrb- to enter the city on account of drusus 's death -lrb- bc 8 _ -lrb- a u 746 -rrb- _ -rrb- -lrb- -5 - -rrb- but the next year in which asinius gallus and graius marcius be consul he come back and carry the laurel contrary to custom into the temple of jupiter feretrius no festival do he celebrate over he achievement think that he have lose far more in the death of drusus than he have gain by the victory the consul carry out the program usual on such occasion and set some of the captive to fight with one another later when they and the rest of the official be accuse of have be appoint by means of some bribery he do not investigate the case but pretend not even to know of it he do not like to visit punishment on any of they or to pardon they if they be convict but from office seeker he demand before the election a deposit of money as a guarantee that they would resort to no such method on pain of forfeit what they have pay in this course all approve -- as it be not permissible for a slave to be tortured for evidence against he master he order that as often as the necessity for such a course should arise the slave should be sell either to the state or to he in order that be now the property of some one else than the man on trial he might be examine some find fault with this because the law be to be invalidate by the change of master but other declare it to be necessary because many under the previous arrangement unite to take advantage of the loophole offer and to get the office -lrb- -6 - -rrb- augustus after this although as he say he be mind to lay aside the supreme power since the second ten-year period have run out resume it again with a show of reluctance and make a campaign against the celtæ he himself remain behind on roman territory but tiberius cross the rhine the barbarian in dread of he all except the sugambrus make overture for peace but they do not obtain they request at this time -- for augustus refuse to conclude a truce with they if they lack the sugambrus -- nor do they later to be sure the sugambrus too send envoy but they fail completely to accomplish anything : on the contrary all of they a numerous and distinguished band meet a untimely end augustus arrest they and place they in various city : they take this very much amiss and committed suicide the tribe then be quiet for a time but later they amply requite the roman for the calamity -- besides do this augustus grant money to the soldier not as to victor though he himself have take the name of imperator and have give it to tiberius but because this be the first time that they have gaius appear in the exercise with they he advance tiberius to the position of imperator in place of drusus and besides exalt he with that title appoint he consul once more accord to the ancient custom he have a write notice bulletine for the public benefit before tiberius enter upon the office and he furthermore accord he the solemnity of a triumph augustus himself do not wish to hold it but obtain the privilege of a horse-race perpetually upon he birthday he enlarged the pomerium and rename the month call sextilis augustus the people generally want September to be so name because he have be bear in it but he prefer the other month in which he have first be appoint consul and have conquer in many great battle it be in these thing that he take pride -lrb- -7 - -rrb- the death of mæcenas cause he grief he have enjoy many kind service at he hand for which reason he have entrust he though but a knight with the care of the city for a long time but especially be he ministry of use when the emperor 's passion become nearly uncontrollable mæcenas be then able to banish he anger and to lead he into a gentler frame of mind here be a instance mæcenas once find he patron hold court and see that would undoubtedly condemn many person to death he undertake to push through the bystander and get find this impossible he write on a tablet : pray desist now executioner make as if it contain something different he throw it into the lap of augustus and the latter impose no death sentence but immediately rise and leave the emperor be not displeased at such hint but rather glad of they because whatever excess of anger he feel by reason of he own nature and the press of affair he be able to tone down with the aid of he friend 's frank advice -- this also be a very great proof of mæcenas 's excellence that he make himself like by augustus in spite of resist he project and pleased all the people though he have tremendous influence with the emperor so that he could bestow office and honor upon many man he do not lose he head but continue to the end of he life in the equestrian class for all these reason augustus miss he greatly and he be affect by the fact that he minister though irritated about he own wife have leave he as he heir and have put all he property save a very small amount in he hand to give to he friend or not as he see fit such be the character of mæcenas and such he treatment of augustus he be the first to construct a swimming pool of warm water in the city and the first to devise sign for letter to facilitate speed -- a system which through aquilum -lrb- 4 -rrb- a freedman he teach to a number -lrb- bc 7 -lrb- _ a u _ 747 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -8 - -rrb- tiberius on the first day that he begin the consulship with gnæus piso convene the senate in the octavium because it be outside the pomerium after assign himself the duty of repair the temple of concord in order that he might inscribe upon it he own name and that of drusus he hold he triumph and in company with he mother dedicate the so-called precinct of livium he himself entertain the senate on the capitol and she the woman privately not much later as there be some disturbance in germany he take the field the festival hold in honor of the return of augustus be manage by gaius together with piso in he place the campus agrippæ -lrb- except the portico -rrb- and the diribitorium augustus himself make public property the latter be the largest house ever construct under a single roof now the whole top of it have be take off because it could not be put together solidly again and the edifice stand wide open to the sky agrippa have leave it still in the process of building and it be complete at this time the portico in the plain which polla he sister -lrb- who have also decorate the race-course -rrb- be make be not yet finish meantime funeral combat in honor of agrippa be give all except augustus wear dark clothing and even he son the same and there be both duel and contest of group they be hold in the sæpta out of honor to agrippa and because many of the structure surround the forum have be burn the blame for the fire be lay upon the debtor class and they be suspect of have set it with the purpose of have some of they debt remit when they appear to have lose considerable they obtain nothing however the lane at this time be provide with certain supervisor from among the people whom we call road commissioner -lrb- 5 -rrb- they be allow to use official dress and two lictor just in the place where they have jurisdiction and on certain day and they be give charge of the body of slave which previously have accompany the ædiles to save building that be set afire -- a arrangement still continue to the present day they together with the tribune and prætors be by lot appoint to have charge of the entire city which be divide into fourteen ward -- these be all the event of that year for nothing worthy of mention happen in germany -lrb- bc 6 -lrb- _ a u _ 748 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -9 - -rrb- the year follow which mark the consulship of gaius antistius and lælius balbus augustus be displeased to see that gaius and lucius who be be bring up in the lap of sovereignty do not carefully imitate he way they not only live too luxuriously but show unseemly audacity lucius once enter the theater by himself and become the center of attraction of the whole population some merely let he engross they thought and other openly pay court to he this treatment make he more arrogant and among he other doings he propose for consul gaius who be not yet a iuveni he father however express the earnest wish that no such complication of circumstance might arise as once occur in he own case -- that any one younger than twenty should be consul when the people still remain urgent he then say that a man ought to receive this office at time when he would not be liable to error himself and could resist the passion of the populace after that he give gaius a priesthood with the right of attendance in the senate and of behold spectacles and sit at banquet with that body and wish in some way -lrb- 6 -rrb- to rebuke they still more severely he bestow upon tiberius the tribunician authority for five year and assign to he armenia which be become estrange since the death of tigrane the result be that he be soon at odds with the people and tiberius though without effect anything the people feel that they have be slight and tiberius fear they anger he be however soon send to rhode on the pretext that he need some education and he take not even he entire retinue to say nothing of other that so he appearance and he deed might drop out of they mind -lrb- the trip he make as a private person except in so far as he compel the parian to sell he the statue of vesta that it might be place in the temple of concord when he reach the island he neither behave at all nor speak in a overweening way -- this be the truest reason for he foreign journey -rrb- there be also a story current that he do this on account of he wife julium because he could no longer endure she at any rate she be leave behind at rome -lrb- other have say that he be angry at not have be designate cæsar other still that he be drive out by augustus be accuse of plot against the latter 's child but that he departure be not for the sake of education nor because he be displeased at the decree pass become plain from many of he subsequent action and especially through he immediately open he will at that time and read it to he mother and to augustus but all possible conjecture be make -rrb- -lrb- bc 5 -lrb- _ a u _ 749 -rrb- -rrb- the following year augustus in the course of he twelfth consulship place gaius among the iuvene and at the same time bring he before the senate declare he princeps luventutis and allow he to become cavalry commander \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- bc 2 -lrb- _ a u _ 752 -rrb- -rrb- and after the elapse of a year lucius also obtain all the honor that have be grant to he brother gaius on a occasion when the populace have gather and be ask that some reform be institute when indeed they have send for this purpose the tribune to augustus lucius come and deliberate with they about they demand and at this all be pleased -lrb- -10 - -rrb- augustus limit the number of the populace to be supply with grain something previously leave vague to twenty myriad and as some say he give each one sixty denarius to mar and that he himself and he grandson as often as they pleased and those who be pass from the classification of child and be be register among the iuvene should invariably resort thither that magistrate be despatch to office abroad should make that they starting-point that the senate should there declare they vote in regard to the grant of triumph and the victor celebrate they should devote to this mar they sceptre and they crown that such victor and all other who might obtain triumphal honor should have they likeness in bronze erect in the forum that in case military standard capture by the enemy be ever recover they should be place in the temple

have the right to undertake the work of furnish the horse that be to compete in the equestrian contest as well as the general care of the temple precisely as have be provide by law in the case of apollo and in the case of jupiter capitolinus these matter settle augustus dedicate that spacious hall : yet to gaius and to lucius he give once and for all power to officiate at all similar consecration on the strength of a kind of consular authority -lrb- found on precedent -rrb- that they be to use they too direct the horse-race on this occasion and they brother agrippa take part with

course of the spectacle he let water into the flaminian hippodrome and thirty-six crocodile be there cut in piece however augustus do not serve as consul every day continuously but after hold office a little while he give the title of the consulship to another these be the exercise in honor of mar to augustus himself a sacred contest be offer in neapoli the campanian city nominally because he have help it rise when it be prostrate by earthquake and by fire but in reality because the inhabitant alone of they neighbor be enthusiastic over greek custom and he also receive the title of father with bind force -lrb- for previously he be merely speak of by that name and no decree have be pass -rrb- moreover it be now that for the first time he appoint two pretorian prefect quintus ostorius scapula and publius salvius aper this term prefect be the word which i too shall use solely to designate the commander of any body since it have win its way into general currency likewise pylade the dancer

similarly the prætor quintus crispinus conduct game -lrb- though i need lay no emphasis on that point -rrb- and under he management knight and woman of family not unknown to fame be bring into the orchestra but of all this augustus make no account he daughter julium however prove so dissolute that she hold revel and drinking bout by night in the forum and on the very rostrum when at last he find this out he be exceedingly enraged he have guess before that she do not lead a right life but refuse to believe it for those who hold supreme power be acquaint with anything better than with they own affair they own deed do not go undetected by they associate but they be not fully aware of the latter 's in this instance -lrb- when he learn what be go on -rrb- he give way to such violent rage that he could not keep the matter to himself but communicate it to the senate as a result she be banish to the island of pandaterium near campanium and she mother scribonium voluntarily be the

war impend no chastisement be visit upon the rebel immediately nevertheless the war with the parthian do not materialize phratace hear that gaius be in syrium equip with consular power and be furthermore uneasy about home interest in which even previously he have fail to discern a friendly feeling hence he hasten to effect a reconciliation secure on the proviso that he himself should

be he wish to take up he abode somewhere in syrium augustus in the depth of grief communicate he desire to the senate and urge he to come at any rate to italy and then do what he please so gaius resign at once all the duty of he office and take a coastwise trading vessel to lycium where at limyra he breathe he last prior to he demise the spark of lucius 's life have also pale -lrb- he too be

without interest he be praise and reverence by all once when a fire destroy the palace and many person offer he large amount he would take nothing except a aureus from the various people and a

property value at not less than five myriad denarius the weaker citizen and those dwelling outside of italy he do not compel to undergo the taking of a census for he fear that they might be disturbed

time the emperor be a prey to great perplexity not wish to kill the man -- for he see that no greater safety would be he by they destruction -- nor yet to let they go for fear this might attract other to conspire against he while he be in a dilemma as to what he should do and could not be free from anxiety by day nor from terror by night livium one day say to he : -- what be this husband why be it you do not sleep wife answer augustus who could be even to the slightest degree free from care that have so many enemy and be so constantly the object of plot of one set of man or another do you not see how many be attack both I and we sovereignty the vengeance mete out to those find guilty do not retard they : quite the contrary as if they be press forward to do some noble action the rest also hasten to perish similarly livium hearing this say : that you should be the object of plot be not remarkable nor be it contrary to human nature have so large a empire you must do many thing and naturally you cause grief to not a few people a ruler can not please all : on the contrary even a exceedingly upright sovereign must inevitably make foe of many person for those who wish to be unjust be many more than those who act justly and they desire it be impossible to satisfy even among such as possess a certain excellence some yearn for many great reward which they can not obtain and some chafe because they be inferior to other : so both of they find fault with the ruler from this you can see that it be impossible to avoid evil and furthermore that of all the attack make none be upon you but all upon you position of supremacy if you be a private citizen no one would willingly do you any harm unless he have previously receive some injury but for the supremacy and for the good thing that it contain all yearn and those who occupy any post of influence far more than they inferior it be the nature of wicked man who have very little sense to do so it be implant in they disposition just like anything else and it be impossible by either persuasion or compulsion to remove such a bent from some of they there be no law or fear stronger than natural tendency reflect on this and do not take the offence of other so hard but keep yourself and you supremacy carefully guard that we may hold it safely not by virtue of inflict severe punishment but by means of strict watchfulness -lrb- -15 - -rrb- to this augustus reply : wife i too know that nothing great be ever free from envy and plot -- least of all sole power we should be peer of the god if we do not have trouble and care and fear beyond all private individual but to I it be also a source of grief that this be inevitably so and that no cure for it can be find yet say livium since some man be so constitute as to want to do wrong in any event let we guard against they we have many soldier who protect we -- some marshal against foreign foe and other about you person -- and a large retinue so that by they help we may live safely both at home and abroad i do not need say augustus interrupt to state that many man on many occasion have perish at the hand of they immediate associate for in addition to other disadvantage this too be a most distressing thing in monarchy that we fear not only enemy -lrb- like other people -rrb- but also we friend many more ruler have be plot against by such person than by those who have nothing to do with they this be to be expect since the inner circle be with the potentate day and night exercise and eat and he have to take food and drink that they have prepare moreover against acknowledged enemy you can array these very man but against the latter themselves there be no one else to employ as a ally to we therefore the whole time through solitude be dreadful company dreadful : to be unguarded be terrifying but most terrifying be the guard themselves : enemy be difficult to deal with but still greater difficulty be present by we friend they must all be call friend whether they be such or not but even if one should find they most reliable even so one may not trust one 's self in they company with a clear carefree unsuspecting heart this then and the fact that it be requisite to take measure of defense against ordinary conspirator make the situation overwhelmingly dreadful for to be always compel to be inflicting punishment and chastisement upon somebody be highly repugnant to man of character -lrb- -16 - -rrb- you be right answer livium and i have some advice to give you -- at least if you prove willing to receive it and willing not to censure I that woman as i be i dare to make suggestion to you which no one else even of you most intimate friend would venture and this be not through any lack of knowledge on they part but because they be not bold enough to speak say on rejoin augustus and let we have it i will tell you continue livium without hesitation because i share you comfort and adversity and while you be safe i myself hold dominion day by day whereas if you come to any harm -lrb- which heaven forbid -rrb- i shall perish with you well then human nature persuade some to sin under any condition and there be no device for control it when it have once start toward any goal what seem good to person -- not to rehearse the vice of the mass -- at once induce very many of they to do wrong -lrb- -17 - -rrb- the boast of birth and pride of wealth greatness of honor audacity found on bravery and conceit due to authority bring shipwreck to not a few there be no make nobility ignoble bravery cowardly or prudence foolish : it be impossible nor again be it to curtail man 's abundance or to strike down ambition where conduct have be correct : that be iniquitous that he who be on the defensive and anticipate other ' movement should incur injury and ill repute be inevitable come let we change we policy and spare some of they to I it seem far more feasible to set thing right by kindness than by harshness not only be those who grant pardon loved by the object of they clemency who strive to repay the favor but all other both respect and reverence they and will not readily endure to see harm do to they sovereign however who maintain a inexorable anger not only be hate by those who have aught to fear but cause uneasiness to all the rest as a result man plot against they to avoid meet a untimely fate do you not notice that physician very rarely have recourse to cut and burn wish to avoid aggravate a person 's disease but in the majority of case soothe and cure by means of fomentation and mild drug do not think that because those ailment have to do with the body and these with the mind that they be essentially different very many experience of the body be similar in a way to what go on in the soul of man no matter how bodiless the latter may be the soul contract under the influence of fear and expand under that of wrath pain humiliate man and audacity puff they up the correspondence then be very close and therefore both kind of trouble need treatment which be much alike a gentle speech utter to a man cause all he unruliness to subside just as a harsh one provoke to anger even a easy-going person the grant of pardon melt the most audacious just as punishment irritate the most mild act of violence inflame all man in every instance even though such measure may be thoroughly just but considerate treatment mollify they hence one would more readily brave great danger through persuasion and voluntarily than under compulsion such be the inherent unalterable quality of both method of behavior that even among brute beast that have no mind many of the strongest and fiercest be domesticate by petting and be subdue by coax whereas many of the most cowardly and weak be make unmanageable and madden by cruelty and terror -lrb- -18 - -rrb- i be not say that we must spare absolutely all wrongdoer for we must cut out of the way the daredevil and busybody the man of evil nature and evil device who give himself up to a unyielding persistent baseness just as we treat part of the body that be quite incurable but of the rest who err through youth or ignorance or a misunderstanding or some other chance some purposely and other unwillingly it be proper to admonish some with word to bring other to they sens by threat and to handle still other with moderation in some different way precisely as in other -lrb- matter -rrb- all man impose upon some greater and upon other lesser punishment so far as these person be concern you may employ moderation without danger inflict upon some the penalty of banishment upon other that of loss of political rights upon still other a money fine you may also place some of they in country district or in certain city in the past a few have be bring to they sens by miss what they hope for by fail to secure what they aim at a degradation in seat -lrb- 13 -rrb- and factional dispute involve disgrace as well as be injure or terrify before they could make a move have improve not a few yet one well bear and courageous would prefer to die rather than to have any such experience as a result vengeance would become not easier for the plotter but more difficult and we should be able to live in safety since not a word could be say against we at present we be think to kill many through anger -lrb- 14 -rrb- many because of a desire for they money other through fear of they bravery and a great many other on account of jealousy of they excellence no one will readily believe that a person possess so great a authority and power can seriously be the object of the plot of any unarmed individual some talk as above and other say that we hear a great many lie and foolishly pay heed to many of they believe they true they assert that those who spy into and overhear doubtful matter concoct many falsehood some be influence by enmity other by wrath some because they can get money from they foe other because they can get no money from the same person and further that they report not only the fact of certain person have commit suspicious action or intend to commit they but also how a say so-and-so and b hearing it be silent how one man laugh and somebody else weep -lrb- -19 - -rrb- i could cite innumerable other detail of like nature which no matter how true they be be no business for free man to concern themselves about or report to you if they go unnoticed they would do you no harm but when hear they might irritate you even against you will : and that ought by no means to happen especially in a ruler of the people now many believe that from this cause large number unjustly perish some without a trial and other by some unwarranted condemnation of a court they will not admit that the evidence give or statement make under torture or any similar proof against they be genuine this be the sort of talk though some of it may not be just which be report in the case of practically all so put to death and you ought augustus to be free not only from injustice but from the appearance of it it be sufficient for a private individual to avoid irregular conduct but it behoove a ruler to incur not even the suspicion of it you be the leader of human being not of beast and the only way you can make they really friendly to you be by persuade they by every means and constantly without a break that you will wrong no one either voluntarily or involuntarily a man can be force to fear another but he have to be persuade to love he : and he be to be persuade by the good treatment he himself receive and the benefit he see confer on other the person however who suspect that somebody have perish unjustly both fear that he may some day meet the same fate and be compel to hate the one responsible for the deed and to be hate by one 's subject be -lrb- besides contain no element of good -rrb- exceedingly unprofitable the general mass of people feel that ordinary individual must defend themselves against all who wrong they in any way or else be despise and consequently oppress : but ruler they think ought to prosecute those who wrong the state but endure those who be think to commit offence against they privately ruler can not be harm by disdain or assault because they have many guardian to protect they -lrb- -20 - -rrb- when i hear this and turn my attention to this i feel inclined to tell you outright to put no one to death for any such reason place of supremacy be establish for the preservation of subject to prevent they from be injure either by one another or by foreign tribe : such place be not by jupiter for the purpose of allow the ruler themselves to hard they subject it be most glorious to be able not to destroy most of the citizen but to save they all if possible it be right to educate they by law and favor and admonition that they may be right-minded and further to watch and guard they so that even if they wish to do wrong they may not be able and if there be anything ail we must cure and correct it in some way in order that there may be no entire loss to endure the offence of the multitude be a task require great prudence and force : if any one should simply punish all of they as they deserve before he know it he would have destroy the majority of mankind for these reason then i give you my opinion to the effect that you should not inflict the death penalty for any such error but bring the man to they sens in some other way so that they will not again do anything dangerous what crime could a man commit shut up on a island or in the country or in some city not only destitute of a throng of servant and money but under guard if it be necessary if the enemy be anywhere near here or some alien force have dominion over this sea so that one of the prisoner might escape to they and do we some harm or if again there be strong city in italy with fortification and weapon so that if a man seize they he might become a menace to we that would be a different story but all town in this neighborhood be unarmed and lack any wall that would serve in war and the enemy be remove from they by vast distance a long stretch of sea and a journey by land include mountain and river hard to cross lie between they and we why then should one fear this man or that man defenceless private citizen here in the middle of you empire and enclose by you armed force i can not see how any one could conceive such a notion or how the maddest madman could accomplish anything -lrb- -21 - -rrb- with these premise therefore let we give the idea a trial the discontented will soon themselves change they way and bring about a improvement in other you notice that cornelius be both of good birth and renowned this matter have to be reason out in a human fashion the sword can not effect everything for you it would be a great blessing if it could bring some man to they sens and persuade they or even compel they to love any one with genuine affection : but instead it will destroy the body of one man and alienate the mind of the rest people do not become more attach to any one because of the vengeance they see mete out to other but they become more hostile through the influence of they own fear that be one side of the picture on the other hand those who obtain pardon for any crime and repent be ashamed to wrong they benefactor again but render they much service in return hope to receive much more again for it when a man be save by some one who have be wrong he think that he rescuer if fairly treat will go to any length to aid he heed I therefore dearest and make a change then all you other act that have cause displeasure will appear to have be due to necessity in conduct so great a city from democracy into monarchy it be impossible to make the transfer without bloodshed but if you follow you old policy you will be think to have do these unpleasant thing intentionally -lrb- -22 - -rrb- augustus heed these suggestion of livium and release all those against whom charge be pend admonish some of they orally cornelius he even appoint consul later he so conciliate both he and the other man that no one else again really plot against he or have the reputation of so do livium have have most to do with save the life of cornelius yet she be destine to be hold responsible for the death of augustus -lrb- ad 5 -lrb- a u 758 -rrb- -rrb- at this time in the consulship of cornelius and valerius messalum earthquake of ill omen occur and the tiber tear away the bridge so that the city be under water for seven day there be a eclipse of the sun and famine set in this same year agrippa be enrol among the iuvene but obtain none of the same privilege as he brother the senator attend the horse-race separately and the knight also separately from the remainder of the populace as be do nowadays and since the noblest family do not show themselves incline to give they daughter for the service of vesta a law be pass that the daughter of freedman might likewise be consecrate many contend for the honor and so they draw lot in the senate in the presence of they father no priestess however be appoint from this class -lrb- -23 - -rrb- the soldier be displeased at the small size of the prize for the war that have take place at this period and no one be willing to carry arm for longer than the specify term of he service it be therefore vote that five thousand denarius be give to member of the pretorian guard when they have end sixteen and three thousand to the other soldier when they have complete twenty year ' service twenty-three legion be be support at that time or as other say twenty-five of citizen soldier only nineteen of they now remain the second -lrb- augusta -rrb- be the one that winter in upper britain of the third there be three division -- the gallic in phoenicium the cyrenaic in arabia the augustan in numidium the fourth -lrb- scythian -rrb- be in syrium the fifth -lrb- macedonian -rrb- in dacium the sixth be divide into two part of which the one -lrb- victrix -rrb- be in lower britain and the other -lrb- ferrata -rrb- be in judæa the soldier of the seventh generally call claudian be in upper moesium those of the eighth augustan be in upper germany those of the tenth be both in upper pannonium -lrb- legio gemina -rrb- and in judaea the eleventh in lower moesium be the claudian this name two legion receive from claudius because they have not fight against he in the insurrection of camillus the twelfth -lrb- fulminata -rrb- be in cappadocium : the thirteenth -lrb- gemina -rrb- in dacium : the fourteenth -lrb- gemina -rrb- in upper pannonium : the fifteenth -lrb- apollinari -rrb- in cappadocium the twentieth call both valerium and victrix be also in upper britain these i believe together with those that have the title of the twenty second -lrb- 15 -rrb- and winter in upper germany augustus take in charge and keep and this i say in spite of the fact that they be by no means call valerian by all and do not themselves use the title any longer these be preserve from the augustan legion of the rest some have be scatter altogether and other be mix in with different legion by augustus himself and by the other emperor from which circumstance they be think to have be call gemina -lrb- -24 - -rrb- now that i have once be bring into a discussion of the legion i shall speak of the force as they be at present accord to the disposition make by subsequent emperor : in this way any one who desire to learn anything about they may do so easily find all he information write in one place nero organize the first legion call the italian and now winter in lower moesium galba the first legion call adiutrix in lower pannonium and the seventh -lrb- gemina -rrb- which be in spain vespasian the second adiutrix in lower pannonium and the fourth -lrb- the flavian -rrb- in syrium domitian the first -lrb- minervium -rrb- in lower germany trajan the second -lrb- the egyptian -rrb- and the thirtieth -lrb- germanic -rrb- which he also name after himself marcus antoninus organize the second which be in noricum and the third in rhætia these be also call italian : severus the parthian legion i e the first and the third in mesopotamium and between they the second the one in italy this be at present the number of legion which be enrol in the service exclusive of the cohorte urbanæ and the pretorian guard at that time in the day of augustus those i mention be be support whether twenty-three or twenty-five altogether and then there be some ally force whatever the size of infantry and cavalry and sailor i can not state the exact figure the body-guard ten thousand in all be divide into ten portion and the six thousand warder of the city into four portion and there be pick foreign horseman to whom the name batavian be apply -lrb- from the island batavium in the rhine -rrb- because the batavian be note for superiority in horsemanship i can not however state they exact number any more than that of the evocatus he begin to reckon in the latter from the time that he call the warrior who have previously support he father to arm again against antony and he retain control of they they constitute even now a special corps and carry rod like the centurion for the distribution mention he need money and therefore introduce a motion into the senate to the effect that a definite permanent fund be create in order that without trouble any private citizen they might obtain abundant support and reward from the propose appropriation the means for such a fund be accordingly seek -- as no one show a willingness to become ædile some from the rank of ex-quæstors and ex-tribune be compel by lot to take the office this happen frequently at other time -lrb- ad 6 -lrb- _ a u _ 759 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -25 - -rrb- after this in the consulship of æmilius lepidus and lucius arruntius when no source for the fund be find that suit anybody but quite everybody feel dejected because such a attempt be be make augustus in the name of himself and of tiberius put money into the treasury which he call the ærarium militare some of the ex-prætors -- such as draw the lot -- he instruct to administer it for three year employ two lictor apiece and such further assistance as be fitting this be do by successive official for a number of year at present they be choose by whoever be emperor and they go about without lictor augustus himself make some further contribution and promise to do this annually and he accept offer from king and certain people from private individual though a number be ready and glad to give -lrb- as they say -rrb- he would take nothing but as all this prove very slight in comparison with the large amount spend and there be need of some inexhaustible supply he order each one of the senator to devise means by himself to write he plan in a book and give it to he to look over this be not because he have no plan of he own but because he be most anxious to persuade they to choose the one that he wish various man propose various course but he would approve none of they : instead he arrange for five per cent of the inheritance and bequest which should be leave by deceased person -lrb- except in the case of very near relation or poor family -rrb- he pretend that he have find this tax suggestion in cæsar 's memoirs it be a method that have be introduce once before but have be later abolish and be now introduce anew in this way he increase the revenue the expenditure make by three man of consular rank whom the lot designate he partly make smaller and partly do away with altogether -lrb- -26 - -rrb- this be not the only source of trouble to the roman : there be also a severe famine as a consequence the gladiator and the slave offer for sale be remove to a distance of over seven hundred and fifty stadium augustus and other dismiss the greater part of they retinue there be a cessation of lawsuit and senator be permit to leave the city and go where they please in order to prevent any hindrance to decree from this last measure it be order that all those frame by as many as happen to attend meeting should be bind moreover ex-consul be appoint to take charge of grain and bread supplies so as to have a state quantity sell to each person those who be recipient of public bounty have as much add to they supply grati by augustus as they might obtain at any time when even that do not suffice he forbid the citizen to hold any public festival on he birthday since also at this time many part of the city fall a prey to fire he form a company of freedman in seven division to render assistance on such occasion and appoint a knight as they leader think soon to disband they he do not do this however have ascertain by experience that the aid they give be most valuable and necessary he keep they the night-watchmen exist to the present day subject to special regulation and those in the service be select not from the freedman only any longer but from on the rest of the class as well they have barracks in the city and draw pay from the public treasury -lrb- -27 - -rrb- the multitude under the burden of the famine and the tax and the loss sustain by fire be ill at ease they discuss openly many scheme of insurrection and by night scatter pamphlet more still : this move be say to be traceable to a certain publius rufus but other be suspect of it rufus could not have originate or have take a active part in it therefore it be think that other who aim at a revolution be make a illicit use of he name a investigation of the affair be resolve upon and reward for information offer information accordingly come in and the city as a result be stir up this last till the scarcity of grain subside when gladiatorial game in honor of drusus be give by germanicus cæsar and tiberius claudius nero he son -lrb- in the course of they a elephant vanquish a rhinoceros and a knight distinguish for he wealth fight as a gladiator -rrb- the people be encourage by this honor show to the memory of drusus and by tiberius 's dedication of the temple of the dioscurus upon which he inscribe not only he name but also that of drusus himself he call claudianus instead of claudius because of he adoption into the family of augustus he continue to direct operation against the enemy and visit the city constantly whenever opportunity offer this be partly on account of various kind of business but chiefly owe to fear that augustus might promote somebody else during he absence these be the event in the city that year in achæa the governor die in the middle of he term and direction be give to he quæstor and to he assessor -lrb- whom as i have say -lrb- 16 -rrb- we call legatus -rrb- that the latter should administer the government as far as the isthmus and the former the rest of it herod -lrb- 17 -rrb- of palestine who be accuse by he brother of some wrongdoing be banish beyond the alp and he portion of the palestinian domain revert to the state -lrb- augustus suffer from old age and infirmity so that he could not transact business for all that need he aid : some case he review and try with he counselor sit upon the tribunal on the palatine the embassy which come from the various nation and prince he put in charge of three ex-consul under the arrangement that any one of they individually might listen to such a embassy and return a answer except in case where it be necessary for himself and the senate to render a decision besides -rrb- -lrb- -28 - -rrb- during this same period also many war take place pirate overrun many quarter so that sardinium have no senatorial governor for some year but be in charge of soldier with knight for commander not a few city rebel with the result that for two year the same person hold office in the same province of the people and be personally appoint instead of be choose by lot the province of cæsar be in general so arrange that man should govern in the same place for a considerable time however i shall not go into all these matter minutely many thing not worthy of record happen in individual instance and no one would be benefit by the exact detail i shall mention simply the event worth remember and very briefly save those of greatest importance the isaurian begin maraud expedition and keep on till they face grim war but be finally subdue the gætuli discontented with they king juba and at the same time feeling themselves slight because not govern by the roman rise against he : they ravage the neighbor territory and kill even many of the roman who make a campaign against they in fine they gain so great a ascendancy that cornelius cossus who reduce they receive triumphal honor and title for it while these trouble be in progress expedition against the celtæ be be conduct by various leader and notably by tiberius he advance first to the river visurgi and subsequently as far as the albi but nothing of any moment be accomplish then although not only augustus but also tiberius be dub imperator for it and gaius sentius governor of germany receive triumphal honor the celtæ be so afraid of they foe that they make a truce with he not merely once but twice and the reason that peace be again grant they in spite of they have break it so soon be that the affair of the dalmatian and pannonian who have begin a rebellion on a large scale need vigilant attention -lrb- -29 - -rrb- the dalmatian smart under the levy of tribute have for some time previous keep quiet even against they will but at the same time that tiberius make he second campaign against the celtæ valerius messalinus the governor of dalmatium and pannonium be himself despatch to the front with tiberius take most of he army they too be order to send a contingent and on come together for this purpose have a chance to see the flower of they fight force after that there be no more delay but urge on particularly by one bato a dæsidiatian at first a few revolt and worst the roman that come against they and this success then lead other to rebel next the breuci a pannonian tribe put another leader name bato at they head and march against sirmium and the roman in the town this they do not capture : cæcina severus the governor of moesium close by he hear of they uprising march rapidly upon they and join battle with they near the river dravus vanquish they army hope to renew the struggle soon since many of the roman also have fall they turn to summon they ally and collect as many as they could meanwhile the dalmatian bato have make a descent upon salonæ and be himself grievously wound with a stone accomplish nothing but send some other who work havoc along the whole sea-coast as far as apollonium there in spite of he defeat he representative win a slight battle against the roman who encounter they -lrb- -30 - -rrb- tiberius ascertain this fear they might invade italy and so return from celtica : he send messalinus ahead and himself follow with the rest of the army bato learn of they approach and though not yet well go to meet messalinus he prove the latter 's superior in open conflict but be afterward conquer by a ambuscade thereupon he go to bato the breucan and make common cause with he in the war occupy a mountain name alma here they be defeat in a slight skirmish by rhoemetalce the thracian despatch in advance against they by severus but resist severus himself vigorously later severus withdraw to moesia because the dacian and the sauromatæ be ravage it and while tiberius and messalinus be tarry in siscium the dalmatian overrun they ally territory and likewise cause many to revolt although tiberius approach they they would engage in no open battle with he but keep move from one place to another devastate a great deal of ground owe to they knowledge of the country and the lightness of they equipment they could easily go wherever they please when winter set in they do much greater damage by invade macedonium again rhoemetalce and he brother rhascupori get the better of this force in battle -lrb- ad 7 -lrb- _ a u _ 760 -rrb- -rrb- the rest do not stay in they territory while it be be ravage -lrb- this be principally later in the consulship of cæcilius metellus and lincinius silanus -rrb- but take refuge on the height from which they make descent whenever they see a chance -lrb- -31 - -rrb- when augustus learn this he begin to be suspicious of tiberius for he think the latter might have overcome they soon but be delay purposely so that he might be under arm as long as possible with war for a excuse the emperor therefore send germanicus though he be then quæstor and give he soldier not only from the free bear citizen but from the freedman some of whom be slave that he have take from both man and woman in return for they value with food for six month and have set free this be not the only measure he take in view of the necessity of the war : he also postpone the review of the knight which be wont to occur in the forum and he vow to conduct the great game -lrb- 18 -rrb- because a woman have cut some letter on she arm and have practice some kind of divination he know well to be sure that she have not be possess by some divine power but have do it intentionally inasmuch however as the populace be terribly work up over the war and the famine -lrb- which have now set in once more -rrb- he too affect to believe what be say and do anything that would lead to the encouragement of the multitude as a matter of course in view of the stringency in the grain supply he again appoint two grain commissioner from among the ex-consul together with lictor as there be need of further money for operation against the enemy and the support of night-watchmen he introduce the tax of two per cent on the sale of slave and he order that the money deliver from the public treasury to the prætors who give armed combat should no longer be expend -lrb- -32 - -rrb- the reason that he send germanicus and not agrippa to take the field be that the latter possess a servile nature and spend most of he time fishing wherefore he also use to call himself neptune he use to give way to violent anger and slander julium as a stepmother while upon augustus he heap abundant reproach in the matter of he paternal inheritance when he could not be make to moderate he conduct he be banish and he property be give to the ærarium militare : he himself be put ashore on planasium the island near corsica -- these be the event in the city germanicus reach pannonium where army from various point be shortly to assemble the bato watch for severus who be approach from moesium and fall upon he unexpectedly while he be encamp near the volcæan marsh the picket outside the rampart they frighten and hurl back within it but as the man inside stand they ground the attack party be defeat after this the roman divide in order that many detachment might overrun the country in separate place at one time most of they do nothing worthy of note during this enterprise but germanicus conquer in battle and badly demoralize the mæzei a dalmatian tribe -- these be the result of that year -lrb- ad 8 -lrb- _ a u _ 761 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -33 - -rrb- in the consulship of marcus furius with sextus nonius the dalmatian and pannonian decide they would like to make peace because they be in distress primarily from famine and then from disease that follow it due to they use grass of various sort and root for food they do not attempt however to open any negotiation be restrain by those who have no hope of preservation at the hand of the roman so even as they be they still resist and one scenobardus who have feign a readiness to change side and have have dealings on this very business with manius ennius commander of the garrison in siscium declare that he be ready to desert become afraid that he might be injure ere he project be complete and -lrb- 19 -rrb- _ the po which they call the monarch of river that cleave the soil of italy know by the name eridanus have its water let into a very broad excavation on the command of the emperor augustus a seventh division of the channel of this river flow through the center of the state afford at its mouth a most satisfactory harbor and be formerly believe -lrb- my authority be dio -rrb- to

would often help the magistrate try case also as often as the consulting judge hold different view he vote be reckon only as equal to that of any one else it be at this time that augustus allow the senate to try the majority of case without he be present and he no longer frequent the assembly of the people instead he have the previous year personally appoint all who be to hold office because there be factional outbreak : this year and those follow he merely post a kind of bulletin and make know to the pleb and to the people what person he favor yet he have so much strength for manage hostile campaign that he journey to ariminum in order that he might be able to give from close at hand all necessary advice in regard to the dalmatian and pannonian prayer be offer at he departure and

tiberius return to rome after the winter when quintus sulpicius and gaius sabinus be consul augustus go out into the suburb to meet he accompany he to the sæpta and there from a platform greet the people next he perform the ceremony proper on such a occasion and have the consul give triumphal spectacles and since the knight on this occasion with great vigor seek for the repeal of the law regard the unmarried and the childless he assemble in one place in the forum the unmarried man of this number and in another those who be marry or have child see that the latter be much fewer in number than the former he be fill with grief and address they to the following effect : -lrb- -2 - -rrb- though you be but few all together in comparison with the great throng that inhabit this city and be far behind the other who be unwilling to fulfill they duty at all yet for this reason i praise you the more and i be heartily grateful that you have show yourselve obedient and be help to replenish the fatherland it be by life so conduct that the roman of later day will become a mighty multitude we be at first a mere handful but when we have recourse to marriage and beget child we come to surpass all mankind not only in manliness but in populousness this we must remember and console the mortal element of we be with a endless succession of generation like torch thus the one gap which separate we from divine happiness may through relay of man be fill by immortality it be for this cause most of all that that first and greatest god who fashion we divide the race of mortal in twain render one half of it male and the other female and add love and the compulsion of they intercourse together make they association fruitful that by the young continually bear he might in a way render mortality eternal even of the god themselves some be believe to be male the rest female : and the tradition prevail that some have begotten other and certain one have be bear of other so even among they who need no such device marriage and child-begetting have be approve as noble -lrb- -3 - -rrb- you have do right then to imitate the god and right to emulate you father that just as they beget you you may also bring other into the world just as you deem they and name they ancestor other will regard you and address you in similar fashion the undertaking which they nobly achieve and hand down to you with glory you will hand on to other the possession which they acquire and leave to you will leave to other spring from you own loin surely the best of all thing be a woman who be temperate domestic a good house-keeper a rearer of child one to gladden you when in health to tend you when sick to be you partner in good fortune to console you in misfortune to restrain the frenzied nature of the youth and to temper the superannuated severity of the old man be it not a delight to acknowledge a child bear the nature of both to nurture and educate it a physical image and a spiritual image so that in its growth you yourself live again be it not most bless on depart from life to leave behind a successor to and inheritor of one 's substance and family something that be one 's own spring from one 's self and to have only one 's human part waste away but to live through the child as successor we need not be in the hand of alien as in war nor perish utterly as in war these be the private advantage that accrue to those who marry and beget child : but for the state for whose sake we ought to do many thing that be even distasteful to we how excellent and how necessary it be if city and people be to exist if you be to rule other and other be to obey you that there should be a multitude of man to till the earth in peace and quiet to make voyage practice art follow handicraft man who in war will protect what we already have with the greater zeal because of family tie and will replace those that fall by other therefore man -- for you alone may properly be call man -- and father -- for you be worthy to hold this title like myself -- i love you and i praise you for this i be glad of the prize i have already offer and i will glorify you still more besides by honor and office thus you may yourselve reap great benefit and leave they to you child undiminished i shall now descend to speak to the rest who have not do like you and whose lot will therefore be directly the opposite : you will thus learn not only from word but by fact even more how far you excel they -lrb- -4 - -rrb- after this speech he make present to some of they at once and promise to make other : he then go over to the other throng to whom he address these word : a strange experience have be mine o -- what shall i call you -- man but you do not perform the office of man -- citizen but so far as you be concern the city be perish -- roman but you be undertake to do away with this name -- well at any rate whoever you be and by whatever name you delight to be call mine have be a unexpected experience for though i be always do everything to promote a increase of population among you and be now about to rebuke you i grieve to see that you be numerous i could rather wish that those other to whom i have just speak be so many than to see you as many as you be or still better to see you muster with they -- or at least not to know how thing stand it be you who without pause to reflect on the foresight of the god or the care of you forefather be bent upon annihilate you whole race and make it in truth mortal upon destroy and end the whole roman nation what seed of human being would be leave if all the remainder of mankind should do the same as you you be they leader and may rightly bear the responsibility for universal destruction or even if no other emulate you will you not be justly hate for the very reason that you overlook what no one else would overlook and neglect what no one else would neglect you be introduce custom and practice which if imitate would lead to the annihilation of all and if hate would end in you own punishment we do not spare murderer because all person do not murder nor do we let temple-robber go because not everybody rob temple : but anybody who be convict of commit any forbid act be chastise for the very reason that he alone or as one of a small group do such thing as no one else would do -lrb- -5 - -rrb- yet if one should name over the greatest offence there be none to compare with that which be now be commit by you and this statement hold true not only if you examine crime for crime but if you compare all of they together with this single one of yours you have incur blood guiltiness by not beget those who ought to be you descendant you be sacrilegious in put a end to the name and honor of you ancestor you be impious in abolish you family which be institute by the god and destroy the greatest of offering to they -- the human being -- and by overthrow in this way they rite and they temple moreover by cause the downfall of the government you be disobedient to the law and you even betray you country by render she barren and childless : nay more you lay she even with the dust by make she destitute of inhabitant a city consist of human being not of house or portico or forum empty of man think what rage would justly seize the great romulus the founder of we race if he could reflect on the circumstance of he own birth and then upon you attitude -- refuse to get child even by lawful marriage how wrathful would the roman who be he follower be when they consider that they themselves even seize foreign girl but you be not satisfy with those of you own race they actually have child even by they enemy : you will not beget they even of woman with undisputed standing in the state how incense would curtius be who endure to die that the married man might not be sunder from they wife : how indignant hersilium the attendant of she daughter who institute for we all the rite of marriage we father fight the sabine to obtain marriage and make peace through the intercession of they wife and child they administer oath and make sundry treaty for this very purpose : you be bring all that labor to naught why be it do you desire to live forever apart from woman as the vestal virgin live apart from man then you should be punish like they if you break out into any act of lewdness -lrb- -6 - -rrb- i know that my word to you appear bitter and harsh but first of all reflect that physician too treat many patient by burn when they can not recover health in any other way in the second place it be not my wish or my pleasure to speak they and hence it be that i have this further reproach to bring against you that you have provoke I to this discourse if you dislike what i say do not continue the conduct for which you be inevitably reprimand if my speech wound any of you how much more do you act wind both I and all the rest of the roman if you vex in very truth make a change that so i may praise and reward you you yourselve be aware that i be not irritable by nature and that i have do subject to human limitation all the act proper for a good lawgiver never in old time be any one permit to neglect marriage and the rearing of child but from the very outset at the first establishment of the government strict law be pass regard they : since then many decree have be issue by both the senate and the people which it would be superfluous to enumerate i have increase the penalty for the disobedient in order that through fear of become liable to they you may be bring to you sens to those that obey i have offer more numerous and greater prize than be give for any other display of excellence that if for no other reason at least by this one you may be persuade to marry and beget child yet you not strive for any of the recompense nor fear any of the penalty have despise all these measure have trodden they all under foot as if you be not even inhabitant of the city you declare you have take upon yourselve this free and continent life without wife and without child you be no different from robber or the most savage -lrb- -7 - -rrb- beast it be not you delight in a solitary existence that lead you to live without wife there be not one of you who either eat alone or sleep alone but you want to have opportunity for wantonness and licentiousness yet i have allow you to court girl still tender and not yet of age for marriage in order that have the name of intendant bridegroom you may lead a domestic life and those not in the senatorial class i have permit to wed freedwoman so that if any one through passion or some inclination should be dispose to such a proceeding he might go about it lawfully i have not limit you rigidly to this even but at first give you three whole year in which to make preparation and later two yet not even so by threaten or urge or postpone or entreat have i accomplish anything you see for yourselve how much larger a mass you constitute than the married man when you ought by this time to have furnish we with as many more child or rather with several time you number how otherwise shall family continue how can the commonwealth be preserve if we neither marry nor produce child surely you be not expect some to spring up from the earth to succeed to you goods and to public affair as myth describe it be neither please to heaven nor creditable that we race should cease and the name of roman meet extinguishment in we and the city be give up to foreigner -- greek or even barbarian we liberate slave chiefly for the purpose of make out of they as many citizen as possible we give we ally a share in the government that we number may increase : yet you roman of the original stock include quintius valerius iullus be eager that you family and name at once shall perish with you -lrb- -8 - -rrb- i be thoroughly ashamed that i have be lead to speak in such a fashion have do with you madness then and reflect now if not before that with many die all the time by disease and many in the war it be impossible for the city to maintain itself unless the multitude in it be constantly reinforce by those who be ever and anon be bear let no one of you think that i be ignorant of the many disagreeable and painful feature that belong to marriage and child-rearing but bear in mind that we possess nothing at all good with which some bane be not mingle and that in we most abundant and greatest blessing there reside the most abundant and greatest woe if you decline to accept the latter do not strive to obtain the former practically all who possess any real excellence and pleasure be oblige to work before its enjoyment to work at the time and to work afterward why should i lengthen my speech by go into each one of they in detail therefore even if there be some unpleasant feature connect with marriage and the begetting of child set over against they the better element : you will find they more numerous and more vital for in addition to all the other blessing that naturally inhere in this state of life the prize offer by law -- a infinitesimal portion of which determine many to undergo death -- might induce anybody to obey I and be it not a disgrace that for reward which influence other to give up they own life you should be unwilling either to marry wife or to rear child -lrb- -9 - -rrb- therefore fellow-citizen -lrb- for i believe that i have now persuade you both to hold fast to the name of citizen and to secure the additional title of man and father -rrb- i have administer this rebuke reluctantly but of necessity not as you foe nor as one hate you but rather loving you and wish to obtain many other like you -- as one wish you to guard lawful hearth with house full of descendant that we may approach the god together with wife and child and associate with one another standing on a equality in whatever we possess and harvest equally the hope to which it give rise how could i call myself a good ruler over you if i should endure see you become constantly fewer how could i any longer be rightfully name you father if you rear no child therefore if you really have a regard for I and have give I this title not out of flattery but as a honor desire yourselve to become man and father thus you may yourselve share this title and also render I well name -lrb- -10 - -rrb- such be he word to both group at that time after this he increase the reward for those have child and by penalty make a still wider difference between the married and those without wife he further allow each of they a year in which person who obey he might render themselves non-liable by yield obedience contrary to the voconian law accord to which no woman could inherit any property over two and a half myriad in value he give woman permission to become inheritor of any amount he also grant the vestal virgin all the benefit enjoy by woman who have child later the pappian and poppæan law be frame by marcus pappius mutilus and by quintus poppæus secundus who be then consul for a portion of the year it turn out that both of they have not only no child but not even wife from this very fact the need of the law be discernible -- these be the event in rome -lrb- -11 - -rrb- germanicus meanwhile have capture among other post in dalmatium also splonum in spite of the fact that it occupy a naturally strong position be well protect by wall and have a huge number of defender consequently he be unable to accomplish aught with engine or by assault yet he take it as a result of the follow coincidence pusio a celtic horseman discharge a stone against the wall which so shake the superstructure that it immediately fall and drag down the man who be lean upon it at this the rest be terrify and in fear leave the wall to ascend the acropoli subsequently they surrender both it and themselves the roman under germanicus have reach rætinium a city of dalmatium fare rather badly they opponent force back by the number could not resist they and therefore place fire in a circle about themselves and throw it into the building near by devise a way to keep it surely from blaze up at once and to make it go unnoticed for a long time the enemy after do this retire to the height the roman unaware of they action follow hard after they expect to find no work at all in pillage extensively thus they get inside of the circle of fire and with they mind direct upon the enemy see nothing of it until they be encompass by it on all side then they find themselves in imminent danger be pelt by man from above and injure by fire from without they could neither safely stay where they be nor break they way out without danger if they stand out of range of the missile they be consume by the fire or if they jump away from the flame they be destroy by the hurler of missile some be catch in narrow place and perish by both at once wound on one side and burn on the other the majority of those who enter the circle meet they fate in this way some few by cast corpse into the very flame and make a passage over they as over bridge manage to escape the fire gain such headway that not even those on the acropoli could stay there but abandon it in the night and hide themselves in subterranean chamber -lrb- -12 - -rrb- these be the operation at that point -- seretium which tiberius have once besiege but not capture be subdue and after this some other town be more easily win but since the remainder even under these condition offer resistance and the war keep lengthen out and famine come in its train especially in italy augustus send tiberius again into dalmatium he see that the soldier be not for endure further delay and be anxious to end the war in some way eyen if it involve danger therefore fear that if they remain in one place together they might revolt he divide they into three part one he assign to silvanus and one to marcus lepidus with the remainder he march with germanicus against bato without difficulty the two former overcome those array in battle opposite they tiberius himself go wander off through practically the entire country as bato appear first at one point and then at another : finally bato take refuge in fort andetrium located close to salonæ and tiberius who besiege he find himself in sore strait the garrison have the protection of fortification build upon a well guard rock difficult of access encircle by deep ravine through which torrent roar and the man have all necessary provision part of which they have previously store there while a part they be still bring from the mountain which be in they hand moreover by ambuscade they interfere with the roman provision train hence tiberius though suppose to be besiege they be himself place in the position of a besiege force -lrb- -13 - -rrb- he be in a dilemma and could not find any plan to pursue : the siege be prove fruitless and dangerous and a retreat appear disgraceful this lead to a uproar on the part of the soldier who raise so great a outcry that the enemy who be encamp in the shelter of the wall be terrify and retreat as a consequence be partly angry and partly pleased he call they together and administer some rebuke and some admonition he display no rashness nor yet do he withdraw but remain quietly on the spot until bato despairing of victory send a herald to ask term this act be due to the subjugation of all but a few of the other tribe and the fact that the force which bato have be inferior to the one then oppose it he could not persuade the rest to ask a truce and so abandon they nor do he again assist one of they though he receive many request for aid tiberius consequently conceive a contempt for those still leave in the fortress and think that he could conquer they without loss pay no further heed to the nature of the country but proceed straight up the cliff since there be no level ground and the enemy would not come down against they he himself take he seat on a platform in full view in order to watch the engagement -lrb- for this would cause he soldier to contend more vigorously -rrb- and to render opportune assistance should there be any need of it he keep a part of the army inasmuch as he have a great plenty of man for this very purpose the rest draw up in a dense square at first proceed at a walk later they be separate by the steepness and unevenness of the mountain -lrb- which be full of gully and at many point cut up into ravine -rrb- and some ascend more quickly other more slowly -lrb- -14 - -rrb- see this the dalmatian marshal outside the wall at the top of the steep and hurl down quantity of stone upon they throw some from sling and roll down other other set in motion wheel other whole wagon full of rock other circular chest manufacture in some way peculiar to the country and pack with stone all these thing come down with great noise keep striking in different quarter as if discharge from a sling and separate the roman from one another even more than before and crush they other by discharge either missile or spear knock many of they down at this juncture much rivalry develop on the part of the warrior one side endeavor to ascend and conquer the height the other to repulse they and hurl they back there be great excitement also on the part of the rest who watch the action from the wall and on the part of those about tiberius each side as a body and also individually encourage its own man try to lend strength to such as show zeal and chide those that anywhere give way those whose voice could be hear above the rest be invoke the god both party pray for the protection of they warrior for the time be and one side call for freedom for themselves in the future and the other for peace under these circumstance the roman would certainly have risk they life in vain have to contend against two thing at once -- the nature of the country and the line of they antagonist -- have not tiberius by sudden reinforcement prevent they from take to flight and disturb the enemy from another quarter by means of other soldier who go about and ascend the incline a considerable distance off as a result the enemy be route and could not even enter the fortification but scatter up the mountain side first cast off they armor so as to be lightly equip they pursuer follow they at every point for they be exceedingly anxious to end the war and do not want they to unite again and cause trouble so they discover the most of they hide in the forest and kill they like beast after which they take possession of the man in the fort who capitulate to these tiberius assure the rights which have be agree upon and some other -lrb- -15 - -rrb- germanicus now turn to meet he adversary for many deserter who be in they rank prevent a peaceful settlement he succeed in enslave a place call arduba but could not do it with he own force though the latter be far greater than he opponent ' army the town have be powerfully strengthen and a river with a strong current surround its foundation except for a small space but the deserter have a dispute with the inhabitant because the latter be anxious for peace and come to blow with they the assailant have the coöperation of the woman in the town for these contrary to the judgment of the man desire liberty and be ready to suffer any fate whatever sooner than slavery : there be consequently a great battle the deserter be beat and surrender and some of they make they escape the woman catch up they child and some throw themselves into the fire other hurl themselves down into the river in this way that post be take and other near it voluntarily come to a understanding with germanicus he after effect this go back to tiberius and postumius -lrb- 1 -rrb- complete the subjugation of the remain section -lrb- -16 - -rrb- upon this bato send he son sceua to tiberius promising to surrender himself and all he follower if he could obtain protection when he have receive a pledge he come by night into he conqueror 's camp and be on the follow day lead before the latter who be seat on a platform bato ask nothing for himself even hold he head forward to await the stroke but in behalf of the rest he make a long defense be again ask by tiberius : why have it pleased you to revolt and to war against we so long a time he make the same answer as before : you be responsible for this for you send as guardian over you flock not dog or shepherd but wolf in this way then the war be end once more after many man and much money have be consume the legion support for it be very numerous whereas the spoil take be exceedingly meager -lrb- -17 - -rrb- on this occasion also germanicus announce the victory in honor of which augustus and tiberius be allow to bear the name imperator and to celebrate a triumph and they receive still other honor as well as two arch bear trophy in pannonium these at least be all of many distinction vote that augustus would accept germanicus receive triumphal honor -lrb- which belong likewise to the other commander -rrb- and prætorial honor the right of cast he vote immediately after the ex-consul and of obtain the consulship earlier than custom allow drusus the son of tiberius although he have not participate in the war be vote permission to attend the sitting of the senate before he become a member of that body and when he should become quæstor to cast he vote before the exprætors -lrb- -18 - -rrb- scarcely have these resolution be pass when terrible news that arrive from germany prevent they from hold any festival at that same period the follow event have take place in celtica the roman have a hold on part of it -- not the whole region but just place that happen to have be subdue so that the fact have not receive historical notice -- and soldier of theirs be use to winter there and city be be found the barbarian be adapt themselves to roman way be take up the custom of market and be hold peaceful meeting they have not however forget they ancestral habit they native manners the life of independence or the authority give by arm hence while they be unlearn they gradually and imperceptibly with careful watch they be not disturb by the changed condition of existence and they be become different without know it finally quintilius varus receive the command of germany and in the discharge of he office strove in administer the affair of the people to introduce more widespread change among they he treat they in general as if they be already slave levy money upon they as he have upon subject nation this they be not incline to endure for the prominent man long for they former ascendency and the mass prefer they accustomed constitution to foreign domination they do not openly revolt since they see there be many roman soldier near the rhine and many in they own territory but they receive varus pretend they would execute all he command and take he far away from the rhine into cherusci near the visurgi there by behave in a most peaceful and friendly manner they lead he to believe that they could be trust to live submissively without soldier -lrb- -19 - -rrb- consequently he do not keep he legion together as be proper in a enemy 's country and many of the man he distribute to helpless community who ask it for the suppose purpose of guard certain locality or arrest robber or escort provision train those deepest in the conspiracy and the leader of the plot and of the war among other armenius and segimerus be he constant companion and often entertain he he accordingly become confident and expect no harm not only refuse to believe all such as suspect the truth and advise he to be on he guard but even rebuke they on the ground that they be needlessly disturbed and slander he friend then there come a uprising first of those dwelling at a distance from he purposely contrived that varus should march against they and be easier overcome while on he journey through what he deem a friendly country and that he might not at once know that all be he enemy and guard himself against all of they it turn out precisely so they escort he on he set out and beg to be excuse from attendance -lrb- 2 -rrb- in order to gather auxiliary -lrb- as they say -rrb- after which they would quickly come to he assistance so then they take charge of force already in wait and after kill the different body of soldier for whom they have previously ask they encounter he in the midst of forest by this time hard to traverse there they show themselves as enemy instead of subject and work many deed of fearful injury -lrb- -20 - -rrb- the mountain have a uneven surface break by ravine and the tree stand close together be extremely tall hence the roman even before the enemy assault they be have hard work in felling road make and bridge place that require it they have with they many wagon and many beast of burden as in a time of peace not a few child and woman and a large body of servant be follow they -- another reason for they advance in scattered group meanwhile a great rain and wind come up that separate they still farther while the ground be slippery where there be root and log make walk very difficult for they and the top branch of tree which keep break off and fall down cause confusion while the roman be in such perplexity as this the barbarian suddenly encompass they from all side at once come through the thickest part of the underbrush since they be acquaint with the path at first they hurl from a distance then as no one defend himself but many be wound they approach closer to they the roman be in no order but go along helter-skelter among the wagon and the unarmed and so not be able to form readily in a body and be fewer at every point than they assailant they suffer greatly and offer no resistance at all -lrb- -21 - -rrb- accordingly they encamp on the spot after secure a suitable place so far as that be possible on a wooded mountain and afterward they either burn or abandon the majority of they wagon and everything else that be not absolutely necessary for they the next day they advance in better order with the aim of reach open country but they do not gain it without loss from there they go forward and plunge into the wood again defend themselves against the attack but endure no inconsiderable reverse in this very operation for whereas they be marshal in a narrow place in order that cavalry and heavy-armed man in a mass might run down they foe they have many collision with one another and with the tree dawn of the fourth day break as they be advance and again a violent downpour and mighty wind attack they which would not allow they to go forward or even to stand securely and actually deprive they of the use of they weapon they could not manage successfully they arrow or they javelin or indeed they shield -lrb- which be soak through -rrb- the enemy however be for the most part lightly equip and with power to approach and retire freely suffer less from the effect of the storm _ they _ number moreover increase as number of those who have at first waver join they particularly for the sake of plunder and so they could more easily encircle and strike down the roman who be already few many have perish in the previous battle varus therefore and the most eminent of the other leader fear that they might either be take alive or be kill by they bitterest foe -- for they have be wound -- dare do a deed which be frightful but not to be avoid : they kill themselves -lrb- -22 - -rrb- when this news be spread none of the rest even if he have strength still leave defend himself longer some imitate they leader other throw aside they arm allow who please to slay they to flee be impossible however one might wish it every man and horse therefore be cut down without resistance and the -lrb- 3 -rrb- and the barbarian occupy all the stronghold save one delay over which prevent they from either cross the rhine or invade gaul yet they find themselves unable to reduce this particular fort because they do not understand the conduct of siege and because the roman employ numerous archer who repeatedly repulse they and from first to last destroy a large proportion of the attack party later they learn that the roman have post a guard at the rhine and that tiberius be approach with a impose force of fighter therefore most of the barbarian retire from the fortress and the detachment still leave there withdraw some distance away so as not to be damage by sudden sally of the man inside and they keep watch of the road hope to capture the garrison through scarcity of food supply the roman within so long as they have abundance of sustenance remain where they be await relief but when no one come to they assistance and they be likewise a prey to hunger they watch for a stormy night and issue forth -- the soldier be but feed the unarmed many -- and they pass the first and second guard of they adversary but when they reach the third they be detect for on account of fatigue and fear and the darkness and cold the woman and child keep call to the man of fight age to come back they would all have perish or be capture have not the barbarian be so busily occupy with seize the plunder this give a opportunity for many of the most hardy to get some distance off and the trumpeter with they by sound the signal for a double quick march cause the enemy to think -lrb- for night be come on and they could not be see -rrb- that they have be send from asprenas therefore the foe cease they pursuit and asprena on learn what be take place render they assistance in reality some of the captive be later ransom by they relative and return for this be permit on condition that the ransom party should be outside of italy at the time -- but this be only afterward -lrb- -23 - -rrb- at the time when augustus hear of the disaster to varus he rent he clothing -lrb- as some assert -rrb- and mourn greatly over the lose soldier as also over the fear inspire by the german and the gaul he grief be especially keen because he expect that they would march upon italy and upon rome itself there be no citizen of military age worth mention that be leave and the ally force that be of any value have be ruin nevertheless he make preparation as well as he could in view of the circumstance : and when no one of the proper age for warfare show a willingness to be enrol he institute a drawing of lot and deprive of he property every fifth man to draw of those not yet thirty-five year old and every tenth man among those who be older besides disenfranchise they finally as very many pay no heed to he even then he put some to death he choose by lot as many as he could of those who have already finish they service and of the freedman and have enrol they send they at once in haste with tiberius into germany and as there be in rome a number of gaul and celtæ sojourning there for various purpose and some of they serve in the pretorian guard he fear that they might commit some act of insurrection : therefore he send such as be in he guard off to the island and order the unarmed class to leave the city -lrb- -24 - -rrb- this be the way be busy himself at that time and none of the usual business go on nor be the festival celebrate after this when he hear that some of the soldier have be save that the germany be garrison and the enemy do not dare to come down even to the rhine he cease to be excite and stop to consider the matter a catastrophe so great and prostrate as this it seem to he could have be due to nothing else than the wrath of some divinity : moreover by reason of the portent which take place both before the defeat and afterward he be greatly incline to suspect some miraculous work the temple of mar in the field of the same name have be strike by lightning and many locust that fly into the very city be devour by swallow the peak of the alp seem to totter toward one another and to send up three fiery column the sky in many place appear ablaze and at the same time numerous comet star come to view spear dart from the north seem to be fall upon the roman camp bee form they comb about roman altar a statue of victory which be in germany face hostile territory turn about toward italy and once a aimless battle and conflict of the soldier occur about the eagle in the camp as if the barbarian have fall upon they for these reason then and also because -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- ad 10 -lrb- _ a u _ 763 -rrb- -rrb- tiberius do not see fit to cross the rhine but keep quiet watch to see that the barbarian should not do so the latter however know he to be present do not venture to cross either germanicus be endear to the populace for many cause but particularly because he intercede for various person and this quite as much in the presence of augustus himself as before other justice now there be a court to try a quæstor who be charge with murder and as germanicus be go to be he advocate he accuser become alarmed lest he might consequently meet with defeat before those judge in whose presence such case be wont to be try and he desire to have augustus preside yet he effort be vain for he do not win he case holding -lrb- it -rrb- after he prætorship -lrb- ad 11 -lrb- _ a u _ 764 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -25 - -rrb- but in the follow season the temple of concord be dedicate by tiberius and both he name and that of drusus he dead brother be inscribe upon it in the consulship of marcus æmilius with statilius taurus tiberius and germanicus act as proconsul invade celtica and overrun some part of it they do not conquer however in any battle -lrb- since no one come to close quarter with they -rrb- and do not reduce any tribe for in they fear of fall victim to a new disaster they advance not far beyond the rhine but after remain there until late autumn and celebrate the birthday of augustus on which they hold a kind of horse-race under the direction of the centurion they return at rome drusus cæsar the son of tiberius become quæstor and sixteen prætors hold office because that number become candidate for the position and augustus mindful of he condition be unwilling to offend any of they the same do not hold true however of the year immediately follow but the number remain twelve for a long period besides these proceedings the seer be forbid to prophesy in private to any one or regard death even if there should be other with they yet in this matter augustus have no personal feeling so that by a bulletin he even publish to all the conjunction of star under which he have be bear in addition to forbid the above he proclaim to subject state that they should grant no honor to any one assign to govern they either during he term of office or within sixty day after he have depart for some governor by arrange for testimonial and eulogy from they subject be do much harm three senator as before transact business with the embassy and the knight -- a fact which might cause surprise -- be allow to fight as gladiator the reason be that some persist in disregard the disenfranchisement state as a penalty for such conduct and as there prove to be no use in forbid it and the participant seem to require a greater punishment before they would be turn aside from this course they be give permission to do as they like in this way they incur death instead of disenfranchisement for they fight more than ever and especially because they contest be center of attraction so that even augustus become a spectator in company with the prætors who superintend game -lrb- ad 12 -lrb- _ a u _ 765 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -26 - -rrb- germanicus soon after receive the office of consul though he have not even be prætor and hold it actually throughout the whole year not because of fitness but as a number of other hold office at that time the consul do nothing worthy of note save that at this time too he act as advocate in suit since he colleague gaius capito count as a mere figurehead augustus because he be grow old write a letter commend germanicus to the senate and the latter to tiberius : the manuscript be not read by he in person for he be unable to make himself hear but by germanicus as usual after that he ask they make the celtic war he excuse not to come to greet he at home nor to be angry if he do not continue to eat with they for generally as often as they have a sit in the forum and sometimes in the senate-house itself they salute he when he enter and again when he leave and it have already happen that when he be sit and sometimes lie down in the palatium not only the senate but the knight and many of the populace greet he -lrb- -27 - -rrb- all this time he continue to attend to he business as before he allow the knight to become candidate for the tribuneship and learn that vituperative book concern certain man be be write he order a search for they those that he find in the city he have burn by the ædiles and those outside by the official who might be in charge and he visit punishment upon some of the composer as there be many exile who be either carry on they occupation outside of the place to which they have be banish or live too luxuriously in the proper place he forbid that any one who have be debar from fire and water should stay either on the mainland or on any of the island distant less than four hundred stadium from the mainland only he make a exception of cos rhode samo -lrb- 5 -rrb- and lesbo for what reason i know not he enjoin upon they also that they should not cross the sea to any other point and should not possess more than one ship of burden have a capacity of one thousand amphoræ and two drive by oar that they should not employ more than twenty slave or freedman that they should not hold property above twelve and a half myriad and he threaten to take vengeance upon they for any violation as well as upon all other who should in any way assist they in violate these ordinance these be the law as fully as be necessary for we history that he lay down a festival extraordinary be conduct by the dancer and horse-breeder the feast of mar because the tiber have previously occupy the hipprodrome be this time hold in the forum of augustus and honor by a kind of horse-race and by the slaughter of wild beast it be celebrate a second time as custom decree and germanicus on that occasion kill two hundred lion in the hippodrome the so-called portico of julium be build in honor of gaius and lucius the cæsars and be at that time dedicated -lrb- ad 13 -lrb- _ a u _ 766 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -28 - -rrb- when lucius munatius and gaius silius have be register as consul augustus reluctantly accept the fifth decennial presidency of the state and give tiberius again the tribunician authority to drusus the latter 's son he grant permission to stand for the consulship a third year still without have hold the prætorship and for himself he ask twenty annual counselor because of he old age which do not permit he to visit the senate any longer save rarely previously fifteen be attach to he for six month it be further vote that any measure should have authority as satisfactory to the whole senate which should after deliberation be resolve upon by he in conjunction with tiberius and with the consul of the year with the man appoint for deliberation and he grandchild -lrb- the adopt one of course -rrb- and the other that he might on any occasion call upon for advice gain by the decree those power -lrb- which in reality he have in any case -rrb- he transact most of the be necessary business though sometimes lie down now as nearly all feel oppress by the five per cent tax and a political convulsion seem likely he send document to the senate bidding its member seek some other means of income this he do not in the intention of abolish the tax but in order that when no other appear to they preferable they might though reluctantly ratify it without declaim against he he also order germanicus and drusus not to make any official statement about it for fear that if they express a opinion person would suspect that this have be do by he order and choose that plan without further investigation there be much discussion and some scheme be submit to augustus in write when he find by they that the senator be ready to endure any form of tax rather than that in force he change it to a levy upon field and house and without tell how great it would be or in what way impose he immediately send man in different direction to make a list of the possession both of individual and of town he object be that they should fear loss on a large scale and so be content to pay the five per cent this actually happen and so it be that augustus settle the difficulty -lrb- -29 - -rrb- at the spectacle of the augustalium -lrb- 6 -rrb- which occur on he birthday a madman seat himself in the chair which be dedicate to julius cæsar and take he crown put it on this happen disturbed everybody for it seem to have some bearing upon augustus as indeed prove true -lrb- ad 14 -lrb- _ a u _ 767 -rrb- -rrb- for the following year when sextus apuleius and sextus pompeius be consul augustus set out for campanium and after superintend the game at naple soon pass away in nolum omen have appear to he not few by any means nor difficult to interpret that point to this end the sun suffer a total eclipse and most of the sky seem to be on fire the form of glowing log appear fall from it and bloody comet star be see when a senate-meeting have be announce on account of he sickness in order that they might offer prayer the senate-house be find close and a owl sit upon it hoot a thunderbolt fall upon he image standing on the capitol and erase the first letter of the name of cæsar this lead the seer to declare that on the hundredth day after that he should attain to some heavenly condition they make this deduction from the fact that the letter mention signify hundred among the latin and all the rest of the name mean god among the etruscan these sign appear while he be still alive man of later time call attention to the case of the consul and of servius sulpicius galba the former official be in some way related to augustus and galba who afterward come to power be at this time on the very first day of the year enrol among the iuvene since he be the first of the roman to become sovereign after the race of augustus have pass away it give occasion to some to say that this coincidence have not be due to mere accident but have be bring about by some divine counsel -lrb- -30 - -rrb- so augustus fall sick and die livium incur some suspicion regard the manner of he death inasmuch as he have secretly sail over to the island to meet agrippa and think to reconcile everything in a way satisfactory to all she be afraid some say that augustus would bring he back to make he sovereign and so smear with poison some fig that be still on tree from which augustus be wont to gather fruit with he own hand so she eat the one that have not be smear and point out the poison one to he from this or from some other cause he become ill and send for he associate he tell they all he wish finally add : rome be clay when i take it in hand : i leave it to you stone in this he have reference not entirely to the appearance of its building but also to the strength of the empire by ask some applause from they as to comic actor at the close of some mime he ridicule most tellingly the whole life of man thus on the nineteenth day of August the day on which he first become consul he pass away have live seventy-five year ten month and twenty-six day he have be bear on the twenty-third of September he reign as monarch from the time he conquer at actium forty-four year lack thirteen day -lrb- -31 - -rrb- he death however be not immediately make public livium fear that as tiberius be still in dalmatium there might be some uprising conceal the fact until the latter arrive this be the statement make in the larger number of history and the more trustworthy one there be some who have affirm that tiberius be present during the emperor 's illness and receive some injunction from he -- the body of augustus be carry from nolum by the foremost man of each city in succession when it come near rome the knight take it in charge and convey it by night into the city on the follow day there be a senate-meeting and to it the majority come wear the equestrian costume but the official the senatorial except for the purple-bordered toga tiberius and drusus he son wear dark clothing make in everyday fashion they too offer incense but make no use of a flute player most of the member sit in they accustomed place but the consul below one on the prætors ' bench and one on the tribune ' after this tiberius be absolved for have touch the corpse -- a forbid act -- and for have escort it on its way although the -lrb- -32 - -rrb- he will drusus take from the virgin priestess of vesta with whom it have be deposit and carry it into the senate those who have seal it view the impression and then it be read in hearing of the senate one polybius of cæsar 's household read he will as it be not proper for a senator to read anything of the sort it show that two-third of the inheritance have be leave to tiberius and the rest to livium -- at least this be one report in order that she too might have the benefit of he property he have ask permission of the senate to leave she so much since it be contrary to law these two be mention as inheritor he order many object and sum of money to be give to many different person both relative of he and those join by no tie of kindred not only to senator and knight but also to king for the people there be a thousand myriad and for the soldier two hundred and fifty denarius apiece to the pretorian half that amount to the city force and to the remainder of the native soldiery seventy-five each moreover in the case of child of whose father he have be the heir while they be still small he enjoin that everything together with income should be give back to they when they become man : this be indeed he custom while in life whenever he inherit the estate of any one who have offspring he never neglect to give it all to the man 's child immediately if they be already adult and later if it be otherwise though he take such a attitude toward other people 's child he do not restore he daughter from exile though he deem she worthy of gift and he forbid she be bury in he own tomb -- so much be learn from the will -lrb- -33 - -rrb- four book be then bring in and drusus read they in the first be write detail pertain to he funeral in the second all the work which he have do which he command to be inscribe aloft upon bronze column to be set around he heroum the third contain a account of military matter of the revenue and of the public expenditure the amount of money in the treasury and everything else of the sort have a bearing upon the administration and the fourth have injunction and order for tiberius and for the public among these last be a command that they should not liberate many slave and should thus avoid file the city with a variegated rabble he also exhort they not to enroll large number as citizen in order that there might be a distinct difference between themselves and subject nation to deliver the control of public business to all who have ability both to understand and to act and never to let it depend on any one person in this way no one would set he mind on a tyranny nor would the state go to piece if one fall he advise they to be satisfy with present possession and under no condition to wish to increase the empire to any greater dimension it would be hard to guard he say and this would lead to danger of they lose what be already theirs this principle he have himself really always follow not only in speech but also in action for whereas he might have make great acquisition of barbarian territory he have not wish to do so -- these be he injunction -lrb- -34 - -rrb- then come he funeral there be a couch make of ivory and gold and adorn with robe of purple mixed with gold in it he body be hide in a kind of box down below : a wax image of he in triumphal garb be display this one be bear from the palatium by the official for the following year and another of gold from the senate-house and still another upon a triumphal chariot behind these come the image of he ancestor and of he deceased relative -lrb- except of cæsar because he have be enrol among the hero -rrb- and those of other roman who have be prominent in any way begin with romulus himself a image of pompey the great be also see and all the nation he have acquire each represent by a likeness which bear some local characteristic be carry in procession after these follow all the remain object mention above when the couch have be place in view upon the orator ' platform drusus read something from that place : and from the other the rostrum of the julian shrine tiberius deliver the follow public oration over the deceased accord to a decree : -- -lrb- -35 - -rrb- what need to be say privately by relative over the divine augustus drusus have speak but since the senate have wisely deem he worthy of some kind of public utterance i know that the speech be fittingly entrust to I to whom more justly than to I he child and successor could be the task of praise he be confide it be not my privilege however to be gladden by the thought that my ability must prove no whit inferior to you desire in the matter and to he worth indeed if i be to speak among stranger i should be greatly alarmed lest in follow my speech they should believe he deed to be no better than i describe they as it be i be encourage by the thought that my word will be direct to you who know all of they thoroughly have experience they all and for that reason have deem he worthy of these very praise you will judge of he excellence not from what i may say but from what you yourselve know and you will assist my discourse make good what be deficient by you memory of event so that in this way he eulogy will become a public one give by all as i like the head of some chorus indicate the chief point and you come in with the remainder of the refrain i be certainly not afraid that you will hold I guilty of weakness because i be unable to meet you desire nor that you will be jealous to see he excellence go beyond you reach who do not understand the fact that not all mankind assemble in one place could worthily sound he praise and you all voluntarily make way for he to triumph not envious to think that not one of you could equal he but rejoice in he surpass greatness the greater he loom up before you the more greatly will you feel yourselve benefit so that envy will not be breed in you by you inferiority to he but awe from the advantage you have receive at he hand -lrb- -36 - -rrb- i shall begin at the point where he also begin to enter politics that be from he earliest manhood this indeed be one of the greatest achievement of augustus -- that when he have just emerge from boyhood and be enter upon the state of youth he pay attention to education so long as public affair be well manage by the famous cæsar the demi-god : when after the conspiracy against the latter the whole commonwealth be throw into confusion he at the same time amply avenge he father and render a much need aid to you not fear the multitude of he enemy nor dread the greatness of the business nor hesitate through he own immaturity yet what deed like this can be cite of alexander of macedon or we romulus who have the reputation of have do something brilliant when very young but these i shall pass over lest from merely compare they with he and bring they up -- and that among you who be acquaint with he no less than i -- i may be think to be diminish the greatness of augustus if i be to do this sort of thing i should be justify only if i look at he deed beside those of hercule : yet even then i should fail of my effect inasmuch as the latter kill only serpent when he be a child a stag and a boar when he be a man -- oh yes and by jupiter a lion also though reluctantly and in obedience to a command whereas we hero voluntarily make war and enact law not among beast but among man carefully preserve the commonwealth and himself gain brilliance it be for this that you choose he prætor and appoint he consul at that age when some be unwilling even to serve in the army -lrb- -37 - -rrb- this be the beginning of political life for augustus and it be the beginning of my speech about he soon after see that the largest and best portion both of the people and of the senate be in accord with he but that lepidus and antony sextus brutus and cassius be employ rebel he fear that the city might become involve in many war -- civil war -- at once and be so torn asunder and exhaust as not to be able to revive in any fashion and so he manipulate they very cleverly and to the greatest public good he attach himself to the strong one who be menace the very city and with they fight the other till he make a end of they : when these be out of the way he in turn free we from the former he choose against he will to surrender a few to they wrath so that he might save the majority and he choose to assume a friendly attitude toward they individually so as not to have to fight with they all at once from this he derive no individual gain but aid we all most evidently why should one speak at length to enumerate he deed in the war both at home and abroad consider especially that the former ought never to have occur at all and that the latter by the conquest gain show they advantage better than any word moreover that they largely depend upon chance that the success be obtain with the aid of many citizen and many ally so that these deserve the credit equally with he and finally that the achievement might possibly be compare with those of some other these accordingly i shall put aside you can behold and read they inscribe in letter and character in many place i shall speak only of the work which belong to augustus himself which have never be perform by any other man and have not only cause we city to survive from many danger of a sort but have render it more prosperous and powerful the mention of they will confer upon he a unique glory and will afford the elder among you a innocent pleasure while give the younger man a exact instruction in the character and constitution of the government -lrb- -38 - -rrb- this augustus then whom you deem worthy of this title for the very reason just cite as soon as he have free himself from the civil war after act and endure -lrb- not in a way that pleased himself -rrb- as heaven approve first of all preserve the life of most of he opponent who be survivor of the army and thus he in no way imitate sullum call the fortunate not to give you a list of all of they who do not know about sosius about scaurus the brother of sextus and particularly about lepidus who live so long a time after he defeat and continue to be high priest he whole life through next he honor he companion in conflict with many great gift but do not allow they to act in any arrogant way or to be wanton you know thoroughly among other in this category both mæcenas and agrippa so that there be no need of my enumerate the name augustus have two quality too which be never unite in any one else some conqueror i know have spare they enemy and other have refuse to allow they companion to give way to license but both sort of behavior at once continually without any exception be never find in the same man here be evidence sullum and marius treat as enemy even the child of those who fight against they why need i cite the other less important man pompey and cæsar be in general guiltless of this conduct but permit they friend to do not a few thing that be contrary to they own principle but this man have each of the two virtue so fuse and intermingle that to he adversary he make defeat look like victory and to he comrade he show a happiness in excellence -lrb- -39 - -rrb- after do this and quiet by kindness all that remain of factional dispute and impose temperance by he benefit upon the victorious military he might as a result of this and the weapon and the money at he command have be indisputably the sole lord of everything as indeed he have be make by the very course of event yet he refuse and like a good physician who take in hand a disease-ridden body and heal it he restore everything to you after make it well and to what this action amount you can best realize from the fact that we father speak in praise of pompey and metellus who be formerly prominent because they voluntarily disband the force with which they have be engage in war now if they who have but a small force and a merely temporary one and besides saw opponent who would not allow they to do otherwise -- if they receive praise for do this -- how could one speak fittingly of the magnanimity of augustus he hold all you force however great he be master of all you fund vast in amount have no one to fear or suspect : but whereas he might have rule alone with the approval of all he would not accept such a course but lay the arm the province the money at you foot wherefore you with wise insistence and proper prudence would not have it nor allow he to retire to private life you know well that democracy would never accommodate itself to such tremendous interest but that the superintendence of a single person would most surely preserve they and so refuse what be nominally independence but really factional discord and make choice of he whom you have prove worthy by he very deed you compel he to stand at you head for a time at least when you have in this way test he even more than before you finally force he a second a third a fourth and a fifth time to remain as manager of public affair -lrb- -40 - -rrb- it be only natural who would not choose to be safe without trouble to be prosperous without danger to enjoy unsparingly the blessing of government and not to be disturb by care for its maintenance who be there that could rule even he private possession better than augustus to say nothing of the goods of so many human being he accept the try and hostile province for he own portion to guard and preserve but restore to you all such other as be peaceful and free from danger though he support such a large standing army to fight in you behalf he let the soldier be troublesome to none of he own countryman but render they to outsider most terrifying guardian to the people at home unarmed and unwarlike the senator in place of authority be not deprive of appeal to the lot but prize for excellence be furnish they in addition he do not destroy the power of the ballot in they decision and he guarantee safety in free speech as well case difficult to decide he transfer from the people to the search justice of the court but preserve to the popular body the dignity of the election and trained citizen in these to seek a means of honor not of strife he even cut away the ambitious greed of office seeker and put a regard for reputation in its place he own money which he increase by legitimate method he spend for public need : for the public fund he care as if they be he own while he refrain from touch they as belong to other he see that all public work that be fall to decay be repair and deprive no one connect with they renovation of the glory attach : many structure he build anew -lrb- some in he own name some in that of another -rrb- or else give other charge of erect they consequently he gaze be direct toward public utility and privately he grudge no one the fame to be derive from public service wantonness among he own kin he recompense relentlessly but the offence of other he treat with humaneness those who have trait of excellence he allow to come as near as they could to he own standard and with the conduct of such as live otherwise he do not concern himself minutely among those who conspire against he he invoke justice upon only those whose life be of no profit even to themselves the rest he place in such a position that for a great while they could obtain no excuse either true or false for attack he it be nothing surprising that he be occasionally the object of conspiracy for even the god do not please all alike the excellence of good ruler be discernible not in the villainy of other but in they own good behavior -lrb- -41 - -rrb- i have speak quirite of he greatest and most striking characteristic in a rather summary way for if one should desire to enumerate all of he great point individually it would need many day furthermore i know that though you will have hear so few fact from I they will lead you to remember for yourselve everything else and it will seem almost as if i have speak that too in the rest that i have say about he i have not be speak in a spirit of vainglory -lrb- 7 -rrb- nor have that be you state of mind in listen but i intend that he many noble achievement might obtain a ever memorable glory in you soul who would not feel inclined to make mention of he senator -- how without give offence he remove the scum that have come to the surface from the faction how by this very act he exalt the remainder magnify it by increase the property requirement and enriched it by grant of money how he vote on a equality with the senator and have they help in make change how he communicate to they all the greatest and most important matter either in the meeting-place or else at he house whither he call different member at different time because of he age and bodily infirmity who would not like to cite the condition of the rest of the roman before whom he set public work money game festival amnesty a abundance of food safety not only from the enemy and evildoer but even from the act of heaven nor such alone as befall by day but by night as well or again the ally -- how he make they freedom free from danger and they alliance to involve no loss or the subject nation -- how no one of they be treat with insolence or abuse how can one forget a man who be in private life poor in public life rich saving in he own case but liberal of expenditure for other -- one who even endure all toil and danger for you but would not submit to you escort he when he go forth on any expedition or to you meeting he when he return : one who on festival admit even the populace to he home but on other day greet even the senate only in its chamber how could one forget the number and precision as well of he law which contain for the wrong a all-sufficient consolation and for the wrongdoer a not inhuman punishment or he reward offer to those who marry and have child or the prize give to the soldier without disadvantage to any other person then there be the fact of he be satisfy with we possession once for all acquire by the will of destiny and he refusal to subjugate additional territory for while imagine that we bear a wider sway we might meantime lose all we have you recall how he always share the joy and sorrow the jest and earnestness of he intimate friend and allow absolutely all who could make any useful suggestion to feel free to speak how he praise those who speak the truth and hate flatterer how he bestow upon many large sum from he own means and how when aught be bequeath to he by man with child he restore it all to those child what oblivion be dark enough to bury all this it be for this therefore i say that you naturally make he you head and a father of the people that you deck he with many mark of esteem and numerous consulship and finally declare he a hero and publish he as immortal hence we ought not either to mourn for he but to give he body back now in due time to nature and to glorify he spirit as that of a god forever -lrb- -42 - -rrb- this be what tiberius read directly after the same man as before take up the couch and carry it through the triumphal gateway accord to the senate 's decree there be present and take part in carry he out the senate and the equestrian class the woman of he family and the pretorian guard and nearly everybody else in the city be in attendance when the body have be place on the pyre in the campus martius all the priest march about it first and then the knight all the magistrate and other and the heavy-armed force for garrison duty run around it and they cast upon it all the triumphal decoration which any of they have ever receive from he for any deed of valor next the centurion take torch conformably to a decree of the senate and kindle the fire from beneath so it be consume and a eagle release from it fly aloft appear to bear he spirit into heaven when this have be accomplish most of those present depart but livium remain on the spot for five day in company with the most prominent knight and gather he bone which she place in the monument the show of grief require by law be prolonged -lrb- -43 - -rrb- only for a few day by the man but by the woman accord to a decree for a whole year real grief not in the heart of many at the time but later feel by all the citizen augustus have be accessible to all and be accustom to aid many person in the matter of money he use to bestow honor scrupulously upon he friend and delighted exceedingly to have they speak frankly one instance in addition to what have be tell occur in the case of athenodorus the latter be once bring into he room in a covered litter as if it be some woman and leap from it sword in hand ask : be not you afraid that some one may come in this way and kill you instead of be angry augustus thank he for he suggestion the people consequently be wont to recall these trait of he and how he do not get blindly enrage at those who injure he as well as how he keep faith with even such as be unworthy of it there be a robber name corocotta who flourish in spain and the emperor be in the first place so angry at he that he offer twenty-five myriad to the man that capture he alive later the robber come to he of he own accord and he not only do he no harm but make he richer by the amount of money mention hence the roman miss he mightily for these reason as well as because by mingle monarchy with democracy he preserve they freedom for they and secure orderliness and security so that they life free from the audacity of democracy free from the wantonness of tyranny be cast in a liberty of moderation and under a monarchy without terror they be subject of royalty yet not slave and democratic citizen without discord -lrb- -44 - -rrb- if any of they remember he former deed in the course of the civil war they lay they to the pressure of circumstance and they think it fair to look for he real disposition which have give he undisputed authority this offer in truth a mighty contrast any one who go carefully into each of he separate action will find this true in regard to the mass of they i must record curtly that he stop all factional dispute transform the government in a way to give it power and strengthen it greatly therefore if any deed of violence be encounter -- as be often bind to happen when the face of a situation shift unexpectedly -- one might more justly blame the circumstance themselves than he not the smallest factor in he glory be the length of he reign the majority of those that have live under a democracy and the more powerful have time to die those who be leave know nothing of that form of government and have be rear entirely or mostly under exist condition be not only not displeased with they -- they have become so familiar -- but take delight in they for they see that these be better and more free from terror than other of which they hear -lrb- -45 - -rrb- though the people know this during he life they nevertheless realize it more fully after he decease human nature be so constitute that in good fortune it do not perceive its prosperity so fully as it miss it when evil day arrive this be the case then in regard to augustus when they find he successor tiberius not the same sort of man they long for the previous emperor person with they wit about they have some immediate evidence of the change in the constitution the consul pompeius who go out to meet the man bear the body of augustus receive a blow in the leg and have to be carry back with the body a owl sit over the senate-house again at the very first sit of the senate after he death and utter many ill-omened cry the two man differ so from each other that some suspect that augustus with full knowledge of tiberius 's character have purposely appoint he for successor to the end that he himself might have greater glory this begin to be rumor at a later date -lrb- -46 - -rrb- at this time they declare augustus immortal and assign to he attendant and sacred rite make livium -lrb- who be already call julium and augusta -rrb- he priestess permission be grant livium to employ a lictor during the service and she bestow upon a certain numerius atticus a senatorial exprætor twenty-five myriad because he swear that he have see augustus ascend into heaven after the manner describe in the case of proclus and of romulus a heroüm vote by the senate and build by livium and tiberius be erect to the dead emperor in rome and other at many different point sometimes with the consent of the nation concern and sometimes without they consent also the house at nolum where he pass away be dedicate to he as a precinct while the heroüm be be build in rome they place a golden image of he upon a couch in the temple of mar and to this they pay all the honor that they be afterward to give to he statue other vote in regard to he be that he image should not be bear in procession at any one 's funeral and the consul should celebrate he birthday with game no less than that of mar -lrb- 8 -rrb- the tribune as be sacrosanct be to manage the augustalium these official conduct everything as have be the custom wear the triumphal costume at the horse-race they do not however ascend the chariot besides this livium hold a private festival in he honor for three day in the palatium and this be continue to the present day by whoever be emperor -lrb- -47 - -rrb- this be the extent of the decree pass in memory of augustus nominally by the senate but really by tiberius and livium various man make various motion and they decide that tiberius should receive write proposal from they and pick out whatever he choose i have add the name of livium because she take a share in the proceedings as though she have full power meantime the populace be plunge in tumult because at the augustalium one of the dancer would not enter the theater for the stipulate pay they do not cease they disturbance until the tribune convene the senate without delay and beg that body to allow they to spend something more than the legal amount -- here end my account of augustus -lrb- footnote 1 : undoubtedly _ c vibius _

education but he have a most peculiar nature he never let what he desire appear in he talk and about what he say he wish he usually care nothing at all thus he word indicate just the opposite of he real purpose : be deny any interest in what he long for and urge the claim of what he hate he would exhibit anger over matter that be very far from arouse he rage and make a show of affability where he be most vexed he would pity those whom he severely punish and retain a grudge against those whom he pardon sometimes he would regard he dearest foe as he nearest friend and again he would act toward he most intimate companion as if the latter be thoroughly hostile in general he think it bad policy for the independent sovereign to reveal he state of mind this be the source he say of great failure but by the opposite course even more success and greater be attain if he have merely follow this method without complication he would have have no protection against such as have come to know he they would have take everything by contrary and would have deem he say that he do not wish something to be equivalent to he ardently desire it and that he be eager for something equivalent to he not be concern about it it happen however that he become angry if any one give evidence of understand he many be those he put to death for no other offence than have comprehend he it be a dangerous matter then to fail to understand he -- for many be ruin by approve what he say instead of what he wish -- but still more dangerous to understand he such person be suspect of discover he practice and be consequently displeased with it practically the only sort of man that could maintain himself -- and such a person be rarely find -- be one who do not misunderstand he nature yet do not subject it to uncomfortable exposure under these condition man would not be deceive by believe he nor be hate for reveal they comprehension of he policy for he give plenty of trouble both to any one who oppose what he say and to any one who favor it as he be really anxious for one thing to be do but want to appear to desire something different he invariably regard those who take either side as he opponent and therefore be hostile to the one class because of he real feeling and to the other for the sake of appearance -lrb- -2 - -rrb- it be due to this characteristic that as emperor he send a dispatch straight from nolum to the legion and province declare that he be emperor this name which be vote he along with the rest he would not accept and though take the portion of augustus he would not adopt this title of he at a time when he be already surround by the body-guard he ask the senate to help he escape suffer any violence at the burial of the emperor 's body he be afraid some man might snatch it up and burn it in the forum as they have that of cæsar when somebody thereupon as a compliment vote that he be give a guard as if he have none he see through the man 's flattery and answer : the soldier be not mine but the public 's besides do this he administer in fact all the business of the empire meanwhile declare that he want none of it at first he say he should give it all up on account of he age -- fifty-six -- and he near-sightedness -lrb- although he see extremely well in the dark he eye in the daylight be very weak -rrb- later he ask for some associate and colleague though not to take charge of the whole domain at once as in a oligarchy but he divide it into three part one of which he should retain himself and yield the remain two to other one of these portion consist of rome and the rest of italy the second of the legion the third of the subject people outside though he become very urgent most of the senator still oppose he and beg he to govern the entire realm but asinius gallus who employ the frank speech of old day more than be good for he reply : choose whichever part you wish tiberius rejoin : how be it feasible for the same man both to make the division and to choose gallus perceive into what a plight he have fall frame he word to flatter he interrupt to the effect that : i not set before you the idea of you have a third but the impossibility of the empire 's be divide in fact however he do not mollify tiberius but after first undergo many dire suffering be subsequently murder for gallus have marry the former wife of the new ruler and claim drusus as he son and consequently there have be hatred between they before this -lrb- -3 - -rrb- tiberius act in this way at that time chiefly because it be he nature and he have determine upon that policy but partly also because he be suspicious of the pannonian and germanic legion and fear germanicus the ruler of the germany of that day and a favorite of theirs he have previously make sure of the soldier in italy by means of the oath establish by augustus but as he be suspicious of the other he wait for either possible outcome intend to save himself by retire to private life in case the legion should revolt and prevail for this reason he often feign sickness and remain at home so as not to be compel to say or do anything definite i have even hear that when it begin to be say that livium against the will of augustus have keep the empire for he he take such action -lrb- 1 -rrb- that he might appear to have receive it not from she -lrb- with whom he be on very bad term -rrb- but under compulsion from the senator through surpass they in excellence again i have hear that when he see that people be cool toward he he wait and delay in order that they in the hope of he voluntarily resign the empire might no adopt rebellious measure until he have secure a unshakable control of the government still i do not record these story as the true cause of he delay but rather he usual disposition and the disturbance among the soldier he send some one from nolum and have agrippa kill at once yet he declare this have not be do by he order and he threaten the perpetrator of the deed instead of punish he however he allow man to invent version of the affair some to the effect that augustus have put he out of the way just before he death other that the centurion who be guard he slew he on he own responsibility for some revolutionary dealings other that livia and not tiberius have order he death -lrb- -4 - -rrb- this rival then he have remove from the scene immediately but there remain germanicus whom he fear mightily the soldier in pannonium have rise as soon as they learn of the demise of augustus they gather in one fort and have strengthen it they take many step toward rebellion among other thing they attempt to kill they leader junius blæsus and arrest and tortured he slave in general what they want be to have the period of service extend over not more than sixteen year and they demand that they should receive a denarius per day and be give at once he prize that be in the camp in case they do not obtain they demand they threaten to make the province revolt and to march upon rome indeed they be at this time with difficulty win over by the persuasion of blæsus to send envoy to tiberius at rome in regard to these matter for they hope during this change in the government to accomplish the utmost of they desire either by frightening the emperor into it or by give the power to some one else subsequently when drusus come upon they with the pretorian they be throw into tumult once more because no definite answer be return they some of he follower they wound and they put a guard around he in the night to prevent he escape notice however a eclipse of the moon occur they feel they boldness begin to waver so that they do no further harm to this detachment and despatched envoy again to tiberius meantime a great storm come up and when on this account every one have retire to he own quarter the most audacious soldier be destroy some in one manner some in another by drusus and he associate in he own tent whither he have summon they on some unsignifying pretext the rest be restore to good standing on condition of surrender for punishment those responsible for the uprising in this way this division become quiet -lrb- -5 - -rrb- the warrior in germany however where many have be assemble on account of the war would not hear of moderation since they see that germanicus be both a cæsar and far superior to tiberius but proclaim publicly the above fact they heap abuse upon tiberius and salute germanicus as emperor when after much plead he find himself unable to reduce they to order finally he draw he sword as if to despatch himself they cry out upon he in horror and one of they proffer he own sword say : take this this be sharper germanicus see to what length the matter have go do not venture to kill himself particularly as he have reason to believe that they would persist in they uprising none the less therefore he compose a letter purport to have be send from tiberius give they twice the gift bequeath they by augustus -- pretend it be the emperor who do this -- and release those who be beyond the age of service most of they belong to the city troops which augustus have gather as a extra force after the disaster to varus as a result they cease for the time be they seditious behavior later on come senator as envoy from tiberius to whom the latter have secretly communicate only so much as he wish germanicus to know he feel quite sure that they would tell he the emperor 's plan in they entirety and accordingly do not care that either they or germanicus should trouble themselves about anything further the instruction deliver be suppose to comprise everything now when these man have arrive and the soldier learn about the trick germanicus have play a suspicion spring up that the presence of the senator mean the overthrow of they leader 's measure and this lead to new turmoil the man-at-arms almost kill some of the envoy and to the point of seize germanicus 's wife agrippina -lrb- daughter of agrippa and julium the daughter of augustus -rrb- and he son both of whom have be send by he to some place for refuge the boy be call gaius caligulum because be bring up for the most part in the camp he wear the military shoe instead of those usual at the capital at the request of germanicus they release to he agrippina who be pregnant but they retain possession of gaius yet on this occasion too as they accomplish nothing they after a time grow quiet in fact they experience such a revulsion of sentiment that of they own accord they arrest the boldest of they number : and some they kill privately the rest they bring before a gathering and then accord to the wish of the majority -lrb- -6 - -rrb- they execute some and release other germanicus be still afraid that they would make another uprising invade the enemy 's country and there spend some time give they plenty of work and abundant food -- the fruit of other ' labor thus though he might have obtain the imperial power -- for he find favor in the sight of absolutely all the roman as well as they subject -- he decline the honor for this tiberius praise he and send many please message both to he and to agrippina : he be not however please with he rival 's progress but fear he all the more because he have win the attachment of the legion tiberius assume that he do not feel as he appear to do from he own consciousness of say one thing and do another hence he be suspicious of germanicus and further suspicious of he wife who be possess of a ambition appropriate to she lofty lineage yet he display no sign of irritation toward they but deliver many eulogy of germanicus in the senate and propose sacrifice to be offer in honor of he achievement as he do in the case of drusus also he bestow upon the soldier in pannonium the same privilege as germanicus have give for the future however he refuse to release member of the service outside of italy until they have serve the twenty year -lrb- -7 - -rrb- now when no further news of a revolutionary nature come but all part of the roman world begin to yield a steady acquiescence to he leadership he no longer practice dissimulation regard the acceptance of sovereign power and manage the empire so long as germanicus live in the way i be about to describe he do little or nothing that be on he own responsibility but bring even the smallest matter before the senate and communicate they to that body in the forum a platform have be erect on which he sit in public to transact business and he always gather about he adviser after the manner of augustus moreover he do not take any step of consequence without make it know to the rest he state he own opinion openly and not only grant every one the right to oppose it freely in speech but sometimes even endure to have some vote directly against it often he would cast a vote himself drusus do this like the rest now vote first and again after some other the emperor would sometimes remain silent and sometimes give he opinion first or after a few other or even last in some case he would speak out directly but generally -lrb- to avoid appear to have cut short they freedom of speech -rrb- he would say : if i be to give my view i should propose this or that this have equal influence with the other method only those who come after be not prevent by he from state what appear good to they but frequently he would outline one plan and those who come after he would prefer something different occasionally they even prevail yet for all that he harbor anger against no one he hold court himself as i have state but he also attend the magistrate ' court both when summon by they and without a invitation these official he allow to sit in they own place : he himself take he seat on the bench located opposite they and as preside officer make any remark that seem to he pertinent -lrb- -8 - -rrb- in all other matter too he behave in this same way he would not allow himself to be call master by the freedman nor imperator except by the soldier the title of _ pater patriæ _ he put away from he entirely : that of _ augustus _ he do not assume -lrb- for he never permit the question to be put to vote -rrb- but endure to hear it speak and to read it when write moreover when he send message to any king he would regularly include this title in he letter in general he speak of himself as cæsar sometimes as germanicus -lrb- from the exploit of germanicus -rrb- and _ princep senatus _ accord to ancient usage often he use to say : my position be that of master of the slave imperator of the soldier and first citizen among the rest he would pray whenever it happen that he be so engage that he might live and rule so long a time as should be to the advantage of the public and he be so democratic in all circumstance alike that on he birthday he do not permit any unusual demonstration and he do not give people the right to swear by he fortune nor do he prosecute any one who after swearing by it incur the charge of perjury in short he would not -lrb- at first at least -rrb- sanction in he own case the carry out of the custom which have obtain as a matter of course on the first day of the year down to the present in honor of augustus of all ruler that come after he of whom we make any account and of such as nowadays succeed to imperial privilege -- namely the ratification under oath of what they have do and of what they shall do by citizen alive during the particular year in question yet in the case of the measure of augustus he both administer the oath to other and take it himself in order to render he attitude more striking he would let the first day of the month go by not enter the senate nor show himself at all in the city on that day but spend the time in some suburb then later he would come in and take pledge separately this be part of the reason that he remain somewhere outside on the first day of the month but he be also anxious to avoid disturbing any of the inhabitant who be concern with the new office and the festival and to avoid take money from they he do not even commend augustus for he behavior in this respect because it bring about great dissatisfaction and a great expenditure in order to return favor -lrb- -9 - -rrb- not only in this way be he action democratic but no precinct be set apart for he either by he own choice or in any other way -- that be to say at this time nor be any one allow to set up a image of he without delay he expressly forbid any city or individual to do this to this refusal he attach the phrase unless i grant permission but he add : i will not grant it least of all do he assume to have be insult or to have be impiously treat by any one -lrb- man be already call such a procedure impiety and be bring many suit base on that ground -rrb- he would not hear of any such indictment be bring for he own benefit though he pay tribute to the majesty of augustus in this matter also at first he would not punish even such as have incur charge for they action in regard to he predecessor and some against whom complaint be make of they have perjure themselves by the fortune of augustus he release as time go on however he put a very great number to death -lrb- -10 - -rrb- not only do he magnify augustus as above state but in give the finish touch to the building of which augustus have lay the foundation -lrb- though not bring they to completion -rrb- he inscribe the first emperor 's name the latter 's statue and heroä likewise whether those that the province or those that individual be erect he partly consecrate himself and partly assign to some member of the pontifice this plan of inscribe the builder 's name he carry out not only in the case of the actual monument of augustus himself but equally in the case of all such as need any repair he put in good condition all building that have fall to decay -lrb- not construct anything new at all himself except the temple of augustus -rrb- and appropriate none of they but restore to all of they the same name name of the original builder while expend extremely little for himself he lay out very great sum for the common good either building over or adorning practically all the public work he assist many city and individual and enriched numerous senator who be poor and on that account be no longer willing to be member of the senate however he do not do this promiscuously and even expunge the name of some for licentiousness and of other for poverty when they could give no adequate reason for it every gift that be bestow upon any person be count out directly in he presence for since in the day of augustus the official who make the presentation be wont to deduct large sum for they own use he take the greatest care that this should not happen during he reign all the expenditure moreover he make from the regular source of income he kill no one for he money do not confiscate -lrb- at this time -rrb- any one 's property nor collect any fund by abuse indeed when aemilius rectus once send he from egypt of which he be governor more money than be require he send he a message say : to shear my sheep and not to shave they to the skin be what i desire -lrb- -11 - -rrb- furthermore he be extremely easy of access and ready to grant a audience the senator he bid greet he all at once and so avoid jostle one another in fine he show himself so considerate that once when the leader of the rhodian send he some communication and fail to write at the foot of the letter this customary formulum about offer they prayer for he welfare he summon they in haste as if he intend to do they some harm but on they arrival instead of administer any serious rebuke have they subscribe what be lack and then send they away the temporary official he honor as he would have do in a democracy even rise from he seat at the approach of the consul whenever he entertain they at dinner he would in the first place receive they at the door when they enter and secondly escort they on they way when they depart in case he be at any time be carry anywhere in he litter he would not allow even one of the knight who be prominent to accompany he still less a senator on the occasion of festival or so often as anything similar be go to afford the people leisure he would go the evening before to one of the cæsarians who live near the place where there be sure to be a large crowd and there pass the night he object be to make it possible for the people to meet he with a minimum of formality and fatigue the equestrian contest he would often watch in person from the house of some freedman he attend the spectacles very frequently in order to do honor to those who give they as well as to ensure the orderliness of the multitude and to seem to take a interest in they celebration really he do not care in the least about anything of the kind nor do he have the reputation of be enthusiastic in these matter in every way he be so fair and equal that when the populace once desire that a certain dancer be set free he would not approve the proposal until the man 's master have be persuade and receive the value of he chattel he intercourse with he companion be like that between private individual : he help they when they be sue and join they in the ceremony of sacrifice he visit they when they be sick take no guard into the room with he over one of they who die he himself deliver the funeral oration -lrb- -12 - -rrb- moreover he bid he mother behave in a similar manner so far as it be proper for she to do so partly that she might imitate he and partly to prevent she become overproud she occupy a position of great prominence far above all woman of former time so that she could at any time receive the senate and such of the people as so wish to greet she in she house this be also inscribe in the public record the letter of tiberius bear for a time she name also and be write by both with equal authority except that she never venture to enter the senate or the camp or the public assembly she undertake to man age everything like a sole ruler in the time of augustus she have have great influence and she declare that it be she who make tiberius emperor consequently she be not satisfy to rule on equal term with he but wish to assert a superiority over he in this way many measure out of the ordinary be introduce and many person vote that she should be call mother of she country many other that she should he term parent other propose that tiberius should receive he name from she that just as the greek be call by they father 's name so he should be call by he mother 's this vex he and he neither ratify the honor vote she -lrb- save a very few -rrb- nor allow she any further unusual freedom of action for instance she have once dedicate in she house a image to augustus and in honor of the event wish to entertain the senate and the knight together with they wife but he would not grant she permission to carry out any part of this program until the senate have vote it and not even then to receive the man at dinner instead he entertain the latter and she attend to the woman finally he remove she entirely from the public sphere allow she to direct affair within door then as she be troublesome even in this capacity he proceed to absent himself from the city and avoid she in every way possible it be chiefly on she account that he remove to capreae -- this be the tradition that obtain about livium -lrb- -13 - -rrb- now tiberius begin to treat more harshly those accuse of any crime and become at enmity with he son drusus who be most licentious and cruel -lrb- as be evidence by the fact that the sharpest kind of sword be call drusian after he -rrb- he he often censure both privately and publicly once he say to he outright in the presence of many witness : while i live you shall perform no act of violence or insolence and if you venture to do any such thing you shall be cut off from the possibility after i be dead for during some time the emperor continue to live a very temperate life and allow no one else to indulge in licentiousness but punish number for it yet once when the senator evince a desire to have a penalty impose by law upon those guilty of lewd living he would make no such ruling explain that it be better to correct they privately in some way or other instead of lay they open to a public punishment under exist condition he say there be a chance of bring some of they to moderation through fear of disgrace and they might endeavor to escape discovery but if the law should once be overcome by nature no one would pay any further heed to it not a few man also be wear quantity of purple clothing -lrb- though this have formerly be forbid -rrb- of these no one be either rebuke or fine : but when a rain come up on a certain festival the emperor put on a dark woolen cloak after this none of they dare any longer to assume any different kind of garb this be the way he behave under all condition so long as germanicus live subsequent to that event he change many of he way perhaps he have be mind from the first as he later appear to feel and have be merely sham as long as germanicus exist because he see that he be lie in wait for the leadership or perhaps he be excellent by nature but drift into vice when he be deprive of he rival -lrb- -14 - -rrb- i shall notice also separate event -- all those at least that deserve mention -- each in its proper place -lrb- ad 15 -lrb- _ a u _ 768 -rrb- -rrb- in the consulship of drusus he son and of gaius norbanus he present to the people the bequest make by augustus : this be after some one have approach a corpse that be be carry out through the forum for burial and bend down have whisper something in its ear when the spectator ask what he have say he state that he have commission the dead to tell augustus that they have get nothing as yet this man the emperor immediately despatch in order -lrb- as he jokingly say -rrb- that he might carry he own message to augustus with the rest he settle after a little distribute sixty-five denarius apiece some say this payment be make the previous year at this time certain knight desire to enter a championship contest in the game which drusus have arrange for he own celebration and that of germanicus tiberius do not view they combat and when one of they be kill he forbid the other to fight as a gladiator again still other conflict take place in connection with the horse-race that be in honor of augustus 's birthday indeed a few beast be slay so thing go on for a number of year at this time too crete its governor be dead be attach to the quaestorship and to the quaestor 's assistant for the future since also many of those to whom the province have be allot linger in rome and in the remainder of italy for a long time so that those who have hold the office before they delay contrary to precedent tiberius command that they should take they departure by the first day of June meanwhile he grandson by drusus die but he neglect none of he customary duty it be he settle conviction that a governor of man ought not to give up care of the common weal by reason of private misfortune and he confirm the rest in they purpose not to jeopardize the interest of the living because of the dead the river tiber now proceed to occupy a large portion of the city so that there be a inundation most people regard this also as a prodigy like the great earthquake which shake down a portion of the wall and like the frequent fall of thunderbolt which make wine leak even from pail that be sound the emperor however think that it be due to the great number of spring appoint five senator choose by lot to constitute a permanent board to look after the river to the end that it should not give out in summer nor become over full in winter but flow evenly so far as possible all the time these be the measure of tiberius as for drusus he perform the duty pertain to the consulship along with he colleague as any private citizen might have do be leave heir to someone 's estate he assist in carry out the funeral yet he be so prone to anger that he inflict blow upon a distinguish knight and for this exploit he obtain the surname of castor -lrb- 2 -rrb- and he show himself such a hard drinker that one night when he be force to lend aid with the pretorian to some people whose property be on fire he command at they request for water to pour it out hot for they he be so fond of dancer that this class raise a tumult and would not be bring to order by the law which tiberius have introduce to apply to they -lrb- ad 16 -lrb- _ a u _ 769 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -15 - -rrb- these be the event of that period now when statilius taurus be consul with lucius libo tiberius forbid any man to wear silk clothing and likewise to use gold ornament except for sacred ceremony as some be at a loss to know whether it be forbid they also to possess silver ornament which have some gold inlay he wish to issue some decree about this too but he refuse to let the word _ emblaema _ since it be a greek term be insert in the original document yet he could find no native word that would describe such inlaid work this be the position he take in that matter now there be a centurion who wish to give some evidence before the senate in greek and he would not allow it yet he be wont to hear many suit that be argue there in that language and to investigate many himself besides he unusual behavior in this respect he fail to pass sentence on lucius scribonius libo a young noble suspect of revolutionary design so long as the latter be well but upon he fall sick he have he bring into the senate in a covered litter -lrb- such as the wife of senator use -rrb- to be condemn to death a slight delay ensue and libo committed suicide whereupon the emperor pass judgment upon he behavior though he be dead give he money to the accuser and have sacrifice vote for he overthrow not only for he own sake but for the sake of augustus and of the latter 's father julius as have occasionally be decree in past time though he take such action in the case of this man he administer no rebuke at all to vibius rufus who use cæsar 's chair -lrb- the one on which the latter be always accustom to sit and on which he be slay -rrb- rufus do this regularly besides have cicero 's wife as he consort and pride himself on both achievement evidently think that he would become a orator by means of the wife or a cæsar by means of the chair for this as i have state he receive no censure indeed he become consul tiberius be moreover forever in the company of thrasyllus and make some use of the mantic art every day become himself so proficient in the study that when he be once bid in a dream to give money to a certain person he comprehend that a deceitful spirit have be call up before he and he put the man to death likewise in the case of all the rest of the astrologer and magician and those who practice divination in any other way whatever he have the foreigner execute and banish all such citizen as still at that time after the previous decree by which it have be forbid to engage in any such business in the city be accuse in court of employ the art to such of they as obeyed immunity have be grant in fact all the citizen would have be acquit even contrary to he wish have not a certain tribune prevent it here one could catch a glimpse of the democratic constitution inasmuch as the senate approve the course of gnaeus calpurnius piso overcome drusus and tiberius and be itself subdue by the tribune -lrb- -16 - -rrb- these affair be settle in this way certain man who have be quaestor the previous year be send out to the province since those who be quaestor at the time prove too few for they this be do again and again as often as it be find necessary many of the public document have either perish utterly or have fade during the lapse of time three senator be therefore elect to copy off what be extant and to look up the rest -- assistance be give in several conflagration not only by tiberius but also by livium the same year a certain clemen who have be a slave of agrippa and resemble he to a certain extent pretend to be he he go to gaul and win the attachment of many there and later of many in italy finally he march upon rome with the avowed intention of recover the dominion of he grandfather many of the inhabitant of the city be throw into confusion at this and not a few join he cause tiberius however get he in he hand by a clever device and through the agency of certain person who pretend to sympathize with the upstart then he tortured the prisoner in order to learn something about he fellow conspirator but when the victim utter not a word the emperor ask he : how do you get to be agrippa and he reply : in the same way as you get to be cæsar -lrb- ad 17 -lrb- a u 770 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -17 - -rrb- the following year gaius cæcilius and lucius flaccus receive the title of consul and when some bring tiberius money after the first of the month he would not accept it and publish a kind of document regard this very point in which he use a word that be not latin after think it over by night he send for all those who have accurate knowledge of such matter for he be extremely anxious to have he diction irreproachable thereupon a certain ateius capito declare : even if no one have previously use this expression yet because of you we shall all enumerate it among the primitive usage but be interrupt by one marcellus -lrb- 3 -rrb- who say : you be cæsar can extend roman government over man but not over word and the emperor do the man no harm for this in spite of the excessive frankness of he speech he have a grudge however against archelaus the king of cappadocium because the latter have first become he suppliant to the extent of employ he as advocate when this monarch in the time of augustus have be accuse by he people and have subsequently slight he on the occasion of a visit to rhode but have pay court to gaius who also go to asia therefore he summon he on the charge of rebellious behavior and deliver he up to the vote of the senate -lrb- the king be not only well stricken in year but a great sufferer from gout and be moreover believe to be demented -rrb- as a matter of fact he have be incommode previously by loss of mind to the extent of have a guardian place over he domain by augustus but at that time he be no longer weak-witted and be merely feign in the hope of save himself by this expedient if by no other he would now have be execute have not some one in testify against he state that he have once say : when i get back home i will show he what sort of sinew i possess a shout of laughter go up at this for the man be not only unable to stand but could not even assume a sit posture and so tiberius give up he plan of put he to death the condition of the prince be so serious that he be carry into the senate in a covered litter for since it be customary even for man whenever one of they come there feel ill to be carry in a reclining position tiberius take advantage of the method on this occasion too -lrb- and the invalid speak a few word bend forward from the litter -rrb- so it be that the life of archelaus be temporarily save but he die shortly afterward in some other way after this cappadocium revert to the roman and be put in charge of a knight to the city in asia which have be damage by the earthquake a ex-prætor be assign with five lictor considerable money therefore be divert from the revenue and considerable be give by tiberius personally for whereas he refrain scrupulously from the possession of other -- so long at least as he practice virtue at all -- and would not even accept the inheritance which be leave to he by testator have relative he spend vast sum both upon the city and upon private individual he would not hear of any honor or praise for these act -- embassy that come from foreign city or nation he never deal with alone but cause a number of other to participate in the deliberation and especially such as have once govern these people -lrb- -18 - -rrb- now germanicus have acquire a reputation for he campaign against the celta advance as far as the ocean inflict a overwhelming defeat upon the barbarian collect and bury the bone of those who have fall under varus and win back the military standard he wife julium be not recall from the banishment to which for unchastity she father augustus have condemn she nay he even put she under lock and key till wretchedness and starvation cause she death -lrb- ad 17 or 18 -rrb- the senate urge upon tiberius the request that the month of November on the sixteenth of which he have be bear should be call tiberius to which he respond : what will you do if there arise thirteen cæsars -lrb- ad 19 -lrb- _ a u _ 772 -rrb- -rrb- later when marcus junius and lucius norbanus come to office a portent of some magnitude occur on the very first day of the month and it doubtless have a bearing on the fate of germanicus norbanus the consul have always be devote to the trumpet and as he have practice assiduously in this pursuit he wish on this occasion also to play the instrument just about dawn when many person be already near he house this proceeding throw they all without exception into confusion just as if the consul have impart to they some warlike signal and they be also disturb by the fall of the statue of janus they calm be further ruffle by a oracle repute to be a sibylline utterance which would not fit any other period of the city 's history but point to that very time it declare : after thrice three hundred revolving year have be number civil strife shall consume the roman -- and the sybaritan folly tiberius denounce these verse as false and make a investigation of all the book contain any prophecy some he reject as worthless and other he admit as genuine as there have be a large influx of jew into rome and they be convert many of the native inhabitant to they principle he expel the great majority of they at the death of germanicus tiberius and livium be thoroughly pleased but everybody else be mightily afflict he be a man who possess the most striking physical beauty and likewise the noblest of spirit both in education and in strength he be conspicuous -lrb- and whereas he be the bravest of the brave against the enemy he be the mildest of the mild to he friend though as a cæsar he have extreme power he keep he ambition on the same plane as weaker man he in no wise conduct himself oppressively toward he subject -rrb- or with jealousy toward drusus or in any way to deserve censure toward tiberius -lrb- in brief he belong to the few man of all time who have neither sin against the fortune allot to they nor be destroy by it -rrb- although on several occasion he might -lrb- with the free consent not only of the soldier but of the people and senate as well -rrb- have obtain the imperial power he refuse to do so he death occur in antioch as the result of a plot form by piso and plancina bone of man bury in the house where he dwell and sheet of lead contain certain curse along with he name be find while he yet breathe -lrb- ad 20 -lrb- _ a u _ 773 -rrb- -rrb- piso be bring before the senate by tiberius himself on the charge of have murder germanicus but succeed in secure a postponement and committed suicide germanicus leave three son whom augustus in he testament denominate cæsars the eldest of these nero at that time have he name place among the number of the iuvene -lrb- -19 - -rrb- tiberius who have hitherto be the author of manifold meritorious work and have make but few error now when he cease to have a rival in view change to precisely the reverse of he previous conduct which have include many excellent deed among other way in which he rule become cruel he push to the bitter end the trial for maiesta in case where complaint be make against any one for commit any improper act or utter any improper speech not only against augustus but against tiberius personally and against he mother and towards those suspect of plot against he he be inexorable tiberius be stern in he chastisement of person accuse of a offence he would remark as follow : nobody willingly submit to be rule but a man be drive into it reluctantly not only do subject like to refuse obedience but more than that they enjoy plot against they ruler and he would accept accuser indiscriminately : a slave might denounce a master or a son a father indeed by indicate to certain person he wish for the death of certain other he bring about the destruction of the latter through the medium of the former and there be no secrecy about these transaction not only be slave tortured to make they testify against they own master but freedman and citizen as well such as accuse or offer testimony against person divide by lot the property of those convict and receive in addition both office and honor in the case of many he take care to ascertain the day and the hour that they have be bear and on the basis of they character and fortune thus investigate would put they to death if he discover any quality of haughtiness and aspiration to power in any one he despatch he whether or no yet so much do he investigate and understand what be fate for each of the prominent man that on meeting galba -lrb- subsequently emperor -rrb- when the latter have betroth a wife he remark : you also shall taste of the sovereignty he spare he as i conjecture because this be settle as he fate but as he explain it himself because galba would reign only in old age and long after he death -lrb- tiberius also find some pretext for assassination the death of germanicus lead to the destruction of many other on the ground that they be please at it -rrb- the man who coöperated with he and help he in all he undertaking with the utmost zeal be lucius aelius sejanus a son of strabo and formerly a favorite of marcus gabius apicius -- that apicius who so surpass all mankind in voluptuous living that when he have once desire to learn how much he have already spend and how much he still have on finding that two hundred and fifty myriad be leave he become grief-stricken feeling that he be destine to die of hunger and take he own life this sejanus accordingly at one time share he father 's command of the pretorian after he father have be send to egypt and he obtain entire control he make the force more compact in many way gather within one fortification the cohort which have be separate and apart from one another like those of the night guardsman in this way the entire body could receive the order speedily and they be a source of terror to all because they be within one fortification this be the man whom tiberius because of the similarity of they character take as he helper elevate he to prætorial honor which have never yet be accord to any of he peer and he make he he adviser and assistant in all matter -lrb- in fine he change so much after the death of germanicus that whereas previously he be highly praise he now attract even greater wonder -rrb- -lrb- ad21 -lrb- a u 774 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -20 - -rrb- when tiberius begin to hold the consular office in company with drusus man immediately begin to prophecy destruction for drusus from this very circumstance for there be not a man who be ever consul with tiberius that do not meet a violent death but in the first place there be quintilius varus and next gnæus piso and then germanicus himself who perish violently and miserably the emperor be evidently doom to cause such ruin throughout he life : drusus he colleague at this time and sejanus who subsequently participate in the office also come to grief while tiberius be out of town gaius lutorius priscus -lrb- 4 -rrb- a knight who take great pride in he poetic talent and have compose a notable funeral oration over germanicus for which he have receive considerable money be charge with have compose a poem upon drusus also during the latter 's illness for this he be try in the senate condemn and put to death now tiberius be vex not because the man have be punish but because the senator have inflict death upon any one without he approval he therefore rebuke they and order a decree to be issue to the effect that no person condemn by they be execute within ten day nor the document apply to he case be make public before the same time this be to ensure the possibility of he learn they decree in advance even while absent and of render a final decision on such matter -lrb- ad 22 -lrb- _ a u _ 775 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -21 - -rrb- after this when he consulship have expire he come to rome and prevent the consul from act as advocate to certain person by say : if i be consul i should not do this one of the prætors be accuse of have utter some impious word or have commit some impious act against he whereupon the man leave the senate and take off he robe of office return demand as a private citizen to have the complaint lodge at once at this the emperor show great grief and molest he no further -lrb- ad 23 -lrb- _ a u _ 776 -rrb- -rrb- the dancer he drive out of rome and would allow they no place in which to practice they profession because they keep debauch the woman and stir up tumult he honor many man and number of those who die with statue and public funeral a bronze statue of sejanus be erect in the theater during the life of the model as a result numerous image of this minister be make by many person and many encomiuma be speak both in the assembly and in the senate the consul themselves besides the other prominent citizen regularly have recourse to he house just at dawn and communicate to he both all the private request that any of they wish to make of tiberius and the public business which have to be take up in brief henceforth nothing of the kind be consider without he knowledge about this time one of the largest portico in rome begin to lean to one side and be set upright in a remarkable way by a certain architect whose name no one know because tiberius jealous of he wonderful achievement would not permit it to be enter in the record this architect accordingly however he be call after strengthen the foundation all about so that they could not move out of position and surround all the rest of the arcade with thick fleece and cloth run rope all over it and through it and by the push of many man and machine bring it once more into its previous position at the time tiberius both admire he and feel envious of he for the former reason he honor he with a present of money and for the latter he expel he from the city later the exile approach he to make supplication during the course of which he purposely let fall a crystal goblet which fall apart somehow or be break and then by pass he hand over it show it straightway intact for this the suppliant hope to have obtain pardon but instead the emperor put he to death -lrb- -22 - -rrb- drusus son of tiberius perish by poison sejanus puff up by power and rank in addition to he other overweening behavior finally turn against drusus and once strike he a blow with he fist as this give the assailant reason to fear both drusus and tiberius and inasmuch as he feel sure that if he could get the young man out of the way he could handle the elder very easily he administer poison to the former through the agency of those in attendance upon he and of drusus 's wife whom some name livillum -lrb- 5 -rrb- sejanus be she paramour -- the guilt be imputed to tiberius because he alter none of he accustomed habit either during the illness of drusus or at he death and would not allow other to alter theirs but the story be not credible this be he regular behavior as a matter of principle in every case alike and furthermore he be attach to he son the only one he have and legitimate those that engineer he death he punish some at once and some later at the time he enter the senate deliver the appropriate eulogy over he child and depart homeward thus perish sejanus 's victim tiberius take he way to the senate-house where he lament he publicly put nero and drusus -lrb- child of germanicus -rrb- in charge of the senate and expose the body of drusus upon the rostrum and nero be he son-in-law pronounce a eulogy over he this man 's death prove a cause of death to many person who be tax with be please at he demise among the large number of people who lose they life be agrippina together with she child the youngest excepted sejanus have incense tiberius greatly against she anticipate that when she and she child be dispose of he might have for he spouse livium wife of drusus for whom he entertain a passion and might wield supreme power since no successor would be find for tiberius the latter detest he nephew as a bastard many other also do he banish or destroy for different and ever different cause for the most part fictitious tiberius forbid those debar from fire and water to make any will -- a custom still observe ælius saturninus he bring before the senate for trial on the charge of have recite some improper verse about he and the culprit have be find guilty be hurl from the capitol -lrb- -23 - -rrb- i might narrate many other such occurrence if i be to go into all in detail but the general statement may suffice that many be slay by he for such offence and also this -- that he investigate carefully case by case all the slighting remark that any person be accuse of utter against he and then call himself all the ill name that other man invent even if a person make some statement secretly and to a single companion he would publish this too and actually have it enter on the official record often he falsely add from he own consciousness of defect what no one have even say as really speak in order that it might be think he have juster cause for he wrath consequently it come to pass that he himself commit against himself all those outrage for which he be wont to chastise other people on the ground of impiety and he likewise become subject to no little ridicule for if person deny have speak certain phrase he by assert and take oath that it have be say wrong himself with greater show of reality for this reason some suspect that he be bereft of he sens yet he be not generally believe to be insane simply for this behavior all other business he manage in a way quite beyond criticism for instance he appoint a guardian over a certain senator that live licentiously as he might have do for a child again he bring capito procurator of asia before the senate and after charge he with use soldier and act in some other way as if he have supreme command he banish he in those day official administer the imperial fund be allow to do nothing more than to levy the customary tribute and they be compel in the case of dispute to stand trial in the forum and accord to the law on a equal footing with private person -- so great be the contrast in tiberius 's conduct -lrb- ad 24 -lrb- _ a u _ 777 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- when the ten year of he office have expire he do not ask any vote for its resumption for he have no wish to receive it piecemeal as augustus have do the decennial festival however be hold -lrb- ad 25 -lrb- _ a u _ 778 -rrb- -rrb- cremutius cordus be force to lay violent hand upon himself because he have come into collision with sejanus he be at the gate of old age and have live most irreproachably so much so that no sufficient complaint could be find against he and he be try for the history which he have long before compose regard the deed of augustus and the latter himself have read the ground of censure be that he have praise cassius and brutus and have attack the people and the senate of cæsar and augustus he have speak no ill but at the same time have show no excessive respect for they this be the complaint against he and this it be that cause he death as well as the burning of he work -- those find in the city at this time be destroy by the ædiles and those abroad by the official of each place later they be publish again for he daughter marcium in particular as well as other have hide copy and they attract much greater attention by reason of the unhappy end of cordus about this time tiberius exhibit to the senator he pretorian cohort in the act of exercise as if they be ignorant of he power he purpose be to make they more afraid of he when they see he defender so many and so strong besides these event of the time that seem worthy to chronicle in a history the people of cyzicus be once more deprive of they freedom because they have imprison certain roman and because they have not complete the heroüm to augustus that they have begin to build -- and the emperor would certainly have put to death the man who sell the emperor 's statue along with he house and be bring to trial for the act have not the consul ask the ruler himself to give he vote first be ashamed to appear partial to himself he cast he ballot for acquittal also a senator lentulus a excellent man naturally and now far advance in old age be accuse by some one of have plot against the emperor lentulus be present and burst out laugh at this a uproar arise

image and some other small matter of no importance as for she be deify he forbid that absolutely the senate however do not content itself with vote merely the measure which he have ordain but enjoin upon the woman mourn for she during the entire year although it approve the course of tiberius in not abandon even at this time the conduct of public business furthermore they vote she a arch -lrb- as have never be do in the case of any other woman -rrb- because she have preserve not a few of they have rear many child belong to citizen and have help find husband for numerous girl -- for all of which act some call she mother of she country she be bury in the mausoleum of augustus tiberius would not pay a single one of she bequest to anybody among the many excellent utterance of hers that be related be one concern with the occasion when some man that be naked meet she and on that account fall under sentence of execution she save they life by say that to chaste woman such person be no whit different from statue when some one ask she how and by what course of action she have obtain such a influence over augustus she answer that it be by be scrupulously chaste herself do willingly whatever please he not meddle with any of he business and particularly by pretend neither to hear of nor notice the favorite that be the object of he passion such be the character of livium the arch vote to she however be not build for the reason that tiberius promise to construct it at he own expense for as he dislike to annul the decree by direct command he make it void in this way by not allow the work to be undertake out of the public fund nor attend to it himself -lrb- ad 29 or 30 -rrb- sejanus be rise to still greater height it be vote that he birthday should be publicly observe and the mass of statue which the senate and the equestrian order the tribe and the foremost citizen set up would have pass any one 's power to count separate envoy be send to both these ruler by the senate as well as the knight and also by the people who select they from they own tribune and aedile for both of they alike they offer prayer and sacrifice and they take oath by they fortune -lrb- ad 30 -lrb- a u 783 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -3 - -rrb- gallus who marry the wife of tiberius and speak he mind regard the empire be the next object of the emperor 's attack for which the right moment have be carefully select -lrb- whether he really believe that sejanus would be emperor or whether it be out of fear of tiberius he pay court to the former it may indeed have be a kind of plot to make the minister irksome to tiberius and so accomplish he ruin : but at any rate gallus transact the greater and more important part of he business with he and make effort to be one of the envoy therefore the emperor send a report about he to the senate making among other statement one to the effect that this man be jealous of he friendship for sejanus although gallus himself treat syriacus as a intimate friend he do not make this know to gallus entertaining he most hospitably instead -rrb- hence something most unusual befall he that never happen to any one else on the very same day he be banquet at the house of tiberius pledge he in the cup of friendship and be condemn before the senate indeed a prætor be send to imprison he and lead he away for punishment yet tiberius though he have act so do not permit he victim to die in spite of the latter 's wish for death as soon as he learn the decree instead he bid gallus -lrb- in order to make he lot still more dismal -rrb- to be of good cheer and instruct the senate -lrb- 1 -rrb- that he should be guard without bond until the emperor should reach the city he object as i say be to make the prisoner suffer for the longest possible time both from deprivation of he civic rights and from terror so it turn out he be keep under the eye of the consul of each year except when tiberius hold the office in that case he be guard by the prætors not to prevent he escape but to prevent he death he have no companion or servant as associate speak to no one see no one except when he be compel to take food and what he get be of such a quality and amount as neither to afford he any pleasure or strength nor yet to allow he to die this be the worst feature of it tiberius do the same thing in the case of many other for instance he have imprison one of he companion and when there be later talk about execute he he say : i have not yet make my peace with he some one else again he have tortured very severely and then on ascertain that the victim have be unjustly accuse he have he kill with all speed remark that he have be too terribly outraged to find any satisfaction in live syriacus who have neither commit nor be charge with any wrong but be renown for he education be slay merely for the reason that tiberius say he be a friend of gallus -lrb- sejanus bring false accusation also against drusus through the medium of he wife for by maintain illicit relation with practically all the wife of the distinguished man he learn what they husband say and do and further make they he assistant by promise of marriage now when tiberius without discussion send drusus to rome sejanus fear that he position might be injure persuade cassius -lrb- 2 -rrb- to busy himself against he -rrb- after exalt sejanus to a high pinnacle of glory and make he a member of he family by the alliance with julium daughter of drusus tiberius later kill he -lrb- -4 - -rrb- now sejanus be grow greater and more formidable all the time and he progress make the senator and the rest look up to he as if he be actually emperor and esteem tiberius lightly when tiberius learn this he do not regard the matter as a trivial one fear indeed that they would hail he rival as emperor outright and he do not neglect it yet he do nothing openly for sejanus have win the entire pretorian guard thoroughly to he own side and have gain the favor of the senator partly by benefit partly by implant hope and partly by intimidation he have make all the attendant on tiberius so entirely he friend that absolutely everything the emperor do be at once report to he whereas of what he do not a word reach tiberius 's ear hence the latter appear content to follow where sejanus lead appoint he consul and term he sharer of he care repeat often the phrase my sejanus and publish the same by write it to the senate and the people man take this behavior as sincere and be deceive and so set up bronze statue all about to both alike write they name together in bulletin and bring into the theater gilded chair for both finally it be vote that they should together be make consul every four year and that a body of citizen should go out to meet both alike whenever they enter rome in the end they sacrifice to the image of sejanus as to those of tiberius this be the way matter stand with sejanus now among the rest many famous man meet a ill fate of whom be also gaius fufius geminus be accuse of the crime of maiestas against tiberius he take he will into the senate-chamber and read it show that he have leave he inheritance in equal portion to he child and to he sovereign as he be charge with weakness he go home before any vote be reach when he learn that the quæstor have arrive to attend to he execution he wound himself and display the wound to the official exclaim : report to the senate that it be thus one die who be a man likewise he wife mutilium prisca against whom some complaint be make make she way into the senate and there stab herself with a dagger which she have bring in secretly next he destroy mutilium and she husband together with two daughter on account of she friendship for he mother in the day of tiberius all who accuse any person regularly receive money and large allotment both from the victim ' property and from the public treasury in addition to various honor there be case where certain man who impudently throw other into a panic or recklessly pass the death sentence upon they obtain in the one instance statue and in the other triumphal honor hence several citizen who be really illustrious and conquer the right to some such distinction would not assume it out of reluctance to let any period of they life betray even a superficial similarity to the career of those scoundrel tiberius feign sickness send sejanus on to rome with the assurance that he should follow he declare that in this separation a part of he own body and soul be wrench away from he : shed tear he embrace and kiss he and sejanus naturally be thereat the more elated -lrb- ad 31 -lrb- a u 784 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -5 - -rrb- by this time sejanus be so impose both in he haughtiness of mind and in he immensity of power that to make a long matter short he seem to be the emperor and tiberius a kind of island potentate because the latter spend all he day in the island call capreæ then there be rivalry and jostle about the great man 's door from the fear not merely that a person might fail to be observe by he patron but that he might appear among the last : for all the word and gesture particularly of those in front be carefully watch people who hold a prominent position as the result of native worth be not give at all to seek sign of friendship from other and in case anything of the sort be see to be want on the part of these other the person in question be not provoke inasmuch as they have a innate consciousness that they be not be look down upon any however that hold a artificial rank be extremely jealous of all such attention feel they to be necessary to render they position complete if they fail to obtain they then they be as irritated as if slander be be pronounce against they and as angry as if they be the recipient of positive insult consequently the world be more scrupulous in the case of such person than -lrb- one might almost say -rrb- in the case of emperor themselves to the latter it be ascribe as a virtue to pardon any one if a error be commit but in the self-made person that course appear to argue a inherent weakness whereas to attack and to exact vengeance be think to furnish proof of great power one morning the first of the month when all be gather at sejanus 's house the couch place in the small room where he receive break into infinitesimal fragment under the weight of the throng seat upon it and as he be leave the house a weasel dart through the midst of they after he have sacrifice on the capitol and be now come down to the forum he servant that act as body-guard turn aside along the road lead to the prison because the crowd prevent they from escort he and as they descend the step down which condemn criminal be commonly cast they slip and fall subsequently he take the auspices and not one bird of good omen appear but crow fly and caw about he and then fly off all together to the jail where they alight -lrb- -6 - -rrb- these prodigy neither sejanus nor any one else lay to heart for in view of the way thing stand not even if some god have plainly foretell that so great a change would take place in a short time would any one have believe it they swear by he fortune as if they would never be weary and hail he colleague of tiberius make this phrase refer not to the consulship but to the supreme power tiberius be no longer uninformed of aught that concern he minister he rack he brain to see in what manner he might kill he but not find any way in which he might do this openly and safely he treat both the man himself and all the rest in a remarkable fashion so as to gain a accurate knowledge of they feeling he send many despatch of all kind regard himself to sejanus and to the senate incessantly say at one time that he be poorly and just at the point of death and again that he be in exceedingly good health and would reach rome directly now he would strongly approve sejanus and again vehemently denounce he some of he companion he would honor to show he regard for he and other he would dishonor thus sejanus fill in turn with extreme elation and extreme fear be always in a flutter he could not decide to be terrify and for that reason attempt a revolution inasmuch as he be be honor nor yet to become bold enough to attempt some desperate venture inasmuch as he be frequently abased moreover all the rest of the people be get to feel dubious because they hear alternately and at short interval the most contrary report because they could no longer justify themselves in either admiring or despise sejanus and because they be wonder about tiberius thinking first that he be go to die and then that he arrival be imminent -lrb- -7 - -rrb- sejanus be disturb by all this and a great deal more by the fact that from one of he statue at first a mass of smoke ascend in a burst and then when the head be take off to enable investigator to see what be go on a huge serpent dart up another head at once replace the former and accordingly he be on the point of sacrifice to himself -lrb- for sacrifice to himself be a regular part of he program -rrb- when a rope be discover coil around the statue 's neck also a figure of fortuna make -lrb- as be say -rrb- in the time of tullius a early king of rome -- one which sejanus at this time keep at he house and take great pride in -- he see turn away while he be sacrifice in person and later other who have go out in they company -lrb- 3 -rrb- most man be suspicious of these circumstance but since they do not know the mind of tiberius and further take into consideration the latter 's caprice and the unstable condition of affair they be divide in sentiment privately they keep a sharp eye on they own safety but publicly they pay court to he among other reason because tiberius have join to -lrb- he -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- as priest both sejanus and he son moreover they have give he the proconsular authority and have likewise vote that word be send to all such as be consul from year to year to emulate he in they office so tiberius have honor he with the priesthood but he do not send for he : instead when he minister request that he might go to campanium plead as a excuse that he fiancée be ill the emperor direct he to stay where he be give as a reason that he would himself arrive in rome in almost no time -lrb- -8 - -rrb- as a result then of this sejanus be again gradually alienate and he vexation be increase by the fact that tiberius appoint gaius priest with the imperial commendation and give some hint to the effect that he should make the new appointee he successor in the empire the angry favorite would have begin rebellious measure especially as the soldier be ready to obey he in everything have he not perceive that the populace be hugely please at what be say in regard to gaius out of reverence for the memory of germanicus he father sejanus have previously think that these person too be on he side and now find they enthusiastic for gaius he become dejected he feel sorry that he have not show open revolt during he consulship the rest be strongly influence against he by the course of event -lrb- 5 -rrb- as also by tiberius 's action in release soon after a enemy of sejanus choose ten year before to govern spain and just now be try on certain charge because of sejanus the emperor also grant temporary immunity from such suit to such other as be go to govern any province or to administer any similar public business and in write to the senate about the death of nero he use simply the name sejanus with no phrase add as have be he custom moreover he forbid offer sacrifice to any human being -lrb- because sacrifice be often offer to this man -rrb- and the introduction of any business look to he own honor -lrb- because many honorary measure be be pass for he rival 's benefit -rrb- he have forbid this practice still earlier but now on account of sejanus he renew he injunction for naturally if he allow nothing of the sort to be do in he own case he would not permit it in the case of another -lrb- -9 - -rrb- in view of all this the people begin to look down on sejanus more and more to the point of draw aside at he approach and leave he alone -- and that openly without pretence of concealment when tiberius learn of it he courage revive : he feel that he should have the coöperation of the people and the senate and accordingly begin a attack upon he enemy first in order to take he off he guard to the fullest possible extent be spread a report that he would give he the office of tribune then he despatch a communication against he to the senate by the hand of nævius sertorius macro whom he have privately appoint to command the body-guard and have instruct as to precisely what must be do the latter come by night into rome as if on some different errand and make know he message to memmius regulus then consul -lrb- he colleague side with sejanus -rrb- and to græcinius laco commander of the night watch at dawn macro ascend the palatine where there be to be a session of the senate in the temple of apollo encounter sejanus who have not yet go in he see that he be trouble at tiberius 's have send he no message and encourage he tell he aside and in confidence that he be bring he the tribunician authority sejanus overjoy at this hasten to the senate-chamber macro send away to the camp the pretorian that commonly surround the minister and the senate after reveal to they he right as leader to do so and declare that he bring document from tiberius that bestow gift upon they around the temple he station the night watch in they stead go in himself deliver he letter to the consul and go out before a word be read he then put laco in charge of guard duty at that point and himself hurry to the camp to prevent any uprising -lrb- -10 - -rrb- meanwhile the letter be read it be a long one and contain no wholesale denunciation of sejanus but first some indifferent matter then a slight censure of he conduct then something else and after that some further objection to he at the close it say that two senator that be very intimate with he must be punish and that he himself must be keep guard tiberius do not give they order outright to put he to death not because such be not he desire but because he fear that some disturbance might be the result of it but since as he say he could not take the journey safely he have send for one of the consul this be all that the composition disclose during the reading many diverse utterance and expression of countenance be observable first before the people hear the letter they be engage in laud the man whom they suppose to be on the point of receive the tribunician authority they shout they approval realize in anticipation all they hope and make a demonstration to show that they would concur in grant he honor when however nothing of the sort be discover but they keep hear just the reverse of what they expect they fall into confusion and subsequently into deep dejection some of those seat near he even withdraw they now no longer care to share the same seat with the man whom previously they be anxious to claim as friend then prætors and tribune begin to surround he to prevent he cause any uproar by rush out -- which he certainly would have do if he have be startle at the outset by any general tirade as it be he pay no great heed to what be read from time to time think it a slight matter a single charge and hope that nothing further or at any rate nothing serious in regard to he have be make a matter of comment so he let the time slip by and remain where he be meantime regulus call he forward but he pay no attention not out of contempt -- for he have already be humble -- but because he be unaccustomed to hear any command give he but when the consul shout at he a second and a third time at the same time stretch out he arm and say : sejanus come here he enquire blankly : be you call _ I _ so at last he stand up and laco who have enter take he stand beside he when finally the reading of the letter be finish all with one voice both denounce he and utter threat some because they have be wrong other through fear some to disguise they friendship for he and other out of joy at he downfall regulus do not give all of they however a chance to vote nor do he put the question to any one regard the man 's death for fear there should be come opposition and a consequent disturbance for sejanus have numerous relative and friend hence after ask one person 's opinion and obtain a support vote in favor of imprisonment he conduct the former favorite out of the senate-chamber and in company with the other official and with laco lead he down to the prison -lrb- -11 - -rrb- then might one have obtain a clear and search insight into the weakness of man so that self-conceit would have be never again under any condition possible he whom at dawn they have escort to the senate-hall as one superior to themselves they be now drag to a cell as if no better than the worst on he whom they once deem worthy of crown they now heap bond he whom they be wont to protect as a master they now guard like a runaway slave and uncover while he wear a headdress he whom they have adorn with the purple-bordered toga they strike in the face whom they be wont to adore and sacrifice to as to a god they be now lead to execution the crowd also assail he reproach he violently for the life he have destroy and jeer loudly at what have be hope of he all of he image they hurl down beat down and pull down seem to feel that they be maltreat the man himself and he thus become a spectator of what he be destine to suffer for the moment he be merely cast into prison but not much later -- that very day in fact -- the senate assemble in the temple of concord not far from he cell and see the attitude of the populace and that none of the pretorian be near by it condemn he to death on these order he be execute and he body cast down the scalæ gemoniæ where the rabble abuse it for three whole day and afterward throw it into the river he child be put to death by special decree the girl -lrb- whom he have betroth to the son of claudius -rrb- have be first outrage by the public executioner on the principle that it be unlawful for a virgin to meet death in prison he wife apica be not condemn to be sure but on learn that she child be dead and after see they body on the stair she withdraw and compose a statement regard the death of drusus direct against livillum the latter 's wife who have be the cause of a quarrel between herself and she husband result in they separation this document she forward to tiberius and then commit suicide thus the statement come to the hand of tiberius and when he have obtain proof of the information he put to death livillum and all other therein mention i have indeed hear that he spare she out of regard for she mother antonium and that antonium herself voluntarily destroy she daughter by starve she at any rate that be later -lrb- -12 - -rrb- at this time a great uproar ensue in the city the populace slew any one it see of those who have possess great influence with sejanus and rely on he have commit act of insolence the soldier too in irritation because they have be suspect of friendliness toward sejanus and because the nightwatchman have be prefer before they in the confidence of the emperor proceed to burn and plunder -- and this in spite of the fact that all official be guard the entire city in accordance with the injunction of tiberius not even the senate be quiet but such member of it as have pay court to sejanus be greatly disturb by dread of reprisal and those who have accuse or bear witness against any person be fill with fear by the prevail suspicion that they have destroy they victim out of regard for the minister instead of for tiberius very small indeed be the courageous element which be unhamper by these terror and expect that tiberius would become milder for as usually happen they lay the responsibility for they previous misfortune upon the dead man and charge the emperor with few or none of they of the most of this unjust treatment they say he have be ignorant and he have be force into the rest against he will privately this be the disposition of the various class publicly they vote as if they have cast off some tyranny not to hold any mourning over the deceased and to have a statue of liberty erect in the forum also a festival be to be celebrate under the auspices of all the magistrate and priest -- as have never before occur and the day on which he die be to be make renowned by annual horse-race and slaughter of wild beast direct by those appoint to the four priesthood and by the member of the sodality of augustus this too have never before be do to celebrate the ruin of the man whom they by the excess and novelty of they honor have lead to destruction they vote solemnity that be not customary even for the god they comprehend so clearly that it be chiefly these honor which have bereft he of he sens that they at once forbid explicitly the give of excessive mark of esteem to any one as also the taking of oath in the name of any one other than the emperor yet though they pass such vote as if under a divine inspiration they begin shortly after to fawn upon macro and laco they give they great sum of money and to laco the honor of ex-quaestor while to macro they extend the honor of ex-prætors similarly -lrb- 6 -rrb- they allow they also to view spectacles in they company and to wear the toga praetexta at the ludus votivus the man do not accept these privilege however for the recent example serve as a deterrent nor would tiberius take any honor bestow though many be vote he chief among they be that he should begin from this time to be term father of he country and that he birthday should be mark by ten equestrian contest and a senatorial banquet indeed he give notice anew that no one should introduce any such motion -- these be the event happen in the capital -lrb- -13 - -rrb- tiberius for a time have certainly be in great fear that sejanus would occupy the city and sail against he and so he have prepare boat to the end that if anything of the sort should come to pass he might escape he have command macro -- or so some say -- if there should be any uprising to bring drusus before the senate and the people and appoint he emperor when he learn that he enemy be dead he rejoice as be natural yet would not receive the embassy send to congratulate he though many member of the senate and many of the knight and of the populace have be despatch as before indeed he even rebuff the consul regulus who have always be devote to he interest and have come in accordance with the emperor 's own command to see about he be convey in safety to the city -lrb- -14 - -rrb- thus perish sejanus who have attain greater power than those who obtain he office before or after he -lrb- save plautianus -rrb- he relative he associate and all the rest who have pay court to he and have move that honor be grant he be bring to trial the majority of they be convict for the act that have previously make they object of envy and they fellow-citizen condemn they for the measure which they themselves have previously vote number of man who have be try on various charge and acquit be again accuse and convict on the ground that they have be save the first time as a favor to the deceased accordingly if no other complaint could be bring against a person the statement that he have be a friend of sejanus serve to convict he -- as if forsooth tiberius himself have not be friendly with he and cause other to become interested for he sake among those who lay information in this way be the man who be wont to pay court to sejanus inasmuch as they know thoroughly those who be in the same position they have no great trouble either in find they out or secure they conviction so they expect to save themselves by do this and to obtain honor and money besides accuse other or else bear witness against they but it prove that none of they hope be realize they find themselves liable to the same charge on which they have prosecute other and partly as a result of they and partly on account of the general detestation of traitor perish along with they companion -lrb- -15 - -rrb- of those against whom charge be bring many be present in person to hear they accusation and make they defense and some employ great frankness in so do still the majority make away with themselves prior to they conviction they do this chiefly to avoid suffer insult and outrage -lrb- for all who have incur any such charge senator as well as knight woman as well as man be crowd together into the prison after they condemnation some undergo the penalty there and other be hurl from the capitol by the tribune or the consul the body of all of they be cast into the forum and subsequently be throw into the river -rrb- but they object be partly that they child might inherit they property very few estate of such as voluntarily take themselves off before they trial be confiscate tiberius in this way invite man to become they own murderer that he might avoid the reputation of have kill they as if it be not far more fearful to compel a man to die by he own hand than to deliver he to the executioner -lrb- -16 - -rrb- most of the estate of such as fail to die in this way be confiscate only a little or nothing at all even be give to they accuser for he be now give far more -lrb- 7 -rrb- accurate attention to money after this tiberius increase to one per cent a tax which be already one-half of one per cent and proceed to accept every inheritance leave to he and in fact nearly every one leave he something -- even those who make away with themselves -- as they have to sejanus while the latter live also with that same intention which have lead he not to take possession of the wealth of those who perish voluntarily he make the senate sponsor for every official summons to the end that he might be free from blame himself -lrb- for so he think -rrb- and the senate pass sentence upon itself as a wrongdoer -lrb- 8 -rrb- by this mean people come to be thoroughly aware during the time that they be be destroy through one another 's agency that they former trouble have emanate no more from sejanus than from tiberius for not only be the accuser of various person bring to trial but those who have condemn they be in turn sentence so it be that tiberius spare no one but keep use up all the citizen one against another no firm friendship exist any longer -lrb- 9 -rrb- but the unjust and the guiltless the fearful and the fearless stand on the same footing as regard the investigation make into the complaint about sejanus at length he see fit to propose a kind of amnesty for the sufferer and so he give permission to those who wish to go into mourning for the deceased and in addition he forbid that any one should in any way be hinder from show this respect to the memory of any person -- for such prohibitory vote be frequently pass yet he do not in fact confirm this edict but after a brief space he punish number on account of sejanus and on other complaint : they be generally charge with have outrage and murder they nearest female relative -lrb- ad 32 -lrb- _ a u _ 785 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -17 - -rrb- such be the state of affair at this time and there be not a soul that could deny that he would be glad to feast on the emperor 's flesh now the next year when gnæus domitius and camillus scribonianus become consul a very laughable thing happen it have now long be the custom for the member of the senate on the first of the year to take the oath not man by man but for one -lrb- as i have state -rrb- -lrb- 10 -rrb- to take the oath for they and the rest to express they acquiescence this time however they do not do so but of they own motion without any compulsion they be separately and individually pledge as though this would make they any more regardful of they oath previously for many year the emperor have allow matter to go on without a single person 's swearing allegiance to he act of government : this i have mention -lrb- 11 -rrb- -- at this time also there occur something else still more laughable -lrb- -18 - -rrb- they vote that he should select as many of they number as he like and should employ twenty of they -- whomsoever the lot should designate -- as guard with dagger as often as he enter the senate-chamber of course as the exterior of the building be watch by the soldier and no private citizen could come inside they resolution that a guard be give he amount to a precaution against no one but themselves thus indicate that they be hostile naturally tiberius express he obligation to they and thank they for they good intention but he reject they offer as be too much out of the ordinary he be not so simple as to give sword to the very man whom he hate and by whom he be hate yet as a result of this very measure he begin to grow suspicious of they -- for every act in contravention of sincerity which one undertake for the purpose of flattery breed suspicion -- and bid a long adieu to they decree he begin to honor the pretorian both by address and with money in spite of he knowledge that they have be on the side of sejanus so that he might find they more disposed to be employ against the senator on occasion to be sure he in turn commend the latter when they vote that fund from the public treasury be bestow on the guardsman he keep alternately deceive the one party by he talk and win over the other party by he act in a most effective way for instance junius gallic have move that a spectacle be provide in the meeting place of the knight for those of the body-guard who have finish they term of service : tiberius do not merely banish he when the man be bring up on this very charge of give a impression that he be persuade the soldier to show good-will to the government rather than to the emperor no but when he find that junius be set sail for lesbo he deprive he of a safe and comfortable existence there and deliver he to the custody of the magistrate as he have once do with gallus and in order to assure the two class still more fully how he feel toward both of they he not long after ask the senate that macro and some military tribune be deem sufficient to conduct he to the senate-chamber he have no need of those person for he have no idea of ever enter the city again but what he want be to display he hatred of the senator and show the latter the friendliness of the soldier the senator actually grant this request however they attach to the decree a clause that the escort should be search on enter to make sure that no one have a dagger hide beneath he arm -- this resolution be pass in the following year -lrb- -19 - -rrb- at this time he spare among some other who have be intimate with sejanus lucius cæsianus -lrb- 12 -rrb- a prætor and marcus terentius a knight he overlook the behavior of the former who at the floralium to ridicule tiberius have have everything up to midnight do by baldheaded man -lrb- because the emperor himself be also baldhead -rrb- and have furnish light to those leave the theater by the hand of five thousand boy with shaven pate tiberius be so far from become angry at he that he pretend not to have hear about it at all though all baldheaded person be from then on call caesianus after this man terentius he spare because when on trial for he friendship with sejanus he not only do not deny it but affirm that he have work for he and pay court to he to the greatest possible extent for the reason that the minister be so highly honor by tiberius himself consequently he say if the emperor do rightly in have such a friend neither have i do any wrong : and if my sovereign who know all thing accurately err what wonder be it that i share he deception we duty be to cherish all whom he honor without concern ourselves overmuch about the kind of man they be but make one thing determine we friendship for they -- the fact that they please the emperor the senate for these reason acquit he and in addition rebuke he accuser tiberius concur with they when piso the praefectus urbus die he honor he with a public funeral -- a distinction grant also to other in he place he choose lucius lamium whom he have long ago put in charge of syrium -lrb- 13 -rrb- and be keep at rome he take similar action too in the case of many other really care nothing at all for they but make a outward show of honor they -- meantime vitrasius pollio governor of egypt die and he entrust the province for a time to one hiberus a cæsarian -lrb- ad 33 -lrb- _ a u _ 786 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -20 - -rrb- now of the consul domitius hold office the whole year through -- for he be husband of agrippina the daughter of germanicus -- but the rest adapt themselves to the whim of tiberius some he elevate for a longer time and some for a shorter : some he stop before the end of they appoint term and other he allow to hold office beyond the limit designate not infrequently he would appoint a man for a entire year and then depose he set up another and still another in he place sometimes after choose certain substitute for third place he would then have other become consul before they in the place of still other these irregularity in the case of the consul occur through practically he entire reign of the candidate for the other office he select as many as he wish and send they name to the senate recommend some to that body -- and these be choose by acclamation -- but make other depend upon they own claim or the assent of the senate or the decision of the lot after that in order to follow out ancient precedent such as belong to the people and the pleb go before one of these two body and be announce : this be the same practice that be follow at present intend to produce at least a appearance of valid election in case there be ever a deficiency of candidate or they become involve in irreconcilable strife a smaller number be choose -- the following year in which servius galba -lrb- that later become emperor -rrb- and lucius cornelius hold the consular title fifteen prætors hold office this go on for many year so that sometimes sixteen and sometimes one or two less be choose -lrb- -21 - -rrb- the next move of tiberius be to approach the capital and sojourn in its environs he do not however go within the wall although he be but thirty stade distant so that he bestow in marriage the remain daughter of germanicus and also julia the daughter of drusus hence the city do not make a festival of they marriage but everything go on as usual : the senator meet and decide judicial case for tiberius make a important point of they assemble as often as he would have convene they and insist on they not arrive later or depart earlier than the time fix he send to the consul many injunction on this head and once order certain statement to be read aloud by they he behave in the same way in regard to certain other matter -lrb- just as if he could not write directly to the senate -rrb- to that body he send in not only the document give he by the informer but also the confession under torture which macro obtain so that nothing be leave in the hand of the senator save the vote of condemnation about this time however a certain vibullius agrippa a knight swallow poison from a ring and die in the senate-house itself and nerva who could no longer endure the emperor 's society starve himself to death he chief reason for do so be that tiberius have reaffirm the law on contract enact by cæsar which be sure to result in great loss of confidence and upheaval and although he chief repeatedly urge he to utter some word -lrb- 14 -rrb- he refuse to answer these event seem to make some impression on the emperor and he modify the situation so far as it pertain to loan by give two thousand five hundred myriad to the public treasury under the arrangement that this money could be lend out by the senatorial party without interest for three year to such as desire it he further command that the most notorious of those who have steadily act as accuser should be put to death on one day and when a man who belong to the centurion wish to lodge information against some one he forbid that any person who have serve in the army should do so although he allow the privilege to knight and senator -lrb- -22 - -rrb- there be no deny that he receive praise for he behavior in these matter and most of all because he would not accept a number of honor that be vote to he for it but the sensual orgy which he carry on shamelessly with the individual of highest rank male and female alike cause ill to be speak of he for example there be the case of he friend sextus marius imperial favor have make this man so rich and so powerful that when he be once at odds with a neighbor he invite he to dine for two successive day on the first he raze he guest 's dwelling entirely to the ground and on the next he rebuild it on a larger scale and in more elaborate style the victim of he treatment declare he ignorance of the perpetrator whereupon marius admit be responsible for both occurrence and add significantly : this show you that i have both the knowledge and the power to repel attack and also to requite a kindness this friend then who have send he daughter a strikingly beautiful girl to a place of refuge to prevent she be outrage by tiberius be charge with have criminal relation with she and for that reason destroy both he daughter and himself all this cover the emperor with disgrace and he connection with the death of drusus and agrippina give he a reputation for cruelty man have be think all along that the whole of the previous action against these two be due to sejanus and have be hope that now they life would be spare so when they learn that they have be actually murder they be exceedingly grieved partly for the reason mention and partly because so far from deposit they bone in the imperial tomb tiberius order they remains to be hide so carefully in the earth that they might never be find in addition to agrippina munatium plancina be slay previous to this time though he hate she -lrb- not on account of germanicus but for another reason -rrb- he yet allow she to live to prevent agrippina from rejoice at she death -lrb- -23 - -rrb- besides do this he appoint gaius quaestor though not of first rank promise he however that he would advance he to the other office five year earlier than be customary at the same time he request the senate not to make the young man conceit by numerous or extraordinary honor for fear the latter might go astray in one way or another he have indeed a descendant in the person of tiberius but he he disregard both on account of age -lrb- he be a mere child as yet -rrb- and on account of the prevail suspicion that this boy be not the son of drusus he therefore cleave to gaius as the most eligible candidate for sole ruler especially as he feel sure that tiberius would live but a short time and would be murder by that very man there be no detail of the character of gaius of which he be in ignorance indeed he once remark to he successor who be quarrel with tiberius : you will kill he and other will kill you the emperor know of no one else that suit he so entirely and at the same time he be well aware that the man would be a thorough knave yet the story obtain that he be glad to give he the empire in order that he own crime might find concealment in the enormity of gaius 's offence and that the largest and the noblest portion of what be leave of the senate might perish after he at all event he be say to have often utter the ancient saying : when i be dead let fire o'erwhelm the earth -lrb- 15 -rrb- often also he declare priam fortunate because that king involve he country and he throne in he own utter ruin these record about he be give a semblance of reality by what take place in those day such a multitude of the senator and of other lose they life that out of the official choose by lot the ex-prætors hold the governorship of the province for three year and the ex-consul for six owe to the lack of person to succeed they and what name could one properly give to the elect magistrate whom from the first he allow to hold office for a unusually long time now among those who die at this time be also gallus tiberius himself say that only then -lrb- and scarcely even so -rrb- do he become reconcile with he thus it be that contrary to the usual custom he inflict upon some life as a punishment and bestow upon other death as a kindness -lrb- ad 34 -lrb- _ a u _ 787 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -24 - -rrb- the twentieth year of the emperor 's reign now come in and he himself though he sojourn in the vicinity of albanum and tusculum do not enter the city the consul lucius vitellius and fabius persicus celebrate the second ten-year period the senator so term it in preference to twenty-year period to signify that they be grant he the leadership of the state again as have be do in the case of augustus punishment overtake they at the same time that they be celebrate the appropriate festival this time none of those accuse be acquit but all be convict -- the majority from document contribute by tiberius and the statement under torture obtain by macro the rest by what these two suspect they be plan it be rumor that the real reason why tiberius do not come to rome be to avoid be disgrace while present by the sentence of condemnation among various person who perish either at the hand of the executioner or by they own act be pomponius labeo he who have once govern moesium for eight year after he prætorship be with he wife indict for receive bribe and voluntarily destroy both she and himself mamercus aemilius scaurus on the other hand who have never govern anybody nor receive bribe be convict because of a tragedy and fall a victim to a worse fate than any he have depict atreus be the name of the composition and in the manner of euripide -lrb- 16 -rrb- it advise some one of the subject of that monarch to endure the folly of the ruling prince tiberius when he hear of it declare that the verse have be compose against he at this juncture and that atreus be merely a pretence use on account of that monarch 's bloodthirstiness and add quietly i will have he play the part of ajax he bring pressure to bear to make he commit suicide the above be not the accusation make against he instead he be charge with have keep up a _ liaison _ with livillum many other have be punish on she account some with good reason and some as the result of blackmail -lrb- -25 - -rrb- while matter at rome be in this condition the subject territory be not quiet either the very moment a certain youth who declare he be drusus appear in the region of greece and ionium the city both receive he enthusiastically and support he cause he would have proceed to syrium and take possession of the legion have not some one recognize he and put a end to he success take he to tiberius -lrb- ad 35 -lrb- _ a u _ 788 -rrb- -rrb- after this gaius gallus and marcus servilius become consul tiberius be at antium holding fête in honor of the nuptials of gaius not even for such a purpose would he enter rome because of the case of one fulcinius trio the latter who have be a friend of sejanus but have stand high in the favor of tiberius on account of he readiness at blackmail be when accuse deliver up for punishment and through fear he slew himself beforehand after abuse roundly both the emperor and macro in he testament he child do not dare to publish it but tiberius learn what have be write order it to be present before the senate little do he trouble himself about such matter sometimes he would voluntarily give to the public denunciation of he conduct that be be keep secret as another man would eulogy indeed he take all that drusus have utter in distress and misfortune and this too he send in to the senate -- so much then for the death of trio poppaeus sabinus who have govern both the mysia and macedonium besides during almost all the reign of tiberius up to this time withdraw from life with the greatest good-will before any charge could be bring against he he be succeed by regulus with equal authority for accord to some report macedonium and achaea be both assign to the new ruler without lot be cast for they -lrb- ad 36 -lrb- _ a u _ 789 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -26 - -rrb- about the same period artabanus the parthian after the death of artaxia bestow armenia upon he son arsace when no vengeance fall upon he from tiberius for this move he make a attempt upon cappadocium and treat the parthian too rather haughtily consequently some revolt from he and go on a embassy to tiberius ask a king for themselves from among those serve as hostage he send they at once phraate son of phraate and at the death of the latter -lrb- which occur on the way -rrb- tiridate who be himself also of the royal race to insure he secure the throne as easily as possible the emperor write order to mithridate the iberian to invade armenia so that artabanus should leave home and assist he son thing turn out as plan but the reign of tiridate last only a short time for artabanus get the scythian on he side and have no great difficulty in expel he so much for the parthian affair -- armenia fall into the hand of mithridate son of mithridate the iberian of course and a brother of pharasmane who become king of the iberian after he -- when sextus papinius become consul with quintus plautius the tiber inundate a large part of the city so that it remain under water and a much more extensive section in the vicinity of the hippodrome and the aventine be devastate by fire in view of these disaster tiberius give two thousand five hundred myriad to those who have suffer any loss -lrb- ad 37 -lrb- _ a u _ 790 -rrb- -rrb- and if egyptian affair also touch roman interest at all it might be mention that that year the phoenix be see all these event be think to foreshadow the death of tiberius thrasyllus die at this very time and the emperor himself in the follow spring in the consulship of gnaeus proculus and pontius nigrinus it chance that macro have plot against domitius and numerous other and have devise complaint and torture against they not all that be accuse however be put to death because thrasyllus handle tiberius very cleverly concern himself he state very accurately both the day and the hour in which he should die but he falsely declare that the emperor would live ten more year in order that the latter feeling he have a moderately long time to live might be in no hurry to kill they the issue justify the plan think that it would be possible for he later to do whatever he like at he leisure he make no haste in any way and show no anger when the senate in consideration of the opposition to the torture express by the magistrate postpone the sentencing of the prisoner yet pitiable scene be not want one woman wound herself be carry into the senate and from there to prison where she die lucius arruntius distinguish both for he age and for he education destroy himself voluntarily when tiberius be already sick and be not think likely to recover the man be aware of the evil character of gaius and desire to depart before he should taste of it say : i can not in my old age become the slave of a new master like he still other be save -- some who have actually be condemn but be not permit to die before the expiration of ten day and other because they trial be again put off when the judge learn that tiberius be seriously ailing -lrb- -28 - -rrb- he pass away at misenum before he could learn anything of this he have be sick for a considerable time but expect to live as thrasyllus have foretell he neither consult physician nor change he way of life waste away gradually as he be in old age and subject to a sickness that be not severe he would often all but expire and then recover strength again these change would cause gaius and the rest first great pleasure when they think he be go to die and then great fear when they think he would live he successor therefore fear that he health might actually be restore refuse he request for anything to eat on the ground that he would be injure and pretend that he need warmth wrap many thick cloth about he in this way he smother he with a certain amount of help to be sure from macro the latter as tiberius be already seriously ill be pay he court to the young man particularly as he have before this succeed in make he fall in love with he own wife ennium thrasyllum tiberius suspect this have once say : you understand well when to abandon the setting and hasten to the rise sun so tiberius who possess the most varied virtue the most varied vice and follow each set in turn as if the other do not exist pass away in this fashion on the twenty-sixth day of march -lrb- 17 -rrb- he have live seventy-seven year four month nine day of which he have spend as ruler twenty-two year seven month and seven day a public funeral be accord he and a eulogy deliver by gaius -lrb- footnote 1 : supply here -lrb- as do sylburgius to fill a gap in the sense -rrb- -lrb- greek : echeleuse chahus tae boulae -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the consul

-rrb- cn sentius cn f saturninus -lrb- ad 41 = a u 794 = fifth of gaius to jan 24th -rrb- this last year be not count because most of the event in it be record in the sixtieth book _ -lrb- book 59 boissevain -rrb- _ -lrb- ad 37 -lrb- _ a u _ 790 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -1 - -rrb- this then be the tradition about tiberius he successor be gaius son of germanicus and agrippina who be know also as i have state by the nickname of germanicus and caligulum tiberius have leave the empire partly in charge of he grandson tiberius but gaius have he will carry to the senate by macro and cause it to be declare null and void by the consul and the rest -lrb- with whom he have make previous arrangement -rrb- on the ground that the author of the document have not be of sound mind this be evidence by he allow a mere boy to rule they who have not yet the right even to enter the senate thus do gaius at this time separate the lad from imperial office and later in spite of have adopt he he slew he of no avail be the fact that tiberius in he testament still extant have write the same word over in a number of way as if this would lend they some force nor yet that all of it have be at this time read aloud by macro before the senatorial body for no injunction can have weight against the intentional misunderstanding or the power of one 's successor tiberius suffer the same treatment he have accord to he mother 's wish save that he discharge none of the obligation impose by she will in the case of any person whereas all he bequest be pay to all the beneficiary save to he grandson this of course make it perfectly plain that the whole fault find with the will have be invent on account of the lad gaius need not have publish it since he be not unacquainted with the contents but inasmuch as many know what be in it and it seem likely that he himself on the one hand or the senate on the other would be blame for its suppression he choose rather to have the latter body overthrow it than to conceal the document -lrb- -2 - -rrb- at the same time by pay all the bequest of the dead emperor as if they be he own to every one concerned he gain among the many a certain reputation for nobility of character in company with the senate he inspect the pretorian while they be busy with exercise and distribute to they the two hundred and fifty denarius apiece that have be bequeath and he add as a gift as many more to the people he pay the one thousand one hundred and twenty-five myriad -lrb- this be the amount bequeath to they -rrb- and in addition the sixty denarius per man which they have fail to receive on the occasion of he enrollment among the iuvene -- this with interest amounting to fifteen denarius more he also settle the bequest to the citizen force to the night-watchmen to those of the regular army outside italy and to any other army of native roman in the smaller fort -- that be the citizen proper receive one hundred twenty-five denarius each and all the rest seventy-five he behave in this same way also in regard to livium 's will execute all the provision of it if he have spend the rest of he money with equal propriety he would nave be think prudent and munificent sometimes through fear of the people and the soldier he do so act but it be mostly through whim at such time he discharge not only the obligation of tiberius but those of he great-grandmother and debt owe to private individual as well as to other as it be he lavish boundless sum upon dancer -lrb- whose recall he at once effect -rrb- upon horse upon gladiator and everything of that sort and so in a inconceivably short time he have exhaust the treasure which have grow so great and at the same time convict himself of have do it through a sort of easy-going temper and indecision he have find accumulate five myriad myriad seven thousand five hundred denarius or -lrb- accord to other -rrb- eight myriad myriad two thousand five hundred and yet could not keep any part of it to the third year but actually in the second season fall in need of a great deal besides -lrb- -3 - -rrb- he go through the same process of deterioration too in almost all other respects at first he seem a most democratic person and would send no letter either to the people or to the senate nor assume any of the title of sovereignty yet he become most dictatorial so that he take in one day all those honor which augustus have with difficulty secure vote one by one during the long extent of he reign some of which tiberius have refuse to accept at all he postpone nothing except the title of _ father _ and that he acquire after no long time though he have prove himself the most libidinous of man have seduce one woman already betroth and have drag other from they husband he afterward hate they all save one and he would certainly have detest she have he live any longer toward he mother he sister and he grandmother antonia he conduct himself in the most dutiful manner possible the last name he immediately salute as augusta and appoint she priestess of augustus give she at once all the privilege pertain to the vestal virgin to he sister he assign these honor of the vestal virgin the right to witness horse-race in the same section of seat with he and the right to have utter in they behalf as well the prayer which be annually offer by the magistrate and the priest for he welfare and that of the state and the oath of allegiance swear to he empire he set sail himself and with he own hand collect and bring back the bone of he mother and of he brother that have die : wear the purple-bordered toga and attend by some lictor as at a triumph he deposit these in the monument of augustus all measure vote against they he cancel all who have plot against they he chastise and recall such as be in exile on they account -- now though he have do all this he show himself the most impious of man in the case both of he grandmother and of he sister the former because she have rebuke he for something he force to seek death by she own hand and after ravish all he sister he shut two of they up on a island : the third have previously die again in the matter of tiberius -lrb- whom he also term grandfather -rrb- he ask that he might receive from the senate the same honor as augustus but these be not immediately vote for the senator could not endure to honor that tyrant nor do they make bold to dishonor he because they be not yet clearly acquaint with the character of they young lord and consequently postpone everything until the latter should be present : so then gaius bestow upon he no mark of notice other than a public funeral after bring the body into the city by night and have it lay out at daybreak and though he do make a speech over it he do not say so much in praise of tiberius as he do to remind the people of augustus and germanicus compare himself meanwhile with they -lrb- -4 - -rrb- gaius inevitably go so by contrary in every matter that he not only emulate but even surpass he predecessor 's licentiousness and bloodthirstiness for which he have censure he but of the quality he have praise in he he imitate not one though he have be the first to insult he the first to abuse he so that other think to please he in this way make use of rather heedless freedom of speech he later laud and magnify tiberius go to the point of punish some for what they have say these as enemy of the former emperor he hate for they injurious remark and he hate equally those who in way praise tiberius as be the latter 's friend though he have put a end to complaint arise from maiestas he make these the cause of many person ' downfall though accord to he own account he dismiss the anger that he feel toward those who have unite against he father and he mother and he brother -lrb- and burn they letter -rrb- he yet put to death great number of they on the basis of evidence contain in such document he do to be sure really destroy some papers but not those which hold definite incontrovertible proof of these he make copy besides though he at first forbid any one to set up he image he go on to manufacture the statue himself whereas once he request the annulment of a decree that sacrifice should be offer to he fortune and have this action of he inscribe on a tablet he afterward order temple and sacrifice to be prepare for he as for some god he delight by turn in vast throng of man and in solitude he grow angry if request be prefer or if they be not prefer he would start out on enterprise with the greatest amount of dash and then carry they through in the most sluggish manner he both spend money most unsparingly and show a thoroughly sordid spirit in exact it he be alike irritated and pleased both at those who flatter he and at those who speak they own mind many who be guilty of great crime he neglect to punish and many who have do no wrong he ruthlessly slaughter among he associate he make some the recipient of excessive adulation and other of excessive insult consequently no one know either what to say or how to act toward he but all who meet with success obtain it as the result of chance rather than of rational calculation -lrb- -5 - -rrb- that be the kind of emperor into whose hand the roman have now fall hence the deed of tiberius though they be feel to have be most grievous be still as far superior to those of gaius as the deed of augustus be to those of he successor for tiberius always hold the power in he own hand and use other people to help he carry out he wish : gaius on the other hand be rule by charioteer and by gladiator he be the slave of dancer and other theatrical performer indeed he always keep apelles the most famous of the tragedian of that day with he even in public thus he by himself and they by themselves do without let or hindrance all that such person when give power would naturally dare to do everything that could help theatrical production he arrange and settle on the slightest pretext in the most expensive manner and compel prætors and consul to do the same so that almost every day some performance of the kind be sure to be give originally he be but a spectator and listener at these and would take side for and against various performer like one of the mob and sometimes if he be irritated at he opponent he would not visit the spectacle but as time go on he come to imitate and contend in many event drive chariot fight duel give exhibition of dancing and act in tragedy this become he regular practice and one night he urgently summon the leader of the senate as if to some important deliberation and then dance before they -lrb- -6 - -rrb- now in that year that tiberius die and gaius enter upon office in he stead he first begin to show great deference to the senator on a occasion when knight be present at the meeting and also some of the populace he promise to share he power with they and do whatever would please they call himself meanwhile they son and nursling he be then twenty-five year old lack five month four day after this he free those who be in prison among whom be quintus pomponius who for seven whole year after he consulship have be keep in a cell suffering abuse gaius do away with the complaint for maiesta on account of which he see that most of the prisoner be suffer and heap up -lrb- or so he pretend -rrb- and burn the document pertain to they case that tiberius have leave behind he also declare : i have do this that no matter how much i might wish to bear malice toward any one for my mother 's and my brother ' sake i might still be unable to punish he for this he be commend because it be expect that _ he _ at all event would speak the truth by reason of he youth it be not think possible that he could be guilty of duplicity in thought or speech and he still further increase they hope by order that the celebration of the saturnalia extend over five day and by take from each of those enjoy a allowance of grain only a as instead of the denarius which they be wont to give a emperor for the manufacture of image it be vote that he should at once become consul by the removal of proculus and nigrinus who be hold office at the time and that he should thereafter be consul annually however he do not accept the offer but instead wait until the two official complete the six month ' term for which they have be appoint and then become consul himself take he uncle claudius as a colleague the latter who have previously be rank among the knight and after the death of tiberius have be send as a envoy to gaius in behalf of that order now for the first time after live forty-six year become both consul and senator at once the behavior of gaius in these matter appear satisfactory and to he action correspond the speech which he deliver in the senate-house on enter upon he consulship in it he denounce tiberius for each of the crime of which he be commonly accuse and make many announcement about he own line of conduct and the senate fear that he might change issue a decree that he statement should be read annually -lrb- -7 - -rrb- soon after clothe in the triumphal garb he dedicate the heroüm of augustus boy of the noblest family both of whose parent have to be live together with maiden similarly circumstance sing the hymn and the senator with they wife as well as the people be banquet entertainment of all sort be give there be exhibition involve music and horserace take place on two day -- twenty heat the first day and forty -lrb- 1 -rrb- more the second because the former be the emperor 's birthday and the latter that of augustus he have a similar number of event on many other occasion as seem good to he hitherto not more than ten -lrb- 2 -rrb- event have be usual but this time he finish four hundred bear together with a equal number of beast from libya the boy of noble birth perform troy on horseback and six horse draw the triumphal car on which he be bear this be a innovation in the race he do not give the signal to the charioteer in person but view the spectacle from a front seat with he brother and he fellow-priest of the augustan order he be always greatly displeased if any one be absent from the theater or leave in the middle of the performance and so in order that no one might have a excuse for not attend he postpone all lawsuit and suspend all period of mourning thus woman bereft of they husband be allow to marry even before the appoint time unless indeed they be pregnant in order to enable people to come without formality and to save they the trouble of greet he -lrb- for previously those who meet the emperor on the street always salute he -rrb- he forbid any one 's do this again those who choose might come barefoot to the spectacles it have be from very ancient time the custom for person to do this who hold court in the summer the practice have be frequently follow by augustus at the summer festival but have be abandon by tiberius it be at this period that the senator first begin sit upon cushion instead of the bare board and that they be allow to wear cap to the theater thessalian fashion to avoid distress from the sun 's ray and whenever the sun be particularly severe they use instead of the theater the diribitorium which be furnish with bench -- this be what gaius do in he consulship which he hold two month and twelve day the remainder of the six month ' term he surrender to the man previously appoint for it -lrb- -8 - -rrb- it be after this that he fall sick but instead of die himself he manage to cause the death of tiberius who have be register among the iuvene have be give the title of princep iuventuti and finally have be adopt into he family -lrb- 3 -rrb- the complaint bring against the lad be that he have pray and expect that gaius might die this charge prove the destruction of many other too the same ruler who give to antiochus son of antiochus the district of commagene which he father have hold and likewise the coast district of cilicium and have free agrippa -lrb- grandson of herod who have be imprison by tiberius -rrb- and have put he in charge of he grandfather 's domain not only deprive agrippa 's brother -lrb- or else he son -rrb- of he paternal fortune but furthermore have he murder without make any communication about he to the senate later he take similar action in a number of other case now the young tiberius perish on suspicion of have utilize the emperor 's illness as a occasion for conspiracy on the other hand there be publius afranius potitus a plebeian who in a burst of foolish servility have promise not only of he own free will but under oath that he would give he life to have gaius recover and a certain atanius secundus a knight who announce that in the event of a favorable outcome he would fight as a gladiator these instead of the money which they hope to receive from he in return for offer to die in exchange for he life be compel to keep they promise so as not to perjure themselves that be the cause of these man 's death again he father-in-law marcus silanus though he have make no promise and take no oath nevertheless because he virtue and he relationship make he displease to the emperor and subject he to extreme insult for this reason commit suicide tiberius have hold he in such honor as to refuse always to try a case that be appeal from he jurisdiction and to refer all such dispute back to he again but gaius abused he in every way and have such a high opinion of he that he call he the golden sheep now silanus on account of he age and he reputation be accord by all the consul the honor of cast he vote first and to prevent he do so any longer gaius have abolish the custom of have some of the ex-consuls vote first or second accord to the pleasure of those who put the vote he arrange that such person should cast they vote on the same footing as the rest and in the same order as they have hold the office moreover he put aside he victim 's daughter to marry cornelium orestillum whom he have actually seize during the marriage festival which she be celebrate with she betrothed gaius calpurnius piso before two month have elapse he banish both of they on the ground that they have carnal knowledge of each other he allow piso to take with he ten slave and then when the latter ask for more he let he employ as many as he like say : you will have just so many soldier -lrb- ad 38 -lrb- _ a u _ 791 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -9 - -rrb- the next year marcus julianus and publius nonius regularly appoint become consul oath pertain to the act of tiberius be not introduce and for this reason be not use nowadays either no one number tiberius among the emperor in the list of member of he house -lrb- 4 -rrb- but in regard to augustus and gaius they take the oath which have regularly be the custom and other to the effect that they would hold gaius and he sister in greater respect than themselves and they child and they offer prayer for all of they alike on the very first day of the new year one machaon a slave climb upon the couch of jupiter capitolinus and after utter from that place many dire prophecy kill a little dog which he have bring in with he and slew himself the follow good deed must be set down to the credit of gaius he publish as augustus have do all the account of public fund which have not be make know during the time tiberius be out of the city he help the soldier extinguish a conflagration and assist those who suffer loss by it as the equestrian order pine from lack of man he summon the foremost man from every office even abroad and enrol they with due regard to they relative and they wealth some of they he allow to wear the senatorial costume occasionally even before they have hold any office through which we enter the senate on the strength of they hope to secure admission to that body previously it would seem that only those who have be bear in the senatorial order be allow to do this these deed cause pleasure to all but this action in restore the election to the populus and the pleb rescind the decision of tiberius about these matter and in abolish the one per cent tax and again in scatter at some gymnastic contest ticket and distribute very large gift to such as secure they -- these action though they delight the lower class grieve the sensible who reflect that even if the office fall once more into the hand of the general public still in case the exist fund should be exhaust and private source of income fail many dreadful disaster would result -lrb- -10 - -rrb- the performance of he next to be enumerate elicit the censure of all without distinction he cause very great number of man to fight as gladiator force they to contend both separately and in group draw up in a kind of military formation : he request permission from the senate to do this and again -- something quite contrary to the spirit of the enact law that he might do whatsoever he please -- he ask leave to put to death a number of person among they twenty-six knight some of whom have already devour they living while other have merely practice gladiatorial combat it be not the number of those who perish that be so bad -lrb- though it be bad enough -rrb- but he frenzied delight in they slaughter and he never satisfied gaze at the scene of blood the same trait of cruelty lead he once when there be a shortage of condemn criminal to be give to the beast to order some of the mob that stand near the bench to be seize and throw to they and to prevent the possibility of they make a outcry or attack he orally he have they tongue cut out first of all one of the prominent knight too he compel to fight in single combat on the charge of insult offer to he mother agrippina and when the man prove victorious hand he over to the accuser and have he slay the same person 's father though guilty of no wrong he confine in a cage -lrb- as he have confine numerous other -rrb- and there put a end to he -- these contest he at first conduct in the sæpta after excavate -lrb- 5 -rrb- the entire site and fill it with water to enable he to bring in one ship later he transfer he operation to another place where he tear down a large number of massive building and set up bench the theater of taurus he hold in contempt all this behavior expenditure and murder alike subject he to criticism he be further blame for compelling macro together with ennium to cause they own death remember neither the latter 's affection nor the former 's benefit which have gain for he among other advantage the sole possession of the empire the fact that he have appoint macro to govern egypt have not the slightest influence he even involve he in a scandal -lrb- of which the greatest share belong to gaius himself -rrb- by bring against he besides all the rest a complaint that he have play the pander before long many other be condemn and execute and some be execute prior to they conviction nominally they suffer on account of some wrong do to he parent or he brother or the rest who have perish with those relative as a excuse but really on account of they property for the treasury have be exhaust and he have no resource such person be convict by witness against they and by the document which he once declare he have burn again the disease which have attack he the previous year and the death of he sister drusillum bring about the ruin of other since -- to omit graver case -- whoever have entertain or have greet any one or have bath on the day in question incur punishment -lrb- -11 - -rrb- the nominal spouse of drusillum be marcus lepidus at once the favorite and lover of the emperor but gaius also treat she as a concubine when she death occur at this time she husband deliver the eulogy but it be she brother who accord she a public funeral the pretorian with they commander and the equestrian order by itself run about the pyre -lrb- 6 -rrb- and the boy of noble birth perform the troy exercise about she tomb all the honor that have be give to livium be vote to she and it be further decree that she should be declare immortal that a figure in gold represent she be set up in the senate-house and that in the temple of venus in the forum there should be dedicate with equal honor a statue of she as large as that of the goddess moreover a separate shrine should be build for she and twenty priest -lrb- 7 -rrb- not only man but also woman should do she honor woman as often as they give testimony should swear by she and on she birthday a festival equal to the megalensium should be celebrate and the senate and the knight should hold a banquet she straightway receive the name panthea and be declare worthy of divine honor in all the city a certain livius geminus a senator state on oath invoke destruction upon himself and he child if he speak falsely that he have see she ascend into heaven and hold converse with the god and he call all the other god and panthea herself to witness for he declaration he receive twenty-five myriad besides all this gaius show she honor in not have the festival which be then due to take place celebrate either at they appoint time -lrb- except as mere formality -rrb- or at any later date all person incur equal censure whether they show pleasure at anything as be grieve or behave as if they be glad -lrb- 9 -rrb- they be charge with malice either in fail to mourn she -lrb- this be disrespect to she as a mortal -rrb- or in bewail she -lrb- this be disrespect to she as a goddess -rrb- one single occurrence give the key to all the transaction of that time the emperor charge with impiety and put to death a man who have sell warm water -lrb- -12 - -rrb- have allow a few day to elapse he marry lollium paulina and he compel no less a person than she husband memmius regulus to betroth she to he so that he might not break the law in take she without a betrothal but almost in a trice he have drive she away too meantime he grant to soaimus the land of the arabian ituræans to coty lesser armenia and later part of arabium to rhoemetalce the possession of coty and to polemon son of polemon he ancestral domain -- all these upon the vote of the senate the ceremony take place in the forum where he sit upon the rostrum in a chair between the consul some say he use silken awning soon after he catch sight of a lot of mud in a alley and order that it be cast into the toga of flavius vespasian who be ædile at the time and have charge of keep alley clean this event be regard at the moment as of no particular importance but later when vespasian who take charge of a state in confusion and turmoil have reduce the same to order it seem to have be due to some divine prompt and to have signify that gaius have entrust the city to he unconditionally for its amelioration -lrb- ad 39 -lrb- _ a u _ 792 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -13 - -rrb- he now become consul again and though he prevent the priest of jupiter from take the oath in the senate -lrb- for at this time they regularly do so privately as in the day of tiberius -rrb- he himself both when he enter upon office and when he relinquish it take the oath like the rest upon the rostrum which have be make larger than before thirty day be the duration of he tenure -lrb- whereas he let he colleague lucius apronius hold office for six month -rrb- and he successor be sanguinius maximus præfectus urbus during this and the following period number of the foremost man perish in fulfillment of a sentence of condemnation -lrb- for many who have be release from prison be punish for the very reason that have lead to they imprisonment by tiberius -rrb- and many other in gladiatorial combat there be nothing happen but slaughter the emperor no longer make any concession to the populace oppose instead absolutely everything it wish and consequently the people too resist all he desire the talk and action usual at such a juncture with a angry ruler on one side and a hostile folk on the other be plainly in evidence the contest between they however be not a equal one the people could do nothing outside of discussion and show they feeling by they demeanor whereas gaius drag many of he opponent away while they be witness performance at the theater and arrest many more after they have leave the build the chief cause for he rage be first that they do not show enthusiasm in attend he make he appearance at a different hour on different occasion sometimes not till nightfall and they be wear out wait for he : second that they do not always applaud the performance that please he and sometimes even show favor to object of he dislike again it vex he mightily to have they cry out in they effort to extol he : young augustus he feel that he be not be congratulate upon be emperor while so young but be be censure for hold at he age so great a domain he regular conduct be as describe once he say threateningly to the whole people : how i wish you have one neck at another time when he be show some of he usual irritation the populace in displeasure cease to notice the spectacle and turn against the informer and with loud shout demand they surrender gaius indignant vouchsafe they no answer but commit to other the conduct of the game withdraw into campanium later he return to celebrate the birthday of drusillum bring into the hippodrome on a wagon she statue draw by -lrb- 10 -rrb- elephant and give the people a free show for two day the first day besides the equestrian contest he have five hundred bear slaughter and on the second a like number of libyan beast be use up athlete struggle in the pancratium at many different point in the city the populace be feast and present be give to the senator and they wife \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- -14 - -rrb- at the same time that he authorize these murder apparently because he be so very poor he devise another kind of transaction he take the survive combatant and sell they at a excessive valuation to the consul the prætors and the rest meeting with acquiescence from some and compelling other who object strenuously to carry out he wish at the horse-race and most of all he impose upon the one especially select by lot for this purpose for he have order that two prætors just as it might happen should be allot to take charge of the gladiatorial game he himself sit on the auctioneer 's platform and keep outbid they many also come from outside to bid against they particularly because he allow such as wish to employ a greater number of gladiator than the law permit and because he often have recourse to they himself so people buy they for large sum some through need of the man other think they should gratify he and the largest number -lrb- in case they be repute to be property-holder -rrb- out of a wish to avail themselves of this pretext for spend some of they substance and thus by become poorer save they life yet in spite of this action of he he afterward put out of the way by poison the best and most famous of these slave he do the same also in the case of rival horse and charioteer be greatly devote to the party that wear the frog green and from this color be call the party of the leek even now the place where the chariot practice be call galanum one of the horse that he name incitatus he invite to dinner offer he golden barley and drink he health in wine from gold goblet he take oath by the same beast 's guardian spirit and preside fortune and promise besides that he would appoint he consul this he would certainly have do too if he have live longer -lrb- -15 - -rrb- now formerly for the purpose of provide fund it have be vote that all those person who have wish to leave anything to tiberius and be alive should at they death bestow the same upon gaius the publication of a decree be deem necessary to prevent its seem that he could break the law in secure by inheritance such gift for he have at the time neither wife nor child but at the time of which i be speak he proceed to levy for himself without any vote absolutely all the property of man who have serve among the centurion and have after the triumph which he father celebrate leave it to somebody other than the emperor when not even this suffice he hit upon the follow third means of raise money there be a senator gnæus domitius corbulo who have notice that the road during the reign of tiberius be in bad condition and be always nagging the road commissioner about it and furthermore keep make a nuisance of himself before the senate regard the matter gaius take he as a confederate and through he attack all those alive or dead who have ever be road commissioner and have receive money for repair the highway he fine both they and the man who have secure any contract from they on the pretence that they have spend nothing for this help corbulo be at the time make consul but later in the reign of claudius he be accuse and he conduct investigate claudius make no further demand for any sum still owe and after collect what have be pay in partly from the treasury and partly from corbulo he return it to the person who have be fine all that be later at this time these unfortunate one by one and practically everybody else in the city be as one might say despoil of those who possess anything there be no one -- not a man nor a woman -- who get off scot free though he allow some of the more elderly person to live yet by call they he father grandfather mother and grandmother he get revenue from they during they lifetime and inherit they property when they die -lrb- -16 - -rrb- up to this time he be always speak ill of tiberius before everybody and so far from rebuke other who criticise he privately or publicly he enjoy they language but now he enter the senate-house and eulogize he predecessor at length besides severely rebuke the senate and the people say that they do wrong in find fault with he i may do even this he say in my capacity as emperor but you be not only unjust but also guilty of impiety -lrb- 11 -rrb- to take such a attitude toward one who rule you thereupon he consider separately the case of each man who have lose he life and show to he own satisfaction that the senator have be responsible for the death of most of they some he allege they have kill by accusation some by damn evidence and all by sentence of condemnation this he prove by have some freedman read it from those very document which he once declare he have burn and he tell they besides : in case tiberius really do do wrong you ought not to have honor he while he live and at any rate by jupiter you ought not to repudiate what you often say and vote but you both behave toward he with fickleness and again after fill sejanus with conceit and spoil he you put he to death and therefore i ought not either to expect any decent treatment from you after some such remark he represent in he speech tiberius himself as say to he : all this that you have say have be good and true therefore have no affection nor mercy for any one of they they all hate you : they all pray for you death they will murder you if they can hence do not stop to consider what act of yours will please they and heed none of they talk rather have regard to you own pleasure and safety solely since that have the most just claim in this way you will suffer no harm and will enjoy all supremest pleasure you will moreover be honor by they whether they so desire or not if you follow a different course it will be useless and beyond a empty reputation you will gain no advantage but become the victim of plot and perish ingloriously no man living be rule of he own free will but the element which be keep in fear whatever its size wait upon the stronger element whereas if it attain to courage it always wreak vengeance upon the other which have now become the weaker at the close of this address gaius reintroduce the complaint for maiesta order he command to be inscribe upon a bronze tablet and rush hastily from the senate-house proceed the same day to the suburb of the capital the senate and the people be fill with great fear as they think of the denunciation against tiberius which they have often utter and of the many surprise he speech have have in store for they temporarily they alarm and dejection prevent they from say a word or transact any business next day they assemble again praise gaius unstintedly as a most sincere and pious ruler and thank he profusely that they have not perish like other accordingly they vote annually to sacrifice cattle to the spirit of kindness that animated he both on the anniversary of the day he have read this matter just mention and on those belong to the palatium -lrb- 12 -rrb- : on such occasion he image in gold be to be conduct to the capitol and hymn sing in its honor by the boy of noblest birth they grant he also the right to celebrate a lesser triumph as though he have defeat some enemy this be what they vote at that meeting : later they add to it extensively on almost every pretext -lrb- -17 - -rrb- gaius take no heed of the celebration mention it seem to he to be no great thing to drive a horse on land : but he have a desire to ride horseback through the sea in a way by bridge over the water between puteolus and baulus this locality be opposite the city twenty-six stade distant boat for the bridge be partly bring together and partly build new for the purpose for the number it have prove possible to collect in a brief space of time be insufficient although all feasible vessel have be gather and it be principally this fact that cause a serious famine in italy and rome in join these boat not merely a passageway be construct but rest place and wait room be build along in it and these have run water fit for drinking when it be ready he put on the breastplate of alexander -lrb- or so he say -rrb- and over it a purple silk chlamy contain much gold and many precious stone from indium he furthermore gird on a sword take a shield and don a garland of oak leave next he offer sacrifice to neptune and some other god and to envy -lrb- in order he say that no jealousy might attend he -rrb- and enter the passage from the end at baulus take with he great number of armed horseman and foot soldier and he make a fierce dash into the city as if he be after some enemy there he rest the following day as though seek respite from battle and wear a gold-spangled tunic he return on a chariot over the same bridge he be draw by race-horse that be most competent to gain victory a long train of what be apparently spoil accompany he among they darius one of the arsacidæ belong to the group of parthian then serve as hostage he friend and associate in beflowered robe follow he on vehicle as do the army and the rest of the throng which be deck out accord to individual taste of course in the midst of such a campaign and after so magnificent a victory he have to deliver a bit of a harangue : so he ascend a platform which have likewise be erect at about the center of the bridge first he extol himself as one who have undertake a great enterprise next he praise the soldier as man exhaust by the danger they have face add the significant statement that they have traverse the sea on foot for this gallantry he give they money and afterward for the rest of the day and all through the night they enjoy a banquet -- he on the bridge as though some island and they at anchor on other boat light in abundance shone upon they from the place itself and abundant light besides from the mountain for since the place be crescent-shaped fire be exhibit from all side as might be do in a theater so that no one could notice the darkness it be he wish to make the night day as he have make the sea land when he have become full to excess of food and strong drink he throw number of he companion off the bridge into the sea and sink many of the rest by make a circuitous attack upon they in boat that have ram some perish but the majority though drunk manage to save themselves the reason be that the sea show itself extremely smooth and tranquil both while the bridge be be put together and while the other event be take place this too cause the emperor some elation and he say that even neptune be afraid of he as for darius and xerx he make all manner of fun of they inasmuch as he have bridge over a far vaster expanse of sea than they -lrb- -18 - -rrb- the final episode in the career of that bridge which i shall now relate proved another source of death to many inasmuch as the emperor have exhaust he revenue in the construction he fall to plot against many more person because of they property he preside at trial both privately and in company with the entire senate that body also try some case by itself yet it have not full power and there be many appeal from its decision the decision of the senate be merely make public but when any man be condemn by gaius they name be bulletine as though he fear they might not learn they fate these meet they punishment some in prison and other by be hurl from the capitoline still other kill themselves beforehand there be no safety even for such as leave the country but many of they too lose they life either on the road or while in banishment it be not worth while to burden my reader unduly by go into the detail of most of these case but i may stop to notice calvisius sabinus one of the foremost man in the senate he have recently come from govern pannonium and he and he wife cornelium be both indict the charge against she be that she have visit some military post and have watch some soldier practice these two do not stand trial but despatch themselves before the time set the same be to be record of titius rufus against whom a complaint be lodge that he have say the senate have one thing in they mind but utter something different also one junius priscus a prætor be accuse on various charge but he death be really due to the supposition that he be wealthy gaius on learn that he possess nothing worth cause he death for make this remarkable statement : he fool I and perish uselessly when he might as well have live -lrb- -19 - -rrb- among these man put on trial at this time domitius afer encounter danger from a unexpected source and secure he preservation in a still more remarkable way gaius be incense against he -lrb- if for no other reason -rrb- because in the reign of tiberius he have accuse a woman who be relate to the emperor 's mother agrippina later the woman have meet afer and as she see that out of embarrassment he stand aside from she path she call to he and say -lrb- refer to the matter -rrb- : never mind domitius : it be not you but agamemnon that cause I these trouble -lrb- 13 -rrb- just about this time afer have set up a image of the emperor and have place upon it a inscription show that gaius in he twenty-seventh year be already consul for the second time this vex the latter who feel that undue notice be be give to he youth and he transgression of the law so for this action for which afer have look to be honor he bring he before the senate and read a long speech against he gaius always maintain that he surpass all live orator and know that he adversary be a extremely gifted speaker he strive on this occasion to excel he he would certainly have put afer to death if the latter have enter into the least competition with he as it be the man make no answer or defense but pretend to be astonished and overcome by the cleverness of gaius and repeat the accusation point by point he praise it as though he be some listener and not on trial when opportunity be give he to speak he take to supplicate and bewail he lot finally he throw himself on the earth and lie there prostrate he beseech he accuser apparently fear he as a orator rather than as cæsar in this way the latter when he see and hear what i have describe be melt for he think that he have really overwhelmed domitius by the eloquence of he address for this reason then and on account of callistus the freedman whom he be wont to honor and whose favor domitius have court he cease he anger and when callistus later blame he for have accuse the man in the first place the emperor answer : it would not have be right for I to hide such a speech so domitius be save by be convict of no longer be a skillful speaker on the other hand lucius annæus seneca who be superior in wisdom to all the roman of he day and to many other great man come very near be ruin though he have do no wrong and there be no suspicion of such a thing but just because he plead a case well in the senate while he sovereign be present gaius order he to be put to death but let he go because he believe what one of he female associate say that seneca have a bad case of consumption and would die before a great while -lrb- -20 - -rrb- directly he appoint domitius consul and remove those who hold the office at the time : this he do because they have not proclaim a thanksgiving on the occasion of he birthday -lrb- the prætors have hold a horse-race and have slaughter some beast but that happen every year -rrb- whereas they have celebrate a festival to commemorate the victory of augustus over antony in order to find a accusation against they he choose to figure as a descendant of antony rather than of augustus he have beforehand tell those who share he secret that whichever the consul do they would certainly get into trouble whether they offer sacrifice as a mark of joy over antony 's disaster or whether they go without sacrifice on such a occasion as the victory of augustus it be for these reason then that he summarily dismiss these official and break to piece they fasce one of they take it so much to heart that he kill himself domitius be choose as the emperor 's colleague nominally by the people but actually by gaius himself the latter have to be sure restore the election to the populace but they have become rather lax in the performance of they duty because for a long time now they have enjoy none of the privilege of freeman and as a rule no more office-seeker present themselves than be need to fill vacant place or if ever there be a excessive number the outcome have be all arrange among themselves thus the appearance of a democracy be preserved but none of the proper result be secure and this lead gaius himself to abolish the election again after this thing go on precisely as in the reign of tiberius sometimes fifteen prætors be choose and again one more or less as it might happen such be the action he take regard the election in general he maintain a malignant and suspicious attitude toward quite everything that go on as witness he banishing carrina secundus the orator because the latter have deliver in a gymnasium a speech against tyrant also when lucius piso son of plancina and gnaeus piso chance to become governor of africa the emperor fear that pride might lead he to revolt particularly since he be to have a large force make up of both citizen and foreigner hence the province be divide in two and the military force together with the nomad in the immediate vicinity be assign to a different official that arrangement last to this day -lrb- -21 - -rrb- gaius have now spend practically all the money in rome and the rest of italy gather from every source from which he could in any way get it and as no resource that be of any value or practicable could be find there he expense become a source of great annoyance to he therefore he set out for gaul declare hostility against the celta on the ground that they be show some uneasiness but in reality he purpose be to get money from that region and spain where wealth be also abundant however he do not make a outright declaration of he destination but go first to one of the suburb and then suddenly start on he journey take with he many dancer gladiator horse woman and the rest of the rout when he reach the section he have in view he do no damage to any of the enemy -- as soon as he have proceed a short distance beyond the rhine he turn back and next he start apparently to conduct a campaign against britain but turn back from the ocean 's edge show no little vexation at he lieutenant because they win some slight success -- among the subject people however and among the ally and the citizen he work the greatest imaginable havoc in the first place he despoil property holder on any and every excuse and second individual and city bring he voluntarily large gift he keep on murder victim allege that some be rebel and other conspire the general complaint against they all be that they be rich the fact that he attend to the selling of they possession in person enable he to obtain far greater sum than would otherwise have be the case everybody be compel to buy they under all sort of condition and for much more than they value for the reason i have mention accordingly he send also for the finest and most precious heirloom of the government and auction they off sell with they the fame of the person who have once use they he would make some comment on each one such as this belong to my father this to my mother this to my grandfather this to my great-grandfather this egyptian piece belong to antony -- become a prize of augustus meantime he incidentally show the necessity of sell they so that no one dare to appear to be indigent and he sell with each article some valuable association -lrb- -22 - -rrb- in spite of all this he do not secure any surplus he keep up he expenditure both for the object that regularly interest he produce some spectacles at lugdunum and also for the army for the number of soldier he have gather amount to twenty myriad or as some say to twenty-five myriad seven time be he name imperator by they -lrb- just as pleased he -rrb- though he have win no battle and slay no enemy to be sure he do once by a ruse seize and make prisoner a few of the latter but it be he own people whom he waste most striking some of they down individually and butcher other _ en masse _ once he see a crowd either of prisoner or some other person and give order -lrb- in the cant phrase -rrb- that they should all be slay from baldhead to baldhead another time he be play dice and find that he have no money call for the census of the gaul and order the wealthiest of they to be put to death then he return to he fellow gambler and say : here you be play for a few denarius while i have collect nearly fifteen thousand myriad so these man perish without consideration indeed one of they julius sacerdo who be fairly well off but not so extremely wealthy as naturally to become the object of attack nevertheless fall a victim because of a similarity of name this show how carelessly everything go other who perish i need not cite by name simply mention enough to satisfy the requirement of my record one then that he kill be gastulicus lentulus a man of good reputation in every way who have be governor of germany for ten year he death be due to the fact that the soldier like he another that he murder be lepidus that lover and favorite of he husband of drusillum the man who together with gaius have maintain criminal relation with the emperor 's other sister agrippina and julium the man whom he have permit to stand for office five year earlier than the law allow whom he also declare he should leave to succeed he as emperor to celebrate the event he give the soldier money as though he have worst some hostile force and send three dagger to mar the avenger in rome he sister for they connection with lepidus he deport to the portian island have first write to the senate a great deal of outrageous and brutal comment upon they agrippina be give the victim 's bone in a jar and order to keep it in she bosom throughout the entire journey and bring it back to rome again also since many honor have be vote to these woman on the emperor 's account the emperor forbid any distinction be award to any of he relative again -lrb- -23 - -rrb- he send to the senate at the time a report of the matter as if he have escape some great plot for he be always pretend to be in danger and to be lead a miserable existence the senator on be apprise of the fact pass several complimentary vote and grant he a lesser triumph they send envoy to announce this some of whom be choose by lot but claudius by election that also displeased the emperor to such a extent that he again forbid anything approach praise or honor be give to he relative he feel too that he have not be honor as he deserve and indeed he never make any account of the honor grant he it irritated he to have small distinction vote since that imply a slight and greater distinction irritated he because then he be deprive of the possibility of win still higher prize he do not wish it to seem that anything that bring he honor be in the senator ' power -- that would make they stronger than he -- nor again that they should have the right to grant such a thing to he as if they have power and he be inferior to they for this reason he ofttime find fault with various gift on the ground that they do not increase he splendor but rather diminish he power be of this mind he use to become angry at those who do he honor if in any case it seem that they have vote he less than he deserve so capricious be he that no one could easily suit he accordingly for the reason mention he would not receive all of those ambassador affect to mistrust that they be spy but choose out a few and send the rest back before they reach gaul those that he admit to he presence be not accord any August reception indeed he would have kill claudius have he not entertain a contempt for he since the latter partly by nature and partly with intention give the impression of great stupidity other be again send more in number -lrb- for he have complain among other point of the smallness of the first embassy -rrb- and they make the announcement that many mark of distinction have be vote to he : these he receive gladly even go out to meet they for which action he receive fresh honor at they hand this however be somewhat later at the time under discussion gaius divorce paulina on the pretext that she be barren but really because he have have enough of she and married milonium cæsonia she have formerly be he mistress but now as she be pregnant he choose to make she he wife and have she bear he a child a month later the people of rome be disturb by this behavior and be still further disturbed because a number of trial be hang over they head as a result of the friendship they have show for he sister and for the man who have be murder : even some ædiles and prætors be compel to resign they office and stand trial -- meantime they also suffer from the excessive heat this grow so extremely severe that curtain be stretch across the forum -- among the man exile at this time ofonius tigillinus be banish on the charge of have have a _ liaison _ with agrippina -lrb- -24 - -rrb- all this however do not distress the people so much as they expectation that the cruelty and licentiousness of gaius would go to still greater length they be particularly trouble on ascertain that king agrippa and king antiochus be with he like two tyrant-trainer -lrb- ad 40 -lrb- _ a u _ 793 -rrb- -rrb- as a consequence while he be consul for the third time no tribune nor prætor dare to convene the senate for he have no colleague though this as some think be not intentional but the regular appointee die and no one else in so short a period of time as be available could be bring forward in the comitium to fill he place moreover the prætors who attend to the affair of the consul whenever the latter be out of town ought to have administer all business pend but at this period in order not to appear to have act for the emperor they perform none of they duty the senator in a body ascend the capitoline offer they sacrifice and do obeisance to the chair of gaius located in the temple furthermore accord to a custom prevail in the time of augustus they deposit money -lrb- 14 -rrb- make a show of give it to the emperor himself they practice be similar also in the following year at the time of the event just narrate they come together in the senate-house after these proceedings without any person have convene they but accomplished nothing waste the whole day in laudation of gaius and prayer in he behalf since they have no love for he nor any wish that he should survive they simulated both these feeling to all the greater extent as if hope in this way to disguise they real sentiment on the third day devote to prayer they come together in response to a announcement of a meeting make by all the prætors in a write notice : still they transact no business on this day nor again on the next until on the twelfth day word be bring that gaius have resign he office then at last the man who have be elect for subsequent service succeed to the position and administer the business that fall to they it be vote among other measure that the same honor should be give to the birthday of tiberius and of drusillum as to that of augustus the actor folk also celebrate a festival provide a spectacle and set up and dedicate image of gaius and drusillum -- this be in accordance with a letter of gaius whenever he wish any business bring up he communicate in write a small portion of it to all the senator but most of it to the consul and then sometimes order this to be read in the senate -- so much for the transaction of the senate -lrb- -25 - -rrb- meanwhile gaius send for ptolemæus the son of juba and on ascertain that he be wealthy put he to death and a number of other with he also when he reach the ocean and be to all appearance about to conduct a campaign in britain and have draw up all the soldier on the beach he embark on the trireme but after put out a little from the land he sail back again next he take he seat on a high platform and give he soldier the watchword as if for battle while the trumpeter urge they on all of a sudden however he order they to gather the shell have secure these spoil -lrb- you see he need booty for the celebration of he triumph -rrb- he become immensely elated assume that he have enslave the ocean itself and he give he soldier many present the shell he take back to rome for the purpose of exhibit the spoil to the people there as well the senate do not see how it could remain inactive in the face of this procedure inasmuch as it learn he be in a exalted frame of mind nor yet again how it could praise he for when anybody bestow great praise or extraordinary honor for a small success or none at all that person become suspect of make a mock and jest of the affair still for all that when gaius enter the city he come very near devote the whole senate to destruction because it have not vote he divine honor but he contented himself with assemble the populace upon whom he shower from a raise position quantity of silver and gold many perish in the effort to seize it for as some say he have mix small knife-blade in with the coin as a result of he adultery he repeatedly receive the title of imperator and germanicus and britannicus no less than if he have subdue gaul and britain entire since this be he manner of life he be destine inevitably to be plot against he be on the lookout for a attack and arrest anicius cerealius and he son sextus papinius whom he put to the torture and inasmuch as the former would not utter a word he persuade papinius -lrb- by promise he safety and immunity -rrb- to denounce certain person -lrb- whether truly or falsely -rrb- he then straightway put to death both cerealius and the rest before he very eye there be a betilienus bassus whom he have order kill and he compel capito the man 's father to be present at he son 's execution though capito be not guilty of any crime and have receive no court summons when the father enquire if he would allow he to shut he eye gaius order he to be slay likewise he find himself in danger pretend to have be one of the plotter and promise that he would disclose the name of all the rest and he name the companion of gaius and those who abet he licentiousness and cruelty he would have bring destruction upon many person have he not by lay further information against the prefect and callistus and cæsonia arouse distrust so he be put to death but this very act pave the way for the ruin of gaius for the emperor privately summon the prefect and callistus and say to they : i be but one and you be three and i be defenceless whereas you be arm : hence if you hate and desire to kill I slay I at once the general consequence be that he come to regard himself as a object of hatred and believe that they be vex at he behavior he harbor suspicion against they and wear a sword at he side when in the city and to forestall any harmony of action on they part he attempt to embroil they one with another by pretend to make a confidant of each one separately and talk to he about the rest until they obtain a notion of he design and leave he a prey to the conspirator the same emperor order the senate to convene and affect to grant its member amnesty say that there be only a very few against whom he still retain he anger this expression double the anxiety of each one of they for everybody be think of himself -lrb- -26 - -rrb- another person name protogene assist the emperor in all he project and carry continually on he person two book of which he call the one sword and the other dagger this protogene once enter the senate as if on some indifferent business and when all as be to be expect salute and greet he he dart a kind of sinister glance at scribonius proculus and say : do you too greet I though you hate the emperor so on hearing this all those present surround they fellow senator and tear he to piece and vote -lrb- some festival to gain as also -rrb- that the emperor should have a high platform in the senate-house to prevent any one 's approach he besides enjoy the use of a military guard even there -lrb- they resolve further that he statue should be guard pleased at this gaius lay aside he anger toward they and with a buoyant spirit promise they some money pomponius who be say to have plot against he he release inasmuch as he have be betray by a friend and as the man 's mistress when tortured would not utter a word he do she no further harm and even give she a honorary gift of money gaius be praise for this partly through fear and partly sincerely and -rrb- as some call he hero and other god he fairly go out of he head even before this he be in the habit of demand that he be give superhuman regard and say that he have intercourse with the moon goddess and be crown by victory he also pretend to be jupiter and take this as a pretext for have carnal knowledge of various woman especially he sister again he would often figure as -lrb- neptune because he have bridge so great a expanse of sea or perhaps as -rrb- juno and diana and venus -lrb- he would impersonate hercule bacchus apollo and all the other divinity not merely male but also female -rrb- as fast as he change the name he would assume all the rest of the attribute that belong to they -lrb- so that he might seem to resemble they -rrb- now he would be see in feminine guise hold a wine-cup and thyrsus again with masculine trappings he would carry a club and lion-skin : -lrb- or perhaps a helmet and shield -rrb- he would make up first with smooth chin and later on as a bearded man sometimes he wield a trident and on other occasion he brandish the thunderbolt he would array himself like a maiden equip for -lrb- hunting or -rrb- war and after a brief interval would come forth as a woman thus he could make change with careful attention to detail by the variety of he dress and by what he attach to or throw over it and he be anxious to appear to be anything rather than a human being -lrb- and a emperor -rrb- once a certain gaul espy he on a high platform transact business in the guise of jupiter laugh aloud gaius call to he and ask : what do i seem to you to be and the other answer -- i shall tell he exact word -- : a big pack of foolishness yet the man meet no dire fate for he be a shoemaker person of such rank as gaius can bear the frankness of the common herd more easily than that of those who hold high position -- now this be the attire he would assume whenever he pretend to be some god and there be suitable supplication prayer and sacrifice offer to it -lrb- -27 - -rrb- otherwise he usually appear in public in silk and triumphal dress very few be those whom he would kiss to most of the senator even he extend he hand or foot for homage consequently the man who be kiss by he thank he for it even in the senate though all might see he kiss dancer every day -lrb- and these divine honor pay he come not only from the many accustom at all time to flatter but from those who really pretend to be something -rrb- take the case of lucius vitellius not of low birth nor without sense a man who on the contrary have become famous by he governorship of syrium in addition to he other brilliant exploit as a official he spoil a plot of artabanus in that region he encounter the latter who have suffer no punishment for armenia already close to the euphrate and terrify he by he sudden appearance he then induce he to come to a conference and finally compel he to sacrifice to the image of augustus and gaius furthermore he make a peace with he that be advantageous for the roman and secure he child as hostage this vitellius then be summon by gaius to be put to death the complaint against he be the same as the parthian have against they king whom they expel jealousy make he the object of hatred and fear the object of plot -lrb- for every power stronger than himself gaius entertain hatred and he be suspicious of whatever be successful feeling sure that it would ultimately attack he -rrb- but vitellius save he life by somehow present himself in such a way as to appear of less importance than he reputation would lead one to expect he fall at the emperor 's foot shed tear of lamentation all the time salute he frequently as divine and pay he worship at last he vow that should he survive he would sacrifice to gaius by this behavior he so mollify the offended monarch and win he good-will that he not only manage to survive but come to be regard as one of he lord 's most intimate friend on one occasion gaius declare he be enjoy converse with the moon goddess and when he ask vitellius if he could see the goddess with he the other keep he eye fix on the ground as if overcome by amazement in a half whisper he answer : only you god master may behold one another -- so vitellius from these beginning later come to surpass all other in adulation -lrb- -28 - -rrb- -lrb- gaius give order that in miletus of the province of asia a certain tract of land should be set apart for he worship he avowed reason for choose this city be that diana have preempt ephesus augustus pergamum and tiberius smyrna the truth of the matter however be that he have conceive a desire to appropriate to he own use the large and extremely beautiful temple which the milesian be build to apollo thereupon he go to still greater length and build actually in rome itself one temple of he own that be accord he by vote of the senate and another at he private expense on the capitoline -rrb- he also plan a kind of dwelling on the capitol in order as he say that he might live in the same house with jupiter however he disdain take second place in this union of household and find fault with the god for occupy the capitol before he : accordingly he hasten to construct another temple on the palatine and by way of a statue for it think he should like to change that of olympian jove so as to resemble himself this he find impossible for the boat build to bring it be shatter by thunderbolt and loud laughter be plainly hear as often as any person approach the pedestal to take hold of it so after hurl threat at the obdurate image he set up a new one of himself -- the temple of the dioscurus in the roman forum he cut in two and make through it a approach to the palatine run right between the statue to the end -lrb- these be at all event he word -rrb- that he might have the dioscurus for gate-keeper assume the name of dialius -lrb- 15 -rrb- he attach cæsonia he wife claudius and other person who be very wealthy to he service as priest receive from each one two hundred and fifty myriad for this honor he also consecrate himself to he own service and appoint he horse a fellow-priest dainty and expensive bird be daily sacrifice to he he have a contrivance by which he defy the thunder with answer peal and could send return flash when it lighten likewise whenever a bolt fall he would in turn hurl a javelin at a rock repeat each time the word of homer : either lift I or i will thee -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- when thirty day after she marriage cæsonia bring forth a little daughter he pretend that this too have come about through supernatural means and give himself air on the fact that in so few day after become a husband he be a father he give the child the name of drusillum and take she up to the capitol place she on the knee of jupiter with the implication that she be he child and put she in charge of minerva to be suckle -rrb- this god then this jupiter -- -lrb- he be call by the latter name so much that it even find its way into document -- at the same time that all this take place be collect money in most shameful and most frightful way -rrb- one may to be sure -lrb- leave out of account the wares and the tavern the brothel -lrb- 17 -rrb- and the court the artisan and the wage-earning slave -rrb- and other such source from -lrb- every single one of -rrb- which he gather fund but how can one escape mention the room set apart in the very palace and the wife of the foremost man as well as the child of the most aristocratic family that he shut up in these room and foully abused spare absolutely no one in he greed for such victim meet with no resistance from some -lrb- who wish to avoid show any displeasure -rrb- but seize other quite against they will -lrb- yet these proceedings do not displease the mob very much but they rather delighted with he in he licentiousness and in the fact that -rrb- he also would throw himself on the heap of gold and silver collect from these person and roll in it -lrb- when however after enact severe law in regard to the tax he inscribe they in exceedingly small letter on a tablet which he then hang up aloft so as to make sure that it should be read as little as possible and that many through ignorance of what be bid or forbid should make themselves liable to the penalty thereof the people straightway run together excitedly into the hippodrome and raise fierce shout -rrb- once the people have come together in the hippodrome and be object to he conduct and he have they cut down by the soldier in this way he impose silence upon they all -lrb- ad 41 -lrb- a u 794 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -29 - -rrb- as he continue to show insanity in every way a plot be form against he by cassius chairea and cornelius sabinus though they be hold tribuneship in he pretorian guard a number be in the conspiracy and privy to what be be do among whom be callistus and the prefect practically all of he courtier be interested both in they own behalf and for the common good any who do not take part in the conspiracy still refuse to reveal it though they know of it and be glad to see a plot form against he but the man who actually kill gaius be those mention it be worth note besides that chairea be a old-fashioned sort of man and have a private cause for anger gaius be in the habit of nickname he sissy -lrb- though he be the hardiest of man -rrb- and whenever it come the turn of chairea to command would give he some such watchword as yearning or venus again a oracle have a short time before warn gaius to beware of cassius the former suppose that it have reference to gaius cassius governor of asia at the time because he be a descendant of that cassius who have slay cæsar have he bring as a prisoner the person whose future conduct the divinity be really indicate to the emperor however be this cassius chairea likewise a certain egyptian apollonius foretold in he native land what happen to he for this speech he be send to rome and be bring before the emperor the day on which the latter be destine to die he punishment be postpone till a little later and in this way he life be save the deed be do as follow : gaius be celebrate a festival in the palace and be attend to the production of a spectacle in the course of this he be himself both eating and drinking and be feast the rest of the company pomponius secundus consul at the time be take he fill of the food as he sit by the emperor 's foot and at the same time keep continually bend over to shower kiss upon they gaius himself decide that he want to dance and act as a tragedian the follower of chairea could endure it no longer as he go out of the theater to see the boy of most noble lineage whom he have import from greece and ionium to sing the hymn compose in he honor the conspirator wound he then intercept he in a narrow passage and kill he when he fall to the ground none of those present would keep he hand off he but they all savagely stab the lifeless corpse again and again some chew piece of he flesh he wife and daughter be immediately slay so gaius who accomplish all these exploit in three year nine month and twenty-eight day learn by actual experience that he be not a god now he be openly spurn by those who have be accustom to do he reverence even when absent he blood be spill by person who be wont to speak and to write of he as jove and god he statue and he image be drag from they pedestal for the people in particular retain a lively remembrance of the distress they have endure all the soldier in the germanic division raise a outcry and they remonstrance extend to the point of indulge in slaughter those who stand by remembered the word once speak by he to the populace : how i wish you have but one neck and make it plain to he that it be he who have but one neck whereas they have many hand and when the pretorian guard fill with consternation begin run about and demand who have slay gaius valerius asiaticus a ex-consul take a remarkable mode of bring they to they sens in that he climb up to a conspicuous place and cry out : i only wish i have kill he this alarm they so that they stop they outcry all such person as in any way acknowledge the authority of the senate obey they oath and become once more quiet -- while the overthrow of gaius be thus be accomplish the consul sentius and secundus forthwith transfer the fund from the treasure-chamber to the capitol they station most of the senator and plenty of soldier as guard over it to prevent any plunder be do by the populace so these man in company with the prefect and the circle of sabinus and chairea deliberate as to what should be do -lrb- footnote 1 : emend by boissevain from the four of the m -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : boissevain restore the m ten in place of the twelve of robert estienne -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : compare

the senate on the capitol where many diverse opinion be utter some favor a democracy some a monarchy some be for choose this man and other that therefore they spend the rest of the day and the whole night without accomplish anything meanwhile some soldier who have enter the palace for the purpose of make spoil of something or other find claudius hide away in a dark corner he be attend gaius when the latter come out of the theater and at this time through fear of the confusion have crouch down out of the way at first the man think that he be some one else and perhaps have something worth take drag he out afterwards on recognize he they hail he as emperor and conduct he to the camp then in company with they comrade they deliver to he the entire power of government inasmuch as he be of the imperial race and be regard as suitable in spite of he shrink and remonstrance the more he attempt to avoid the honor and to resist the more do the soldier in turn insist upon not accept a emperor from other but upon they own right to establish such a sovereign over the entire world hence with a show of reluctance he yield the consul for a time send tribune and other forbid he to assume any such authority and to submit to the jurisdiction of the people and the senate and the law but when they attendant soldier leave they in the lurch then finally they too yield and vote he all the remain privilege pertain to sole rulership -lrb- -2 - -rrb- so it be that tiberius claudius nero germanicus the son of drusus child of livium obtain the imperial power without have be previously test at all in any position of authority save only that he have be consul he be fifty year of age in mental development he be by no means inferior have be through a sufficient education to do a little history write but physically he be frail and he head and hand shake a little hence he voice be also falter and he do not himself read all the measure that he introduce before the senate but would give they to the quæstor to read -- though at first at least he be regularly present whatever he do read in person he generally recite sit down he be the first of the roman too to employ a covered chair -- which have lead to the present custom which prescribe that not only the emperor be carry in chair but we ex-consul as well before this time augustus tiberius and some other use to be carry sometimes in litter such as woman even at the present day affect these infirmity however be not the cause of nearly so much trouble to he as be the freedman and woman with whom he associate for more conspicuously than any of he peer he be rule by slave and by woman from a child he have be rear with careful nursing and in the midst of terror and have for that reason feign simplicity to a greater extent than be really true this fact he himself admit in the senate : and as he have live for a long time with he grandmother livium and for another long period with he mother antonium and again with libertus and moreover have have several amours with woman he have acquire no quality become a freeman but although ruler of all the roman and they subject he be himself nothing more nor less than a slave they would take advantage of he particularly when he be incline to drink and sexual intercourse for in both these direction he be quite insatiable and on such occasion be exceedingly easy to master moreover he be afflict by cowardice which frequently rouse in he so great alarm that he could not calculate anything as he ought they anticipate this fail of he too and it be no inconsiderable help toward get the better of he by frightening he half to death they would reap great benefit and in other people they inspire so much fear that -- to give a epitome of the situation -- once when a number be on the same day invite to dinner by claudius and again by he dependent the guest neglect he on some indifferent pretext and present themselves at the feast of he companion -lrb- -3 - -rrb- though generally speak he be the sort of character describe still he perform not a few valuable service whenever he be free from the influence mention and be master of himself i shall take up he act in detail all honor vote to he he immediately accept except the title father and this he afterward take : yet he do not at once enter the senate but delay as late as the thirtieth day the fact that he have see gaius perish as he do and now learn that some other candidate presumably superior to himself have be propose for emperor by the senatorial body make he a little timid therefore he exercise great caution at all point and cause all man and woman who approach he to be search for fear they might have a dagger at banquet he make sure there be some soldier present -- a custom which set by he continue to this day that of invariable search be bring to a end by vespasian he put to death chairea and some other in spite of he pleasure at the death of gaius in other word he look far ahead to ensure he own safety and be not so much grateful to the man for have by he deed enable he to get the empire as he be displeased at the idea of any one assassinate a emperor he act in this matter not as a avenger of gaius but as one who have catch a person plot against himself as a sequel to this murder sabinus also die by he own hand not choose to survive after he comrade have be execute as for all other citizen who have openly show they eagerness for a democracy or have be regard as eligible for the supreme power claudius so far from bear malice toward they give they honor and office in plainer term than any ruler that ever live he promise they immunity -- therein imitate the example of the athenian -lrb- 1 -rrb- as he say -- and it be no mere promise but he afford it in fact he abolish complaint of maiestas alike for thing write and thing do and punish no one on any such charge for either earlier or later offence he invent no complaint for the sake of persecute those who have wrong or insult he when he be a private citizen and there be many who have do this particularly as he be deem of no importance and to please either tiberius or gaius if however he find they guilty of some other crime he would take vengeance on they also for they former abuse -lrb- -4 - -rrb- the tax introduce in the reign of gaius and whatever other measure have lead to denunciation of the latter 's act be do away with by claudius not all at once but as opportunity offer he also bring back such person as gaius have unjustly exile -- among other the latter 's sister agrippina and julium -- and restore to they they property of those imprison -- and a very great number be in this predicament -- he liberate such as be suffer for maiesta or any similar complaint but real criminal he punish he investigate the case very carefully in order that those who have commit crime should not be release on account of the victim of blackmail nor yet the latter be ruin on account of the former nearly every day either in company with the entire senate or alone he would sit on a platform try case generally in the forum but occasionally elsewhere in fact he renew the custom of have man sit as he colleague which have be abandon ever since tiberius withdraw to the island very often he join the consul and the prætors and especially those have charge of the finances in they investigation and some few matter he turn over entirely to the various court he destroy the poison -lrb- which be find in great variety among the effect of gaius -rrb- and the book of protogene -lrb- who be put to death -rrb- together with the document which gaius pretended to have burn but which be actually find in the imperial archive he show to the senator and give they to the latter to the very man who have write they no less than to those against whom they have be write to read : afterward he burn they up yet when the senate manifest a desire to dishonor gaius he personally prevent such a measure from be vote but on he own responsibility cause all of he predecessor 's image to disappear by night hence the name of gaius do not occur in the list of emperor whom we mention in oath and prayer any more than that of tiberius neither of they however suffer any official disgrace -lrb- -5 - -rrb- accordingly the unjust institution set up by gaius and by other on he account claudius overturn to drusus he father and antonium he mother he offer horse-race on they birthday put off to different day the festival which would occur on the same date in order that there should not be two celebration at once he grandmother livium be not only honor by equestrian contest but be deify and he set up a statue to she in the temple of augustus charge the vestal virgin with the duty of offer sacrifice in proper form he also order that woman should use she name in take oath though he pay such reverence to he ancestor he himself would accept nothing beyond the name pertain to he office on the first day of August to be sure -- he birthday -- there be equestrian contest but not on he account : it be because the temple of mar have be dedicate on that day which have consequently be distinguish thereafter by annual contest beside moderation in this respect he further forbid any one 's worship he or offer he any sacrifice he check the many excessive acclamation accord he and he accept only one image -- of silver -- and two statue of bronze and stone that have be vote to he at the start all such expenditure he declare be useless and furthermore inflict great loss and great annoyance upon the city all the temple and all the rest of the public work have be fill with statue and votive offering so that he say he should have to make it a matter of think what to do with they he forbid the prætors ' give gladiatorial game and ordain that any one else who superintend they in any place whatsoever should not allow to be write or report the statement that such game be be hold for the emperor 's preservation he become so use to settle all these matter by consider the merit of each case rather than accord to the dictate of custom that he adopt the same attitude toward other department of life for instance when this year he betroth one of he daughter to lucius junius silanus and give the other in marriage to gnæus pompeius magnus he do nothing out of the common to commemorate the occasion but attend the court in person on those day and convene the senate as usual he order he son-in-law temporarily to hold office among the vigintus virus and later to act as prefect of the city at the feriæ after a long interval he give they the right to stand for the other office five year sooner than be customary gaius have despoil this pompeius of he title _ magnus _ and come very near killing he because he be so name yet out of contempt for he since he be still but a boy he do not go to such extreme and merely abolish the offend epithet say that it be not safe for any one to be call magnus claudius now restore to he this title and give he he daughter to wife -lrb- -6 - -rrb- these be certainly commendable action in addition when at one time in the senate the consul come down from they seat to talk with he he rise in turn and go to meet they in naple he live entirely like a private citizen he and he associate while there adopt the greek manner of life invariably at the musical entertainment he would wear cloak and military boot and at the gymnastic exercise a purple robe and golden crown he action moreover in regard to money be remarkable for he forbid any one to bring he contribution as have be customary in the reign of augustus and of gaius and he refuse to allow any person to name he as heir if such person possess any relative whatever indeed the fund that have be confiscate by government order during the period of tiberius and gaius he give back either to the victim themselves if they still survive or otherwise to they child it have be the custom -lrb- 2 -rrb- that if any slightest detail be carry out contrary to precedent on the occasion of the game these should be give over again as i have state but since such occasion be frequent occur a third fourth fifth and sometimes tenth time and this partly by accident but generally by intention on the part of those benefit by these happening he enact a law that on only one day should the equestrian contest take place a second time in fact however he usually abrogate this privilege also the schemer henceforth easily avoid fall into irregularity as they gain very little by so do in the matter of the jew who have again increase so greatly that by reason of they multitude it would have be hard without raise a tumult to bar they from the city he decide not to drive they out but order they to follow that mode of life prescribe by they ancestral custom and not to assemble in number -- the club institute by gaius he disband -- also see that there be no use in forbid the populace to do certain thing unless they daily life should be reorganize he abolish the tavern where they be wont to gather and drink and command that no dress meat nor warm water -lrb- 3 -rrb- should be sell some who disobey this ordinance be punish he restore to the various city the statue which gaius be in the habit of require they to send restore also to the dioscurus they temple and to pompey the right of name the theater on the stage-building of the latter he inscribe also the name of tiberius because that emperor have rebuild the structure when it be burn he own name he have chisel there likewise -lrb- not because he have rear it but because he have dedicate it -rrb- but on no other part of the edifice likewise he do not wear the triumphal garb the entire time of the game though permission be vote to he but appear in it merely to offer sacrifice the rest of the festival he superintend in the purple-bordered garment -lrb- -7 - -rrb- he introduce in the orchestra among other knight and woman who be he peer who have be accustom in the reign of gaius so to appear regularly the reason be not that he like they performance but that he want a proof of they past behavior certainly none of they be again marshal on the stage during the era of claudius the pyrrhic dance which the boy send for by gaius be practice they be allow to perform once be honor with citizenship for it and be then dismiss other in turn choose from among the retinue then give exhibition -- this be what take place in theatrical circle in the hippodrome twelve camel and horse have one contest and three hundred bear together with a equal number of libyan beast be slaughter previous to this time the different class in attendance have watch the spectacle each from its own special location -- senator knight and populace thus it have come to be a regular practice yet no definite position have be assign to they -lrb- -8 - -rrb- it be at this time that claudius mark off the space which still belong to the senate and furthermore he allow those senator who choose to view the sight somewhere else and even in citizen 's dress after this he banquet the senator and they wife the knight and likewise the tribe next he restore commagene to antiochus for gaius though he have himself give he the district have take it away again and mithridate the iberian whom gaius have summon only to imprison he send home again to resume he sovereignty to another mithridate a lineal descendant of mithridate the great he grant bosporus give to polemon some land in cilicium in place of it he enlarged the domain of agrippa of palestine -lrb- who happen to be in rome have help he become emperor -rrb- and bestow on he consular honor to the latter 's brother herod he give pretorial dignity and some authority they be allow to enter the senate and to express they thanks to he in greek -- now these be the act of claudius himself and they be laud by all but certain other deed be do at this time of a entirely different nature by he freedman and by he wife valerium messalina she become enraged at she niece julium because the latter neither pay she honor nor flattered she and she be also jealous because the girl be extremely beautiful and have be the only one to enjoy the favor of claudius several time accordingly she have she banish by bring against she among other complaint that of adultery -lrb- for which annius seneca be also exile -rrb- and after a while she succeed in procure julium 's death as for the freedman it be they who persuade claudius to accept triumphal honor for he deed in mauretanium though he have not be successful and have not yet attain imperial power when the end of the war come this same year however sulpicius galba overcome the chattus and publius gabinius conquer the cauchus -lrb- 4 -rrb- beside win fame in other way for instance he recover a military eagle the only one leave among the enemy from the catastrophe of varus through the exploit of both of these man claudius receive a title of imperator that have some foundation in fact -lrb- ad 42 -lrb- _ a u _ 795 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -9 - -rrb- the next year the same moor be again subdue in fight with he suetonius paulinus one of the ex-prætors overrun they country as far as the atlantic gnæus hosidius geta one of the peer make a subsequent campaign advance at once against they general salabus and conquer he two separate time and when the latter after leave a few soldier near the frontier to hold back any who might pursue take refuge in the sandy part of the country geta venture to follow he first station a part of he army opposite the hostile detachment that be await he he provide himself with as much water as be feasible and push forward when this supply give out and no more could be find he be catch in a exceedingly unpleasant position the barbarian especially since through habit they can endure thirst a exceedingly long time and through knowledge of the country can always get _ some _ water have no trouble in maintain themselves the roman for the opposite reason find it impossible to advance and difficult to withdraw while geta be in a dilemma as to what he should do one of the native who be at peace with the invader persuade he to make use of incantation and enchantment tell he that as a result of such procedure abundant water have frequently be grant they no sooner have he take this advice than so much rain burst from heaven as to allay the soldier ' thirst entirely beside scare the enemy who think the god be assist the roman consequently they come to term voluntarily and end they warfare -- after these event claudius divide the moor who be in subjection into two district namely the country about tengi and that about cæsarea these city give they name to the whole region and he appoint two knight as governor at this same period certain part of numidium also be involve in warfare by neighbor barbarian and when the latter have be conquer return to a state of repose -lrb- -10 - -rrb- the office of consul claudius hold in conjunction with gaius largus he allow the latter to continue consul for a whole year but as for himself he remain a magistrate only two month at this time he have the rest swear to the deed of augustus and be himself swear but in regard to he own deed he allow no such procedure on the part of any one on leave the office he take the oath again like other people this be always he practice every time he be consul about this period certain speech of augustus and tiberius be be read accord to decree on the first of the month and when they have keep the senator busy till evening he end the reading declare that it be sufficient for they to be engrave on tablet some prætors who be entrust with the administration of the fund have incur charge he do not take legal measure against they but make the round of those who sell goods and let building and correct whatever he deem to be abuse this he do also on numerous other occasion -- there be likewise peculiarity in the appointment of the prætors for they number be now fourteen or eighteen or somewhere between just as it happen -- beside this action with reference to the finances he establish a board of three ex-prætors to collect debt owe the government grant they lictor and the usual force of assistant -lrb- -11 - -rrb- on the occasion of a severe famine he consider the problem of abundant provision not only for that particular crisis but for all succeed time practically all food use by the roman be import and yet the region near the mouth of the tiber have no safe landing-place nor suitable harbor so that they mastery of the sea be render useless save for such staple as be bring in during they season and store in warehouse nothing from abroad could be have in the winter season and if any one risk a voyage he be almost sure to meet with disaster be cognizant of these fact claudius undertake to build a harbor and would not be turn aside though the architect on he enquire how great the expense would be reply : you do not want to do this so sure be they that the great disbursement necessary would cause he to rein in he ambition if he should learn beforehand the exact amount he however desire a work worthy of the dignity and greatness of rome and he bring it to a successful conclusion in the first place he excavate a very considerable piece of land construct quay on all side of it and let the sea into it next in the sea itself he heap huge mound on both side of the entrance to this place -- mound that enclose a large body of water between these breakwater he rear a island and plant on it a tower with a beacon light -- this harbor then still so call in local parlance be create by he at this period he have another project to make a outlet into the liri from lake fucina in the marsian country to the end that the land around it might be till and the river be render more navigable but the expenditure be all to no purpose he make a number of law most of which i have no need to mention but here be some of the regulation that he introduce he have the governor who be choose by lot set out before the first day of April for it be they habit to delay a long time in the city and he would not permit those choose by election to express any thanks to he in the senate -- this have be a kind of custom with they -- but he say : these person ought not to thank I as if they be so eager for office but i they because they cheerfully help I bear the burden of government : and if they acquit themselves well in office i shall praise they still more such man as by reason of insufficient means be not able to be senator he allow to ask permission to retire and he admit some of the knight to tribuneship : the rest of they without exception he force to attend the senate as often as notice be send they he be so severe upon those who be remiss in this matter that some kill themselves -lrb- -12 - -rrb- in other respects he be sociable and considerate in he dealings with they he would visit they when sick and be a partner in they merrymaking a certain tribune beat a slave of he in public but claudius do the offender himself no harm only deprive he of he assistant and these he restore not long afterward another of he slave be send to the forum and severely scourge because he have insult a prominent man in the senate the emperor would himself regularly rise in case the rest have be stand for a long time on account of he ill health as i related he frequently remain seat and read he advice if ask for it he allow lucius sullum to sit on the prætors ' bench because this man be unable by reason of age to hear anything from he own seat have stand up the day on which a year previous he have be declare emperor he do nothing unusual except to give the pretorian twenty-five denarius and this he continue to do every year thereafter some of the prætors however of they own free will and not by any decree publicly celebrate that day and also the birthday of messalina not all of they do this but as many as choose this show what freedom they have you may see how really moderate claudius be in all such matter from the fact that when a son be bear to he -- call at that time claudius tiberius germanicus but later also _ britannicus _ -- he do not make the occasion in any way conspicuous and would not allow he to be name augustus nor messalina augusta -lrb- -13 - -rrb- he be constantly arrange gladiatorial game take a degree of pleasure in they that arouse criticism very few beast be destroy but a great many human being some of whom fight with one another whereas other be devour by animal the emperor hate vehemently the free slave who in the reign of tiberius and gaius have conspire against they master as well as those who extort blackmail from people or have bear false witness against any person the majority of these he get rid of in the manner mention though some of they he punish by other method a great many he deliver up to the vengeance of they master so great do the number become of those who die a public death that the statue of augustus erect on the scene be turn to face in another direction both to prevent its be think that _ he _ be view the slaughter and to avoid have the statue always cover up for this act claudius be well laugh at when people reflect how he sate himself with the sight that he do not think proper for even the inanimate bronze to behold it might be note particularly that he use to delight greatly even at lunch time in watch those who be incidentally cut down in the middle of the spectacle yet a lion that have be train to eat man and on this account greatly please the crowd he order kill on the principle that it be not fitting for roman to gaze on such a sight he receive abundant praise however for appear in the people 's midst at the spectacle for give they all they want and for he employ a herald so very little and announce most event by notice write on board -lrb- -14 - -rrb- after he have become accustomed then to feast he fill on blood and slaughter he have recourse more readily to other kind of killing the cæsarians and messalina be really responsible for this whenever they desire to obtain any one 's death they would terrify he with the result that they would be allow to do everything they choose often when in a moment of sudden alarm he momentary terror have lead he to order some one 's death afterward when he recover and come to he sens he would search for the man and on learn what have happen would be grieve and repent he begin this series of slaughter with gaius appius silanus this man who be of very noble family and at the time be governor of spain he have send for pretend that he want to see he about something have marry he to messalina 's mother and have for some time hold he in honor among he dearest and closest friend then he suddenly kill he the reason be that silanus have offend messalina the most abandon and lustful of woman in refuse to lie with she and by the slight show the empress have alienate narcissus the emperor 's freedman as they have no true charge to bring against he nor even one that would be believe narcissus invent a dream in which he declare he have see claudius murder by the hand of silanus so just before dawn while the emperor be still in bed he come all of a tremble to tell he the dream and messalina by expatiate on it make it worse thus silanus perish just because of a vision -lrb- -15 - -rrb- after the latter 's death the roman at once lose confidence in claudius and annius vinicianus with some other form a plot against he the chief conspirator have be one of those propose at the death of gaius for the imperial office and it be partly fear inspire by this fact that cause he to rebel as he possess no considerable force however he send to furius camillus scribonianus governor of dalmatium who have a large body of native and foreign troops camillus who be incline to the project of he own accord be induce to revolt at the same time particularly because he have be speak of for emperor when so much have be accomplish many senator and knight join the rank of annius they do he no good however -lrb- 5 -rrb- for the soldier because camillus proffer they the name of _ populus _ and promise that he would restore to they they ancient freedom suspect that they should have trouble and change of government again and would therefore no longer obey he then in terror he flee from they and come to the island issa he there meet a voluntary death claudius for a time be quite cow with fear and be ready at a demand from camillus to withdraw from he sovereignty voluntarily later he recover courage and reward he soldier among other method by have the citizen legion -lrb- the seventh and the eleventh -rrb- name the claudian and the faithful and the pious by the senate itself then he make reprisal upon those who have plot against he and on this charge put many to death among they a prætor who first have to resign he office number of whom vinicianus be one committed suicide for messalina and narcissus and all the latter 's fellow freedman seize this opportunity to wreak they direst vengeance they employ slave and libertus for instance and informer against they own master these master and other of undoubted nobility foreigner and citizen alike not only plebeian but some of the knight and senator be put to the torture in spite of the fact that claudius at the very beginning of he reign have swear not to torture any free citizen -lrb- -16 - -rrb- many man therefore at this time and many woman incur punishment some of the latter meet they fate right in the prison and when they be to die be actually lead in chain upon a scaffold like captive and they body like those of other be throw down the scalæ gemoniæ of those who be execute outside the prison only the head be exhibit in that place some of the most guilty nevertheless either through favoritism or by the use of money save they neck with the help of messalina and of the cæsarians follow narcissus all the child of those who perish be grant immunity and some receive money trial be hold in the senate-house in the presence of claudius he prefect and he freedman with a consul on each side he make he report to the senator while seat upon a chair of state or on a bench next he himself go to he accustomed seat and chair be set for he escort this same program be follow also at the other most important function it be at this time that a certain galæsus a freedman of camillus be bring into the senate and talk with the utmost frankness on a variety of subject the following remark of he be worth instance narcissus have take the floor and say to he : what would you have do galæsus if camillus have become monarch he reply : i should have stand behind he and say nothing so he become famous for this speech and arrium for something quite different the latter who be wife of cæcina pætus refuse to live after he have be put to death although be on very intimate term with messalina she might have occupy a position of some honor moreover when she husband show cowardice she strengthen he resolution she take the sword and give herself a wound then hand it to he say : see pætus i feel no pain -- these two person then be accord praise for by reason of the long succession of woe matter have now come to such a pass that excellence no longer mean anything else than die nobly the attitude of claudius in bring destruction upon they and other be indicate by he forever give to the soldier as a watchword this verse about its be necessary in one 's first anger to ward off the foe -lrb- 6 -rrb- he keep throw out many other hint of that sort in greek both to they and to the senate with the result that those who could understand any of they laugh at he these be some of the happening of that period -- and the tribune at the death of one of they number themselves convene the senate for the purpose of appoint a tribune to succeed he -- this in spite of the fact that the consul be accessible -lrb- ad 43 -lrb- _ a u _ 796 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -17 - -rrb- when claudius now become consul again -- it be the third time -- he put a end to many sacrifice and many feast day for as the greater part of the year be give up to they no small damage be do to public business beside curtail the number of these he retrench in all the other way that he could what have be give away by gaius without any justice or reason he demand back from the recipient but he give back to the road commissioner all that he predecessor have exact in fine on account of corbulo moreover he give notice to magistrate choose by lot since they be even now slow about leave the city that they must commence they journey before the middle of April come he reduce to servitude the lycian who rise in revolt have slay some roman and merge they in the prefecture of pamphylium during the investigation which be conduct in the senate-house he put a question in the latin tongue to one of the envoy who have originally be a lycian but have be make a roman as the man do not understand what be say he take away he citizenship say that it be not proper for a person to be a roman who have no knowledge of roman speech a great many other person unworthy of citizenship be exclude from its privilege whereas he grant it to some quite without restriction either individual or large body of man and inasmuch as practically everywhere roman be esteem above foreigner many seek the franchise by personal application to the emperor and many buy it from messalina and the cæsarians for this reason though the right be at first barter only for great sum it later be so cheapen by the facility with which it could be obtain that it come to be say that if a person only give a man some broken glassware he might become a citizen this behavior then subject the emperor to no end of jest but he receive praise for such action as the follow many person be all the time become object of blackmail some because they do not use claudius 's proper title and other because they be go to leave he nothing when they die -- the blackmailer assert that it be necessary for those who obtain citizenship from he to do both of these thing the emperor now step in and forbid that any one should be call to account for such negligence -- now messalina and he freedman keep offer for sale and peddle out not merely the franchise and military post and position as procurator and governmental office but everything in general to such a extent that all necessaries grow scarce -lrb- 7 -rrb- and claudius be force to muster the populace on the campus martius and there from a platform to ordain what the price of wares should be claudius himself wear a chlamy give a contest of armed man at the camp he son 's birthday be observe voluntarily by the prætors with a kind of spectacle that they produce and with dinner this be once afterward repeat too -- at least by all of they that choose -lrb- -18 - -rrb- meanwhile messalina be exhibit she own licentious tendency and be force the other woman of she circle to show themselves equally unchaste many of they she cause to commit adultery in the very palace while they husband be present and observe what take place such man she love and cherish and crown with honor and office : but other who would not submit to this humiliation she hate and bring to destruction in every possible way these deed however though of such a character and carry on so openly for a long while never come to the notice of claudius messalina give he some attractive housemaid for bedfellow and intercept those who be able to afford he any information -- some by kindness and some by punishment thus at this period she succeed in put out of the way catonius justus captain of the pretorian guard before he could carry out he intention of tell the emperor something about these doings and become jealous of julium daughter of drusus son of tiberius and later wife of nero germanicus just as she have be of the other julium she compass she death -- it be about then also that one of the knight on the charge of have conspire against claudius be hurl down the capitoline by the tribune and the consul -lrb- -19 - -rrb- at the same time that these event be happen in the city aulus plautius a senator of great renown make a campaign against britain the cause be that a certain bericus who have be eject from the island during a revolution have persuade claudius to send a body of troops there this plautius after he be make general have difficulty in lead he army beyond gaul the soldier object on the ground that they operation be to take place outside the limit of the known world and would not yield he obedience until the arrival of narcissus send by claudius who mount the tribunal of plautius and try to address they this make they more irritated than ever and they would not allow the newcomer to say a word but all suddenly shout together the well-known phrase : ho ho the saturnalia -lrb- for at the festival of saturn slave celebrate the occasion by don they master ' dress -rrb- after this they at once follow plautius voluntarily but they delay have bring the expedition late in the season three division be make in order that they might not be hinder in advance -lrb- as might happen to a single force -rrb- and some of they in they voyage across become discourage because they be buffet into a backward course whereas other acquire confidence from the fact that a flash of light start from the east shot across to the west the direction in which they be sail so they come to anchor on the shore of the island and find no one to oppose they the briton as a result of they inquiry have not expect that they would come and have therefore not assemble beforehand nor even at this time would they come into closer conflict with the invader but take refuge in the swamp and in the forest hope to exhaust they opponent in some other way so that the latter as in the day of julius cæsar would sail back empty-handed -lrb- -20 - -rrb- plautius accordingly have considerable trouble in search for they -- they be not free and independent but be parcel out among various king -- when at last he do find they he conquer first caratacus and next togodumnus child of cynobelinus who be dead after the flight of those king he attach by treaty a portion of the bodunnus rule by a nation of the catuellani leave a garrison there he advance farther on reach a certain river which the barbarian think the roman would not be able to cross without a bridge -- a conviction which lead they to encamp in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank -- he send ahead celtæ who be accustom to swim easily in full armor across the most turbulent stream these fall unexpectedly upon the enemy but instead of shooting at any of the man confine themselves to wound the horse that draw they chariot and consequently in the confusion not even the mount warrior could save themselves plautius send across also fiavius vespasian who afterward obtain the imperial office and he brother sabinus a lieutenant of he so they likewise get over the river in some way and kill number of the foe who be not aware of they approach the survivor however do not take to flight and on the next day join issue with they again the two force be rather evenly match until gnæus hosidius geta at the risk of be capture manage to conquer the barbarian in such a way that he receive triumphal honor without have ever be consul thence the briton retire to the river thame at a point near where it empty into the ocean and the latter 's flood-tide form a lake this they cross easily because they know where the firm ground in this locality and the easy passage be but the roman in follow they up come to grief at this spot however when the celtæ swam across again and some other have traverse a bridge a little way up stream they assail the barbarian from many side at once and cut down large number of they in pursue the remainder incautiously they get into swamp from which it be not easy to make one 's way out and in this way lose many man -lrb- -21 - -rrb- shortly after togodumnus perish but the briton so far from yield stand together all the more closely to avenge he death because of this fact and he previous mishap plautius become alarmed and instead of advance farther proceed to guard what he have already gain and send for claudius he have be notify to do this in case he meet with any particularly stubborn resistance and a large reinforcement for the army consist partly of elephant have be assemble in advance when the message reach he claudius entrust domestic affair -lrb- include the management of the soldier -rrb- to he colleague vitellius whom he have cause to become consul like himself for the entire six month ' period and start himself on the expedition he sail down the river to ostium and from there follow the coast to massilium thence advance partly by land and partly along the water course he come to the ocean and cross over to britain where he join the legion that be wait for he near the thame take charge of these he cross the stream and encounter the barbarian who have gather at he approach he defeat they in a pitched battle and capture camulodunum

with he in the procession triumphal honor and this not merely to the ex-consul for he be accustom to do that most lavishly on other occasion and with the slightest excuse upon rufrius pollio the prefect he bestow a image and a seat in the senatorial body as often as he would enter that assembly with he and to avoid have it think that he be make any innovation he declare that augustus have do this in the case of a certain valerius a ligurian he also increase the dignity of laco -lrb- formerly præfectus vigilum but now procurator of the gaul -rrb- by this same mark of esteem and in addition

in the course of the spectacle he would frequently absent himself while other superintend it in he place he have announce as many horse-race as could find place in a day but they amount to not more than ten altogether for between the separate course bear be slaughter and athlete struggle boy send for from asia also execute the pyrrhic dance the performer in the theater give with the consent of the senate another festival likewise intend to commemorate the victory all this be do on account of the success in britain and to the end that other nation might more readily capitulate it be vote that all the agreement which claudius or the lieutenant represent he should make with any people should be bind the same as if sanction by the senate and the people -lrb- -24 - -rrb- achæa and macedonium which ever since tiberius become emperor have belong to elect governor claudius now return to the choice by lot and abolish the office of prætor charge with the administration of fund he put the business in the hand of quæstors as it have be of old and these be not annual magistrate as be the case with they previously and with the prætors subsequently but the same two man attend to they duty for three entire year some of these secure a prætorship immediately afterward and other draw a salary the amount of which depend on the impression of efficiency they have create while in office the quæstors then be give charge of the treasury in place of governorship in italy outside of the city for he do away with all of the latter to compensate the prætors he entrust to they care several kind of judicial case which the consul be previously accustom to try those serve as soldier since by law they could not have wife be grant the privilege of married man marcus julius cottius receive a increase in he ancestral domain -lrb- which include the alp name after he -rrb- and be now for the first time call king the rhodians be deprive of they liberty because they have impale certain roman and umbonius silio governor of bætica be summon and eject from the senate because he have send so little grain to the soldier then serve in mauretanium at least this be the accusation bring against he in reality it be not so at all but he treatment be due to he have offend some of the freedman so he bring together all he furniture considerable in amount and very beautiful in the auction room as if he be go to call for bid on all of it : but he sell only he senatorial dress by this he show that he have receive no deadly blow and could enjoy life as a private citizen -- beside these event of the time the weekly market be transfer to a different day because of some religious rite that happen too on many other occasion -lrb- ad 45 _ -lrb- a u _ 798 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -25 - -rrb- following year marcus vinicius for the second and statilius corvinus for the first time enter upon the office of consul claudius himself take all the customary oath in detail but prevent the rest from take oath separately accordingly as in earlier time one man who be a prætor and second who be a tribune and one each of the other official repeat the oath for those of the same grade this custom be follow for several year now since the city be become fill with number of image -- for those who wish might without restriction appear in public in a painting or in bronze or stone -- he have most of those already exist set somewhere else and for the future forbid that any private citizen be allow to follow the practice unless the senate should grant permission or except he have build or repair some public work such person and they relative might have they likeness set up in the place in question have banish the governor of a certain province for venality the emperor confiscate to public use all the extra fund that the man have gather in office again to prevent these person elude those who wish to bring they to trial he would give to nobody one office immediately after another this have be the custom in earlier day also to the end that any one without difficulty might institute a suit against they in the intervene period indeed those whose term have expire and who be grant leave of absence from the city might not even take these absence in succession since it be intend that if official should be guilty of any irregularity they should not gain the further benefit of escape investigation by either continuous office or continuous absence the custom have however fall out of use so carefully do claudius guard against both possibility that he would not without out some delay allow even a official who be he colleague to be choose by lot for the governorship of a province that would naturally belong to he still he allow some of they to govern for two year and sometimes he would send elect magistrate person who prefer a request to leave italy for a time be give permission by claudius himself without action of the senate yet in order to appear to be do it under some form of law he order that a decree to the effect be issue vote of this sort be also pass the following year at the time under consideration he arrange the votive festival which he have promise in commemoration of he campaign to the populace support by public dole he give seventy-five denarius in every case and in some case more so that for a few it amount to three hundred twelve and a half he do not however distribute all of it in person but he son-in-law also take part because the distribution last several day and he be anxious to use they in hold court in the case of the saturnalia he put back the fifth day which have be appoint by gaius but be later abolish -lrb- -26 - -rrb- and inasmuch as the sun be to undergo a eclipse on he birthday he fear that some disturbance might result -- for already certain other portent have occur -- and therefore he give notice beforehand not only that there would be a eclipse and when and for how long but also the reason for which this would necessarily take place they be as follow : the moon which revolve lower down than the sun -lrb- or so it be believe -rrb- either directly below he or perhaps with mercury and likewise venus intervene have a longitudinal movement just like he and a higher and lower movement just like he but furthermore a latitudinal movement such as nowhere belong to the sun under any circumstance when therefore she get in a direct line with he over we head and pass under he blaze then she obscure he beam that extend toward the earth for some to a greater for some to a less degree but do not conceal he presence for even the briefest moment for since the sun have a light of he own he can never surrender it and consequently when the moon be not directly in people 's way so as to throw a shadow over he he always appear entire this then be what happen to the sun and it be make public by claudius at the time mention with regard to the moon however -- for it be not irrelevant to speak of lunar phenomenon also since once i have broach this subject -- as often as she get directly opposite the sun -lrb- and she only take such a position with reference to he at full moon whereas he take it with reference to she at the season of new moon -rrb- a conical shadow fall upon the earth this occur whenever in she motion to and from we she revolution take she between the sun and the earth then she be deprive of the sun 's light and appear by herself just as she really be such be the condition of the case -lrb- ad 46 -lrb- a u 799 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -27 - -rrb- at the close of that year valerius asiaticus for the second time and also marcus silanus become consul the latter held office for the period for which he be elect asiaticus however though elect to serve for the whole year -lrb- as be do in other case -rrb- fail to do so and resign voluntarily some other have do this though mostly by reason of poverty the expense connect with the horse-race have greatly increase for generally there be a series of twenty-four contest but asiaticus withdraw simply by reason of he wealth which also prove he destruction inasmuch as he be extremely well-to-do and by be consul a second time have arouse the dislike and jealousy of many he desire in a way to overthrow himself feel that by so do he would be less likely to encounter danger still he be deceive -- vinicius on the other hand suffer no harm from claudius for though he be a illustrious man he manage by keep quiet and mind he own business to preserve he life but he perish by poison administer by messalina she suspect that he have kill he wife julium and be angry because he refuse to have intercourse with she he be duly accord a public funeral and eulogy -- a honor which have be grant to many asinius gallus half-brother of drusus by the same mother conspire against claudius but instead of be put to death be banish the reason perhaps be that he make ready no army and collect no fund in advance but be embolden merely by he extreme folly which lead he to think that the roman would submit to have he rule they on account of he family but the chief cause be that he be a very small and unshapely person and be therefore hold in contempt incur ridicule rather than danger -lrb- -28 - -rrb- the people be truly loud in praise of claudius for he moderation and also by jupiter at the fact that he show displeasure when a certain man seek the aid of the tribune against the person who have free he ask and secure thus a helper in he cause both the man in question and those associate with he in the proceedings be punish and the emperor further forbid render assistance to person in this way against they former master on pain of be deprive of the right to bring suit against other per contra people be vex at see he so much the slave of he wife and freedman this feeling be especially mark on a occasion when claudius himself and all the rest be anxious to kill sabinus -lrb- former governor of the celtæ in the reign of gain -rrb- in a gladiatorial fight but the latter approach messalina and she save he they be also irritated at she have withdraw mnester from the theater and keep he with she but whenever any talk about he not dance spring up among the people claudius would appear surprised and make various apology take oath that he be not at he house the populace believe he to be really ignorant of what be go on be grieve to think that he alone be not cognizant of what be be do in the imperial apartment -- behavior so conspicuous that news of it have already travel to the enemy they be unwilling however to reveal to he the state of affair partly through awe of messalina and partly to spare mnester for he please the people as much by he skill as he do the empress by he beauty with he ability in dancing he combine great cleverness of repartee so that once when the crowd with mighty enthusiasm beg he to perform a famous pantomime he dare to come to the front of the stage and say : to do this friend i may not try oreste ' bedfellow be i this then be the relation of claudius to these matter as the number of lawsuit be now beyond reckoning and person summon would now no longer put in a appearance because they expect to be defeat he give write notice that by a give day he should decide the case against they by default so that they would lose it even if absent and there be no deviation from this rule mithridate king of the iberian -lrb- 8 -rrb- undertake to rebel and be engage in preparation for a war against the roman he mother however oppose he and since she could not win he over by persuasion determine to take to flight : he then become anxious to conceal he project and so while himself continue preparation he send he brother coty on a embassy to convey a friendly message to claudius but coty prove a treacherous ambassador and tell the emperor all and he be make king of iberium in place of mithridate -lrb- ad 47 -lrb- a u 800 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -29 - -rrb- the following

majority of whom be not sorry to be drive out but willingly stand aside on account of they poverty likewise he bring in a number to fill they place among these he summon with haste one surdinius gallus qualify to be a senator who have emigrate to carthage and say to he : i will bind you with golden fetter gallus therefore fetter by he rank remain at home although claudius visit dire punishment upon the freedman of other in case he catch they in any crime he be very lenient with he own one day a actor in the theater utter this well-worn saying : a knave who prosper scarce can be endure -lrb- 9 -rrb- whereupon the whole assemblage look at polybius the emperor 's freedman he undismay shout out : the same poet however say : -- ` who once be goatherd now have royal power ' -lrb- 9 -rrb- and suffer no harm for he behavior information be lay that some person be plot against claudius but in the majority of instance he pay no attention say : it do not do to adopt the same defensive tactic against a flea as against a beast of prey asiaticus however be try before he and come very near be acquit he enter a general denial declare : i have no knowledge of nor acquaintance with any of these person who be testify against I then the soldier who state he have be a associate of he be ask which one asiaticus be point out a baldheaded man that happen to be stand near he baldness be the only thing of which he be sure about asiaticus this event occasion much laughter and claudius be on the point of free he when vitellius to please messalina make the statement that he have be send for by the prisoner who request the privilege of decide the manner of death to be visit upon he hear this claudius believe that on account of a guilty conscience asiaticus have really condemn himself and accordingly have he execute among many other who be calumniate by messalina he put to death asiaticus and likewise magnus he son-in-law asiaticus have property and the family of

only to the follow exclamation : -- how fortunate be those who become prætors in the day of old he imply that the latter have be permit to exhibit they prowess without danger whereas he progress have be block by the emperor on account of jealousy yet even so he obtain a triumph be again entrust with a army he train it no less thoroughly and as the nation be at peace he have the man dig a trench

divide the ruling power among themselves : callistus who have be give charge of the record of value narcissus who preside over the letter and hence wear a dagger at he belt and palla to whom the administration of fund have be entrust -lrb- -31 - -rrb- messalina as if it do not satisfy she to play the adulteress and harlot -- for besides she usual shameful behavior she sometimes carry on a regular brothel in the palace serve as a prostitute herself and compelling woman of highest rank to do the same -- now conceive a desire to have many husband that be with the legal title -lrb- and she would have enter upon a legal contract with all those who enjoy she favor have she not be detect and destroy in she very first attempt for a time all the cæesarians be on good term with she and

down to ostium to inspect the grain supply and she be leave behind in rome on the pretext of be ill she get up a banquet of no little renown and carry on a most licentious revel then narcissus have get claudius alone convey to he through the medium of concubine information of all that be take place -lrb- and by frightening he with the idea that messalina be go to kill he also and set up silius as emperor in he place he persuade he to arrest and torture several person -rrb- the moment this be do the emperor hasten back in person to the city and enter just as he be he put to death mnester

and for this reason he execute silanus feeling that he be plot against he -rrb- -lrb- yet silanus be regard as a upright man and be honor by claudius to the extent of receive triumphal honor while still a boy be betroth to the emperor 's daughter octavium and become prætor long before the age ordain he be allow to give the festival that fall to he lot at the expense of claudius and during it the latter ask some favor of he as if he be himself the mere head of some party -lrb- 12 -rrb- and utter any shout that he see other people wish he to utter yet in spite of all this claudius have become such a slave to the woman that on they account he kill both he son-in-law -rrb- on the heel of this occurrence vitellius come forward in the senate with a declaration that the good of the state require claudius to marry he indicate agrippina as a suitable person in this emergency and suggest that they force he to the marriage then the senator rise and come to claudius and compel he to marry they also pass a decree permit roman to wed they niece a union formerly prohibit -lrb- -32 - -rrb- as soon as agrippina have become settle in the palace she gain complete control of claudius for she

claudius conceive a wish to have a naval battle in a certain lake -lrb- 13 -rrb- so after build a wooden wall around it and set up bench he gather a enormous multitude claudius and nero be array in military costume agrippina wear a beautiful chlamy weave with gold and the rest of the people whatever please they fancy those who be to take part in this sea-fight be condemn criminal and each side have fifty ship one party be call rhodian and the other sicilian first they draw close together and after unite at one spot they address claudius in this fashion : salve imperator moriturus salutamus -lrb- 14 -rrb- since this afford they no salvation and they be still order to fight they use simple smashing tactic and take very good care not to harm each other this go on until they be cut down by outside force -lrb- somewhat later the fucinian lake cave in and narcissus be severely criticise for it he preside over the undertaking and it be think that after spend a great deal less than he have receive -lrb- 15 -rrb- he have then purposely contrived the collapse in order that he villainy might go undetected -rrb- -lrb- ad 52-53 -rrb- about narcissus there be a story of how openly he use to make sport of claudius one day when the latter be hold court the bithynian raise a great outcry against junius cilo they governor because as they assert he have take very considerable bribe claudius not understand on account of they noise ask the bystander what they be say thereupon instead of tell he the truth narcissus say : they be express they gratitude to junius claudius believe he rejoin : why he shall have charge of they two year more agrippina often attend she husband in public when he be transact ordinary business or when he be hear ambassador she sit upon a separate platform this be surely one of the most remarkable sight of the time on one occasion when a certain orator julius gallicus be plead a case claudius grow vex and order that he be cast into the tiber near the bank of which he chance to be hold court domitius afer who as a advocate have the greatest ability of he contemporary make a very neat joke on this a man whom gallicus have disappoint come to domitius for assistance whereupon the latter say to he : and who tell you i could swim better than he can later claudius fall sick and nero enter the senate to promise a horse-race in case claudius should regain he health agrippina be leave no stone unturn to make he popular with the mass and to cause he to be regard as the only natural successor to the imperial throne hence it be that she select the equestrian contest on which they dote especially for nero to promise in the event of claudius 's recovery -lrb- a outcome against which she sincerely pray -rrb- -- again after instigate a riot over the sale of bread she persuade claudius to make know to the populace by public bulletin and to write to the senate that if he should die nero be fully capable of administer public interest in consequence of this he become a power and he name be on everybody 's lip whereas in regard to britannicus number do not know of he existence and all other regard he as idiotic and epileptic for this be the declaration that agrippina give out -- well claudius become convalescent and nero conduct the horse-race in a sumptuous manner now too he marry octavium a new circumstance to cause he a feeling of manly dignity -lrb- ad 53-54 -rrb- nothing seem to satisfy agrippina though all rights which livia have possess be bestow upon she also and a number of additional honor have be decree she wield equal power with claudius desire to have he title outright and once when a blaze have spread over the city to a considerable distance she accompany he in the work of rescue -lrb- ad 54 -lrb- a u 807 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- -34 - -rrb- claudius be irritated by agrippina 's action of which he now begin to become aware and seek to find he son britannicus the boy however be purposely keep out of he sight by the empress most of the time for she be do everything conceivable to secure the right of succession for nero since he be she own son by she former husband domitius claudius who display he affection whenever he meet britannicus be not dispose to endure she behavior and make preparation to put a end to she power to register he son among the iuvene and appoint he as heir to the empire this news alarmed agrippina who decide to anticipate the emperor 's project by poisoning he since however by reason of the great quantity of wine he be forever drinking and he general habit of life which all emperor adopt for they protection he could not easily be harm she send for a drug-woman name lucusta a recent captive renown for the desire skill and obtain from she a poison whose effect be sure she put it in one of the vegetable call -lrb- 16 -rrb- mushroom then she herself eat of the other in the dish but make she husband eat the one which have the poison for it be the largest and finest of they the victim of this plot be carry out of the banquet apparently quite overcome by strong drink but that have happen many time before during the night the poison take effect and he pass away without have be able to say or hear a word it be the thirteenth of October and he have live sixty-three year two month and thirteen day have be emperor thirteen year eight month and twenty day agrippina 's rapid vengeance have be aid by the fact that before she attempt she have despatch narcissus to campanium feign that he need to take the water there for he gout have he be present she would never have do the deed such extreme care do he take of he master he death follow hard upon that of claudius and he leave behind he a reputation for power unequaled by any man of that age he property amount to more than ten thousand myriad and city and king be dependent upon he even when he be on the point of be slay he manage to execute a brilliant coup he have charge of the correspondence of claudius and have in he possession letter contain secret information against agrippina and other : all of these he burn before he death and he be slay beside the tomb of messalina -- a coincidence manifestly intend by chance to satisfy she vengeance -lrb- -35 - -rrb- in such fashion do claudius meet he end it seem that indication of this event be give in advance by the comet star which be see over a wide expanse of territory by the shower of blood by the bolt that descend upon the standard of the pretorian by the opening of its own accord of the temple of jupiter victor by the
