with firelight and electric light and merry with the laughter and talk of people who be try to decide a great and momentous question for the benefit of those who be not acquaint with patty fairfield and she relative it may be well to say that mr elliott be patty 's aunt alice at whose home patty and she father be now visit of the other member of the elliott family uncle charley grandma marian and frank be present and these with mr fairfield and patty be debate a no less important subject than the location of patty 's future home you know papa say patty you say that if i want to live in vernondale you would buy a house here and i do want to live here -- at least i be almost sure i do oh patty say marian why be not you quite sure you be president of the club and the girl be all so fond of you and you be get along so well in school i do not see where else you could want to live i know say frank patty want to live in new york she soul yearn for the gay and giddy throng and the hall of dazzling light ` ah patricia beware the rapid be below you ' as it say in that thrilling tale in the third reader i think papa would rather live in new york say patty look very undecided i 'll tell you what we 'll do exclaimed frank let 's debate the question a regular honest debate i mean and we 'll have all the argument for and against clearly state and ably discuss uncle fred shall be the judge and he decision must be final no say mr fairfield we 'll have the debate but patty must be the judge she be the one most interested and i be ready to give she a home wherever she want it in greenland 's icy mountain or indium 's coral strand if she choose you certainly be a disinterested member say uncle charley laughing but that will not do in debate here i 'll organise this thing and for the present we will not consider either greenland or indium the question as i understand it be between vernondale and new york now to bring this mighty matter properly before the house i will put it in the form of a resolution thus : resolve that miss patty fairfield shall take up she permanent abode in new york city patty give a little cry of dismay and marian exclaim oh father that be not fair of course it be fair say mr elliott with a twinkle in he eye it do not really mean she be go but it be the only way to find out what she be go to do now fred shall be captain on the affirmative side and i will take the negative we will each choose we colleague fred you may begin all right say mr fairfield as a matter of social etiquette i think it right to compliment my hostess so i choose mr elliott on my side oh you choose I father cry marian do choose I owe to certain insidious wire-pulling i be force to choose miss marian elliott say uncle charley pinch he daughter 's ear if one mr elliott be a good thing say mr fairfield i be sure two would be better and so i choose grandma elliott to add to my collection of great mind frank my son say uncle charley do not think for a moment that i be choose you merely because you be the last of the mohican far from it i have want you from the beginning and i be proud to impress you noble intellect in my cause thank you sir say frank and if we side can not induce patty to stay in vernondale it will not be for lack of good strong argument forcibly present modest boy say he mother you seem quite to forget you wise and clever opponent in great glee the debater take they place on either side of the library table while patty be judge be escort with much ceremony to a seat at the head a old parlour-croquet mallet be find for she with which she rap on the table after the manner of a grave and dignified chairman the meeting will please come to order she say and the secretary will please read the minute of the last meeting the secretary regret to report say frank rise that the minute of the last meeting fall down the well although rescue they be afterward chew up by the puppy and be at present somewhat illegible if the honorable judge will excuse the reading of the minute the secretary will be greatly oblige the minute be excuse say patty and we will proceed at once to more important business mr frederick fairfield we shall be glad to hear from you mr fairfield rise and say you honor lady and gentleman : i would be glad to speak definitely on this burn question but the truth be i do not know myself which way i want it to be decide for you see my only desire in the matter be that the wise and honorable judge whom we see before we should have a home of such a character and in such a place as best please she but before she make she decision i hope she will allow herself to be thoroughly convince as to what will please she and as by force of circumstance i be oblige to uphold the new york side of this argument i will now set forth some of its advantage feel sure that my worthy opponent be quite able to uphold the vernondale side hear hear exclaimed frank but patty rap with she mallet and command silence then mr fairfield go on : for one thing patty have always live in a city and like myself be accustom to city life it be more congenial to both of we and i sometimes fear we should miss certain city privilege which may not be find in a suburban town but we have other thing that you can not get in the city break in marian and i be very sure that they will be enthusiastically enumerate when it be you turn to speak say mr fairfield smile the gentleman have the floor remark patty the other will please keep they seat proceed mr fairfield so mr fairfield proceed : other advantage perhaps will be find in the superior school which the city be say to contain i be make no allusion to the school that we honorable judge be at present attend but i be speak merely on general principle and not only school but master of the various art i have be lead to believe by the assertion of some people who however may be prejudice that miss fairfield have a voice which require only training and practice to rival the voice of adelina pattus when that lady be miss fairfield 's age quite true say the judge nod gravely at the speaker this phenomenal voice then might -- mind i say might -- be cultivate to better purpose by metropolitan teacher we have a fine singing-master here exclaim frank but patty rap he to silence what be one singing-master among a voice like miss fairfield 's demand the speaker and another thing he continue that ought to affect you vernondale people very strongly be the fact that you would have a delightful place to visit in new york city now do not deny it you know you would be glad to come and visit patty and I in we brown-stone mansion and we would take you around to see all the sight from grant 's tomb to the aquarium we have see those murmured frank they be still there say mr fairfield and there will probably be some other and newer entertainment that you have not yet see it do sound nice say frank and finally go on mr fairfield though i do not wish this argument to have undue weight it certainly would be more convenient for I to live in the city i be about to start in business there and though i could go in and out every day as the honorable gentleman on the other side of the table do yet he be accustom to it and as i be not it seem to I a uninteresting performance however i dare say i could get use to a commutation ticket and i be certainly willing to try all of which be respectfully submit and with a bow the speaker resume he seat that be a very nice speech say the judge approvingly and now we would be please to hear from the captain gentleman on the other side uncle charley rise without wish to be discourteous he say i must say that i think the argument just set forth be exceedingly flimsy there can be no question but that vernondale would be a far better and more appropriate home for the young lady in question than any other spot on the globe here we have wide street green lawn fresh air and bright sunshine all conducive to that bloom state of health which we honorable judge now apparently enjoy city life would doubtless soon reduce she to a thin pale peaked specimen of humanity unrecognisable by she friend the rose-colour in she cheek would turn to ashen gray she starry eye would become dim and lustreless she robust flesh would dwindle to skin and bone and probably she hair would all fall out and she would have to wear a wig even patty 's mallet be not able to check the burst of laughter cause by the horrible picture which uncle charley draw but after it have subside he continue : as to the wonderful master and teacher in the city far be it from I to deny they greatness and power but the beautiful village of vernondale be less than a hour from new york no mosquito no malaria boat bathing and fishing miss fairfield could therefore go to new york for she instruction in the various art and science and return again to she vernondale home on a local train add to this the fact that here she have relative friend and acquaintance who already know and love she while in new york she would have to acquire a whole new set probably have to advertise for they as to the commute gentleman : before he first ticket be all punch up he would be ready to vow that the commuter 's life be the only ideal existence have thus offer unattackable argument i deem a decision in we favor a foregone conclusion and i take pleasure in sit down a very successful speech say patty smile at she uncle we will now be please to hear from the next speaker on the affirmative side mr charle elliott will you kindly speak what be on you mind i will say mr elliott with a nod of she head that betoken fairfield decision of character i will say exactly what be on my mind without regard to which side i be on oh that be not fair cry patty a debate be a debate you know and you must make up opinion for you own side whether you think they or not very well say aunt alice smile a little then it be thoroughly understand that i be not speak the truth i will say that i think it better for patty to live in new york as she father will be away all day at he business she will enjoy the loneliness of a big brown-stone city house she will enjoy the dark room and the entire absence of grass and flower and tree which she hate anyway instead of picnic and boat party she can go to stiff and formal afternoon tea and instead of attend she young people 's club here she can become a member of the society of social economics with a air of have accomplish she intention aunt alice sit down amid great cheer and handclapping from the opposite side patty look a little sober as she begin to think the vernondale home would win and though for many reason she wish it would be so yet at the same time she realize very strongly the attraction of life in new york city however she only say : the meeting will please come to order in order to listen to the opinion of miss elliott marian rise with great dignity and address the chair and the lady and gentleman with true parliamentary punctiliousness though personally interested in this matter she begin it be not my intention to allow my own wish or prejudice to blind I to the best interest of we young friend who be now under discussion far be it from I to blight she career for the benefit of my own unworthy self but i will say that if patty fairfield go to live in new york or anywhere except vernondale i think she be just the horridest meanest old thing on the face of the earth why i would not _ let _ she go i would lock she in she room and poke bread and water to she through the keyhole if she dare to think of such a thing go to new york indeed a nice time she would have hang on strap in the trolley-car and get run over by automobile the whole thing be so perfectly absurd that there be no earthly chance of its ever come to pass why she _ would not _ go she could not be _ hire _ to go she would not be happy there a minute but if she _ do _ go i 'll go too chapter ii the decision hooray for we side cry frank as marian drop into a chair after she outburst of enthusiasm oh i have not finish yet say marian jump up again i want to remark further that not only be patty go to live in vernondale but she be go to have a house very near this one i have pick it out and marian wag she head with the air of a mysterious sibyl i will not tell you where it be just yet but it be a lovely house and big enough to accommodate uncle fred and patty and a guest or two besides i have select the room that i prefer and i hope you will furnish it in blue the speaker be a bit hasty say patty as marian sit down again we can not furnish any room before this debate be conclude and though we deeply regret it miss elliott will be oblige to wait for she blue room until the other speaker have have they speak but patty smile at marian understandingly and begin to have a very attractive mental picture of she cousin 's blue room next she own the next speaker announce the judge will be mr elliott senior -- the dowager duchess you grace we would be please to hear from you i do not know say grandma elliott look rather seriously into the smile face before she that i be entirely in favor of the country home i think we patty would greatly enjoy the city atmosphere she be a schoolgirl now but in a year or two she will be a young woman and one well deserving of the best that can be give to she i be city-bred myself and though at my age i prefer the quiet of the country yet for a young girl i well know the charm of a city life of course we would all regret the loss of we patty who have grow to be a part of we daily life but nevertheless be i to vote on this matter i should unhesitatingly cast my ballot in favor of new york bravo for grandma cry frank give I a lady who fearlessly speak she mind even in the face of overwhelming opposition all the same i have not speak my piece yet and i believe it be now my turn it be say patty and we eagerly await you sapient and authoritative remark ahem say frank pompously as he arise my remark shall be brief but very much to the point patty 's home must be in vernondale because we live here if ever we go to live in new york or oshkosh or kalamazoo patty can pick up she thing and go along just get that idea firmly fix in you head my friend where we live patty life whither she goeth we goeth therefore if patty should go to new york the elliott will take up bag and baggage sell the farm and go likewise to new york now i be sure we patty be of proper common-sense and sound judgment would not put the elliott family to such inconvenience -- for move be a large and fearsome proposition thus we see that as the mountain insist on follow mahomet whithersoever she goest the only decently polite thing for mahomet to do be to settle in vernondale i regret exceedingly that i be force to express a opinion so diametrically oppose to the advice of she grace the dowager duchess but i be quite sure she do not realize what a bother it would be for the elliott to move and now have convince you all to my way of think i will leave the case in the hand of we wise and competent judge wait say uncle charley i believe the captain be usually allow a sort of summing-up speech be they not they be in this case anyway say patty mr elliott will please go ahead with he summing-up well say uncle charley the sum of the whole matter seem to be that we all want fred and patty to live here because we want they to but of course it be only fair that they consult they own wish in the matter and if they conclude that they prefer new york why -- we 'll have another debate that be all uncle charley sit down and mr fairfield rise i have listen with great interest to the somewhat flattering remark of my esteemed fellow member and have come to the conclusion that if agreeable to she judgeship a compromise might be effect it would seem to I that if a decision should be arrive at for the vernondale home the fairfield could manage to reap some few of those mysterious advantage say to be find in city life by go to new york and stay a few month every winter this too would give they a opportunity to receive visit from the elliott family which would i be sure be a pleasure and profit to all concern with this suggestion i be quite ready to hear a positive and final decision from she honor the judge and it will not take she long to make up she mind either cry patty i know you would fix it somehow papa you be the best and wisest man solomon be not in it with you nor solon nor socrate nor anybody that arrangement be exactly what i choose and suit I perfectly i do want to stay in new york sometimes but i would much rather live in vernondale so the judge hereby announce that on the merit of the case the question be decide in the negative the fairfield will buy a house in vernondale and the judge hope that they will buy it quick three cheer for patty and uncle fred cry frank and while they be be give with a will marian fly to the telephone and when the cheer subside she be engage in a conversation of which the debate club hear only one side be this you elsie what do you think patty 's go to stay in vernondale yes indeed perfectly gorgeous just this evening just now i guess i be i be so glad i do not know what to do oh yes of course she 'll keep on be president no they have not decide yet but i want they to take the bigelow house yes would not it be fine oh it be not very late well come over early to-morrow morning then good-by elsie morri be delighted say marian as she hang up the receiver and polly steven will just dance jig of joy when she hear about it i would call she up now only i be afraid she would break the telephone try to express she enthusiasm she flutter so you can tell she about it to-morrow say frank and now let 's talk about where the house shall be would you rather buy or build uncle fred perhaps it would be better to rent say mr fairfield suppose my fickle daughter should change she mind and after a visit in the city decide that she prefer it for she home i be not fickle papa say patty and it be all arrange all right just as it be but i do not want a rent house they will not let you drive tack in the wall or anything like that let 's buy a house and then if you turn fickle and want to move away we can sell it again all right say mr fairfield obligingly what house shall we buy i know just the one cry marian guess where it be would you by any chance refer to the bigelow house inquire frank politely how do you know exclaimed marian i only hear to-day that it be for sale and i want to surprise you well next time you have a surprise in store for we say frank do not announce it to elsie morri over the telephone oh do you hear that as a rule sister dear unless you be the matron of a deaf and dumb asylum you must expect those present to hear you end of a telephone conversation of course say marian i do not think but really would not the bigelow house be fine only a few block away from here and such a lovely house with a barn and a conservatory and a little arbor in the garden patty begin to look frightened goodness gracious I she exclaim i do not believe i realize what i be come to i could take care of the little arbor in the garden but i wonder if i could manage a house and a barn and a conservatory and go to school every day besides say she father laugh i think my child that at least until you school day be over we will engage the service of a responsible housekeeper oh papa cry patty in dismay you say i could keep house for you and aunt alice have teach I lot about it and she 'll teach I lot more and you know i can make good pumpkin pie and of course i can dust and fly ` round and that be about all there be to housekeeping anyway oh patty say aunt alice my lesson must have fall on stony ground if you think that be all there be to housekeeping that be merely a figure of speech aunt alice reply patty you well know i be a thoroughly capable and experienced housekeeper honest steady good-tempered and with a fine reference from my last place you be certainly a clever little housekeeper for you age say she aunt but i be not sure you could keep house successfully and go to school and practice you music and attend to you club all at the same time but i would not do they all at the same time aunt alice i would have a time for everything and everything in it place i would go to school and practice and housekeep and club all in they proper proportion -- here patty glance at she father you see if i have the proportion right all would go well well perhaps say mr fairfield if we have a competent cook and a tidy little waitress we could get along without a professional housekeeper i admit i have hope to have patty keep house for I and preside at my table and at any rate it would do no harm to try it as a experiment then if it fail we could make some other arrangement i guess i do want to sit at the head of we table papa say patty i would just like to see a housekeeper there a prim sour-faced old lady with a black silk dress and dangling ear-ring no i thank you if i have my way i will keep that house myself and when i get into any trouble i will fly to aunt alice for rest and refreshment we 'll all help say marian i 'll make lovely sofa-pillow for you and i be sure grandma will knit you a afghan that be not much towards housekeeping say frank i 'll come over next summer and swing you hammock for you and put up you tennis-net and meantime say uncle charley until the house be buy and furnish the fairfield family will be the welcome guest of the elliott it be almost the middle of December now and i do not think miss patty fairfield that you 'll get you home settle in time to make a visit in new york _ this _ winter and now you rattle-pated youngster run to bed while i discuss some plan sensibly with my brother-in-law and fellow townsman chapter iii the tea club well i should think you would better stay in vernondale patty fairfield if you know what be good for yourself why if you have attempt to leave this town we would have mob you with tar and feather or whatever those dreadful thing be that they do to the most awful criminal oh if i have go polly i should have take this club with I of course i be so use to it now i be sure i could not live a day and know that we should meet no more as the arab remark to he beautiful horse it would be rather fun to be transport bodily to new york as a club but i would want to be transport home again after the meeting say helen preston why should not we do that cry florence douglass it would be lot of fun for the whole club to go to new york some day together i be so glad patty be go to stay with we i do not care what we do say ethel holme who be draw picture on patty 's white shirt-waist cuff as a mark of affection i be glad too say patty and ethel you kitten be perfectly lovely but this be my last clean shirt-waist and those pencil-mark be awfully hard to wash out i do not mean they to be wash out say ethel calmly go on with she art work they be not wash drawing they be permanent decoration for you cuff and be offer as a token of deep regard and esteem the tea club be hold a Saturday afternoon meeting at polly steven 's house and the conversation as yet have not stray far from the all-engrossing subject of patty 's future plan the tea club have begin its existence with lofty and noble aim in a literary direction to be supplement and assist by a occasional social cup of tea but if you have have any experience with merry healthy young girl of about sixteen you will not be surprise to learn that the literary element have softly and suddenly vanish away much after the manner of a boojum then somehow the social interest grow stronger and the tea element hold its own and the result be a most satisfactory club if not a instructive one but as polly steven have say we be instruct all day long in school and a good deal out of school too for that matter and what we need most be absolutely foolish recreation the foolisher the better and so the Saturday afternoon meeting have develop into merely merry frolic with a cup of tea which be often a figure of speech for chocolate or lemonade at the close there be no rule and the girl take pleasure in call themselves unruly member there be no due and consequently no occasion for a secretary or treasure patty continue to be call the president but the title mean nothing more than the fact that she be really a chief favorite among the girl no one be bind or even expect to attend the meeting unless she choose but as a rule a large majority of the club be present and so to-day in the library at polly steven 's house nine member of the tea club be chatter like nine large and enthusiastic magpie now we can go on with the entertainment say lillian desmond as she sit on the arm of patty 's chair curl wisp of the presidential hair over she finger if patty have go away i should have resign my part in the show and go into a convent where be you go to live patty i do not know i be sure we have not select a house yet and if we do not find one we like papa may build one though i believe marian have one all pick out for we yes i have say marian it be the bigelow house on we street i do want to keep patty near we the bigelow house why that be too large for two people patty and mr fairfield would get lose in it now i know a much nicer one there be a little house next-door to we a lovely little cottage that would suit you a lot better tell you father about it patty it be for sale or rent and it be just the dearest place why laura russell cry marian that little snip of a house it would not hold patty let alone uncle fred you only propose it because you want patty to live next-door to you yes that be it say laura quite unabashed i know it be too little but you could add ell and bay-window and wing and thing and then it would be big enough would it hold the tea club say patty i must have room for they you know oh will not it be fun to have the tea club at patty 's house cry elsie i have not think of that what be a home without a tea club say patty i shall select the house with a eye single to the glory and comfort of you girl then i know of a lovely house say christine converse it be awfully big and it be pretty old but i guess it could be fix up i mean the old warner place good gracious cry ethel ` way out there and it be nothing but a tumble-down old barn anyhow oh i think it be lovely and it be colonial or revolutionary or something historic and they be go to put the trolley out there this spring -- my father say so it be a nice old house say patty and it could be make awfully pretty and quaint i can see it now in my mind 's eye with dimity curtain at the window and rose grow over the porch i hope you will never see those dimity curtain anywhere but in you mind 's eye say marian it be a heathenish old place and anyway it be too far away from we house papa say i can have a pony and cart say patty and i could drive over every day a pony and cart exclaim helen preston will not that be perfectly lovely i have always want one of my own and shall you have man-servant and maid-servant oh patty you never could run a big establishment like that you 'll have to have a housekeeper i be go to try it say patty laugh it will be a experiment and of course i shall make lot of blunder at first but i think it be a pity if a girl nearly sixteen year old can not keep house for she own father so do i say laura and anyhow if you get into any dilemma we 'll all come over and help you out the girl laugh at this for laura russell be a giddy little feather-head and could not have keep house for ten minute to save she life much good it would do patty to have the tea club help she keep house say florence douglass but we 'll all make she lovely thing to go to housekeeping with i shall be real sensible and make she sweeping-cap and ironing-holder oh i can beat that for sensibleness cry ethel holme i read about it the other day and it be a broom-bag i have not a idea what it be for but i 'll find out and i 'll make one one 's no good say marian sagely make she a dozen while you be about it oh do they come by dozen say ethel in a awestruck voice well i guess i will not make they then i 'll make she something pretty a pincushion all over lace and pin ribbon or something like that that will be lovely say laura i shall embroider she a tablecloth you 'll never finish it say patty who well know how soon laura 's burst of enthusiasm spend themselves you would better decide on a doily better a doily do than a tablecloth but begin oh i 'll tell you-what we can do girl say polly steven let 's make patty a tea-cloth and we 'll each write we name on it and then embroider it you know lovely cry christine just the thing who 'll hemstitch it i will not i 'll embroider my name all right but i hate to hemstitch i 'll hemstitch it say elsie morri i do beautiful hemstitching so do i say helen preston let I do half ethel and i hemstitch like bird say lillian desmond let 's each do a side -- there 'll be four side i suppose well the tea-cloth seem in a fair way to get hemstitch say patty you can put a double row around it if you like and i 'll be awfully glad to have it i 'll use it the first Saturday afternoon after i get settle i wish i know where you be go to live say ethel i would like to have a correct mental picture of that first Saturday afternoon it be a beautiful day for walk say polly steven let 's all go out and take a look at the warner place something tell I that you 'll decide to live there i hope something else will tell you differently soon say marian for i 'll never give my consent to that arrangement however i would just as lieve walk out there if only to convince you what a forlorn old place it be come on let 's go then we can be back in a hour and have tea afterwards i 'll get the key from mr martin as we go by like a bombard army the tea club storm the old warner house and once inside its colonial portal they make the old wall ring with they laughter the wide hall be dark and gloomy until elsie morri fling open the door at the other end and let in the December sunshine seek no farther she cry dramatically we have cross the rubicon and find the golden fleece this be the place of all other for we tea club meeting and it do not matter what the rest of the house may be like patty you will kindly consider the matter settle i 'll consider anything you like say patty and before breakfast too if you 'll only hurry up and get out of this damp musty old place i be shiver myself to piece oh it be not cold say laura russell and while we be here let 's go through the house yes say marian examine it carefully lest some of its numerous advantage should escape you notice observe the hardwood floor the magnificent mahogany stair-rail and the lofty ceiling the old floor be creaky worm-eaten and dusty the stair-rail be in a most dilapidated condition and the ceiling be low and smoky so marian score she point but it be antique say ethel holme with the air of a auctioneer ah lady what would you have it be a fine specimen of the colonial empire period pick out here and there with queen anne the mantel ah -- the mantel be dream in marble nightmare in paint wood you mean say lillian but so roomy and expansive go on ethel and the wall-papers note the fine stage of complete dilapidation leave by the move finger of time the wall-papers be all right say patty they look as if they would peel off easily come on upstairs the chamber be large low and rambling and the house in its best day must have be a interesting specimen of its type but after a short investigation patty be as firmly convince as marian that its charm could not offset its drawback i have see enough of this moated grange cry patty come on girl we be go back to tea right straight smack off there be no please some folk grumble ethel here be a ancestral pile only wait for somebody to ancestralise it you could make it one of the historic home of vernondale and you will not even consider it for a minute i 'll consider it for a minute say patty if that will do you any good but not a bit longer and as the minute be nearly up i move we start chapter iv boxley hall after consultation with various real estate agent and after due consideration of the desirable house they have to offer mr fairfield come to the conclusion that the bigelow house which marian have suggest be perhaps the most attractive of any and so one afternoon a party of very interested people go over to look at it the procession be head by patty and marian follow by mr fairfield and aunt alice while frank and he father bring up the rear but as they be go out of the elliott ' front gate laura russell come fly across the street where be all you people go she cry i know you be go to look at a house which one the bigelow house say marian and i be almost sure uncle fred will decide to take it come on with we we be go all through it no say laura look disappointed i do not want to go and i do not want the fairfield to live in that house anyway if they would only look at that little cottage next-door to we i know they would like it ever so much better oh please mr fairfield will not you come over and look at it now it be so pretty and cunning and it have the loveliest garden and chicken-coop and everything i do not want a chicken-coop say patty laughing i have no chicken and i do not want any we chicken be over there most of the time say laura then of course we ought to have a coop to keep we neighbor ' chicken in say mr fairfield and if this cottage be as delightful as miss russell make it out i think it be we duty at least to go and look at it if the rest of you be willing suppose we go over there first and then if we _ should _ decide not to take it we 'll have time to investigate the bigelow afterward marian look so woe-begone that patty laugh cheer up girl she say there be not one chance in a million of we take that doll 's house but laura will never give we a minute 's peace until we go and look at it so we may as well go now and get it over all right say marian and patty with she two girl friend on either side of she start in the direction of the cottage but when they reach it mr fairfield exclaim in amazement that little house he say oh i see that be the chicken-coop you speak of well where be the house this be the house say laura but somehow it do look smaller than usual still it be a great deal bigger inside no doubt say frank i have often notice that the inside of a house be much larger than the outside of course we can not all go in at once but i be willing to wait my turn who will go first very well you may stay outside say laura i think the rest of we can all squeeze in at once if we try but frank follow the rest of the party and pass through the narrow hall they enter the tiny parlor i never be in such a crowded room say marian i can scarcely get my breath i have no idea there be so many of we well you be not go to live here say laura there be room enough for just patty and she father there be if we each take a room to ourself say mr fairfield you may have this parlor my daughter and i 'll take the library where be the library miss russell i think it have just step out say frank at any rate it be not on this floor there be only this room and the dining-room and a kitchen cupboard very likely the library be on the third floor say marian that would be convenient there be not any third floor explain laura this be what they call a story-and-a-half house it would have to be expand into a serial story then before it would do for we say mr fairfield we may not be such big people but patty and i have a pretty large estimate of ourselves and i be sure we never could live in such a short-story-and-a-half as this seem to be indeed we could not papa say patty just look at this dining-room i be sure it be only big enough for one we would have to have we meal alternately you could have breakfast and i would have dinner one day and the next day we would reverse the order come look at the kitchen patty call out frank or at least stick you head in there be not room for all of you see the stationary tub two of they you see each just the size of a good comfortable coffee-cup just exactly say patty laughing why i never see such a house laura russell what be you thinking of oh of course you could add to it say laura you could build on as many more room as you want and you could run it up another story and a half and that would make three story and i do want you to live near I we be sorry not to live near you miss laura say mr fairfield but i can not see my way clear to do it unless you would move into this bandbox and let we have you roomy and comfortable mansion next door oh there would not be room for we family here say laura but you could build on a whole lot of room say frank and add enough story to make it a sky-scraper and put in a elevator and it would be perfectly lovely laura laugh with the rest and then at mr elliott 's suggestion they all start back to the bigelow house now this be something like say marian as they go in at the gate and up the broad front walk like what say frank like a home for the fairfield what shall you call it -- fairfield hall fairfield place or what i do not know cry patty dash up the veranda step but be not it a dear house i feel at home here already this big piazza will be lovely in warm weather there be room for hammock and big chair and little table and everything inside the house prove very attractive the large square hall open into a parlor on one side and a library on the other back of the library be a little conservatory and beyond that a large light dining-room with a open fireplace here be a kitchen worth have say aunt alice who be investigate ahead of the rest and such convenient pantry and cupboard and this back veranda be great say frank open the door from a little hall oh yes say patty see the dead vine in the summer it must have honeysuckle all over it and there be the little arbor at the foot of the garden i be go down to see it marian start to follow she but laura call she back to show she some new attraction and patty run alone down the veranda step and through the box-bordered path to the little rustic arbor goodness she exclaim as she reach it who in the world be you for inside the arbor sit a strange-looking girl of about patty 's own age she be a tall thin child with a pale face large black eye and straight black hair which hang in wisp about she ear i be pansy she say clasp she hand in front of she and look straight into patty 's face you be pansy be you say patty look puzzle and what be you do here pansy well miss you see it be this way i want to go out to service and when i hear

i 'll be faithful and true what can you do ask patty half laughing and half pity the strange-looking girl can you cook no ma'am i can not cook but i might learn it but i do not mean that i think you would have a cook and you would take I for a table girl you know and to tidy up after you i do want a waitress but have you have any experience no ma'am say the girl very earnestly i have not but i be just sure i could learn if you just tell I a thing once you need not ever tell it to I again that be something be not it indeed it be say patty remember a certain careless waitress at mr elliott 's have you any reference no say the girl smile you see i have never live anywhere except home and i suppose mother 's reference would not count it would with I say patty decidedly i think you mother ought to know more about you than anybody else what would she say if i ask she she would say i be careless and heedless and thoughtless and do not know anything reply the girl cheerfully and i be that way at home but i would not be if i work for you because i want to be a waitress and a good one and you would see how quick i would learn oh do take I miss you 'll never be sorry and that be sure this statement be accompany by such decide gesture of head and hand that patty be very nearly convince to the contrary but she only say i be sorry pansy -- you say you name be pansy do not you yes miss -- pansy pott what a extraordinary name be it miss well you see my father 's name be pott and mother name I pansy because she be so fond of the flower you do not think the name will interfere with my be a waitress do you not so far as i be concern say patty laughing but you see i shall be a very inexperienced housekeeper and if i have a inexperienced waitress also i do not know what might happen why now miss it seem to I that that would work out just right you be a young housekeeper but i expect you know just about what a waitress ought to do and you could teach I and i know a lot about housekeeping and i could teach you the sincerity in pansy 's voice and manner impressed patty and she look at she closely as she say : it do seem good proportion it be say pansy and you have no idea how quickly i can learn can you say patty well then learn first to call I miss patty it would suit I much better than to hear you say ` miss ' so often yes miss patty and do not wring you hand in that absurd fashion and do not stand first on one foot and then on the other as if you be scare out of you wit no miss patty pansy cease shuffling drop she hand naturally to she side and stand in the quiet respectful attitude that patty have unconsciously assume while speak delighted at this quick-witted mimicry patty exclaim : i believe you will do i believe you be just the one but i can not decide positively now you go home pansy and come to-morrow afternoon to see I at mr elliott 's do you know where i live yes miss patty and with a respectful little bob of she head pansy pott disappear and patty run back to the house well chickadee say mr fairfield i have about decide that you and i can make ourselves comfortable within these four wall and if it suit you ladyship i think we 'll consider that we have take the house it do suit I say patty i be perfectly satisfied and _ i _ have take a house-maid where do you get she exclaimed frank do they grow on tree in the garden i see you out in the arbor with one yes say patty i pick she off a tree she be not quite ripe but she be not so very green and i think she 'll do never mind about she now i can not decide until i have have a talk with aunt alice i be so glad you decide on this house papa oh be not it lovely to have a home it look rather bare to be sure but be it ever so empty there be no place like home now what shall we name it i do like a nice name for a place it have so many of those little boxwood hedge say aunt alice look out of the window that you might call it the boxwood house oh do not call it a wood-house say uncle charley call it the wood-box and be do with it frank i like ` hall ' say patty how be boxwood hall sound like locksley hall say marian more like boxley hall say frank boxley hall cry patty that be just the thing i like that rather a pretentious name to live up to say mr fairfield never mind say patty with pansy pott for a waitress we can live up to any name and so patty 's new home be choose and its name be boxley hall chapter v shopping as boxley hall be a sort of experiment mr fairfield conclude to rent the place for a year with the privilege of buying by this time patty be sure that she wish to remain in vernondale all she life but she father say that woman even very young one be fickle in they taste and he think it wiser to be on the safe side and it do not matter as patty say to marian for when the year be up papa will just buy the house and then it will be all right have find a home the next thing be to furnish it and about this mr fairfield be very decide and methodical to-morrow he say as they be talk it over at the elliott ' one evening to-morrow i shall take patty to new york to select the most important piece of furniture we shall go alone because it be a very special occasion and we can not allow ourselves to be hamper by outside advice another day we shall go to buy prosaic thing like tablecloth and carpet-sweeper and then as we know little about such thing we shall be glad to take with we some experienced adviser and so the next day patty and she father start for the city to buy furniture for boxley hall you see patty say she father after they be seat in the train there be a certain proportion to be observe in furnish a house about which i imagine you know very little very little indeed return patty but then how should i know such thing when i have never furnish a house i understand that say mr fairfield and so with my advantage of age and experience and you own natural good taste i think we shall accomplish this thing successfully now first as to what we have on hand why we have not anything on hand say patty at least i have a few picture and book and the afghan grandma 's knit for I but that be all you reckon without you host say she father smile i possess some few object of value and during the past year i have add to my collection in anticipation of the time when we should have we own home oh papa cry patty have you a whole lot of new furniture that i do not know about yes say mr fairfield except that instead of be new it be mostly old i have opportunity in the south to pick up bit of fine old mahogany and i have a number of really good piece that will help to make boxley hall attractive what be they papa tell I all about they i can not wait another minute to begin with child i have several heirloom the old sideboard that be you grandfather fairfield 's and several old bureau and table that come from the fairfield estate then i have also two or three beautiful book-case and a old desk for we library and

though we 'll do all we can to help but i be so prosaic i would like to have special attention pay to the comfort of the dining-room and as to you own bedroom patty i want you to see to it that it fulfil exactly you ideal of what a girl 's room ought to be oh i know just how i want that almost exactly like my room at aunt alice 's but with a few more of the sort of thing i have in my room at

slowly but all the same you would better keep pretty close to I when i pick out the trap for my room do you know papa i think aunt isabel want to help we furnish we house she write that she would meet we in new york some time that be kind of she say mr fairfield but do _ you _ know it just seem to I that we 'll be able to manage it by ourselves we house be not of the era of queen isabellum but of the princess patricium that sound like aunt isabel they always call I patricium there do not you think papa now that i be get so grow up i ought to be call patricium patty be such a baby name patty be good enough for I say mr fairfield if you want to be call patricia you must get somebody else to do it i dare say you could hire somebody for a small sum per week to call you patricium for a give number of time every day now you be make fun of I papa but i do want to grow up dignified and not be a silly schoolgirl all my life take care of you common sense and you dignity will take care of itself after they cross the ferry and reach the new york side mr fairfield take a cab and they make a round of the various shop buy such beautiful thing that patty grow fairly ecstatic with delight i do think you be wonderful papa she exclaim after they have select the dining-room furnishings you know exactly what you want and when you describe it it seem to be the only possible thing that anybody could want for that particular place that be a result of decision of character my child it be a fairfield trait and i hope you possess it though i can not say i have see any marked development of it as yet but you must have notice it in you aunt alice yes i have say patty she be so decide that with all she sweetness i have sometimes be tempt to call she stubborn stubbornness and decision of character be very closely ally but now we be go to select the furniture for you own bedroom and if you have any decision of character you will have ample opportunity to exercise it oh i 'll have plenty of decision of character when it come to that say patty you will find I a true fairfield aid by she father 's judgment and advice patty select the furnishings for she own room she have choose green as the predominant color and the couch and easy-chair be upholster in a lovely design of green and white the rug be green and white and for the brass bedstead with its white fitting a down comfortable with a pale green cover be find the dainty dressing-table be of bird 's - eye maple and for this mr fairfield order a bewildering array of fitting all in ivory with patty 's monogram on they and i want a little book-case papa she say a little one you know just for my favouritest book for of course the most of my book will be down in the library so a dear little book-case be buy also of bird 's - eye maple and a pretty little work-table with a low chair to match that be very nice say patty with a air of satisfaction for though i hate to sew yet sometimes it must be do and with that little work-table i think i could sew even in a indian wigwam patty have not much to say regard the furniture of she father 's bedroom for mr fairfield attend to that himself and select the thing with such rapidity and certainty that it be all do almost before patty know it now say mr fairfield there be two guest-chamber to be furnish the one you call marian 's room and the other for the general stranger within we gate marian 's room be do up in blue as she have request and the other guest-room be furnish in yellow it be great fun to pick out the furniture rug and curtain for these room and patty try very hard to select such thing as she father would approve of for she dearly love to have he commend she taste and judgment as they be sit at luncheon mr fairfield say : this afternoon i think we will devote to picture i be not sure we will buy any but we will look at they and i will learn what be you taste in art and you will lean what be mine i have not any say patty cheerfully i do not know anything about art and never do you still have some time i hope in which to learn i have time enough but i do not believe i could learn the only picture i like be pretty one you _ be _ hopeless and that be a fact say mr fairfield of all discourage people the worst be those who like pretty picture but i be sure i can learn say patty if you will teach I you be more flattering than convincing say mr fairfield but i will try and so after luncheon they visit several picture shop and mr fairfield import to he daughter what be at least a foundation for a education in art back in vernondale patty confide to marian that she have have a perfectly lovely time all the morning but the afternoon be not so much fun in fact she say it be very much like that little book we have to study in school call ` how to judge a picture ' the follow Saturday another shopping tour be undertake this time aunt alice and marian accompany the fairfield and there be more fun and less responsibility for patty she father insist upon she undivided attention while mr elliott select table-linen bed-linen towel and other household fitting but as these thing be choose with fairfield promptness and decision patty have nothing to do but admire and acquiesce and now she remark after they have choose two set of china and a quantity of glass for the dining-room now if you please we will buy I some tea-thing to entertain the tea club we will indeed say mr fairfield and both he and aunt alice enter into the selection of the tea-table fitting with as much zest as they have show in the other china dainty dresden cup be find lovely plate and a tea-pot and cracker-jar which make marian and patty fairly shriek with delight a three-storied wicker tea-table be find to hold these treasure and mr fairfield add the most fascinating little silver tea-caddy and tea-ball and strainer oh exclaim marian make quite breathless by the glory of it all the tea club will never want to meet anywhere except at you house patty they 'll have to say patty i do not propose to have they every time well you 'll have to have they every other time anyway say marian after the fun of pick out the tea-thing it be hard to come down to the plainer claim of the kitchen but aunt alice grow so interested in the selection of granite saucepan and patent coffee-mill that patty too become enthusiastic and we must get a rolling-pin she cry for i shall make pumpkin pie every day oh and i want a farina-kettle and a colander and a _ bain-marie _ and a larding-needle and a syllabub-churn why patty child exclaim she father what be all those thing for be you go to have a french _ chef _ no papa but i expect to do a great deal of fancy cooking myself oh you do well then buy all the contraption that be necessary but do not omit the plain gridiron and frying-pan then aunt alice and patty put they head together in a most sensible fashion and order a kitchen outfit that would have delight the heart of any well-organised housekeeper not only kitchen utensil but laundry fitting and household furnishings generally include patent labour-saving device and newly invent contrivance which be suppose to be of great aid to any housewife if i can only live up to it all sigh patty as she look at the enormous collection of iron tin wood and granite or down to it say marian chapter vi servant i do think say patty in a disgusted tone that we could get settle in the house in time to eat we christmas dinner there but it do not look a bit like it i be over there this afternoon and such a hopeless-looking mess of papering and painting and plumbing i never see in my life i do not believe it will _ ever _ be do i do not either say marian those man work as slow as mud-turtle the conversation be take place at the elliott ' dinner-table and uncle charley look up from he carve to say : it be a ill wind that blow nobody good and the slower the mud-turtle be the longer we shall have we guest with we for my part i shall be very sorry to see pretty patty go out of this house patty smile gaily at she uncle for they be great friend and say : then i shall expect you to visit I very often in my new home -- that be if i ever get there i can not see we way clear to a christmas dinner in boxley hall say mr fairfield but i think i can promise you chick that you can invite you revered uncle and he family to

say patty but i would like to go there the first day of January and stay there by some unknown method mr fairfield manage to stir up the mud-turtle workman to greater activity and the work go rapidly on the wall-papers seem to get themselves into place and the floor take on a beautiful polish bustling man come out from the city and put up window-shades and curtain and drapery and under mr fairfield 's supervision lay rug and hang picture the lady of the elliott household organise themselves into a most active sewing-society grandma aunt alice marian and patty hem tablecloth and napkin with great diligence and even little edith be allow to help with the kitchen towel everybody be so kind that patty begin to feel weigh down with gratitude the girl of the tea club make the tea-cloth that they have propose and they also bring offering of pin-cushion and doily and centre-piece until patty 's room begin to look like a booth at a fancy bazaar one Saturday morning as the sewing-circle be hard at work little gilbert come in carry a paper bag which evidently contain something valuable it be for you patty he say i bring it for you to help keep house and its name be pudgy deposit the bag in he cousin 's lap little gilbert kneel beside she you need not open it he cry it will open itself and sure enough the mouth of the bag untwisted and a little gray head come poke out a kitten exclaim patty a maltese kitten why that be just the very thing i want where do you get it gilbert dear from the milkman say gilbert proudly we always get kitty from he and i telled he to pick out a nice pretty one for you do you like it i love it say patty cuddle the little bunch of gray fur and pudgy be just the right name for it it be the fattest little cat i ever see yes say gilbert gravely do not let it get thin will you no indeed say patty i 'll feed it on strawberry and cream all the year round that same afternoon patty and aunt alice start out on a cook-hunting expedition a cook 's tour frank call it and the tourist take it very seriously much of the success of you home patty say aunt alice as they be go to the intelligence office depend upon you cook for she will be not only a cook but in part housekeeper and overseer of the whole place and while you must of course exercise you authority and demand respect yet at the same time you will find it necessary to defer to she judgment and experience on many occasion i know it aunt alice say patty very earnestly and i do want to do what be right i want to be the head of papa 's home and yet there be a great many thing that my servant will know more about than i do i shall have to be very careful about my proportion but if you and papa will help I i think i 'll come out all right i think you will say aunt alice but she smile a little at the assure toss of she niece 's head the intelligence office prove to be as much misnamed as those institution usually be and vary degree of unintelligence be show in the candidate offer for the position of cook at boxley hall though if the applicant seem unsatisfactory to patty in many case she be no less so to they one tall rawboned irishwoman seem hopefully good-tempered and capable but when she discover that patty be to be she mistress instead of mr elliott as she have suppose she exclaim : go ` way wid yez wud i be workin ' for the likes of a child like that no mum i be not no nurse i be a cook and i want a mistress as have get past play wid doll i hope you 'll find one say patty politely and i be afraid we would not suit each other another irish girl with a merry rosy face and frizzled blonde hair be very anxious to go to work for patty sure it will be fun she say i would like to work for such a pretty little lady and sure we would have the good time could i have all I afternoon out miss not if you live with I say patty laugh my house be large and there be a great deal of work to be do by somebody i think my cook could not do she share if she go out every afternoon many other be interview but each seem to have more or less objectionable trait one would not come unless she be the only servant another would not come unless patty keep five most of they show such a decide lack of respect to so young a mistress that aunt alice begin to despair of find the kind capable woman she have imagine they go home feeling rather discourage but when patty tell she trouble to she father he only laugh bless you heart child he say you could not expect to engage a whole cook in one afternoon it be a long and serious process but papa you say we would be all settle and ready by the first of January yes i know but i do not say which January now you be tease say patty but she run away with a light heart feeling sure that somehow a cook would be provide that evening accord to appointment pansy pott appear for inspection the whole elliott family be present and observe with much interest the strange-looking girl but though ignorant and awkward pansy be not embarrassed and seeming to realize that she fate lay in the hand of mr elliott mr fairfield and patty she address herself to they she manner though untrained show respectful deference and she expressive black eye show quick perception and clever adaptability she be all right at heart think mr fairfield to himself but she know next to nothing i wonder if it would be a good plan to let the two girl help each other out have you ever wait at table pansy he ask so pleasantly that pansy pott feel encouragement rather than alarm no sir but i could learn and i would do exactly as i be tell that be the right spirit say mr fairfield i think perhaps we 'll have to give you a trial but do not you know anything of a housemaid 's duty inquire aunt alice who be a little dubious in the face of such absolute ignorance for instance if the door-bell should ring what would you do i would have ask miss patty beforehand ma'am and i would do whatever she have tell I to good enough exclaimed mr fairfield i think you 'll do pansy at any rate you 'll have nothing to unlearn and that be a great deal so the waitress be engage and it be not long after this that a cook drop from the sky as patty express it one afternoon a large and amiable-looking color woman appear at mr elliott 's house with a note from mr steven recommend she as a cook for patty as soon as patty see she she like she but remember previous experience she say : do you understand that you be to work for I i be a very young housekeeper you know law missy dat 's all right til do de housekeepin ' and you can do de bossin '

have it only i do not know whether to call it ` first course in mineralogy ' or ` how to tell the wild flower ' chapter viii a unattained ambition to say that boxley hall be in readiness for the party would be state it very mildly it be overflow -- yes fairly burst with readiness new year 's day be on Thursday and patty have decree that on that day none of the elliott should go to boxley hall until they come as guest dinner be to be at two o'clock and in the morning patty and she father go over to they new home together just think papa say patty squeeze he hand as they go along how many time we have walk -- and run too for that matter -- from aunt alice 's over to we house but this time it be different we be go to stay to live really to _ reside _ in we own home and whenever we go to aunt

this morning and a few hundred that i want you to do i shall see to it first that the carving-knife be well sharpen it be the first time that i have carve at my own table for a great many year and i want the performance to be mark by grace and skill it will be if you do it papa i be sure of that and by this time they have reach the gate and patty be skip along the path and up the step and into the door of she own home mancy and pansy pott be already there and to a casual observer it look as if there be nothing more to do except to admit the guest patty have set the table the day before and to the awestruck admiration of pansy pott have arrange the beautiful new glass and china with most satisfactory effect pansy have watch the proceedings with intelligent scrutiny and when it be finish have tell patty that the next time she would be able to do it herself you 'll have a chance to try patty have answer for in the evening we 'll have supper and you may set the table all by yourself and i 'll come out and look it over to make sure it be all right but as patty have say there be yet much to be do on Thursday morning even though there be eight hand to make the work light box of flower have arrive from the florist 's and these have to be arrange in the various room also a few potted plant in full bloom have come for the conservatory and these so delighted the soul of pansy pott that patty fear the girl would spend the whole day nurse they come pansy she call let they grow by themselves for a while i want you help in the kitchen but oh miss patty they be daisy real white daisy with yellow centre well they 'll still be daisy to-morrow and you 'll have more time to admire they then patty 's ambition in the culinary line run to the fanciful and elaborate confection which be picture in the cook-book and in the household periodical especially do she incline toward marvellous dessert which call for spin sugar and syllabub and rare sweetmeat and patent freezing process for she new year 's dinner party she have decide to try the most complicated recipe of all and moreover intend to surprise everybody with it warn she father to keep out of the kitchen on pain of excommunication she roll up she sleeve and tie on a white apron and with she open book on the table before she begin she proceedings pansy pott be set to whipping cream with a new-fangled syllabub-churn and mancy be request to blanch some almond and pound they to a paste in a very new and very large mortar though the good-natured mancy be more than willing to help she young mistress through what threaten to be somewhat troubled water yet she have the more substantial portion of the dinner to prepare and there be none too much time as patty go on with she work difficulty of all sort present themselves the cream would not whip but remain exasperatingly fluid the sugar refuse to spin a thread and obstinately crystallise itself into a hard crust the almond persist in become a lumpy mass instead of a smooth paste and the gelatine as patty despairingly remark act like all possess but have attempt the thing she be bind to carry it through though it be with some misgiving that she finally pour a queer and sticky-looking substance into the patent freezer pansy pott have declare herself quite able to accomplish the freezing process but as she be about to begin she announce in tragic tone that the extra ice have not come oh exclaim patty in desperation everything seem to go wrong about that dessert well pansy you use what ice there be and i 'll telephone for some more right away but when patty call up the ice company she find that they office be close for the day and hang up the receiver with a angry little jerk she turn to find she father smile at she i see you have begin to amuse I he say but never mind about my entertainment now puss run away and get dress or you will not be ready to receive you guest it be half-past one now oh papa be it so late and i have to get into that new frock well scuttle along then and make all the haste you can patty scuttle but during the process of make all the haste she could she very nearly lose she temper the new white frock be complicate the broad white hair-ribbon be difficult to tie and as it be the first time that she have make a toilette in she new home it be not at all surprising that many useful or indispensable little article be miss pansy she call as she hear the girl in the dining-room do for mercy 's sake come up and help I i can not find my shoe-buttoner and i can not button the yoke of this crazy dress without it pansy come to the rescue and just as the elliott family come in at the front gate patty completely attire but very flushed and breathless from she rapid exertion -- fly downstairs and tuck she arm through she father 's as he stand in the hall i be here she say demurely and try to speak calmly oh so you be he say i think a white cashmere whirlwind have strike I i _ hope _ you do not hurry yourself oh no say patty meeting he merry smile with another i just dawdle through my dress to kill time yes you look so say she father and just then the doorbell ring oh papa cry patty she eye dance with excitement _ be not _ it just grand that be the first ring at we own doorbell we _ own _ doorbell you know and have not it a musical ring and now it will be answer by we own pansy without a trace of the hurry and fluster that have so affect she young mistress pansy pott in neat white cap and apron open the door to the guest patty nudge she father 's arm in glee as they note the correct demeanor of they own waitress and then all such consideration be drown in the outburst of enthusiasm that accompany the entrance of the elliott the younger member of the family announce themselves with wild war-whoop of delight and the older one though less noisy be no less enthusiastic i like cousin patty 's house announce gilbert sit down in the middle of the floor i will stay here always where be the pudgy kitty-cat i 'll get she for you right away say patty she be fatter than ever but first let I make grandma comfortable take mr elliott 's bonnet and wrap patty lead the old lady to a large easy-chair and announce that she must sit there for a few moment and rest before she make a tour of inspection around the house grandma elliott have not be allow in the new house while it be be arrange lest she should take cold and so to-day it burst upon she in all its glory by this time frank and marian be investigate the conservatory and little edith be announce that cousin patty have a crimson gambler she mean crimson rambler exclaim patty or as pansy call it ` that bunchy rosebush ' although the guest have be invite to a two-o'clock dinner yet when the clock hand point to nearly three the meal have not be announce there be so much to be talk about that the time do not drag but aunt alice look at patty a little curiously patty catch the glance and excuse herself go out into the kitchen mancy she exclaim it be almost three o'clock why do not you have dinner well honey yo ' take so much of my time mashin ' you old nut dat my work get put behind dinner 'll come on after a while it be mo ' ready patty go back to the parlor laugh if anybody can hurry up mancy she say they be welcome to try it i do not realize it be so late and i be awfully sorry but i guess we 'll have dinner pretty soon now do not be sorry we be go to have it soon say frank none of the rest of we be i assure you although serve about a hour late the dinner be a great success it have be carefully plan mancy 's cooking be beyond reproach and pansy pott prove a neat-handed and quick-witted if inexperienced phylli encourage by the general excellence of the course as they succeed one another patty begin to hope that she gorgeous dessert would turn out all right after all seat at the head of she own table she make a charming little hostess and many a glance of happy understanding pass between she and the gentleman who preside at the other end i say patty it be right down jolly you have a house of you own say frank except that we miss you awfully over home add uncle charley i do not see how you can say patty smile as i take breakfast there this morning you have not yet gather round you lonely board without I no but we shall have to say uncle charley and it be that which be break my young heart well _ this _ be what be break _ my _ young heart say patty as she watch pansy pott who be just enter the room with a dish contain a most unattractive-looking failure i may as well own up she say bravely as the dessert be place in front of she my ambition be greater than my ability do not say another word say aunt alice _ i _ understand those spun-sugar thing be monument of total depravity patty give she aunt a grateful glance and say they certainly be aunt alice and i 'll never attempt one again until i have make myself perfect by long practice good for you my irish pat say frank but do you know i like they better this way there be a attraction about that general conglomeration that appeal to I more strongly than those over-neat concoction that look as if they have sit in a caterer 's window for week but notwithstanding frank 's complimentary impulse the dessert prove uneatable and have to be replace with cracker and cheese and fruit and bonbon chapter ix a caller it be quite late in the evening before the elliott leave boxley hall but after they have go patty and she father still linger in the library for a bit of cosey chat be not it lovely say patty with a little sigh of extreme content to sit down in we own library and talk over we own party and by the way papa how do you like we library be it all you fancy paint it yes say mr fairfield look around critically the library be all right but of course as yet it be young and inexperienced it remain for we to train it up in the way it should go and i feel sure under we ministration and loving care it will grow better as it grow older we have certainly get good material to work on say patty give a satisfied glance around the pretty room and now mr man tell I what you think of we first effort at hospitality how do the dinner party go off today it go off with fly color and you certainly deserve a great deal of credit for you very successful first appearance as a hostess of course if one be dispose to be critical -- one would say that one 's elaborate dessert -- be a very successful imitation of a complete failure interrupted mr fairfield laughing and this be where i shall take a opportunity to point a moral it be not good proportion to undertake a difficult and complicated recipe for the first time when you be expect guest no i know it say patty and yet papa you would not expect I to have that gorgeous french mess for dinner when we be all alone would you and so when could we have it you implication do seem to bar the beautiful confection from we table entirely and yet do you know it would not alarm I a bit to have that dessert attack we some night when you and i be at dinner quite alone and unprotect all right papa we 'll have it and i be sure after another trial i can make it just as it should be make do not be too sure my child self-confidence be a good thing in its place but self-assurance be a quality not nearly so attractive i think patty girl and here mr fairfield put he arm around he daughter and look very kindly into she eye i think every new year 's day i shall give you a bit of good advice by way of correct whatever seem to I at the time to be you beset sin patty smile back at she father with loving confidence but if you only reform I at the rate of one sin per year it will be a long while before i become a good girl she say you be a good girl now say she father pat she head you be really a very good girl for you age and if i correct you fault at the rate of one a year i do not think i can keep up with the performance for very many year but seriously pattikin what i want to speak to you about now be you apparent inclination toward a certain kind of filigree elaborateness which be out of proportion to we simple mode of live i have notice that you have a decide admiration for appointment and service that be only appropriate in house run on a really magnificent scale where the corps of servant include a butler and other trained functionary now you know my child that with you present retinue you can not achieve startling effect in the way of household glory be i make myself clear well you be not so awfully clear but i gather that you think that ridiculous pudding i try to make be out of proportion to pansy pott as waitress you have grasp my meaning wonderfully well say she father but it be not only the pudding i have in mind but several ambitious attempt at a over-display of grandeur and elegance well but papa i like to have thing nice yes but be careful not to have they more nice than wise however there be no necessity for dwelling on this subject i see you understand what i mean and i know now that i have call you attention to it you own sense of proportion will guide you right if you remember to follow its dictate but do you imagine say patty roguishly that such a mild scolding as that be go to do a hardened reprobate like I any good yes say she father decidedly i think it will so do i say patty next morning at breakfast patty could scarcely eat so enthusiastic be she over the delightful sensation of breakfast alone with she father in they own dining-room very carefully she pour he coffee for he and very carefully pansy pott carry the cup to its destination i do not ask marian to stay last night slide patty because i want we first night and we first breakfast all alone by ourselves you be a sentimental little puss say she father yes i think i be say patty do you mind not at all if you keep you sentiment in its proper place and do not let it interfere with the somewhat prosaic duty that have of late come into you life gracious goodness ' sake say patty that remind I what shall i order from the butcher this morning do not ask I say mr fairfield i object to be implicate in matter so entirely outside my own domain oh certainly say patty that be all right i beg you pardon i be sure and do not feel alarmed i 'll promise you shall have a tip-top dinner i have no doubt of it and now good-bye baby i must be off to catch my train do not get lonesome have a good time and forget that you father scold you as if i mind that little feathery scolding come home early and bring I something nice from the city good-bye leave to herself patty begin to keep house with great diligence she plan the meal for the day make out order for market give the flower in the vase fresh water and look in at the conservatory she find pansy pott digging around the potted daisy with a hairpin pansy she say kindly i be glad to have you take care of the flower but you must not spend all you time in here have you straighten up in the dining-room yet no ma'am say pansy but these little daisy cry so loud to be look after that i just could not neglect they another minute see how they laugh when i tickle up the dirt around they toe that be all very well pansy say patty laughing herself but i want you to do you work properly and at the right time now leave the daisy until the dining-room and bedroom be all in order yes miss patty say pansy and though she cast a linger farewell glance at the beloved posy she go cheerfully about she duty now think pansy i 'll telephone to marian to come over this afternoon and stay to dinner and stay all night then we can arrange about have the tea club to-morrow why there be the doorbell perhaps that be marian now i do not know who else it could be i be sure in a few moment pansy pott appear and offer patty a card on a very new and very shiny tray for goodness ' sake who be it pansy ask patty read the card which only say miss rachel daggett i do not know miss patty i be sure she ask for you and i say you would go right down very well i will say patty a glance in the mirror show a crisp fresh shirt-waist and neatly brush hair so patty run down to the library to welcome she guest the guest prove to be a large tall and altogether impressive-looking lady who speak with a great deal of firmness and decision i be miss daggett she say and i be you neighbor be you say patty pleasantly i be very glad to meet you and i hope you will like I for a neighbor i do not know whether i shall or not say miss daggett it depend entirely on how you behave although patty be extremely good-natured she could not help feel a little inclined to resent the tone take by she guest and she return rather crisply : i shall try to behave as a lady and a neighbor humph say miss daggett you be promise a good deal if you accomplish what you have mention i shall consider you the best neighbor i have ever experience in my life patty begin to think she strange guest be eccentric rather than impolite and begin to take a fancy to the somewhat brusque visitor i live next-door say miss daggett and i be by no means social in my habit indeed i prefer to let my neighbor alone and i be not in the habit of ask they to call upon I i will do just as you like say patty politely call upon you or not it be not my habit to call on people who do not care to see I but on the other hand i shall be happy to call upon such of my neighbor as ask I to do so oh people do not have to call upon each other merely because they be neighbor say miss daggett and that be why i come in here to-day to let you understand my idea on this matter i have live next-door to this house for many year and i have never care to associate with the people who have live in it i have no reason to think that you will prove of any more interest to I that any of the other who have live here indeed i have reason to believe that you will prove of less interest to I because you be so young and inexperienced that i feel sure you will be a regular nuisance and i would like you to understand once for all that you be not to come to I for advice or assistance when you make absurd and ridiculous mistake as you be bind to do at first patty have grow indignant at miss daggett 's conversation but soon she feel rather amuse at what be doubtless the idiosyncrasy of a eccentric mind and she answer : i will promise not to come to you for advice or warn no matter how much i may need assistance that be right say miss daggett very earnestly and remember please that you cook be not to come over to my house to borrow anything not even egg butter or lemon i 'll promise that too say patty try not to laugh though she could not help think that she first caller be a extraordinary one well you really behave quite well say miss daggett i be very much surprised at you i come over here partly to warn you against interfere with myself and my household but also because i want to see what you be like i have hear that you be go to live in this house and that you be go to keep house yourself and though i be much surprised that you father would let you do such a thing yet i can not help think that you be really quite sensible yet i want you to understand that you be not to borrow thing from my kitchen i be glad that you think i be sensible say patty look earnestly at she visitor toward whom she feel somehow draw in despite of she queer manners and i 'll promise not to borrow anything from you under any circumstance that be all right say miss daggett rise and that be all i come to say to you i will now go home and if i ever feel that i want you to return this call i will let you know otherwise please remember that i do not care to have it return patty show she guest to the door and dismiss she with a polite good-bye well she exclaim to herself as miss daggett walk out of the front gate with a air of stalwart dignity that be a delightful specimen of a caller but i hope i will not have many more like that she be a queer kind of a neighbor but somehow i rather think if i see she more i should like she better chapter x a pleasant evening marian come to dinner and frank come with she as he announce when he enter he have have no invitation but he say he do not hesitate on that account i should think not say patty i expect all the elliott family to live at my house and only go home occasionally to visit so frank proceed to make himself at home and when mr fairfield arrive a little later and dinner be serve it be a very merry party of four that sit down to the table as patty have promise she father the dinner be excellent and it be with a pardonable pride that she dispense the hospitality of she own table what be the dessert go to be patty ask frank nightingale ' tongue i suppose serve on rose-leaf do not be rude frank say he sister you be probably cause you hostess great embarrassment not at all say patty i be now such a old experienced housekeeper that i be not disturb by such insinuation i be sorry to disappoint you frank but the dessert be a very simple one however you be now about to have a most marvellous concoction call ` russian salad ' i be a little uncertain as to how it would turn out so i think i would try it tonight as i know my guest would be both good-natured and hungry that be a combination of virtue that do not always go together say mr fairfield i hope the young people appreciate the compliment to be good-natured and hungry at the same time imply a disposition little short of angelic so you see say marian you be not entertaining these angel unawares bravo pretty good for mally say frank applaud he sister 's speech and if i may be allow to remark on such a delicate subject you salad be also pretty good patty it be more than pretty good say marian it be a howling scream shout success i be endeavor to find out what it be make of you can not do it say mr fairfield i have try too and it seem to include everything that ever grow on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth you guess be not far out of the way say patty composedly i will not attempt to deny that that complicated and exceedingly frenchified salad be concoct from certain remainder that be set away in the refrigerator after yesterday 's dinner who would have believe it exclaim frank look at he plate with mock awe and reverence material count for very little in a salad say marian with a wise and didactic air its whole success depend on the way it be put together now that be a true compliment say patty and it be mine for i make this salad all myself after dinner they adjourn to the library and the girl fall to make plan for the tea club which be to meet there next day i do think say marian it be awfully mean of helen preston to insist on have a bazaar they be so old-fashioned and silly and we could get up some novel entertainment that would make just as much money and be a lot more fun besides i know it say patty i just hate bazaar with they everlasting rebecca at the well and flower-girl and fish-pond and gipsy-tent but then what could we have why there be two or three of those little acting show that elsie morri tell we about i think they would be a great deal nicer what sort of act show be you talk about my child and what be it all to be ask mr fairfield who be always interested in patty 's plan why papa it be the tea club you know and we be go to have a entertainment to make money for the day nursery -- oh you just ought to see those cunning little baby and they have not room enough or nurse enough or anything and you know the tea club never have do any good in the world we have never do a thing but sit around and giggle and so we think if we could make a hundred dollar would not it be nice the hundred dollar would be very nice indeed but just how be you go to make it what be this about a act play oh not a regular play -- just a sort of dialogue thing you know and we would have it in library hall and aunt alice and a lot of she friend would be patroness it would seem to I say frank that miss patty fairfield now be a old and experienced housekeeper could qualify as a patroness herself no thank you say patty i be housekeeper for my father and in my father 's house but to the great outside world i be still a shy and bashful young miss you do not look the part say frank you ought to go around with you finger in you mouth why do not you tell I sooner say patty i shall begin to cultivate the habit at once do say marian i be sure it would be become to you but perhaps hard on you glove well there be one thing certain say patty : i would really rather put my finger in my mouth than to crook out my little finger in that absurd way that so many people do why florence douglass never lift a cup of tea that she do not crook out she little finger and then think she be a very pattern of all that be elegant i know it say marian i think it be horrid too it be nothing but air i know lot of people who do it when they be all dress up but who never think of such a thing when they be alone at home i wonder what the real reason be say patty thoughtfully it be a announcement of refinement say mr fairfield fall in with he daughter 's train of thought and as we all know the refinement that need to be announce be no refinement at all we therefore see that the conspicuously curved little finger be but a advertisement of a specious and flimsy imitation of aristocracy papa you certainly do know it all say patty i have not any word by I just now long enough to answer you with but i quite agree with you in spirit that be all very well say frank for a modern twentieth-century explanation but the real root of the matter go far back into the obscure age of antiquity the whole habit be a relic of barbarism probably in the early age only the great have cup to drink from these few to protect themselves from they envious and covetous brethren stick out they little finger to ward off possible assault upon they porcelain property this ingrained impulse the age have be unable to eradicate hence we find the little finger crook upon the earth to-day what a ingenious boy you be say patty look at she cousin with mock admiration how do you ever think of all that that be not ingenuity miss it be historic research and you 'll probably find that florence douglass can trace she ancestry right back to the aforesaid barbarian i suppose most of we be descend from primitive people say marian and then the entrance of elsie morri and she brother guy put a end to the discussion of little finger i be so glad to see you say patty welcome she caller come right into the library you be we first real guest then i think we ought to have the prize for promptness say elsie as she take off she wrap but do not you count frank and marian not as guest reply patty they be relative and you know you relative -- be like the poor interrupted frank because they be always with you then we be really you first caller say guy morris no not quite say patty laughing i speak too hastily when i say that and forget entirely a very distinguished personage who visit I this morning who be it my next-door neighbor miss daggett what not locky ann daggett exclaim elsie laughing merrily it be miss rachel daggett i do not know why you call she by that queer name say patty oh i have know she ever since i be a baby and mother always call she locky ann daggett and grandmother do before she you know locky be a nickname for rachel i do not know it say patty what a absurd nickname yes be not it how do you like she it be not a question of liking answer patty she do not want I to like she all she seem to care about be to have I promise not to interfere with she oh she be afraid of you say guy you do not seem so very terrifying now but i suppose when you be engage in the housekeeping of you house you be a impose and awe-inspiring sight i dare say i be say patty but my neighbor miss daggett i be sure would be impose at any hour of the day or night she be a queer character say elsie have you never see she before no i never even hear of she until she send up she card why how funny say marian i have always hear of locky ann daggett but i never know anything about she except that she be very old and very queer she be a sort of humourous character say guy morris strong-minded you know and eccentric but not half bad i quite like the old lady though i almost never see she no she do not seem to care to see people say patty she seem to have no taste for society why i do not suppose she would care to take part in we play even if we invite she oh what about the play say elsie have you really decide to have a play instead of that stupid old fair we have not decide anything say patty we can not until the club meet to-morrow oh do have a play say frank and then we fellow can take part we could not do anything at a bazaar except stand around and buy thing and we be chuck-full of histrionic talent put in guy you ought to see I do hamlet yes say frank guy 's hamlet be quite the funniest thing on the face of the earth i do love comedy so do i say guy i just love to play a side-splitting part like hamlet then you may have a chance say marian for one of the play we be think about -- and it be not exactly a play either -- bring in a whole lot of tragic character in a humourous way it be a general mix-up you know : hamlet and sairy gamp and rip van winkle and old mother hubbard and everybody yes that be a good one say marian it be call ` shakespeare at the seashore ' the name be enough to condemn that piece say mr fairfield not one of you can say it straight and sure enough though numerous attempt be make and much laughter ensue none entirely successful chapter xi preparation with the instinct of a true hostess patty have slip from the room unobserved and have hold a short confab with she two trusty servitor in the kitchen but miss patty expostulate mancy dey be not nuffin ' fit to

that she have be a little absurd then pansy bring in the various dish that patty have work so hard over and perhaps you will not be surprise to learn that they be almost uneatable or at least very far from the dainty perfection they ought to have show on discover this the girl who be really well-bred in spite of they love of chaff quite change they manner and ignore the situation begin merrily to

mistakenly serve on open-work plate have melt and run through patty do not say a word indeed there be nothing to say she go and stand very close to she father as if expect he to put he arm around she which he promptly do you see pitty-pat he say it would not have make any difference at all -- not _ any _ difference at all _ except _ that i have bring my friend mr hepworth the artist home to dinner and you see mislead by the experience of last night i promise he we would find a tidy little dinner await we oh papa cry patty i _ be _ sorry if i have only known i would not have fail you for world i

chapter xv bill patty 's plan for systematic housekeeping include a number of small russia-leather account book and she look forward with some eagerness to the time when the first month 's bill should come in and she could present to she father a neat and accurate statement of the household expense for the month the 1st of February be Sunday but on Monday morning the postman bring a sheaf of letter which be evidently bill patty have no time to look at these before she go to school so she place they carefully in she desk determine to hurry home that afternoon and get she account into apple-pie order before she father come home after school she return to find a supplementary lot of bill have be leave by the postman and also mancy present she with a number of bill which the tradesman have leave that morning patty take the whole lot to she desk and with methodical exactness note the amount on the page of she little book she and she father have talk the matter over more or less and patty know just about what mr fairfield expect the bill to amount to but to she consternation she discover as she go along that each bill be prove to be about twice as large as she have anticipate there must be some mistake she say to herself we simply _ can not _ have eat all those grocery anybody would think we run a branch store and that butcher 's bill be big enough for the central park menagerie they must have add it wrong but a careful verification of the figure prove that they be add right and patty 's heart begin to sink as she look at the enormous sum-total to think of all that for flower well papa buy some of they that be a comfort but i have no idea i have order so many myself i think bill be perfectly horrid and here 's my dressmaker 's bill gracious how madame lafayette have go up in she price i believe i 'll make my own clothes after this but the market bill be the worst i do not see how we _ could _ have eat all these thing mancy must be a dreadful waster but it be not fair to blame she if that be where the trouble be i ought to have look after it myself hello marian be that you i do not hear you come in do come here i be in the depths of despair what be the matter patsie and what a furious lot of bill you look like a clearinghouse oh marian it be perfectly fearful every bill be two or three time as much as i think it would be and i be so sorry for i mean to be such a thrifty housekeeper jiminetty christmas exclaim marian look at some of the papers i should think these bill _ be _ big why that be more than we pay a month for grocery and look at the size of we family i know it say patty hopelessly i do not see how it happen you be a extravagant little wretch patty there be no doubt about it i suppose i be at least i suppose i have be but i be not go to be any more i be go to reform suddenly and all at once and very thoroughly now you watch I we be not go to have any more fancy thing no more ice cream from pacettus 's why that caterer 's bill be something fearful and so you be go to starve poor uncle fred no that would not be fair would it the economy ought to fall entirely on I well i have decide to make my own clothes after this anyway oh patty what a goose you be you could not make they to save you neck and after you make they you could not wear they i could too marian elliott just you wait and see I make my summer dress i be go to sew all through vacation all right say marian i 'll come over and help you but you can not make any dress this afternoon so put away those old bill and get ready for a sleigh ride it be lovely out and father say he would call for we here at four o'clock all right i will if we can get back by six i want to be here when papa come home yes we 'll be back by six i expect uncle fred will shut you up in a dark room and keep you on bread and water for a week when he see those bill that be just the worst of it say patty forlornly he be so good and kind and spoil I so dreadfully that it make I feel all the worse when i do not do thing right a good long sleigh ride in the fresh crisp winter air quite revive patty 's despondent spirit she sit in front with uncle charley and he let she drive part of the way for it be patty 's great delight to drive two horse and she have already become a fairly accomplish little horsewoman fred tell I he be go to get horse for you this spring say uncle charley you 'll enjoy they a lot will not you patty yes indeed -- that be -- i do not know whether we 'll have they or not for it just occur to patty that have run she father into such unexpected expense in the household a good way to economise would be to give up all hope of horse oh yes you 'll have they all right say uncle charley in he gay cheery way have no idea of course what be in patty 's mind and you must have a little pony and cart of you own it would give you a great deal of pleasure to go out drive in the spring weather i just guess it would say patty and i be sure i hope i 'll have it she begin to wonder if she could not find some other way to economise rather than on the horse for she certainly do love to drive promptly at six o'clock uncle charley leave she at boxley hall and as she enter the door patty feel that strange sinking of the heart that always accompany the resume of a half-forgotten mental burden i know just how thief and defaulter and forger feel she say to herself as she take off she wrap i have not exactly steal but i have betray a trust and that be just as bad i wonder what papa will say at dinner patty be subdue and a little nervous mr fairfield quick to notice anything unusual in he daughter surmise that she be bother but feel sure that in she own time she would tell he all about it so he endeavor to set she at she ease by chat pleasantly about the event of he day in the city and sustain the burden of the conversation himself but after dinner when they have go into the library as they usually do in the evening patty bring out she fearful array of paper bugbear and lay they before she father what be these say mr fairfield cheerily ah yes i see the 1st of the month have bring its usual crop of bill i do hope it be not the usual crop papa for if they always come in like this we 'll have to give up boxley hall and go to live in the poor-house oh i do not know we have not overdrawn we bank account yet whew pacettus 's be a stunner be not it yes say patty in a meek little voice and fisher & co seem to have sum up quite a total and smith 's flower bill look like a good old summer time oh papa please scold I i know i deserve it i ought to have look after these thing and keep the expense down more why ought you to have do so patty we have to have food do not we yes but papa you know we estimate in the beginning and these old bill come up to about twice as much as we estimate that be a fact baby they do say mr fairfield look over the statement with a more serious air these be pretty big figure to represent a month 's living for just you and I and we small retinue of servant yes and papa i think mancy be rather wasteful i do not say this to blame she i know it be my place to see about it and be careful that she utilise all that be possible of the kitchen waste patty say this so exactly with the air of a _ young housekeeper 's guide _ or _ cooking school manual _ that mr fairfield laugh outright chickadee he say you 'll come out all right you have the true element of success you see where you have fall into error you be willing to admit it and you be ready to use every means to improve in the future i be not quite so surprised as you be at the size of these bill for though we make we estimate rationally yet we have be buy a great many thing and have a pretty good time generally i foresaw this experience at the end of the month but i prefer to wait and see how we come out rather than interfere with the proceedings and another thing patty which may comfort you some be the fact that i quite believe that some of these tradespeople have take advantage of you youth and inexperience and pad they bill a little bit in consequence but papa just look at madame lafayette 's bill i do not think she ought to charge so much these do seem high price for the simple little frock you wear but they be always so daintily make and in such good taste that i think we 'll have to continue to employ she dressmaker you know be acknowledged vampire i like the clothes she make too say patty but i have conclude that that be the best way for I to economise and i think after this i would make my own dress i do not think you will my child say mr fairfield decidedly you could not make dress fit to be see unless you take a course of instruction in dressmaking and i be not sure that you could then and you have quite enough to do with you school work and you practising when do you propose to do this wonderful sewing oh i mean in vacation -- to make my summer dress no in vacation you be to run out of door and play do not let I hear any more about sew all right say patty with a sigh of relief i be awfully glad not to but i want to help somehow i think i would make my green cloth costume for diana in the play yes that would be a good thing to begin on say mr fairfield broadcloth be so tractable so easy to fit and that tailor-made effect can of course be attain by any well-meaning beginner patty laugh i know it would look horrid papa she say but as i be to blame for all this outrageous extravagance i want to economise somewhere to make up for it and do you call it good proportion to buy a great deal too much to eat and then go around in botchy home-made clothes to make up for it no say patty i do not believe it be what can i do i want to do something and i do not -- oh papa i _ do not _ want to give up those horse that you say you would buy well we 'll fix it up this way patty girl we 'll just pay off all these bill and start fresh the extra expense we 'll charge to experience account -- experience be a awfully high-priced commodity you know -- and next month while we will not exactly scrimp ourselves we 'll keep we eye on the account and watch they as they progress as i have tell you before my darling i do not expect you to become perfect or even proficient in these thing all at once you will need year of experience before the time can come when you domestic machinery will run without a flaw if indeed it ever do now never think of these January bill again they be thing of the past go and get you play-book and let I hear you speak you piece chapter xvi a successful play mr hepworth come again to visit boxley hall and while there hear about the play and become so interested in the preparation that he offer to paint some scenery for it patty jump for joy at this for the scenery have be they greatest stumbling-block and so the Saturday morning before the performance the renowned new york artist mr egerton hepworth walk over to library hall escort by a dozen merry young people of both sex as a scenic artist mr hepworth prove a great success and a rapid workman beside for by mid-afternoon he have complete the one scene that be necessary -- a view of mount olympus as suppose to be at the present date though the actual work be sketchily do yet the general effect be that of a beautiful grecian grove with marble temple and step and surround tree and flower the whole of which seem to be a sort of a island set in a sea of blue sky and fleecy cloud at least that be the way elsie morri declare it look and though mr hepworth confess that that be not the idea he have intend to convey yet if they be satisfied he be the young people declare themselves more than satisfied and urge mr hepworth so heartily to attend the performance -- offer he the choicest seat in the house and as many as he want -- that he finally consent to come if he could persuade he friend at boxley hall to put he up for the night patty demurely promise to try she best to coax she father to agree to this arrangement and though she say she have little hope of succeed mr hepworth seem willing to take he chance at last the great day arrive and patty rise early that morning for there be many last thing to be attend to and be a capable little manager it somehow devolve on patty to see that all the loose end be gather up and all the minor matter look after kenneth harper have be down twice to rehearsal and have already become a favorite with the vernondale young people indeed the cheery willing capable young man could not help get himself like wherever he go he stay with he aunt miss daggett when in vernondale which greatly delight the heart of the old lady the play be to be on Friday night because then there would be no school next day and Friday morning patty be as busy as a bee sort ticket count out program make list and check off memorandum when pansy appear at she door with the unwelcome announcement that miss daggett have send word she would like to have patty call on she unwelcome only because patty be so busy otherwise she would have be glad of a summons to the house next-door for she have take a decide fancy to she erratic neighbor determine she would return quickly and smile to herself as she think that probably she would be ask to do so she run over to miss daggett 's come in child come in call the old lady from the upper hall come right up here i be in a terrible quandary patty go upstairs and then follow miss daggett into she bedroom i have decide say the old lady with the air of one announce a decision the importance of which would shake at least two continent i have decide to go to that ridiculous show of yours oh have you say patty that be very nice i be sure i be glad you be please say the old lady grimly though i be not go for the sake of please you be you go to please you nephew mr harper say patty not be exactly curious but feeling that she be expect to inquire no i be not say miss daggett curtly i be go to please myself and i call you over here to advise I what to wear here be all my best dress but there be none of they make in the fashion people wear nowadays and it be too late to have they fix over i wish you would tell I which one you think come nearest to be right patty look in amazement at the great heap of beautiful gown that lay upon the bed they be make of the richest velvet and satin and lace but be all of such a antiquated mode that it seem impossible to advise anyone to wear they without remodel but as miss daggett be very much in earnest patty conclude that she must necessarily make some choice accordingly she pick out a lavender moir silk trim with soft white lace at the throat and wrist although old-fashioned it be plain and very simply make and would patty thought be less conspicuous than the more elaborate gown that be just the one i have decide on myself say miss daggett and i should have worn that anyway whatever you have say then why do you call I over say patty move to impatience by this inconsistency oh because i want you opinion and i want to ask you about some other thing kenneth be come to-night you know yes i know it say patty and i be very glad this frank statement and the clear unembarrassed light in patty 's eye seem to please miss daggett and she kiss the pretty face upturn to hers but she only say : run along now child go home i do not want company now i be glad of it patty think to herself but she only say : good-bye then miss daggett i 'll see you this evening wait a minute child come back here i be not through with you yet patty groan in spirit but go back with a smile face miss daggett regard she steadily you be pretty busy i suppose to-day she say get ready for you play yes i be say patty frankly and you do not want to take the time to come over here to see I do you oh i shall have time enough to do all i want to do say patty do not evade my question child you do not want to come do you well miss daggett say patty you be often quite frank with I so now i 'll be frank with you and confess that when you message come i do wish you have choose some other day to send for I for i certainly have a lot of little thing to do but i shall get they all do i know and i be very glad to learn that you be come to the entertainment you be a good girl say miss daggett you be a good girl and i like you very much good-bye good-bye say patty and she run downstairs and over home determine to work fast enough to make up for the time she have lose she succeed in this and when she father come home at night bring mr hepworth with he they find a very charming little hostess await they and boxley hall imbue throughout with a air of comfortable hospitality after dinner patty don she diana costume and come down to ask she father 's opinion of it he declare it be most jaunty and become and mr hepworth say it be especially well adapt to patty 's style and that he would like to paint she portrait in that garb this seem to mr fairfield a good idea and they at once make arrangement for future sitting patty be greatly pleased will not it be fine papa she say it will be a ancestral portrait to hang in boxley hall and keep till i be a old lady like miss daggett when they reach library hall where the play be to be give patty go in at the stage entrance be meet by a crowd of excited girl who announce that florence douglass have go all to piece what do you mean cry patty what be the matter with she oh hysteric say elsie morri in great disgust first she giggle and then she burst into tear and nobody can do anything with she well she be go to be niobe anyway say patty so let she go on the stage and cut up those trick and the audience will think it be all right oh no patty we can not let she go on the stage say frank elliott she would queer the whole show well then we 'll have to leave that part out say patty oh dear wail elsie that be the funniest part of all i hate to leave that part out i know it say patty and florence do it so well i wish she would behave herself well i can not think of anything else to do but omit it i might ask papa he can think of thing when nobody else can that be so say marian uncle fred have a positive genius for suggestion i 'll step down in the audience and ask he say frank in five minute frank be back again broadly smile and mr hepworth be with he it be all right say frank i know uncle fred would fix it all he say be ` hepworth you be a bear actor take the part yourself ' and mr hepworth like the brick he be say he would do it i fairly jump at the chance say the young artist smile down into patty 's bright face i be die to be in this thing anyway and they tell I the costume be nothing but several hundred yard of greek drapery so i think it will fit I all right but you do not know the line say patty delighted at this solution of the dilemma but unable to see how it could be accomplish oh that be all right say mr hepworth merrily i shall make up my line as i go along and when i see that anyone else want to talk i shall stop and give they a chance it sound a little precarious but as there be nothing else to do and florence douglass beg they to put somebody -- anybody -- in she place and let she go home they all agree to avail themselves of mr hepworth 's service and it be fortunate they do for though the rest of the character be bright and clever representation yet it be mr hepworth 's funny impromptu joke and humourous action in the character of niobe that make the hit of the evening indeed he and kenneth harper quite carry off the laurel from the other amateur but so delighted be the vernondale young people at the success of the whole play that they be more than willing to give the praise where it belong perhaps the only one in the audience who fail to appreciate mr hepworth 's clever work be miss rachel daggett she have eye only for she beloved nephew with a occasional side glance for she pretty young neighbor after the entertainment there be a little dance for the young people and patty as president of the club receive so many compliment and so much congratulation that it be a wonder she curly head be not turn but as she walk home between she father and mr hepworth she declare that the success of the evening be in no way consequent upon she effort but depend entirely on the talent of the two travel comedian from the city chapter xvii entertaining relative spring and summer follow one another in they usual succession and as the month go by boxley hall become more beautiful and more attractively homelike both inside and out mr fairfield buy a pair of fine carriage horse and a pony and cart for patty 's own use a man be engage to take care of these and also to look after the lawn and garden patty learn much from experience and also from aunt alice 's occasional visit develop into a sensible and capable little housekeeper so determine be she to make the keep of she father 's house a real success that she try most diligently to correct all she error and improve she power patty have a natural aptitude for domestic matter and after some rough place be make smooth and some sharp corner round off thing go quite as smoothly as in many house where the preside genius number twice patty 's year with June come vacation and patty be more than glad for she be never fond of school and now could have all she time to devote to she beloved home and too she want very much to invite she cousin to visit she which be only possible in vacation time i think papa she say as they sit on the veranda one June evening after dinner i think i shall have a house party i shall invite all my cousin from elmbridge and philadelphium and boston and we 'll have a grand general reunion that will be most beautiful you 'll invite you aunt and uncle too say mr fairfield why i do not see how we would have room for so many say patty and of course go on she father you would invite the whole elliott family it would not be fair to leave they out of you house-party just because they happen to live in vernondale then patty see that she father be laugh at she i know you be tease I now papa she say but i do not see why just because i want to ask my cousin to come here and return the visit i make to they last year but you do not visit they all at once my child and you certainly could not expect to entertain they here all at once you list of cousin be a very long one and even if there be room for they in the house the care and responsibility of such a house party would be enough to land you in a sanitarium when it be over if not before there be a awful lot of they say patty and they be not altogether congenial say she father although i have not see they as lately as you have yet i can not help think from what you tell I that the barlow and the st clair would enjoy themselves better if they visit here at different time and i be sure the same be true of you boston cousin you be right say patty as you always be and i do not believe i would have much fun with all that company at once either so i think we 'll have they in detachment and first i 'll just invite ethelyn and reginald down for a week or two i do not really care much about have they but ethelyn have write so often that she want to come that i do not see how i can very well get out of it if she want to come you certainly ought to ask she you visit there three month you know yes i know it and they be very kind to I aunt isabel have party and do thing for my pleasure all the time well i 'll invite they right away perhaps i ought to ask aunt isabel too yes you might ask she say mr fairfield and she can bring the child down but she probably will not stay as long as they do so patty write for she aunt and cousin and the first day of July they arrive mr st clair who be patty 's aunt only by marriage be a very fashionable woman of a pretty but somewhat artificial type she like young people and have spare no pain to make patty 's visit to she a happy one but it be quite evident that she expect patty to return she hospitality in kind and she have be at boxley hall but a few hour before she begin to inquire what plan patty have make for she entertainment now though patty have think out several little pleasure for she cousin it have not occur to she that aunt isabel would expect party make for she she evade she aunt 's question however and wait for a opportunity to speak alone with she father about it why papa she exclaim that evening after they guest have go to they room aunt isabel expect I to have a tea or reception or something for she nonsense child she can not think of such a thing yes she do papa and what be more i want to do it she be very kind to I and i would rather please she than ethelyn i do not care much for ethelyn anyway she be not just you kind be she my girl no she be not like marian nor any of the club girl she have she head full of fashion and beau and grown-up thing of all sort she be just my age but you would think she be about twenty would not you yes she do look almost as old as that and she act quite as old reginald be a nice boy yes but he be pompous and stuck-up he always do put on grand air aunt isabel do too but she be so kind-hearted and generous nobody can help like she well have a party for she if you want to chicken but do not take the responsibility of it entirely on yourself i should think you might make it a pretty little afternoon tea get aunt alice to make out the invitation list she know better than you what lady to invite and then let pacettus send up whatever you want for the feast i have no doubt pansy will be willing to attend to the floral decoration of the house i have no doubt she will say patty laugh the trouble will be to stop she before she turn the whole place into a horticultural exhibit well go ahead with it patty i think it will please you aunt very much but do not wear yourself out over it next morning at breakfast patty announce she plan for a afternoon tea and aunt isabel be delighted you dear child she exclaim how sweet of you i hate to have you go to any trouble on my account but i shall be so pleased to meet the vernondale lady i want to know what kind of people my niece be grow up among i be sure you 'll like they aunt isabel aunt alice 's friend be lovely and then i 'll ask the mother of the tea club girl and my neighbor miss daggett but i do not believe she 'll come be that the rich miss daggett ask aunt isabel curiously the queer one i do not know whether she be rich or not say patty i dare say she be though because she have lovely thing but she certainly can be call queer i be very fond of she though she be awfully nice to I and i like she in spite of she queerness but you 'll ask some young lady too will not you say ethelyn i do not care very much for queer old maid and middle-aged married lady oh this be not for you ethel say patty i 'll have a child 's party for you and reginald some other day child 's party indeed say ethelyn turn up she haughty little nose you know very well patty i have not consider myself a child for year nor i say reginald well i consider myself one say patty i be not in a bit of hurry to be grown-up but we be go to have a lovely sailing party ethelyn on fourth of July and i be sure you 'll enjoy that be any young man go say ethelyn there be a lot of boy go say patty but the only young man will be my father and uncle charley and mr hepworth who be mr hepworth he be a artist friend of papa 's who come out quite often and who always go sailing with we when we have sailing party aunt alice be more than willing to help patty with she project and the result be a very pretty little afternoon tea at boxley hall i be so glad i bring my white crpe-de-chine say aunt isabel as she dress for the occasion i be glad too say patty for it be a lovely gown and you look sweet in it i have bring a lot of pretty dress too say ethelyn and i suppose i may as well put on one of the prettiest to-day as there be no use in waste they on those child 's party you be talk about do just as you like ethelyn say patty know that she cousin be always overdressed on all occasion and therefore it make little difference what she wear and sure enough ethelyn array herself in a most resplendent gown which though very beautiful be make in a style more suit to a belle of several season than a young miss of sixteen patty wear one of she pretty little white house dress and aunt alice in a lovely gray gown assist she to receive the guest and to introduce mr st clair and she child among the late arrival be miss daggett she coming create a sensation for as be well know in vernondale she rarely attend social affair of any sort but for some unknown reason she choose to accept patty 's invitation and garb in a old-fashioned brown velvet she be present to mr st clair i be so glad to see you say the latter shake hand effusively humph say miss daggett why should you be glad to see I pray why because -- because -- mr st clair flounder a little and seem really unable to give any reason because you have hear that i be rich and old and queer say miss daggett this be exactly true but mr st clair do not care to admit it so she say : why no not that but i have hear my niece speak of you so often that i feel anxious to meet you well i be not afraid of anything patty fairfield say about I she be a dear little girl i be very fond of she why do you call she little girl say mr st clair patty be in she seventeenth year surely that be not quite a child but she be a child at heart say miss daggett and i be glad of it i would far rather see she with she pretty sunshiny childish way than to see she like that overdressed little minx standing over there beside she whoever she may be that be my daughter say mr st clair without however look as deeply offended as she might have do oh be it say miss daggett sniff well i see no reason to change my opinion of she if she be no say mr st clair of course we be each entitle to we own opinion now i think my daughter more appropriately dress than my niece and i think you nephew will agree with I she add smile my nephew snap miss daggett do you know he oh yes indeed we meet mr harper at a reception in new york not long ago and he be very much charm with my daughter ethelyn he may have seem so say miss daggett scornfully he be a very polite young man but let I tell you he admire patty fairfield more than any other girl he have ever see he tell I so himself and now go away if you please i be tired of talk to you mr st clair be not very much surprised at this speech for patty have tell she of miss daggett 's summary method of dismiss people and so with a sweet smile and a bow the fashionable matron leave the eccentric and indignant spinster chapter xviii a sailing party after aunt isabel have go home patty devoted herself to the entertainment of she young cousin and they seem to require a great deal of entertainment -- both ethelyn and reginald want something do for they pleasure all the time they do not hesitate to express very freely they opinion of the pleasure plan for they and as they be sophisticated young person they frequently scorn the simple gaiety in which patty and she vernondale companion find pleasure however they condescend to be please at the idea of a sailing party for as there be no water near they own home a yacht be a novelty to they at first ethelyn think to appear interesting by express timid doubt as to the safety of the picnic party but she soon find that the vernondale young people have no foolish fear of that sort fourth of July be a bright clear day warm but very pleasant with a good stiff breeze blow patty be up early and when ethelyn come downstairs she find she cousin with the aid of mancy and pansy packing up what seem to be luncheon enough for the whole party do not anybody else take anything she inquire oh yes say patty they all do i be only take cold chicken and stuff egg you have no idea what a appetite sailing give you ethelyn look very pretty in a yachting suit of white serge while patty 's sailor gown be of more prosaic blue flannel trim with white braid that be a sweet dress ethelyn say patty but i be awfully afraid you 'll spoil it you know we do not go in a beautiful yacht all white paint and polished brass we go in a big old schooner that be roomy and safe but not overly clean oh it do not matter say ethelyn i dare say i shall spoil it but i have nothing else that be just right to wear all aboard shout a cheery voice and kenneth harper 's laughing face appear in the doorway oh good-morning cry patty smile gaily back at he i be so glad to see you this be my cousin miss st clair ethelyn may i present mr harper immediately ethelyn assume a coquettish and simpering demeanor i have meet mr harper before she say though i dare say he do not remember I oh yes indeed i do say kenneth gallantly we meet at a reception in the city and i be delighted to see you again especially on such a jolly occasion as i feel sure to-day be go to be do you think it be quite safe say ethelyn with what she consider a charming timidity i have never be sail you know and i be not very brave oh pshaw of course it be safe bar accident but you be always liable to those even in a automobile hello here come hepworth glad to see you old chap mr hepworth receive a general storm of glad greeting be present to the stranger and announce himself as ready to carry basket box rug wrap or whatever be to be transport mr fairfield as general manager portion out the luggage and then each pick up he individual charge they start off on the way they meet the elliott family similarly equip and equally enthusiastic and the whole crowd proceed down to the wharf there they find about thirty young people await they all the girl of the tea club be there and all the boy who insist on call themselves honorary member of the club it be a beautiful day say guy morri but no good at all for sail the breeze have die down entirely and i do not believe it will come up again all day that 's real cheerful be not it say frank elliott i should be incline to doubt it myself but guy be such a weatherwise genius and he almost never make a mistake in he prognostication well it remain to be see what the day will bring forth say uncle charley but in the meantime we 'll get aboard the laughing crowd pile themselves on board the big schooner stow away all the basket and bundle and settle themselves comfortably in various part of the boat some sit in the stern other climb to the top of the cabin while other prefer the bow and one or two adventurous spirit clamber out to the end of the long bowsprit and sit with they foot dangle above the water ethelyn give some affect little cry of horror at this but frank elliott reassure she by tell she that it be always a part of the performance why i have see you dignified cousin patty do it in fact she generally festoon herself along the edge of the boat in some precarious position do not do it to-day will you patty besought ethelyn with a ridiculous air of solicitude no i will not say patty i 'll be real good and do just as you want I to noble girl say kenneth harper i know how hard it be for you to be good it be indeed say patty laughing and i insist upon have due credit as a rule the vernondale party be exciting affair the route be down the river to the sound from the sound to the bay and if the day be very favourable out into the ocean and perhaps around staten island patty have hope for this most extended trip today in order that ethelyn and reginald might see a sailing party at its very best but after they have be on board a hour they have cover only the few mile of river and find themselves well out into the sound but with no seeming prospect of go any farther the breeze have die away entirely and as the sun rise higher the heat be become decidedly uncomfortable ethelyn begin to fidget she pretty white serge frock have come in contact with some muddy rope and some oily screw and several unsightly spot be the result this make she cross for she hate to have she costume spoil so early in the day and besides she be unpleasantly conscious that she fair complexion be rapidly take on a deep shade of red she know this be unbecome but when reginald with brotherly frankness inform she that she nose look like a poppy bud she lose she temper and relapse into a sulky fit i do not see any fun in a sailing party if this be one she say oh this be not one say guy morris good-humoredly this be just a first-class fizzle we often have they and though they be not as much fun as a real good sailing party yet we manage to get a good time out of they some way i do not see how say ethelyn who be grow very ill-tempered we 'll show you say frank elliott kindly there be lot of thing to do on board a boat besides sail there do seem to be and notwithstanding the heat and the sunburn -- yes even the mosquito -- those happy-go-lucky young people find way to have a real good time they sing song and tell story and joke and show each other clever little game and trick one of the boy have a camera and he take picture of the whole crowd both singly and in group mr hepworth draw caricature portrait and kenneth harper give some of he funny impersonation except for the responsibility of she cousin 's entertainment patty enjoy herself exceedingly but then she be always a happy little girl and never allow herself to be discomfited by trifle everybody be surprise when aunt alice announce that it be time for luncheon and though all be disappoint at the failure of the sail everybody seem to take it philosophically and even merrily what be the matter say ethelyn why do not we go the matter be say mr fairfield we be becalm there be no breeze and consequently nothing to make we bonny ship move so she stand still and be we go to stay right here all day ask ethelyn it look very much like it unless a ocean steamer come along and give we a tow aunt alice and the girl of the party soon have the luncheon ready and the merry feast be make as frank remark it be a very different thing to sit there in the broiling sun and eat sandwich and devilled egg or to consume the same viand with the yacht madly fly along in roll wave and dash spray the afternoon pall a little youthful enthusiasm and determine good temper could make light of several hour of discomfort but toward three o'clock the sun 's ray grow unbearably hot the glare from the water be very try and the mosquito be something awful guy morri who probably spend more of he time in a boat than any of the other declare that he have never see such a day mr fairfield feel sorry for ethelyn who have never have such a experience before and so he exert himself to entertain she but she resist all he attempt and even though patty come to she father 's assistance they find it impossible to make they guest happy reginald be no better he growl and fret about the heat and other discomfort and he be so pompous and overbearing in he manner that it be not surprising that the boy of vernondale cordially dislike he as long as we can not go sailing say ethelyn i should think we would go home we can not get home say patty patiently she have already explain this several time to she cousin there be no breeze to take we anywhere well what will happen to we then shall we stay here forever there ought to be a breeze in two or three day say kenneth harper who could not resist the temptation to chaff this ill-tempered young person say by Tuesday or Wednesday i should think a capful of wind might puff up in some direction it be come now say frank elliott suddenly i certainly feel a draught put something around you my boy say he mother i do not want you to take cold let I get you a wrap say frank smile back at he mother who be fan herself with a fold newspaper the wind be come say guy morri and he serious face be a sharp contrast to the merry one about he and it be no joke this time within ten minute there 'll be a stiff breeze and within twenty a howling gale or i be no sailor as he speak he be busily prepare to reef the mainsail and he consult hurriedly with the sailor at first no one could believe guy 's prophecy would come true but in a few moment the cool breeze be distinctly feel the sun go under a cloud and the boat begin to move it be a sudden squall and the cloud thicken and mass themselves into great hill of blackness the water turn dark and begin to rise in little threatening billow the wind grow stronger and stronger and then without warn the rain come thunder and lightning add to the excitement of the occasion and in less than fifteen minute the smooth sunny glare of water be at the mercy of a fearful storm the occupant of the boat seem to know exactly how to behave in these circumstance mr elliott and the girl of the party go down into the little cabin which hold they all but which be very crowded guy morri take command and the other boy and man too for that matter do exactly as he tell they ethelyn begin to cry this be really not surprising as the girl have never before have such a experience and be exceedingly nervous as well as very much frightened mr elliott appreciate this and put she arm around the sob child comfort she with great tact and patience the storm pass as quickly as it come there have be danger both real and plentiful but no bad result attend except that everybody be more or less wet with the rain the boy be more and the girl less but to ethelyn 's surprise they all seem to view the whole performance quite as a matter of course and accept the situation with the same merry philosophy that they have show in the morning the thermometer have fall many degree and the cold wind against damp clothing cause a most unpleasant sensation it be a ill wind that blow nobody good say guy this breeze will take we home spin i be glad of it say ethelyn snappishly i have have quite enough of the sailing party frank confide to patty afterward that he feel like respond that the sailing party have have quite enough of she but instead he say politely : oh do not be so easily discourage better luck next time to which ethelyn reply still crossly there 'll be no next time for I chapter xix more cousin patty be not sorry when she elmbridge cousin conclude they visit and the evening after they departure she sit on the veranda with she father talk about they it be a pity she say that ethelyn be so ill-tempered for she be so pretty and graceful and she be really very bright and entertaining when she be pleased but so much of the time she be displeased and then there be no do anything with she she be selfish patty say she father and selfishness be just about the worst fault in the catalogue a selfish person can not be happy you probably learn something to that effect from you early copybook but it be none the less true i know it papa and i do think that selfish ness be the worst fault there be and though i fight against it do you know i sometimes think that live here alone with you and have my own way in everything be make I rather a selfish individual myself i do not think you need worry about that say a hearty voice and kenneth harper appear at the veranda step pardon I i be not eavesdropping but i could not help overhear you last remark and i think it my duty to set you mind at rest on that score selfishness be not you besetting sin miss patty fairfield and i can not allow you to libel yourself i quite agree with you ken say mr fairfield my small daughter may not be absolutely perfect but selfishness be not one of she fault at least that be the conclusion i have come to after observe she pretty carefully through she long and checkered career well if i be not selfish i will certainly become vain if so many compliment be heap upon I say patty laughing and i be sure i value very highly the opinion of two such wise man oh say a man and a boy say young harper modestly all right i will say patty but i be not sure which be which sometimes i think papa more of a boy than you be ken now you have succeed in compliment we both at once say mr fairfield which prove you clever as well as unselfish well never mind I for the present say patty i want to talk about some other people and they be some more of my cousin a commodity with which you seem to be well supply say kenneth indeed i be i have a large stock yet in reserve and i think papa that i 'll ask bob and bumble to visit I for a few week do say mr fairfield if you would enjoy have they but not otherwise you have just be through a siege of entertaining cousin and i think you deserve a vacation oh but these be so different say patty bob and bumble be nothing like the st clair they enjoy everything and they be always happy i like they name say kenneth bumble be not exactly romantic but it sound awfully jolly she be jolly say patty and so be bob they be twin about sixteen and they be just brim over with fun and mischief bumble 's real name be helen but i guess no one ever call she that helen seem to mean a fair tall girl slender and graceful and rather willowy and bumble be just the opposite of that : she be round and solid and always tumble down at least she use to be but she may have outgrow that habit now anyway she be a dear and what be bob like ask she father i have not see he since he be a baby bob oh he be just plain boy awfully nice and oblige and good-hearted and unselfish but i do not believe he 'll ever be president i think i shall like you two cousin say kenneth with a air of conviction when be they come i shall ask they right away and i hope they 'll soon come how much longer shall you be in vernondale oh i think i be a fixture for the summer aunt locky want I to spend my whole vacation here and i do not know of any good reason why i should not i be very glad it will be awfully nice to have you here when the twin be and perhaps somebody else will be here too i be go to ask nan allen who be she inquire mr fairfield oh papa do not you remember about she she be a friend of the barlow and live near they in philadelphium and she be visit they down at long island when i be there last summer she be perfectly lovely she be a grown-up young lady compare to bumble and I -- she be about twenty-two i think -- and i know kenneth will lose he heart to she he 'll have no more use for schoolgirl probably not say kenneth but i be afraid the adorable young lady will have no use for I she will not if hepworth 's around and he usually be he be always cut I out nothing of the sort say patty staunchly mr hepworth be very nice but he be papa 's friend and whose friend be i say young harper you be everybody 's friend say patty smile at he you be just ` we ken ' miss nan allen be delighted to accept a invitation to boxley hall and it be arrange that she and the barlow twin should spend August there a month be quite a long visit pattikin say she father yes but you see papa i stay there three month now if three of they stay here one month it will be the same proportion and besides i like they and i want they to stay a good while i sha not get tire of they i do not believe you will but you may get tired of the care of housekeeping with guest for so long a time but if you do i shall pick up the whole tribe of you and bundle off for a trip of some sort oh papa i wish you would do that i would be perfectly delighted i 'll do my best to get tired just so you 'll take we but if i remember you report of you barlow cousin it seem to I they would not make the most desirable travel companion be not they the one who be so helter-skelter never be ready on time never know where thing be and in fact have never learn the meaning of the phrase ` law and order ' yes they be the one and truly they be something dreadful do not you remember they have a party and forget to send out the invitation and the first night i reach there when i go to visit they they forget to have any bed in my room yes i think i remember you write to I about some such doings and do you think you can enjoy a month with such visitor as that oh yes papa because they will not upset _ my _ house and really they be the dearest people oh i be awfully fond of bob and bumble i and nan allen be lovely nobody can help like she she be not so helter-skelter as the other but down at the hurly-burly nobody could help lose they thing why i even grow careless myself well have you company child and i 'll do all i can to make it pleasant for you and for they i know you will you dear old pearl of a father sometimes i think you enjoy my company as much as i do myself but i suppose you do not really i suppose you entertain the young people and pretend to enjoy it just to make I happy i be happy dear in anything that make you happy though sixteen be not exactly a age contemporary with my own but i enjoy have hepworth down and i like young harper a great deal then of course i have my little friend mr and mr elliott to play with -- so i be not entirely dependent on the kindergarten the barlow twin and nan allen be expect to arrive on Thursday afternoon at four o'clock and everything at boxley hall be in readiness for the arrival of the guest not that it be worth while to have everything in such spick-and-span order say patty to herself for the barlow will not appreciate it and what be more they 'll turn everything inside out and upside down before they have be in the house a hour but notwithstanding she conviction she make she preparation as carefully as if for the most fastidious visitor and view the result with great satisfaction after it be finish she go down in the carriage to meet the train delighted at the thought of see again she barlow cousin of whom she be really very fond i wish aunt grace and uncle ted be come too she say to herself but i suppose i could not take care of so many people at once it would be like run a hotel the train have not arrive when they reach the station so tell the coachman to wait patty leave the carriage and walk up and down the station platform hello patty have not you cousin come yet why kenneth be that you no they have not come i think the train must be late yes it be a little but there it be now just come into sight around the curve may i stay and meet they or would you rather fall on they neck alone oh stay i would be glad to have you but you 'll have to walk back there be no room in the carriage for you oh that be all right i have my wheel thank you the train stop and a number of passenger alight but as the train go on and the small crowd disperse patty remark in a most exasperated tone : well they do not come on that train i just know they would not they be the most aggravating people now nobody know whether they be on that train and do not know enough to get off or whether they miss it at the new york end what time be the next train i be not sure say kenneth let 's go in the station and find out the next train be due at 430 but the expect guest do not arrive on that either there be no use in get annoyed say patty laughing for it be really nothing more nor less than i expect the barlow never catch the train they intend to take and miss allen be she the same kind of a ` old reliable ' no nan be different and i believe that leave to herself she would be on time though probably not ahead of time but i have never see she except with the barlow and when she be down at the hurly-burly she be just about as uncertain as the rest of they be the hurly-burly the barlow homestead well it be they summer home and it be really a lovely place but its name just express it i spend three month there last summer and i have a awfully good time but no one ever know what be go to happen next or when it would come off but everybody be so good-natured that they do not mind a bit well i suppose we may as well drive back home there be no tell when these people will come very likely not until to-morrow just then a small messenger boy come up to patty and hand she a telegram just as i think exclaimed patty they have do some crazy thing open the yellow envelope she read : take wrong train carry through to philadelphia back this evening bob well then they can not get here until that nine-o'clock train come in say kenneth so there be no use in you wait any longer now no i suppose not say patty i be awfully disappointed i wish they have come a east-bound train have just come into the station and patty and kenneth stand idly watch it when suddenly patty exclaim : there they be now do you ever know such ridiculous people chapter xx a fair exchange we do not have to go to philadelphium after all explain bob after greeting have be exchange we find we could get off at new brunswick and come back from there why do not you find out that before telegraph laugh patty never once think of it say bob you know the barlow be not note for ingenuity well they be note for better thing than that say patty as she affectionately squeeze bumble 's plump arm we would not have think of it at all say honest bob if it have not be for nan she suggest it well i be send along with instruction to look after you two rattle-pated youngster say nan and so i have to do something to live up to my privilege and now bob you look after the luggage will you let I help say kenneth where be you check miss allen here be the check for the trunk and there be three suit-case the one that have not any name on be mine and you tell it by the fact that it have a extra handle on the end i be very proud of that handle i have it put on by special order and it be so convenient and it be identification besides i do not want my name paint on i think it spoil a brand-new suit-case to have letter all over it we 'll find they all right come on barlow say kenneth and the two young man start off they return in a few moment with the three suit-case bob bring he own and he sister 's while kenneth harper carefully carry the immaculate leather case with the handle on the end these be deposit in the fairfield carriage patty and she guest be also tuck in and they start for the house while kenneth follow on he wheel come over to-night patty call back to he as they leave he behind and though he answer be lose in the distance she have little doubt as to its tenor what a nice young fellow say nan who be he he be the nephew of we next-door neighbor say patty and he be spend he vacation with he aunt he be a jolly all-round chap say bob yes he be just that say patty i think you would like he you 'll like all the young people here they be a awfully nice crowd i be so glad to see _ you _ again say bumble i do not care whether i like the other young people or not and i want to see uncle fred too i have not see he for year and year oh he be one of the young people say patty laughing he go ` most everywhere with we i tell he he be more of a boy than ken as they drive up to the house bumble exclaim with delight at the beautiful flower and the well-kept appearance of the whole place what a lovely home she cry i do not see how you ever put up with we tumble-down old place patty nonsense say patty i have the time of my life down at the hurly-burly last summer well we be go to have the time of we life at boxley hall this summer i feel sure of that say bob as he spring out of the carriage and then help the other out i hope you will say patty you be very welcome to boxley hall and i want you just to look upon it as you home and conduct yourselve accordingly nan can do that say bumble but i be afraid if bob and i do it you beautiful home would soon lose its present spick-and-span effect all right let it lose say patty we 'll have a good time anyhow and now she go on as she take the guest to they room there 'll be just about a hour before dinner time but if you get ready before that come down you 'll probably find I on the front veranda if i be not in the kitchen bob be the first one to reappear and he find patty and she father chat on the front veranda how do you do uncle fred he say you may know my name but i doubt if you remember my feature hello bob my boy say mr fairfield cordially grasp the hand hold out to he as i last saw you with feature of infantile vacancy i be glad to start fresh and make you acquaintance all over again thank you sir say bob as he seat himself on the veranda railing i do not know you as a infant but i dare say you be a very attractive one i think i be say mr fairfield at least i remember hear my mother say so and surely she ought to know just then bumble come out on the porch with she hair-ribbon in she hand please tie this for I patty she say i can not manage it myself and get it on quick before uncle fred see I but i be so glad to see you my dear bumble say mr fairfield that even that piece of pretty blue ribbon can not make I any gladder bumble smile back at he in she winning way and patty tie she cousin 's hair-ribbon with a decide feeling of relief that in all other respects bumble 's costume be tidy and complete where 's nan she inquire be not she ready yet why it be the funniest thing say bumble i tap at she door as i come by but she tell I to go on and not wait for she she would come down in a few minute just as pansy appear to announce dinner nan do come down and patty stare at she in amazement bob whistle and bumble exclaim : well for goodness gracious sake what be you up to now for nan instead of wear the pretty gown which bumble know she have bring in she suitcase be garb in the complete costume of a trained nurse a white piqu skirt and linen shirt-waist of immaculate and starched whiteness a apron with regulation shoulder-strap and a cap that betoken a graduate of st luke 's hospital form she surprising but not at all unbecoming outfit nan 's roguish face look very demure under the white cap and she smile pleasantly when patty at last recover she wit sufficiently to introduce she father nan she say if this be really you let I present my father and papa this be suppose to be miss nan allen but i never see she look like this before i be very glad to meet you miss allen say mr fairfield and though we be all apparently very well at present one can never tell how soon there may be need of you professional service i hope not very soon say nan laughing for my professional knowledge be scarcely sufficient to enable I to adjust this costume properly it seem to be on all right say patty look at it critically but where in the world do you get it and what have you get it on for we be not go to a masquerade i put it on say nan because i could not help myself i want to change my travel gown and when i open my suit-case this be all there be in it except some comb and brush and bottle whew say bob when i pick up that suit-case i be not quite sure i have the right one you know i go back for it after we leave the train at new brunswick and you say it be the only one in the world with a handle on the end i think it be say nan but it seem somebody else be clever enough to have a end-handle too and she be a trained nurse apparently many of the new suit-case have handle on the end say mr fairfield though not common as yet i have see a number of they but just imagine how the nurse feel who be oblige to wear you dinner gown instead of she uniform i hope she will not spoil it exclaimed bumble it be that lovely light blue thing one of the prettiest frock you own i can imagine she now say bob : she be probably bathing the brow of a sleepless patient and the lace ruffle and turquoise bugle be help along a lot in fact i think she be look rather nice go around a sick-room in that blue bombazine it be not bombazine bob say he sister it be beautiful lovely light-blue chiffon well beautiful lovely light-blue chiffon then but anyway i be sure the nurse be glad of a chance to wear it instead of she own plain clothes but she own plain clothes be not at all unpicturesque and be very become to miss allen say mr fairfield but have not you trunk come he add as they all go out to dinner no say bob mr harper and i investigate the baggage-room but they be not there oh call he kenneth say patty you boy be too young for such formality i may be say bob but he be not he be a college man he be a college boy say patty he be only nineteen and you be sixteen yourself go on seventeen say bob proudly and so be bumble twin often be the same age observe mr fairfield and after a few year bob you 'll have to be careful how you announce you own age because it will reveal you sister 's pooh i do not care say bumble i would just as lieve people would know how old i be nan be twenty-two and she do not care who know it you look about fifty in those ridiculous clothes say patty do i say nan quite unconcernedly i do not mind that a bit but i do not think i can keep they at this stage of whiteness for many day can anything be do to coax we trunk this way we might do some telephone after dinner say mr fairfield what be the situation up to the present time why you see it be this way say bumble when the carriage come to take we to the station the trunk be not quite ready and mamma say for we to go on and she would finish pack they and send they down in time to get that train or the next and do they come for that train no they do not and so of course they must have be send on the next one but even so they ought to be here now because you know we go on through and come back but how do you get you check if you trunk be not put on the train oh the baggageman know we explain bob and he give we we check and keep the duplicate to put on we trunk when they come down to the station he often do that yes say bumble we have never have we trunk ready yet when the man come for they nan 's be ready put in bob who be a great stickler for justice but of course hers could not go till ours do oh i guess they 'll turn up all right they do turn up all right twenty-four hour later but the exchange of suit-case be not so easily effect however after more or less correspondence between nan and the nurse who own the uniform the transfer be finally make and nan recover she pretty blue gown which certainly bear no evidence of have be worn in a sickroom but i bet she wear it all the same say bob she probably neglect she patient and go to a party that night just because she have the frock chapter xxi a good suggestion August at boxley hall prove to be a month of fun and frolic the barlow cousin be much easier to entertain than the st clair in fact they entertain themselves and as for nan allen she entertain everybody with whom she come in contact mr fairfield express himself as be delighted to have patty under the influence of such a gracious and charming young woman and aunt alice quite agree with he marian adored nan and though she like bumble very much indeed she take more real pleasure in the society of the older girl but they be a congenial crowd of merry young people and when mr hepworth come down from the city as he often do and kenneth harper drift in from next-door as he very often do the house party at boxley hall wax exceed merry and there be no lack of social entertainment the vernondale young people be quite ready to provide pleasure for patty 's guest and the appreciation show by nan and the barlow be a decide and very pleasant contrast to the attitude of ethelyn and reginald sailing party occur often and these nan enjoy especially for she be passionately fond of the water and dearly love sailing or rowing the tea club girl all like nan and though she be older than most of they she enjoy they meeting quite as much as bumble marian or patty herself bob soon make friend with the tea club annex as the boy of patty 's set choose to call themselves though not a club of any sort they be always invite when the tea club have anything special go on and many time when it have not one afternoon the tea club be hold its weekly meeting at marian 's do you know elsie morri be say that the baby ' hospital be in need of fund again those infant be perfect gormandiser i do not see how they can eat so much or wear so many clothes baby always wear lot of clothes say lillian desmond with a air of great wisdom i have see they they just bundle they up in everything they can find and then wrap more thing around they well they have use up all they wrapping say elsie morri and they want more i meet mr greenleaf this morning in the street and she stop I to ask if we girl would not raise some more money for they somehow oh dear say florence douglass they just want we to work all the time for the old hospital i be tired of it why florence say patty we have not do a thing since we have that play last winter i think it would be very nice to have some entertainment or something and make some money for they again we could have some summery outdoorsy kind of a thing like a lawn party you know yes say laura russell and have it rain and spoil everything and soak all the chinese lantern and drench all the people 's clothes and everybody would run into the house and track mud all over oh it would be lovely what a cheerful view you do take of thing laura say elsie morri now you know it be just as likely not to rain as to rain more likely say nan it do not rain twice as often as it rain now i believe it would be a beautiful bright day or moonlight night whichever you have the party and nobody will get they clothes spoil and the lantern will burn lovely and you will have a big crowd and it would be a howling success and you would make a awful lot of money that picture sound very attractive say polly steven and i say let 's do it but somehow i do not like a lawn party -- it be so tame let 's have something real novel and original nan you must know of something i do not say nan i be stupid as a owl about such thing but if you can decide on something to have i 'll help all i can with it and nan 's awful good help put in bumble she work and work and work and never get tired i 'll help too i would love to only i be not much good we 'll take all the help that be offer say elsie morri of any quality whatsoever but what can the show be no amount of think or discussion seem to suggest any novel enterprise by which a fortune could be make at short notice and at last nan say : i should think patty that mr hepworth could help he be always have queer sort of performance in he studio do not you know the mock art exhibition he tell we about oh yes say patty he would be sure to know of something for we to do and i think he be come out with papa to-night i 'll ask he do say elsie and tell he it must be something that be heap of fun and that we 'll all like and that be never be do here before all right say patty anything else yes it must be something to appeal to the popular taste and draw a big crowd so we can make a lot of money for the baby very well say patty i 'll tell he all that and i be sure he 'll suggest just the right thing mr hepworth do come down that night and when the girl ask he for suggestion he very willingly begin to think up plan for they i should think you might make a success he say of a

little more diffidently : do you like I best why yes of course i do say patty smile that be after papa and aunt alice and marian and uncle charley and frank and mancy and pansy -- and mr hepworth patty might not have add the last name if she have not just then see that gentleman come toward she he look at patty with a especial kindliness in he eye and say gently : miss fairfield may i see you

own taste for dancing from she father the evening pass all too swiftly pretty patty with she merry way and graceful manners be a real belle and aunt alice be besiege by request for introduction to she niece and daughter but marian though a sweet and charming girl have a certain shyness which always keep she from become a immediate favorite patty 's absolute lack of self-consciousness and she ready friendliness make she popular at once mr fairfield and nan allen be speak of this as they stand out on the veranda and look at patty through the window she be the most perfect combination miss allen be say of the child and the girl she have none of the silly affectation of young-ladyhood and yet she have in she nature all the element that go to make a wise and sensible woman i think you be right say mr fairfield as he look fondly at he daughter she be grow up just as i want she to and develop the trait i most want she to possess a frank simplicity of manner a happy fun-loving disposition and a gentle unselfish soul meantime patty and mr hepworth be sit on the stair now my cup of happiness be full remark patty i have always think it must be perfect bliss to sit on the stair at a party i do not know why i be sure but all the information i have gather from art and literature have lead I to consider it the height of earthly joy and be it prove all you fancy paint it ask mr hepworth who be sit a step below yes -- that be it be almost perfect and what be the lack element oh i would not like to tell you say patty and mr hepworth be not quite certain whether she confusion be real or simulated may i guess he ask yes if you 'll promise not to guess true say patty if you do i should be overcome with blush embarrassment but i be go to guess and if i guess true i will promise to go and bring you the element that will complete you happiness that sound so tempting say patty that now i hope you _ will _ guess true what be the miss joy kenneth harper say mr hepworth look at patty curiously without a trace of a blush patty break into gay laughter oh you be ridiculous she say i have _ you _ here why should i want he then what be it you do want and mr hepworth look away as he evade she question since you make I confess my very prosaic desire i 'll own up that i would like a strawberry ice well that be just what i be die for myself say mr hepworth gaily and if you 'll reserve this orchestra chair for I i 'll go and forage for it it look almost impossible to get through that crowd but i 'll return either with my shield or on it unless you would rather i would send harper back with the ice do just as you please say patty with a sudden touch of coquetry in she smile eye it do not matter a bit to I but though a willing messenger mr hepworth find it impossible to accomplish he errand with any degree of rapidity and when he return successful but tardy he find young harper wait where he have leave patty she be go off to dance with frank elliott explain the boy cheerfully and she say you and i could divide the ice between we all right say the artist here 's you share the next morning patty nan and marian go down to the beach for a quiet chat let 's shake everybody say patty and just go off by ourselves i be tired of a lot of people you be become such a belle patty say nan that i be afraid you 'll be bother with a lot of people the rest of you life no i will not say patty lot of people be all very well when you want they but i be go to cultivate a talent for get rid of they when you do not want they can you cultivate a talent if you have only a taste to start with say marian with more seriousness than patty 's careless remark seem to call for if you have the least little scrap of a mustard-seed of taste and plenty of will-power you can cultivate all the talent you want say patty with the air of a oracle why what do you want to do now marian marian 's ambition be a good deal of a joke in the elliott family at one time she have determine to become a musician and have spend unsuccessfully many hour and much money in she endeavor but at last she be oblige to admit that she talent do not lie in that direction later on she have try paint and notwithstanding discourage result she have feel sure of she artistic ability for a long time until at last she have prove to she own satisfaction that she be not mean to make picture and now when she ask the above question in a serious tone patty feel sure that some new scheme be ferment in she cousin 's brain what be up marian she say out with it and we 'll promise to help you if it be only by wise discouragement i think say marian unmoved by she cousin 's attitude i think i should like to be a author do say patty that be the best line you have strike yet because it be the cheapest you see nan when marian go in for painting and sculpture and music she whim cost uncle charley fabulous sum of money but this new scheme be great the outlay for a fountain pen and a few sheet of stamp can not be so very much and the scheme will keep you out of other mischief all winter it do sound attractive say nan tell we more about it be you go to write book or story book say marian calmly lovely cry patty do two at once will not you so you can dedicate one to nan and one to I at the same time i will not share my dedication with anybody you can laugh all you like say marian i do not mind a speck for i be sure i can do it i have be talk to miss fischer she be write lot of book you know and story too and she say it be awfully easy if you have a taste for it of course it be say patty that be just what i tell you if you have a taste -- good taste you know -- and plenty of will-power and stamp you can write anything you want to and i believe you 'll do it go in and win marian you can put I in you book if you want to willpower be not everything patty say nan whose face have assume a curious and somewhat wistful look at least it may be in literature but it will not do all i want it to what do you want girlie say patty i never know you have a ungratified ambition gnawing at you heart-string well i have i want to be a singer you do sing beautifully say marian i have hear you yes but i mean a great singer on the stage inquire patty yes or in concert i do not care where but i mean to sing wonderfully to sing as i feel i could sing if i have the opportunity you mean a musical education and foreign study and all those thing say patty yes say nan but after all that you might fail say marian remember she own experience yes i might and probably i should it be only a dream you know but we be talk about ambition and that be mine and can not you accomplish it i do not see how i can my parent be very much oppose to it they hate anything like a public career and they think i sing quite well enough now without further instruction i think so too say patty i would rather hear you sing those quaint little song of yours than to hear the most elaborate trill and frill that any prima donna ever accomplish you opinion be worth a great deal to I patty as a friend but technically i can not value it so highly of course i do not know much about music say patty quite unabashed but papa think so too he say you voice be the sweetest voice he ever hear do he say nan what be you ambition patty say marian after a moment 's pause nan and i have express ourselves so frankly you might tell we yours my ambition say patty why i never think of it before but i do not believe i have any i feel rather ashamed for i suppose every properly equip young woman ought to have at least one ambition and i do not seem to have a shadow of one really great one i mean of course i can sing a little not much but it seem to be enough for I and i can play a little on the piano and on the banjo and i suppose it be shocking but really i do not care to play any better than i do i can not paint and i can not write story but i do not want to do either you can keep house say marian patty 's eye light up yes she say be not it ridiculous but i do really believe that be my ambition to keep house just perfectly you know and have everything go not only smoothly but happily you ought to have be a _ chatelaine _ of the fourteenth century say nan yes say patty eagerly that be just my ambition what a pity it be look backward instead of forward but i would love to live in a great stone castle all my own with a moat and drawbridge and outrider and go around in a damask gown with a pointed bodice and big puffy sleeve and a ruff and a little cap with pearl on it and a bunch of key jingle at my side they usually carry the key in a basket observe marian and you forget to mention the falcon on you wrist so i do say patty but i think the falcon would be a regular nuisance while i be housekeeping so i would put he in the basket and set it up on the mantelpiece and keep my key jingle from my belt well it seem say nan that patty have more hope of realize she ambition than either of we speak for yourself say marian i think i have say patty i have all the key i want and i be quite sure papa would buy I a falcon if i ask he to chapter xxiv a afternoon drive the next Saturday mr fairfield propose that they all go for a drive to allaire what be allaire say patty it be a desert village reply she father the house be empty the old mill be silent the street be overgrow in fact it be nothing but a picturesque ruin of a once busy hamlet they say it be a lovely drive say nan i have always want to go there the boy will be down by noon say mr elliott and we can get off soon after luncheon do you suppose fred we can get conveyance enough for we large and flourishing family we can try say mr fairfield i 'll go over to the stable now and see what i can secure on he return he find that hepworth kenneth and frank have arrive well Saturday 's child he say i be glad to see you i always know it be the last day of the week when this illustrious trio burst upon my vision we be awfully glad to burst say frank and we hope you vision can stand it oh yes say mr fairfield the sight of you be good for the eye and now i 'll tell you the plan for the afternoon what luck do you have with the carriage papa ask impatient patty that be what i be about to tell you my child if you 'll give I half a chance i secure four safe and more or less commodious vehicle four exclaim marian we 'll be a regular parade shall we have a band ask nan of course say kenneth and a fife-and-drum corps besides you will not need that say patty for there 'll be no ` girl i leave behind I ' we be all go of course we be all go say mr fair-field and as we shall have one extra seat you can invite some girl who otherwise would be leave behind if frank do not mind say patty with a mischievous glance at she cousin i would like to ask miss kitty nelson they all laugh for frank 's admiration for the charming kitty be a open secret frank blush a little but he hold he own and say : be they all double carriage uncle fred no my boy there be two trap and two victoria all right then i 'll take one of the trap and drive miss nelson bravo boy if you do not see what you want ask for it miss allen will you trust yourself to I in the other trap with great pleasure mr fairfield reply nan and please appreciate my amiability for i think they be most jolty and uncomfortable thing to ride in i speak for a seat in one of the victoria say aunt alice and i think it wise to get my claim in quickly as the bid be be make so rapidly i do not care how i go say patty or what i go in i be so amiable a child can play with I to-day i 'll go in a wheelbarrow if necessary i have hope to drive you over myself say mr hepworth who sit next to she speaking in a low tone but i 'll push you in a wheelbarrow if you prefer you go with I patty in one of the trap will not you say kenneth who sit on the veranda railing at she other side patty 's face take on a comical smile of amusement at these two request but she answer both at once by merrily say : then it all adjust itself mr and mr allen and mr and mr elliott shall have the most comfortable carriage and marian and mr hepworth and ken and i will go in the other that seem to be the best possible arrangement and about three o'clock the procession start patty and marian take the back seat of the open carriage mr hepworth and kenneth harper sit face they as marian have already become very much interested in she new fad of authorship and as under miss fischer 's tuition she be rapidly develop into a real little blue-stocking it be not strange that the conversation turn in that direction i look in all the bookshop in the city for you latest work miss marian say mr hepworth but they must have be all sell out for i could not find any too bad say marian i be afraid you 'll have to wait until a new edition be print you be not to tease marian say patty reprovingly she be be as patient as a angel under a perfect storm of chaff and i be not go to allow any more of it i do not mind say marian i think if one be really in earnest one ought not to be annoy by good-natured fun quite right say kenneth and ambition if it be worth anything ought to rise above comment of any sort it ought to be strengthen by comment of any sort say mr hepworth of any sort ask marian thoughtfully yes for comment always imply recognition and that in itself mean progress have you a ambition mr hepworth say patty suddenly but you have already achieve yours you be a successful artist a man may have more than one ambition say mr hepworth slowly and i have _ not _ achieve my dearest one i suppose you want to paint even better than you do say patty yes say the artist smile a little i hope i shall always want to paint better than i do what be you ambition harper to build bridge say kenneth i be go to be a civil engineer but my ambition be to be a bridge-builder and i 'll get there yet he add with a determine nod of he head i think you will say mr hepworth and i be sure i hope so then the talk turn to lighter theme than ambition and merry laughter and jest fill up the mile to allaire all be delighted with the place aside from the picturesque ruin building and the eerie mysterious-looking old mill there be a novel interest in the strange silent air of desertion that seem to invest the place with a almost palpable loneliness i do not like it say patty come on let 's go home but to marian 's more romantic imagination it all seem most attractive so different be she temperament from that of she sunshiny merry-hearted cousin at last they do go home and patty chatter gaily all the way in order as she say to drive away the musty recollection of that forlorn old place how do you like it nan she ask when they be all back at the hotel i think it beautiful say nan smile that evening there be a small informal dance in the parlor not a large hop like the one give the week before but patty declare the small affair be just as much fun as the other i always have all the fun i can possibly hold anyway she say and what more can anybody have toward the close of the evening mr fairfield come up to patty who be sit with a crowd of merry young people in a cosey corner of the veranda patty he say do not you want to come for a little stroll on the board walk yes of course i do say patty wonder a little but always ready to go with she father be nan go no i just want you say mr fairfield all right say patty i be glad to go they join the crowd of promenader on the board walk and as they pass patty 's favorite bit of beach she say : that be where we girl sit and talk about we ambition yes so i have hear say mr fairfield and what be you ambition baby oh mine be not half so grand and gorgeous as the other girl ' they want to do great thing like singing in grand opera and write immortal book and thing like that and you modest ambition be to be a good housekeeper be not it well yes papa but not only that i be think about it afterward by myself and i think that the housekeeping be the practical part of it -- and that be a good big part too -- but what i really want to be be a lovely good _ womanly _ woman like aunt alice you know i do not believe she ever want to write book or paint picture no she never do say mr fairfield and i quite agree with you that she ambition be just as high and noble as those other you mention well i be glad you think so papa for i be afraid i might seem to you very small and petty to have all my ambition bound by the four wall of my own home no patty girl i think those be far better than unbounded ambition far more easily realize and will bring you greater and better happiness but do not you see my child that the very fact of you have a talent -- which you certainly have -- for housekeeping and home-making imply that some day in the far future i hope you will go away from I and make a home of you own very likely i shall papa but that be so far in the future that it be not worth while bother about it now but i be go to bother about it now to a certain extent do you realize that when this do come to pass be it ever so far hence that you be go to leave you poor old father all alone and that too after i have so carefully bring you up for the express purpose of make a home for I well what be you go to do about it say patty who be by no means take she father 's remark seriously do why i be go to do just this i be go to get somebody else to keep my house for I and i be go to get she now so that i 'll have she ready against the time you leave I patty turn and by the light of a electric lamp which they be pass see the smile on she father 's face and with a sudden intuition she exclaim : nan yes reply she father nan how do you like it like it exclaim patty i _ love _ it i think it be perfectly gorgeous i be just as delighted as i can be how do nan like it she seem delighted too say mr fairfield smile the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of patty at
