society the american antiquarian society the numismatic and antiquarian society of philum etc author of the myth of the new world the religious sentiment etc 1882 to elus k price esq president of the numismatic and antiquarian society of philadelphium whose enlighten interest have for many year and in many way further the progress of knowledge this volume be respectfully dedicate by the author preface this little volume be a contribution to the comparative study of religion it be a endeavor to present in a critically correct light some of the fundamental conception which be find in the native belief of the tribe of america so little have heretofore be do in this field that it have yield a very scanty harvest for purpose of general study it have not yet even pass the stage where the distinction between myth and tradition have be recognize nearly all historian continue to write about some of the american hero-god as if they have be chief of tribe at some undetermined epoch and the effort to trace the migration and affiliation of nation by similarity in such story be of almost daily occurrence how baseless and misleading all such argument must be it be one of my object to set forth at the same time i have endeavor to be temperate in apply the interpretation of mythologist i be aware of the risk one run in look at every legend as a light or storm myth my guide principle have be that when the same and that a very extraordinary story be tell by several tribe wholly apart in language and location then the probability be enormous that it be not a legend but a myth and must be explain as such it be a spontaneous production of the mind not a reminiscence of a historic event the importance of the study of myth have be abundantly show of recent year and the method of analyze they have be establish with satisfactory clearness the time have long since pass at least among think man when the religious legend of the lower race be look upon as trivial fable or as the invention of the father of lie they be neither the one nor the other they express in image and incident the opinion of these race on the mightiest topic of human thought on the origin and destiny of man he motive for duty and he grounds of hope and the source history and fate of all external nature certainly the sincere expression on these subject of even humble member of the human race deserve we most respectful heed and it may be that we shall discover in they crude or coarse narration gleam of a mental light which they proud aryan brother have be long in come to or have not yet reach the prejudice against all the lower faith inspire by the claim of christianity to a monopoly of religious truth -- a claim nowise set up by its founder -- have lead to extreme injustice toward the so-called heathen religion little effort have be make to distinguish between they good and evil tendency or even to understand they i do not know of a single instance on this continent of a thorough and intelligent study of a native religion make by a protestant missionary so little real work have be do in american mythology that very diverse opinion as to its interpretation prevail among writer too many of they apply to it facile generalization such as heliolatry animism ancestral worship primitive philosophizing and think that such a sesame will unloose all its mystery the result have be that while each satisfy himself he convince no one else i have try to avoid any such bias and have seek to discover the source of the myth i have select by close attention to two point : first that i should obtain the precise original form of the myth by a rigid scrutiny of authority and secondly that i should bring to bear upon it modern method of mythological and linguistic analysis the first of these requirement have give I no small trouble the source of american history not only differ vastly in merit but many of they be almost inaccessible i still have by I a list of book of the first order of importance for these study which i have not be able to find in any public or private library in the united state i have be free in give reference for the statement in the text the grow custom among historian of omit to do this must be deplore in the interest of sound learn it be better to risk the charge of pedantry than to leave at fault those who wish to test a author 's accuracy or follow up the line of investigation he indicate on the other hand i have exercise moderation in draw comparison with aryan semitic egyptian and other old world mythology it would have be easy to have note apparent similarity to a much greater extent but i have prefer to leave this for those who write upon general comparative mythology such parallelism to reach satisfactory result should be attempt only by those who have study the oriental religion in they original source and thus be not to be deceive by superficial resemblance the term comparative mythology reach hardly far enough to cover all that i have aim at the professional mythologist think he have complete he task when he have trace a myth through its transformation in story and language back to the natural phenomenon of which it be the expression this external history be essential but deeper than that lie the study of the influence of the myth on the individual and national mind on the progress and destiny of those who believe it in other word its true _ religious _ import i have endeavor also to take some account of this the usual statement be that tribe in the intellectual condition of those i be deal with rest they religion on a worship of external phenomenon in contradiction to this i advance various argument to show that they chief god be not identify with any objective natural process but be human in nature benignant in character love rather than fear and that he worship carry with it the germ of the development of benevolent emotion and sound ethical principle _ media pa oct 1882 _ contents chapter i

contend by some that there be tribe of man without any sort of religion nowadays the effort be to show that the feeling which prompt to it be common even among brute this change of opinion have come about partly through a extension of the definition of religion it be now hold to mean any kind of belief in spiritual or extra-natural agency some learn man say that we have better drop the word religion lest we be misunderstand they would rather use daimonism or supernaturalism or other such new term but none of these seem to I so wide and so exactly significant of what i mean as religion all now agree that in this very broad sense some kind of religion exist in every human community -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : i suppose i be not go too far in say all agree for i think that the latest study of this subject by gustav roskoff dispose of sir john lubbock 's doubt as well as the crude statement of the author of _ kraft und stoff _ and such like compilation gustav roskoff _ da religionswesen der rohesten naturvölker _ leipzig 1880 -rrb- the attempt have often be make to classify these various faith under some few general heading the scheme of auguste comte still have supporter he teach that man begin with fetichism advance to polytheism and at last rise to monotheism more in vogue at present be the theory that the simplest and lowest form of religion be individual above it be the national religion and at the summit the universal or world religion comte 's scheme have not bear examination it be artificial and sterile look at christianity it be the highest of all religion but it be not monotheism look at buddhism in its pure form it be not even theism the second classification be more fruitful for historical purpose the psychologist however inquire as to the essence the real purpose of religion this have be differently define by the two great school of think all religion say the idealist be the effort poor or noble conscious or blind to develop the idea of god in the soul of man no reply the rationalist it be simply the effort of the human mind to frame a theory of thing at first religion be a early system of natural philosophy later it become moral philosophy explain the universe by physical law point out that the origin and aim of ethic be the relation of man and we shall have no more religion nor need any the first answer be too intangible the second too narrow the rude savage do not philosophize on phenomenon the enlighten student see in they but interact force : yet both may be profoundly religious nor can morality be accept as a criterion of religion the bloody scene in the mexican teocallus be merciful compare with those in the torture room of the inquisition yet the religion of jesus be far above that of huitzilopochtlus what i think be the essence the principle of vitality in religion and in all religion be _ they suppose control over the destiny of the individual _ he weal or woe he good or bad hap here or hereafter as it may be root infinitely deep in the sense of personality religion be recognize at the begin it will be recognize at the end as the one indestructible ally in the struggle for individual existence at heart all prayer be for preservation the burden of all litany be a beg for life this end these benefit have be seek by the cult of the world through one of two theory the one that which characterize the earliest and the crudest religion teach that man escape danger and secure safety by the performance or avoidance of certain action he may credit this or that myth he may hold to one or many god this be unimportant but he must not fail in the penance or the sacred dance he must not touch that which be _ taboo _ or he be in peril the life of these cult be the deed they expression be the rite higher religion discern the inefficacy of the mere act they rest they claim on belief they establish dogma the mental acceptance of which be the one thing needful in they mythology pass into theology the act be measure by its motive the formulum by the faith back of it they life be the creed the myth find vigorous and congenial growth only in the first of these form there alone the imagination of the votary be free there alone it be not fetter by a symbol already define to the student of religion the interest of the myth be not that of a infantile attempt to philosophize but as it illustrate the intimate and immediate relation which the religion in which it grow bear to the individual life thus examine it reveal the inevitable destiny of man and of nation as bind up with they form of worship these general consideration appear to I to be need for the proper understanding of the study i be about to make it concern itself with some of the religion which be develop on the american continent before its discovery my object be to present from they a series of myth curiously similar in feature and to see if one simple and general explanation of they can be find the process of myth-building among american tribe be much the same as elsewhere these be now too generally familiar to need specification here beyond a few which i have find particularly noticeable at the foundation of all myth lie the mental process of _ personification _ which find expression in the rhetorical figure of _ prosopopeium _ the definition of this however must be extend from the mere representation of inanimate thing as animate to include also the representation of irrational being as rational as in the animal myth a most common form of religious story among primitive people some language favor these form of personification much more than other and most of the american language do so in a marked manner by the broad grammatical distinction they draw between animate and inanimate object which distinction must invariably be observe they can not say the boat move without specify whether the boat be a animate object or not or whether it be to be consider animate for rhetorical purpose at the time of speak the sound of word have aid greatly in myth building name and word which be somewhat alike in sound _ paronym _ as they be call by grammarian may be take or mistake one for the other again many myth spring from _ homonymy _ that be the sameness in sound of word with difference in signification thus _ coatl _ in the aztec tongue be a word frequently appear in the name of divinity it have three entirely different meaning to wit a serpent a guest and twin now whichever one of these be originally mean it would be quite certain to be misunderstand more or less by later generation and myth would arise to explain the several possible interpretation of the word -- as in fact we find be the case closely ally to this be what have be call _ otosis _ this be the substitution of a familiar word for a archaic or foreign one of similar sound but wholly diverse meaning this be a very common occurrence and easily lead to myth make for example there be a cave near chattanooga which have the cherokee name nik-a-jak this the white settler have transform into nigger jack and be prepare with a narrative of some runaway slave to explain the cognomen it may also occur in the same language in a algonkin dialect _ missus wabu _ mean the great light of the dawn and a common large rabbit be call _ missabo _ at some period the precise meaning of the former word be lose and a variety of interesting myth of the daybreak be transfer to a suppose huge rabbit rarely do there occur a more striking example of how the deterioration of language affect mythology _ aztlan _ the mythical land whence the aztec speaking tribe be say to have come and from which they derive they name mean the place of whiteness but the word be similar to _ aztatlan _ which would mean the place of heron some spot where these bird would love to congregate from _ aztatl _ the heron and in after age this latter as the plainer and more concrete signification come to prevail and be adopt by the myth-maker _ polyonomy _ be another procedure often see in these myth a divinity have several or many title one or another of these become prominent and at last obscure in a particular myth or locality the original personality of the hero of the tale in america this be most obvious in peru akin to this be what prof max müller have term _ henotheism _ in this mental process one god or one form of a god be exalt beyond all other and even address as the one only absolute and supreme deity such expression be not to be construe literally as evidence of a monotheism but simply that at that particular time the worshiper 's mind be so fill with the power and majesty of the divinity to whom he appeal that he apply to he these superlative very much as he would to a great ruler the next day he might apply they to another deity without any hypocrisy or sense of logical contradiction instance of this be common in the aztec prayer which have be preserve one difficulty encounter in aryan mythology be extremely rare in america and that be the adoption of foreign name a proper name without a definite concrete significance in the tongue of the people who use it be almost unexampled in the red race a word without a meaning be something quite foreign to they mode of think one of we most eminent student -lrb- 1 -rrb- have justly say : every indian synthesis -- name of person and place not except -- must preserve the consciousness of its root and must not only have a meaning but be so frame as to convey that meaning with precision to all who speak the language to which it belong hence the name of they divinity can nearly always be interpret though for the reason above give the most obvious and current interpretation be not in every case the correct one -lrb- footnote 1 : j hammond trumbull _ on the composition of indian geographical name _ p 3 -lrb- hartford 1870 -rrb- -rrb- as foreign name be not adopt so the mythology of one tribe very rarely influence that of another as a rule all the religion be tribal or national and they votary have no desire to extend they there be little of the proselytize spirit among the red race some exception can be point out to this statement in the aztec and peruvian monarchy some borrowing seem to have be do either by or from the maya and the hero-myth of the iroquoi have so many of the lineament of that of the algonkin that it be difficult to believe that it be wholly independent of it but on the whole the identity often find in american myth be more justly attributable to a similarity of surroundings and impression than to any other cause the diversity and intricacy of american mythology have be greatly foster by the delight the more developed nation take in rhetorical figure in metaphor and simile and in expression of amplification and hyperbole those who imagine that there be a poverty of resource in these language or that they concrete form hem in the mind from the study of the abstract speak without knowledge one have but to look at the inexhaustible synonymy of the aztec as it be set forth by olmo or sahagun or at its power to render correctly the refinement of scholastic theology to see how wide of the fact be any such opinion and what be true of the aztec be not less so of the qquichua and other tongue i will give a example where the english language itself fall short of the nicety of the qquichua in handle a metaphysical tenet _ cay _ in qquichua express the real being of thing the _ essentium _ as _ runap caynin _ the being of the human race humanity in the abstract but to convey the idea of actual be the _ existentium _ as unite to the _ essentium _ we must add the prefix _ cascan _ and thus have _ runap-cascan-caynin _ which strictly mean the essence of be in general as existent in humanity -lrb- 1 -rrb- i doubt if the dialect of german metaphysics itself after all its elaboration could produce in equal compass a term for this conception in qquichua moreover there be nothing strained and nothing foreign in this example it be perfectly pure and in thorough accord with the genius of the tongue -lrb- footnote 1 : el ser existente de hombre que es el modo de estar el primer ser que es la essentia que en dios y los angeles y el hombre es modo personal diego gonzalez holguin _ vocabvlario de la lengva qqichua o del inca sub voce cay _ -lrb- ciudad de los reyes 1608 -rrb- -rrb- i take some pain to impress this fact for it be a important one in estimate the religious idea of the race we must not think we have grounds for skepticism if we occasionally come across some that astonish we by they subtlety such be quite in keep with the psychology and language of the race we be study yet throughout america as in most other part of the world the teaching of religious tenet be twofold the one popular the other for the initiate a esoteric and a exoteric doctrine a difference in dialect be assiduously cultivate a sort of sacred language be employ to conceal while it convey the mystery of faith some linguist think that these dialect be archaic form of the language the memory of which be retain in ceremonial observance other maintain that they be simply affectation of expression and form a sort of slang base on the every day language and current among the initiate i be incline to the latter as the correct opinion in many case whichever it be such a sacred dialect be find in almost all tribe there be fragment of it from the cultivate race of mexico yucatan and peru and at the other end of the scale we may instance the guaymi of darien naked savage but whose chief of the law we be tell teach the doctrine of they religion in a peculiar idiom invent for the purpose and very different from the common language -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : franco _ noticia de los indios guaymies y de sus costumbres _ p 20 in pinart _ coleccion de linguistica y etnografia americana _ tom iv -rrb- this become a add difficulty in the analysis of myth as not only be the name of the divinity and of locality express in term in the highest degree metaphorical but they be at time obscure by a affected pronunciation devise to conceal they exact derivation the native tribe of this continent have many myth and among they there be one which be so prominent and recur with such strangely similar feature in locality widely asunder that it have for year attract my attention and i have be lead to present it as it occur among several nation far apart both geographically and in point of culture this myth be that of the national hero they mythical civilizer and teacher of the tribe who at the same time be often identify with the supreme deity and the creator of the world it be the fundamental myth of a very large number of american tribe and on its recognition and interpretation depend the correct understanding of most of they mythology and religious life the outline of this legend be to the effect that in some exceedingly remote time this divinity take a active part in create the world and in fitting it to be the abode of man and may himself have form or call forth the race at any rate he interest in its advancement be such that he personally appear among the ancestor of the nation and teach they the useful art give they the maize or other food plant initiate they into the mystery of they religious rite frame the law which govern they social relation and have thus start they on the road to self development he leave they not suffer death but disappear in some way from they view hence it be nigh universally expect that at some time he would return the circumstance attend the birth of these hero-god have great similarity as a rule each be a twin or one of four brother bear at one birth very generally at the cost of they mother 's life who be a virgin or at least have never be impregnate by mortal man the hero be apt to come into conflict with he brother or one of he brother and the long and desperate struggle result which often involve the universe in repeat destruction constitute one of the lead topic of the myth-maker the duel be not generally -- not at all i believe when we can get at the genuine native form of the myth -- between a morally good and a evil spirit though undoubtedly the one be more friendly and favorable to the welfare of man than the other the better of the two the true hero-god be in the end triumphant though the national temperament represent this variously at any rate he people be not desert by he and though absent and perhaps for a while drive away by he potent adversary he be sure to come back some time or other the place of he birth be nearly always located in the east from that quarter he first come when he appear as a man among man toward that point he return when he disappear and there he still live await the appoint time for he reappearance whenever the personal appearance of this hero-god be describe it be strangely enough represent to be that of one of the white race a man of fair complexion with long flow beard with abundant hair and clothe in ample and loose robe this extraordinary fact naturally suggest the gravest suspicion that these story be make up after the whites have reach the american shore and nearly all historian have summarily reject they authenticity on this account but a most careful scrutiny of they source positively refute this opinion there be irrefragable evidence that these myth and this ideal of the hero-god be intimately know and widely current in america long before any one of its million of inhabitant have ever see a white man nor be there any difficulty in explain this when we divest these figure of the fanciful garb in which they have be clothe by the religious imagination and recognize what be the phenomenon on which they be base and the physical process whose history they embody to show this i will offer in the most concise term my interpretation of they main detail the most important of all thing to life be _ light _ this the primitive savage feel and personify it he make light he chief god the beginning of the day serve by analogy for the beginning of the world light come before the sun bring it forth create it as it be hence the light-god be not the sun-god but he antecedent and creator the light appear in the east and thus define that cardinal point and by it the other be located these point as indispensable guide to the wander horde become from earliest time personify as important deity and be identify with the wind that blow from they as wind and rain god this explain the four brother who be nothing else than the four cardinal point and they mother who die in produce they be the eastern light which be soon lose in the grow day the east as they leader be also the suppose ruler of the wind and thus god of the air and rain as more immediately connect with the advent and departure of light the east and west be twin the one of which send forth the glorious day-orb which the other lie in wait to conquer yet the light-god be not slay the sun shall rise again in undiminished glory and he live though absent by sight and light we see and learn nothing therefore be more natural than to attribute to the light-god the early progress in the art of domestic and social life thus light come to be personify as the embodiment of culture and knowledge of wisdom and of the peace and prosperity which be necessary for the growth of learn the fair complexion of these hero be nothing but a reference to the white light of the dawn they ample hair and beard be the ray of the sun that flow from he radiant visage they loose and large robe typify the enfolding of the firmament by the light and the wind this interpretation be nowise strained but be simply that which in aryan mythology be now universally accept for similar mythological creation thus in the greek phoebus and perseus in the teutonic lif and in the norse baldur we have also beneficent hero-god distinguish by they fair complexion and ample golden lock amongst the dark as well as amongst the fair race amongst those who be mark by black hair and dark eye they exhibit the same unfailing type of blue-eyed hero whose golden lock flow over they shoulder and whose face gleam as with the light of the new rise sun -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : sir george w cox _ a introduction to the science of comparative mythology and folk-lore _ p 17 -rrb- everywhere too the history of these hero be that of a struggle against some potent enemy some dark demon or dragon but as often against some member of they own household a brother or a father the identification of the light-god with the deity of the wind be also see in aryan mythology herme to the greek be the inventor of the alphabet music the cultivation of the olive weight and measure and such humane art he be also the messenger of the god in other word the breeze the wind the air in motion he name herme hermeia be but a transliteration of the sanscrit sarameya under which he appear in the vedic song as the son of sarama the dawn even he character as the master thief and patron saint of the light-fingered gentry draw from the way the wind and breeze penetrate every crack and cranny of the house be absolutely repeat in the mexican hero-god quetzalcoatl who be also the patron of thief i might carry the comparison yet further for as sarameya be derive from the root _ sar _ to creep whence _ serpo _ serpent the creeper so the name quetzalcoatl can be accurately translate the wonderful serpent in name history and function the parallelism be maintain throughout or we can find another familiar myth partly aryan partly semitic where many of the same outline present themselves the argive theban attribute the founding of they city and state to cadmus he collect they ancestor into a community give they law invent the alphabet of sixteen letter teach they the art of smelting metal establish oracle and introduce the dyonisiac worship or that of the reproductive principle he subsequently leave they and live for a time with other nation and at last do not die but be change into a dragon and carry by zeus to elysion the birthplace of this culture hero be somewhere far to the eastward of greece somewhere in the purple land -lrb- phoenicium -rrb- he mother be the far gleam one -lrb- telephassa -rrb- he be one of four child and he sister be europe the dawn who be seize and carry westward by zeus in the shape of a white bull cadmus seek to recover she and set out follow the westward course of the sun there can be no rest until the lose one be find again the sun must journey westward until he see again the beautiful tint which greet he eye in the morning -lrb- 1 -rrb- therefore cadmus leave the purple land to pursue he quest it be one of toil and struggle he have to fight the dragon offspring of are and the band of armed man who spring from the dragon 's tooth which be sow that be the cloud and gloom of the overcast sky he conquer and be reward but do not recover he sister -lrb- footnote 1 : sir george w cox _ ibid _ p 76 -rrb- when we find that the name cadmus be simply the semitic word _ kedem _ the east and notice all this mythical entourage we see that this legend be but a lightly veil account of the local source and progress of the light of day and of the advantage man derive from it cadmus bring the letter of the alphabet from the east to greece for the same reason that in ancient maya myth itzamna son of the mother of the morning bring the hieroglyph of the maya script also from the east to yucatan -- because both represent the light by which we see and learn egyptian mythology offer quite as many analogy to support this interpretation of american myth as do the aryan god-story the heavenly light impregnate the virgin from whom be bear the sun-god whose life be a long contest with he twin brother the latter win but he victory be transient for the light though conquer and banish by the darkness can not be slay and be sure to return with the dawn to the great joy of the son of man this story the egyptian delighted to repeat under numberless disguise the groundwork and meaning be the same whether the actor be osiris isis and set ptah hapus and the virgin cow or the many other actor of this drama there too among a brown race of man the light-god be deem to be not of they own hue but light color white or yellow of comely countenance bright eye and golden hair again he be the one who invent the calendar teach the art establish the ritual reveal the medical virtue of plant recommend peace and again be identify as one of the brother of the cardinal point -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see dr cp tiele _ history of the egyptian religion _ pp 93 95 99 et al -rrb- the story of the virgin-mother point in america as it do in the old world to the notion of the dawn bring forth the sun it be one of the commonest myth in both continent and in a period of human thought when miracle be suppose to be part of the order of thing have in it nothing difficult of credence the peruvian for instance have large establishment where be keep in rigid seclusion the virgin of the sun do one of these violate she vow of chastity she and she fellow criminal be at once put to death but do she claim that the child she bear be of divine parentage and the contrary could not be show then she be fete as a queen and the product of she womb be class among prince as a son of the sun so in the inscription at thebe in the temple of the virgin goddess mat we read where she say of herself : my garment no man have lift up the fruit that i have bear be beget of the sun -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : -lrb- greek : ton emon chitona oudei apechaluphen on ego charpon etechan aelio egeneto -rrb- proclus quote by tiele ubus suprá p 204 note -rrb- i do not venture too much in say that it be easy to parallel every event in these american hero-myths every phase of character of the personage they represent with other draw from aryan and egyptian legend long familiar to student and which now be fully recognize as have in they nothing of the substance of history but as pure creation of the religious imagination work on the process of nature bring into relation to the hope and fear of man if this be so be it not time that we dismiss once for all these american myth from the domain of historical tradition why should we try to make a king of itzamna a enlighten ruler of quetzalcoatl a culture nation of the toltec when the proof be of the strongest that every one of these be a absolutely baseless fiction of mythology let it be understand hereafter that whoever use these name in a historical sense betray a ignorance of the subject he handle which be it in the better known field of aryan or egyptian lore would at once convict he of not merit the name of scholar in european history the day have pass when it be allowable to construct primitive chronicle out of fairy tale and nature myth the science of comparative mythology have assign to these venerable story a different though not less noble interpretation how much longer must we wait to see the same canon of criticism apply to the product of the religious fancy of the red race furthermore if the myth of the american nation be show to be capable of a consistent interpretation by the principle of comparative mythology let it be recognize that they be neither to be discard because they resemble some familiar to they european conqueror nor do that similarity mean that they be historically derive the one from the other each be a independent growth but as each be the reflex in a common psychical nature of the same phenomenon the same form of expression be adopt to convey they chapter ii the hero-god of the algonkin and iroquois § 1 _ the algonkin myth of michabo _ the myth of the giant rabbit -- the rabbit create the world -- he marry the muskrat -- become the all-father -- derivation of michabo -- of wajashk the muskrat -- the myth explain -- the light-god as god of the east -- the four divine brother -- myth of the huarochiri -- the day-maker -- michabo 's contest with he father and brother -- explanation of these -- the symbolic flint stone -- michabo destroy the serpent king -- meaning of this myth -- relation of the light-god and wind-god -- michabo as god of water and fertility -- represent as a bearded man § 2 _ the iroquois myth of ioskeha _ the creation of the earth -- the miraculous birth of ioskeha -- he overcome he brother tawiscara -- create and teach mankind -- visit he people -- he grandmother ataensic -- ioskeha as father of he mother -- similar conception in egyptian myth -- derivation of ioskeha and ataensic -- ioskeha as tharonhiawakon the sky supporter -- he brother tawiscara or tehotennhiaron identify -- similarity to algonkin myth nearly all that vast area which lie between hudson bay and the savannah river and the mississippus river and the atlantic coast be people at the epoch of the discovery by the member of two linguistic family -- the algonkin and the iroquois they be on about the same plane of culture but differ much in temperament and radically in language yet they religious notion be not dissimilar § 1 _ the algonkin myth of michabo _ among all the algonkin tribe whose myth have be preserve we find much be say about a certain giant rabbit to whom all sort of power be attribute he be the master of all animal he be the teacher who first instruct man in the art of fishing and hunting he impart to the algonkin the mystery of they religious rite he teach they picture writing and the interpretation of dream nay far more than that he be the original ancestor not only of they nation but of the whole race of man and in fact be none other than the primal creator himself who fashion the earth and give life to all that thereon be hear all this say about such a ignoble and weak animal as the rabbit no wonder that the early missionary and traveler speak of such fable with undisguised contempt and never mention they without excuse for put on record triviality so utter yet it appear to I that under these seemingly weak story lay a profound truth the appreciation of which be lose in great measure to the native themselves but which can be show to have be in its origin a noble myth setting forth in not unworthy image the ceaseless and mighty rhythm of nature in the alternation of day and night summer and winter storm and sunshine i shall quote a few of these story as tell by early authority not add anything to relieve they crude simplicity and then i will see whether when submit to the test of linguistic analysis this unpromising ore do not yield the pure gold of genuine mythology the beginning of thing accord to the ottawa and other northern algonkin be at a period when boundless water cover the face of the earth on this infinite ocean float a raft upon which be many species of animal the captain and chief of whom be michabo the giant rabbit they ardently desire land on which to live so this mighty rabbit order the beaver to dive and bring he up ever so little a piece of mud the beaver obey and remain down long even so that he come up utterly exhaust but report that he have not reach bottom then the rabbit send down the otter but he also return nearly dead and without success great be the disappointment of the company on the raft for what better diver have they than the beaver and the otter in the midst of they distress the -lrb- female -rrb- muskrat come forward and announce she willingness to make the attempt she proposal be receive with derision but as poor help be better than none in a emergency the rabbit give she permission and down she dive she too remain long very long a whole day and night and they give she up for lose but at length she float to the surface unconscious she belly up as if dead they hastily haul she on the raft and examine she paw one by one in the last one of the four they find a small speck of mud victory that be all that be need the muskrat be soon restore and the giant rabbit exert he creative power mould the little fragment of soil and as he mould it it grow and grow into a island into a mountain into a country into this great earth that we all dwell upon as it grow the rabbit walk round and round it to see how big it be and the story add that he be not yet satisfy still he continue he journey and he labor walk forever around and around the earth and ever increase it more and more the animal on the raft soon find home on the new earth but it have yet to be cover with forest and man be not bear the giant rabbit form the tree by shoot he arrow into the soil which become tree trunk and transfix they with other arrow these become branch and as for man some say he form they from the dead body of certain animal which in time become the totem of the algonkin tribe but another and probably a older and truer story be that he marry the muskrat which have be of such service to he and from this union be bear the ancestor of the various race of mankind which people the earth nor do he neglect the child he have thus bring into the world of he creation have closely study how the spider spread she web to catch fly he invent the art of knit net for fish and teach it to he descendant the piece of native copper find along the shore of lake superior he take from he treasure house inside the earth where he sometimes live it be he who be the master of life and if he appear in a dream to a person in danger it be a certain sign of a lucky escape he confer fortune in the chase and therefore the hunter invoke he and offer he tobacco and other dainty place they in the cleft of rock or on isolate boulder though call the giant rabbit he be always refer to as a man a giant or demigod perhaps but distinctly as of human nature the mighty father or elder brother of the race -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the writer from whom i have take this myth be nicolas perrot _ mémoire sur les meurs coustume et relligion des sauvages de l'amérique septentrionale _ write by a intelligent layman who live among the native from 1665 to 1699 and the various _ relation des jesuites _ especially for the year 1667 and 1670 -rrb- such be the national myth of creation of the algonkin tribe as it have be hand down to we in fragment by those who first hear it have it any meaning be it more than the puerile fable of savage let we see whether some of those unconscious trick of speech to which i refer in the introductory chapter have not disfigure a true nature myth perhaps those common process of language personification and otosis duly take into account will enable we to restore this narrative to its original sense in the algonkin tongue the word for giant rabbit be _ missabo _ compound from _ mitchus _ or _ missus _ great large and _ wabo _ a rabbit but there be a whole class of related word refer to widely different perception which sound very much like _ wabo _ they be from a general root _ wab _ which go to form such word of related signification as _ wabus _ he see _ waban _ the east the orient _ wabish _ white _ bidaban _ -lrb- _ bid-waban _ -rrb- the dawn _ wában _ daylight _ wasseium _ the light and many other here be where we be to look for the real meaning of the name _ missabo _ it originally mean the great light the mighty seer the orient the dawn -- which you please as all distinctly refer to the one original idea the bringer of light and sight of knowledge and life in time this meaning become obscure and the idea of the rabbit whose name be draw probably from the same root as in the northern winter its fur become white be substitute and so the myth of light degenerate into a animal fable i believe that a similar analysis will explain the part which the muskrat play in the story she it be who bring up the speck of mud from the bottom of the primal ocean and from this speck the world be form by he whom we now see be the lord of the light and the day and subsequently she become the mother of he son the word for muskrat in algonkin be _ wajashk _ the first letter of which often suffer elision as in _ nin nod-ajashkwe _ i hunt muskrat but this be almost the word for mud wet earth soil _ ajishkus _ there be no reasonable doubt but that here again otosis and personification come in and give the form and name of a animal to the original simple statement that statement be that from wet mud dry by the sunlight the solid earth be form and again that this damp soil be warm and fertilize by the sunlight so that from it spring organic life even man himself who in so many mythology be the earth bear _ homo ab humo homo chamaigenes _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : mr j hammond trumbull have point out that in algonkin the word for father _ osh _ mother _ oka _ and earth _ ohke _ -lrb- narraganset dialect -rrb- can all be derive accord to the regular rule of algonkin grammar from the same verbal root signify to come out of or from -lrb- note to roger william ' _ key into the language of america _ p 56 -rrb- thus the earth be in they language the parent of the race and what more natural than that it should become so in the myth also -rrb- this then be the interpretation i have to offer of the cosmogonical myth of the algonkin do some one object that it be too refine for those rude savage or that it smack too much of reminiscence of old-world teaching my answer be that neither the early traveler who write it down nor probably the native who tell they understand its meaning and that not until it be here approach by modern method of analysis have it ever be explain therefore it be impossible to assign to it other than a indigenous and spontaneous origin in some remote period of algonkin tribal history after the darkness of the night man first learn he whereabouts by the light kindling in the orient wander as do the primitive man through pathless forest without a guide the east become to he the first and most important of the fix point in space by it be located the west the north the south from it spread the welcome dawn in it be bear the glorious sun it be full of promise and of instruction hence it become to he the home of the god of life and light and wisdom as the four cardinal point be determine by fix physical relation common to man everywhere and be closely associate with he daily motion and well be they become prominent figure in almost all early myth and be personify as divinity the wind be classify as come from they and in many tongue the name of the cardinal point be the same as those of the wind that blow from they the east however have in regard to the other a pre-eminence for it be not merely the home of the east wind but of the light and the dawn as well hence it attain a marked preponderance in the myth it be either the greatest wisest and oldest of the four brother who by personification represent the cardinal point and the four wind or else the light-god be separate from the quadruplet and appear as a fifth personage govern the other four and be in fact the supreme ruler of both the spiritual and human world such be the mental process which take place in the algonkin mind and give rise to two cycle of myth the one represent wabun or michabo as one of four brother whose name be those of the cardinal point the second place he above they all the four brother be prominent character in algonkin legend and we shall find that they recur with extraordinary frequency in the mythology of all american nation indeed i could easily point they out also in the early religious conception of egypt and indium greece and china and many other old-world land but i leave these comparison to those who wish to treat of the principle of general mythology accord to the most generally receive legend these four brother be quadruplet -- bear at one birth -- and they mother die in bring they into life they name be give differently by the various tribe but be usually identical with the four point of the compass or something relate to they wabun the east kabun the west kabibonokka the north and shawano the south be in the ordinary language of the interpreter the name apply to they wabun be the chief and leader and assign to he brother they various duty especially to blow the wind these be the primitive and chief divinity of the algonkin race in all part of the territory they inhabit when as early as 1610 captain argoll visit the tribe who then possess the bank of the river potomac and inquire concern they religion they reply we have five god in all we chief god often appear to we in the form of a mighty great hare the other four have no visible shape but be indeed the four wind which keep the four corner of the earth -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : william strachey _ historie of travaile into virginia _ p 98 -rrb- here we see that wabun the east be distinguish from michabo -lrb- _ missi-wabun _ -rrb- and by a natural and transparent process the eastern light be separate from the eastern wind the original number four be increase to five precisely the same differentiation occur as i shall show in mexico in the case of quetzalcoatl as show in he _ yoel _ or wheel of the wind which be he sacred pentagram or i will further illustrate this development by a myth of the huarochiri indian of the coast of peru they relate that in the beginning of thing there be five egg on the mountain condorcoto in due course of time these egg open and from they come forth five falcon who be none other than the creator of all thing pariacaca and he brother the four wind by they magic power they transform themselves into man and go about the world perform miracle and in time become the god of that people -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : doctor francisco de avila _ narrative of the error and false god of the indian of huarochiri _ -lrb- 1608 -rrb- this interesting document have be partly translate by mr cb markham and publish in one of the volume of the hackluyt society 's series -rrb- these striking similarity show with what singular uniformity the religious sense develope itself in locality the furthest asunder return to michabo the duplicate nature thus assign he as the light-god and also the god of the wind and the storm and rain they bring lead to the production of two cycle of myth which present he in these two different aspect in the one he be as the god of light the power that conquer the darkness who bring warmth and sunlight to the earth and knowledge to man he be the patron of hunter as these require the light to guide they on they way and must always direct they course by the cardinal point the morning star which at certain season herald the dawn be sacred to he and its name in ojibway be _ wabanang _ from _ waban _ the east the ray of light be he servant and messenger seat at the extreme east at the place where the earth be cut off watch in he medicine lodge or pass he time fishing in the endless ocean which on every side surround the land michabo send forth these messenger who in the myth be call _ gijigouai _ which mean those who make the day and they light the world he be never identify with the sun nor be he suppose to dwell in it but he be distinctly the impersonation of light -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see hr schoolcraft _ indian tribe _ vol v pp 418 419 _ relation des jesuites _ 1634 p 14 1637 p 46 -rrb- in one form of the myth he be the grandson of the moon he father be the west wind and he mother a maiden who have be fecundate miraculously by the pass breeze die at the moment of give he birth but he do not need the foster care of a parent for he be bear mighty of limb and with all knowledge that it be possible to attain -lrb- 1 -rrb- immediately he attack he father and a long and desperate struggle take place it begin on the mountain the west be force to give ground he son drive he across river and over mountain and lake and at last he come to the brink of the world ` hold ' cry he ` my son you know my power and that it be impossible to kill I ' the combat cease the west acknowledge the supremacy of he mighty son -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : in the ojibway dialect of the algonkin the word for day sky or heaven be _ gijig _ this same word as a verb mean to be a adult to be ripe -lrb- of fruit -rrb- to be finish complete rev frederick baraga _ a dictionary of the olchipwe language _ cincinnatus 1853 this seem to correspond with the statement in the myth -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : he schoolcraft _ algic research _ vol i pp 135 et seq -rrb- it be scarcely possible to err in recognize under this thin veil of imagery a description of the daily struggle between light and darkness day and night the maiden be the dawn from whose virgin womb rise the sun in the fullness of he glory and might but with he advent the dawn itself disappear and die the battle last all day begin when the earliest ray gild the mountain top and continue until the west be drive to the edge of the world as the evening precede the morning so the west by a figure of speech may be say to fertilize the dawn in another form of the story the west be typify as a flint stone and the twin brother of michabo the feud between they be bitter and the contest long and dreadful the face of the land be seam and tear by the wrestling of the mighty combatant and the indian point out the huge boulder on the prairie as the weapon hurl at each other by the enraged brother at length michabo master he fellow twin and break he into piece he scatter the fragment over the earth and from they grow fruitful vine a myth which like this introduce the flint stone as in some way connect with the early creative force of nature recur at other locality on the american continent very remote from the home of the algonkin in the calendar of the aztec the day and god tecpatl the flint-stone hold a prominent position accord to they myth such a stone fall from heaven at the beginning of thing and break into sixteen hundred piece each of which become a god the hun-pic-tok eight thousand flint of the maya and the toh of the kich point to the same association -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : brasseur de bourbourg _ dissertation sur les mythes de l'antiquite americaine _ § vii -rrb- probably the association of idea be not with the flint as a fire-stone though the fact that a piece of flint strike with a nodule of pyrites will emit a spark be not unknown but the flint be everywhere employ for arrow and lance head the flash of light the lightning anything that dart swiftly and strike violently be compare to the hurtle arrow or the whiz lance especially do this apply to the phenomenon of the lightning the belief that a stone be shoot from the sky with each thunderclap be show in we word thunderbolt and even yet the vulgar in many country point out certain form of stone as derive from this source as the refreshing rain which accompany the thunder gust instill new life into vegetation and cover the ground parch by summer drought with leaf and grass so the statement in the myth that the fragment of the flint-stone grow into fruitful vine be a obvious figure of speech which at first express the fertilize effect of the summer shower in this myth michabo the light-god be represent to the native mind as still fight with the power of darkness not now the darkness of night but that of the heavy and gloomy cloud which roll up the sky and blind the eye of day he weapon be the lightning and the thunderbolt and the victory he achieve be turn to the good of the world he have create this be still more clearly set forth in a ojibway myth it relate that in early day there be a mighty serpent king of all serpent whose home be in the great lake increase the water by he magic power he begin to flood the land and threaten its total submergence then michabo rise from he couch at the sun-rising attack the huge reptile and slew it by a cast of he dart he strip it of its skin and clothing himself in this trophy of conquest drive all the other serpent to the south -lrb- 1 -rrb- as it be in the south that in the country of the ojibway the lightning be last see in the autumn and as the algonkin both in they language and pictography be accustom to assimilate the lightning in its zigzag course to the sinuous motion of the serpent -lrb- 2 -rrb- the meteorological character of this myth be very manifest -lrb- footnote 1 : hr schoolcraft _ algic research _ vol i p 179 vol ii p 117 the word _ animikig _ in ojibway means it thunder and lightning in they myth this tribe say that the west wind be create by animikus the thunder -lrb- ibid _ indian tribe _ vol v p 420 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : when father buteux be among the algonkin in 1637 they explain to he the lightning as a great serpent which the manito vomit up -lrb- _ relation de la nouvelle france _ a 1637 p 53 -rrb- accord to john tanner the symbol for the lightning in ojibway pictography be a rattlesnake -lrb- _ narrative _ p 351 -rrb- -rrb- thus we see that michabo the hero-god of the algonkin be both the god of light and day of the wind and rain and the creator instructor and teacher of mankind the derivation of he name show unmistakably that the earliest form under which he be a mythological existence be as the light-god later he become more familiar as god of the wind and storm the hero of the celestial warfare of the air-current this be precisely the same change which we be enable to trace in the early transformation of aryan religion there also the older god of the sky and light dyâus once common to all member of the indo-european family give way to the more active deity indra zeus and odin divinity of the storm and the wind but which after all be merely other aspect of the ancient deity and occupy he place to the religious sense -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be essential for the comprehension of early mythology to understand this twofold character and to appreciate how naturally the one merge into and spring out of the other -lrb- footnote 1 : this transformation be well set forth in mr charle franci keary 's _ outline of primitive belief among the indo-european race _ -lrb- london 1882 -rrb- chap iv vii he observe : the wind be a far more physical and less abstract conception than the sky or heaven it be also a more variable phenomenon and by reason of both these recommendation the wind-god supersede the older dyâus \* \* \* just as the chief god of greece have descend to be a divinity of storm be not content to remain only that but grow again to some likeness of the older dyâus so odhinn come to absorb almost all the quality which belong of right to a higher god yet he do this without put off he proper nature he be the heaven as well as the wind he be the all-father embrace all the earth and look down upon mankind -rrb- in almost every know religion the _ bird _ be take as a symbol of the sky the cloud and the wind it be not surprising therefore to find that by the algonkin bird be consider especially singing bird as peculiarly sacred to michabo he be they father and protector he himself send forth the east wind from he home at the sun-rising but he appoint a owl to create the north wind which blow from the realm of darkness and cold while that which be waft from the sunny south be send by the butterfly -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : hr schoolcraft _ algic research _ vol i p 216 _ indian tribe _ vol v p 420 -rrb- michabo be thus at time the god of light at other of the wind and as these be the rain-bringer he be also at time speak of as the god of water he be say to have scoop out the basin of the lake and to have build the cataract in the river so that there should be fish preserve and beaver dam -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : michabou le dieu des eaux etc charlevoix _ journal

various art of domestic life and the chase be teach they long ago by a venerable and eloquent man who come to they from a distance and have instruct they in what be desirable for they to know he depart not to another region or by the natural course of death but by ascend into the sky they add that this ancient and beneficent teacher _ wear a long beard _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- we might suspect that this last trait be think of after the bearded european have be see do it not occur so often in myth elsewhere on the continent and in relic of art finish long before the discovery that another explanation must be find for it what this be i shall discuss when i come to speak of the more southern myth whose hero be often white and bearded man from the east -lrb- footnote 1 : thoma campanius

iroquois myth of ioskeha _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the source from which i draw the element of the iroquois hero-myth of ioskeha be mainly the following : _ relation de la nouvelle france _

have make a thorough study of the iroquois history and dialect -rrb- the most ancient myth of the iroquoi represent this earth as cover with water in which dwelt aquatic animal and monster of the deep far above it be the heaven people by supernatural being at a certain time one of these a woman by name ataensic throw herself through a rift in the sky and fall toward the earth what lead she to this act be variously record some say that it be to recover she dog which have fall through while chase a bear other related that those who dwell in the world above live off the fruit of a certain tree that the husband of ataensic be sick dream that to restore he this tree must be cut down and that when ataensic deal it a blow with she stone axe the tree suddenly sink through the floor of the sky and she precipitate herself after it however the event occur she fall from heaven down to the primeval water there a turtle offer she he broad back as a resting-place until from a little mud which be bring she either by a frog a beaver or some other animal she by magic power form dry land on which to reside at the time she fall from the sky she be pregnant and in due time be deliver of a daughter whose name unfortunately the legend do not record this daughter grow to womanhood and conceive without have see a man for none be as yet create the product of she womb be twin and even before birth one of they betray he restless and evil nature by refuse to be bear in the usual manner but insist on break through he parent 's side -lrb- or armpit -rrb- he do so but it cost he mother she life she body be bury and from it spring the various vegetable production which the new earth require to fit it for the habitation of man from she head grow the pumpkin vine from she breast the maize from she limb the bean and other useful esculent meanwhile the two brother grow up the one be name ioskeha he go about the earth which at that time be arid and waterless and call forth the spring and lake and form the sparkling brook and broad river but he brother the troublesome tawiscara he whose obstinacy have cause they mother 's death create a immense frog which swallow all the water and leave the earth as dry as before ioskeha be inform of this by the partridge and immediately set out for he brother 's country for they have divide the earth between they soon he come to the gigantic frog and pierce it in the side -lrb- or armpit -rrb- the water flow out once more in they accustomed way then it be reveal to ioskeha by he mother 's spirit that tawiscara intend to slay he by treachery therefore when the brother meet as they soon do it be evident that a mortal combat be to begin now they be not man but god whom it be impossible really to kill nor even could either be seemingly slay except by one particular substance a secret which each have in he own keep as therefore a contest with ordinary weapon would have be vain and unavailing they agree to tell each other what to each be the fatal implement of war ioskeha acknowledge that to he a branch of the wild rose -lrb- or accord to another version a bag fill with maize -rrb- be more dangerous than anything else and tawiscara disclose that the horn of a deer could alone reach he vital part they lay off the list and tawiscara have the first chance attack he brother violently with a branch of the wild rose and beat he till he lay as one dead but quickly revive ioskeha assault tawiscara with the antler of a deer and deal he a blow in the side the blood flow from the wound in stream the unlucky combatant flee from the field hasten toward the west and as he run the drop of he blood which fall upon the earth turn into flint stone ioskeha do not spare he but hasten after finally slew he he do not however actually kill he for as i have say these be being who could not die and in fact tawiscara be merely drive from the earth and force to reside in the far west where he become ruler of the spirit of the dead these go there to dwell when they leave the body behind they here ioskeha return peaceably devoted himself to people the land he open a cave which exist in the earth and allow to come forth from it all the variety of animal with which the wood and prairie be people in order that they might be more easily catch by man he wound every one in the foot except the wolf which dodge he blow for that reason this beast be one of the most difficult to catch he then form man and give they life and instruct they in the art of make fire which he himself have learn from the great tortoise furthermore he teach they how to raise maize and it be in fact ioskeha himself who impart fertility to the soil and through he bounty and kindness the grain return a hundred fold nor do they suppose that he be a distant invisible unapproachable god no he be ever at hand with instruction and assistance be there to be a failure in the harvest he would be see early in the season thin with anxiety about he people hold in he hand a blighted ear of corn do a hunter go out after game he ask the aid of ioskeha who would put fat animal in the way be he so mind at they village festival he be present and partook of the cheer once in 1640 when the smallpox be desolate the village of the huron we be tell by father lalemant that a indian say there have appear to he a beautiful youth of impose stature and address he with these word : have no fear i be the master of the earth whom you huron adore under the name _ ioskeha _ the french wrongly call I jesus because they do not know I it grieve I to see the pestilence that be destroy my people and i come to teach you its cause and its remedy its cause be the presence of these stranger and its remedy be to drive out these black robe -lrb- the missionary -rrb- to drink of a certain water which i shall tell you of and to hold a festival in my honor which must be keep up all night until the dawn of day the home of ioskeha be in the far east at that part of the horizon where the sun rise there he have he cabin and there he dwell with he grandmother the wise ataensic she be a woman of marvelous magical power and be capable of assume any shape she please in she hand be the fate of all man 's life and while ioskeha look after the thing of life it be she who appoint the time of death and concern herself with all that relate to the close of existence hence she be fear not exactly as a maleficent deity but as one whose business be with what be most dreaded and gloomy it be say that on a certain occasion four bold young man determine to journey to the sun-rising and visit the great ioskeha they reach he cabin and find he there alone he receive they affably and they converse pleasantly but at a certain moment he bid they hide themselves for they life as he grandmother be come they hastily conceal themselves and immediately ataensic enter she magic insight have warn she of the presence of guest and she have assume the form of a beautiful girl dress in gay raiment she neck and arm resplendent with collar and bracelet of wampum she inquire for the guest but ioskeha anxious to save they dissemble and reply that he know not what she mean she go forth to search for they when he call they forth from they hiding place and bid they flee and thus they escape it be say of ioskeha that he act the part of husband to he grandmother in other word the myth present the germ of that conception which the priest of ancient egypt endeavor to express when they teach that osiri be he own father and he own son that he be the self-generating one even that he be the father of he own mother these be grossly materialistic expression but they be perfectly clear to the student of mythology they be mean to convey to the mind the self-renewing power of life in nature which be exemplify in the sowing and the seed the winter and the summer the dry and the rainy season and especially the sunset and sunrise they be echo in the soul of man of the ceaseless rhythm in the operation of nature and they become the only guarantor of he hope for immortal life -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : such epithet be common in the egyptian religion to most of the god of fertility amun call in some of the inscription the soul of osiri derive he name from the root _ man _ to impregnate to beget in the karnak inscription he be also term the husband of he mother this too be the favorite appellation of chem who be a form of horo see dr cp tiele _ history of the egyptian religion _ pp 124 146 149 150 etc -rrb- let we look at the name in the myth before we for confirmation of this _ ioskeha _ be in the oneida dialect of the iroquois a impersonal verbal form of the third person singular and mean literally it be about to grow white that be to become light to dawn _ ataensic _ be from the root _ aouen _ water and mean literally she who be in the water -lrb- 1 -rrb- plainly express the sense of the story be that the orb of light rise daily out of the boundless water which be suppose to surround the land precede by the dawn which fade away as soon as the sun have rise each day the sun disappear in these water to rise again from they the succeed morning as the approach of the sun cause the dawn it be merely a gross way of state this to say that the solar god be the father of he own mother the husband of he grandmother -lrb- footnote 1 : i have analyze these word in a note to another work and need not repeat the matter here the less so as i be not aware that the etymology have be question see _ myth of the new world _ 2d ed p 183 note -rrb- the position of ioskeha in mythology be also show by the other name under which he be perhaps even more familiar to most of the iroquois this be _ tharonhiawakon _ which be also a verbal form of the third person with the dual sign and literally mean he hold -lrb- or hold up -rrb- the sky with he two arm -lrb- 1 -rrb- in other word he be nearly ally to the ancient aryan dyâus the sky the heaven especially the sky in the daytime -lrb- footnote 1 : a careful analysis of this name be give by father ja cuoq probably the best living authority on the iroquois in he _ lexique de la langue iroquoise _ p 180 -lrb- montreal 1882 -rrb- here also the iroquois follow precisely the line of thought of the ancient egyptian shu in the religion of heliopolis represent the cosmic light and warmth the quicken creative principle it be he who as it be state in the inscription hold up the heaven and he be depict on the monument as a man with uplifted arm who support the vault of heaven because it be the intermediate light that separate the earth from the sky shu be also god of the wind in a passage of the book of the dead he be make to say : i be shu who drive the wind onward to the confines of heaven to the confines of the earth even to the confines of space again like ioskeha shu be say to have beget himself in the womb of he mother nu or nun who be like ataensic the goddess of water the heavenly ocean the primal sea tiele _ history of the egyptian religion _ pp 84-86 -rrb- the signification of the conflict with he twin brother be also clearly see in the two name which the latter likewise bear in the legend one of these be that which i have give _ tawiscara _ which there be little doubt be ally to the root _ tiokara _ it grow dark the other be _ tehotennhiaron _ the root word of which be _ kannhia _ the flint stone this name he receive because in he battle with he brother the drop of blood which fall from he wound be change into flint -lrb- 1 -rrb- here the flint have the same meaning which i have already point out in algonkin myth and we find therefore a absolute identity of mythological conception and symbolism between the two nation -lrb- footnote 1 : cuoq _ lexique de la langue iroquoise _ p 180 who give a full analysis of the name -rrb- could these myth have be historically identical it be hard to disbelieve it yet the nation be bitter enemy they language be totally unlike these same similarity present themselves over such wide area and between nation so remote and of such different culture that the theory of a parallelism of development be after all the more credible explanation the impression which natural occurrence make on mind of equal stage of culture be very much alike the same thought be evoke and the same expression suggest themselves as appropriate to convey these thought in speak language this be often exhibit in the identity of expression between master-poet of the same generation and between cotemporaneous thinker in all branch of knowledge still more likely be it to occur in primitive and uncultivated condition where the most obvious form of expression be at once adopt and the resource of the mind be necessarily limit this be a simple and reasonable explanation for the remarkable sameness which prevail in the mental product of the lower stage of civilization and do away with the necessity of suppose a historic derivation

grande and the gilum south almost to the isthmus of panama they be familiarly know as aztec or mexican and the language common to they all be the _ nahuatl _ a word of they own mean the pleasant sound they mythology have be preserve in greater fullness than that of any other american people and for this reason i be enable to set forth in ampler detail the element of they hero-myth which indeed may be take as the most perfect type of those i have collect in this volume § 1 _ the two antagonist _ the culture hero of the aztec be quetzalcoatl and the lead drama the central myth in all the extensive and intricate theology of the nahuatl speaking tribe be he long contest with tezcatlipoca a contest observe a eminent mexican antiquary which come to be the main element in the nahuatl religion and the cause of its modification and which materially influence the destiny of that race from its earliest epoch to the time of its destruction -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : alfredo chavero _ la piedra del sol _ in the _ anale del museo nacional de mexico _ tom ii p 247 -rrb- the explanation which have be offer of this struggle have vary with the theory of the writer propound they it have be regard as a simple historical fact as a figure of speech to represent the struggle for supremacy between two race as a astronomical statement refer to the relative position of the planet venus and the moon as a conflict between christianity introduce by saint thoma and the native heathenism and as have other meaning not less unsatisfactory or absurd place it side by side with other american hero-myth we shall see that it present essentially the same trait and undoubtedly must be explain in the same manner all of they be the transparent story of a simple people to express in intelligible term the daily struggle that be ever go on between day and night between light and darkness between storm and sunshine like all the hero of light quetzalcoatl be identify with the east he be bear there and arrive from there and hence las casas and other speak of he as from yucatan or as landing on the shore of the mexican gulf from some unknown land he day of birth be that call ce acatl one reed and by this name he be often known but this sign be that of the east in aztec symbolism -lrb- 1 -rrb- in a myth of the formation of the sun and moon present by sahagun -lrb- 2 -rrb- a voluntary victim spring into the sacrificial fire that the god have build they know that he will rise as the sun but they do not know in what part of the horizon that will be some look one way some another but quetzalcoatl watch steadily the east and be the first to see and welcome the orb of light he be fair in complexion with abundant hair and a full beard border on the red -lrb- 3 -rrb- as be all the dawn hero and like they he be a instructor in the art and favor peace and mild law -lrb- footnote 1 : chavero _ anale del museo nacional de mexico _ tom ii p 14 243 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ historia de las cosas de nueva españa _ lib vii cap ii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : la barba longa entre cana y roja el cabello largo muy llano diego duran _ historia _ in kingsborough vol viii p 260 -rrb- he name be symbolic and be capable of several equally fair rendering the first part of it _ quetzallus _ mean literally a large handsome green feather such as be very highly prize by the native hence it come to mean in a adjective sense precious beautiful beloved admirable the bird from which these feather be obtain be the _ quetzal-tototl _ -lrb- _ tototl _ bird -rrb- and be call by ornithologist _ trogon splenden _ the latter part of the name _ coatl _ have in aztec three entirely different meaning it mean a guest also twin and lastly as a syncopated form of _ cohuatl _ a serpent metaphorically _ cohuatl _ mean something mysterious and hence a supernatural be a god thus montezuma when he build a temple in the city of mexico dedicate to the whole body of divinity a regular pantheon name it _ coatecallus _ the house of the serpent -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : coatecallus que quiere decir el _ templo de la culebra _ que sin metáfora quiere decir _ templo de diversos dioses _ duran _ historia de las indias de nueva españa _ cap lviii -rrb- through these various meaning a good defense can be make of several different translation of the name and probably it bear even to the native different meaning at different time i be incline to believe that the original sense be that advocate by becerra in the seventeenth century and adopt by veitium in the eighteenth both competent aztec scholar -lrb- 1 -rrb- they translate quetzalcoatl as the admirable twin and though they notion that this refer to thoma didymus the apostle do not meet my view i believe they be right in they etymology the reference be to the duplicate nature of the light-god as see in the setting and rise sun the sun of to-day and yesterday the same yet different this have its parallel in many other mythology -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : becerra _ felicidad de méjico _ 1685 quote in veitium _ historium del origen de las gentes que poblaron la américa septentrional _ cap xix -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in the egyptian book of the dead ra the sun-god say i be a soul and its twin or my soul be become two twin this mean that the soul of the sun-god be one but now that it be bear again it divide into two principal form ra be worship at a under he two prominent manifestation as tum the primal god or more definitely god of the sun at evening and as harmachi god of the new sun the sun at dawn tiele _ history of the egyptian religion _ p 80 -rrb- the correctness of this supposition seem to be show by a prevail superstition among the aztec about twin and which strikingly illustrate the uniformity of mythological conception throughout the world all reader be familiar with the twin romulus and remus in roman story one of whom be fate to destroy they grandfather amulius with edipus and telepho whose father laio be warn that he death would be by one of he child with theseus and peirithoo the former destine to cause the suicide of he father aigeus and with many more such myth they can be trace without room for doubt back to simple expression of the fact that the morning and the evening of the one day can only come when the previous day be past and go express figuratively by the statement that any one day must destroy its predecessor this lead to the story of the fatal child which we find so frequent in aryan mythology -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : sir george w cox _ the science of comparative mythology and folk lore _ pp 14 83 130 etc -rrb- the aztec be a coarse and bloody race and carry out they superstition without remorse base no doubt on this mythical expression of a natural occurrence they have the belief that if twin be allow to live one or the other of they would kill and eat he father or mother therefore it be they custom when such be bring into the world to destroy one of they -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : gerónimo de mendieta _ historia eclesiastica indiana _ lib ii cap xix -rrb- we shall see that as in algonkin story michabo strove to slay he father the west wind so quetzalcoatl be in constant warfare with he father tezcatlipoca-camaxtlus the spirit of darkness the effect of this oft-repeated myth on the mind of the superstitious native be to lead they to the brutal child murder i have mention it be however natural that the more ordinary mean the feathered or bird-serpent should become popular and in the picture write some combination of the serpent with feather or other part of a bird be often employ as the rebus of the name quetzalcoatl he be also know by other name as like all the prominent god in early mythology he have various title accord to the special attribute or function which be uppermost in the mind of the worshipper one of these be _ papachtic _ he of the flow lock a word which the spaniard shorten to papa and thought be akin to they title of the pope it be however a pure nahuatl word -lrb- 1 -rrb- and refer to the abundant hair with which he be always credit and

because he could do what he please on earth or in heaven and no one could prevent he -lrb- historia de nueva españa lib iii cap ii -rrb- it seem to I that it would rather refer to he demiurgic creative power -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : all these title be to be find in sahagun _ historia de nueva españa _ -rrb- he be say to be form of thin air and darkness and when he be see of man it be as a

footnote 1 : the description of clavigero be worth quote : tezcatlipoca : questo era il maggior dio che in que paesus si adorava dopo il dio invisible o supremo essere era il dio della providenza l'

aztec be polish plate of obsidian trim to a circular form there be a variety of this black stone call _ tezcapoctlus _ smoky mirror stone and from this he image be at time make -lrb- 1 -rrb- this however seem too trivial a explanation -lrb- footnote 1 : sahagun _ historia _ lib ii cap xxxvii -rrb- other have contend that tezcatlipoca as undoubtedly the spirit of darkness and the night refer in its meaning to the moon which hang like a bright round mirror in the sky though partly dull by what the native think a smoke -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ anale del museo nacional _ tom ii p 257 -rrb- i be incline to believe however that the mirror refer to be that first and most familiar of all the surface of water : and that the smoke be the mist which at night rise from lake and river as actual smoke do in the still air as preside over the darkness and the night dream and the phantom of the gloom be suppose to be send by tezcatlipoca and to he be sacred those animal which prowl about

inhabitant and to plunge even the heavenly luminary into a common ruin the half sun create by quetzalcoatl light the world but poorly and the four god come together to consult about add another half to it not wait for they decision tezcatlipoca transform himself into a sun whereupon the other god fill the world with great giant who could tear up tree with they hand when a epoch of thirteen time fifty-two year have pass quetzalcoatl seize a great stick and with a blow of it knock tezcatlipoca from the sky into the water and himself become sun the fall god transform himself into a tiger and emerge from the wave to attack and devour the giant with which he brother have enviously fill the world which he have be light from the sky after this he pass to the nocturnal heaven and become the constellation of the great bear for a epoch the earth flourish under quetzalcoatl as sun but tezcatlipoca be merely bide he time and the epoch end he appear as a tiger and give quetzalcoatl such a blow with he paw that it hurl he from the sky the overthrow god revenge himself by sweep the earth with so violent a tornado that it destroy all the inhabitant but a few and these be change into monkey he victorious brother then place in the heaven as sun tlaloc the god of darkness water and rain but after half a epoch quetzalcoatl pour a flood of fire upon the earth drive tlaloc from the sky and place in he stead as sun the goddess chalchiutlicue the emerald skirt wife of tlaloc in she time the rain pour so upon the earth that all human being be drown or change into fish and at last the heaven themselves fall and sun and star be alike quench then the two brother whose strife have bring this ruin unite they effort and raise again the sky rest it on two mighty tree the tree of the mirror -lrb- _ tezcaquahuitl _ -rrb- and the beautiful great rise tree -lrb- _ quetzalveixochitl _ -rrb- on which the concave heaven have ever since securely rest though we know they better perhaps if we drop the metaphor and call they the mirroring sea and the flowery earth on one of which repose the horizon in whichever direction we may look again the four brother meet together to provide a sun for the now darken earth they decide to make one indeed but such a one as would eat the heart and drink the blood of victim and there must be war upon the earth that these victim could be obtain for the sacrifice then quetzalcoatl build a great fire and take he son -- he son bear of he own flesh without the aid of woman -- and cast he into the flame whence he rise into the sky as the sun which light the world when the light-god kindle the flame of the dawn in the orient sky shortly the sun emerge from below the horizon and ascend the heaven tlaloc god of water follow and into the glowing ash of the pyre throw he son who rise as the moon tezcatlipoca have it now in mind to people the earth and he therefore smite a certain rock with a stick and from it issue four hundred barbarian -lrb-

huitzilopochtlus enter she body to be bear again when therefore the four hundred have gather together to burn she the god come forth fully armed and slew they every one -lrb- footnote 1 : the name chichimeca have be a puzzle the derivation appear to be from _ chichus _ a dog _ mecatl _ a rope accord to general tradition the chichimec be a barbarous people who inhabit mexico before the aztec come yet sahagun say the toltec be the real chichimec -lrb- lib x cap xxix -rrb- in the myth we be now consider they be plainly the star -rrb- it be not hard to guess who be these four hundred youth slay before the sun rise destine to be restore to life and yet again destroy the veil of metaphor be thin which thus conceal to we mind the picture of the myriad star quench every morning by the grow light but return every evening to they appoint place and do any doubt remain it be remove by the direct statement in the echo of this tradition preserve by the kich of guatemalum wherein it be plainly

of this version of the myth be from the work of ramirez de fuen-leal which i consider in some respects the most valuable authority we possess it be take directly from the sacred book of the aztec as

opinion be widely accept that the present be the fifth age or period of the world 's history that it have already undergo four destruction by various cause and that the present period be also to terminate in another such catastrophe the agent of such universal ruin have be a great flood a world-wide conflagration frightful tornado and famine earthquake and wild beast and hence the age sun or period be call respectively from they termination those of water fire air and earth as we do not know the destiny of the fifth the present one it have as yet no name i shall not attempt to go into the detail of this myth the less so as it have recently be analyze with much minuteness by the mexican antiquary chavero -lrb- 1 -rrb- i will merely point out that it be too closely identify with a great many similar myth for we to be allow to seek a origin for it peculiar to mexican or even american soil we can turn to the tualatus who live in oregon and they will tell we of the four creation and destruction of mankind how at the end of the first age all human being be change into star at the end of the second they become stone at the end of the third into fish and at the close of the fourth they disappear to give place to the tribe that now inhabit the world -lrb- 2 -rrb- or we can read from the cuneiform inscription of ancient babylon and find the four destruction of the race there specify as by a flood by wild beast by famine and by pestilence -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : alfredo chavero _ la piedra del sol _ in the _ anale del museo nacional _ tom i p 353 et seq -rrb-

paul haupt _ der keilinschriftliche sintfluthbericht _ p 17 -lrb- leipzig 1881 -rrb- -rrb- the explanation which i have to give of these coincidence -- which could easily be increase -- be that the number four be choose as that of the four cardinal point and that the fifth or present age that in which we live be that which be rule by the ruler of the four point by the spirit of light who be believe to govern they as in fact the early dawn do by define the relation of space act as guide and governor of the motion of man all through aztec mythology tradition and custom we can discover this ancient myth of the four brother the four ancestor of they race or the four chieftain who lead they progenitor to they respective habitation the rude mountaineer of meztitlan who worship with particular zeal tezcatlipoca and quetzalcoatl and have inscribe in gigantic figure the sacred five point symbol of the latter on the side of a vast precipice in they land give the symbolic title to the primeval quadruplet -- _ ixcuin _ he who have four face _ hueytecpatl _ the ancient flint-stone _ tentetemic _ the lip-stone that slay _ nanacatltzatzus _ he who speak when intoxicate with the poisonous mushroom call _ nanacatl _ these four brother accord to the myth be bear of the goddess hueytonantzin which mean we great ancient mother and with unfilial hand turn against she and slew she sacrifice she to the sun and offer she heart to that divinity -lrb- 1 -rrb- in other word it be the old story of the cardinal point define at daybreak by the dawn the eastern aurora which be lose in or sacrifice to the sun on its appearance -lrb- footnote 1 : gabriel de chaves _ relacion de la provincia de meztitlan _ 1556 in the _ colecion de documentos ineditos del archivo de indias _ tom iv pp 535 and 536 the translation of the name be not give by chave but i think they be correct except possibly the third which may be a compound of _ tentetl _ lipstone _ temictlus _ dream instead of with _ temictus _ slayer -rrb- of these four brother i suspect the first ixcuin he who look four way or have four face be none other than quetzalcoatl -lrb- 1 -rrb- while the ancient flint be probably tezcatlipoca thus bring the myth into singularly close relationship with that of the iroquois give on a previous page -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ixcuina _ be also the name of the goddess of pleasure the derivation be from _ ixtlus _ face _ cuus _ to take and _ na _ four see the note of mm jourdanet and simeon to they translation of sahagun _ historium _ p 22 -rrb- another myth of the aztec give these four brother or primitive hero as : -- huitzilopochtli huitznahua itztlacoliuhquus pantecatl of these dr schultz-sellack advance plausible reason for believe that itztlacoliuhquus which be the name of a certain form of head-dress be another title of quetzalcoatl and that pantecatl be one of the name of tezcatlipoca -lrb- 1 -rrb- if this be the case we have here another version of the same myth

in the glorious city of tollan -lrb- tulum -rrb- the teacher of the art the wise lawgiver the virtuous prince the master builder and the merciful judge here again though the scene be transfer from heaven to earth and from the cycle of other world to a date not extremely remote the story continue to be of he contest with tezcatlipoca and of the wiles of this enemy now diminish to a potent magician and jealous rival to dispossess and drive he from famous tollan no one verse in the metaphor of mythology can be deceive by the thin veil of local color which surround the myth in this its terrestrial and historic form apart from its be but a repetition or continuation of the genuine ancient account of the conflict of day and night light and darkness which i have already give the name tollan be enough to point out the place and the power with which the story deal for this tollan where quetzalcoatl reign be not by any means as some have suppose the little town of tulum still alive a dozen league or so northwest from the city of mexico nor be it as the legend usually state in some undefined locality from six hundred to a thousand league northwest of that city nor yet in asia as some antiquary have maintain nor indeed anywhere upon this weary world but it be as the name denote and as the native historian tezozomoc long since translate it where the bright sun life and where the god of light forever rule so long as that orb be in the sky tollan be but a syncopated form of _ tonatlan _ the place of the sun -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : tonalan ô lugar del sol say tezozomoc -lrb- _ cronica mexicana _ chap i -rrb- the full form be _ tonatlan _ from _ tona _ hacer sol and the place end _ tlan _ the derivation from _ tollin _ a rush be of no value and it be nothing to the point that in the picture write tollan be represent by a bundle of rush -lrb- kingsborough vol vi p 177 note -rrb- as that be merely in accordance with the rule of the picture writing which represent name by rebus still more worthless be the derivation give by herrera -lrb- _ historia de las indias occidental _ dec iii lib i cap xi -rrb- that it mean lugar de tuna or the place where the tuna -lrb- the fruit of the opuntium -rrb- be find inasmuch as the word _ tuna _ be not from the aztec at all but belong to that dialect of the arawack speak by the native of cuba and haitus -rrb- it be worth while to examine the whereabouts and character of this marvelous city of tollan somewhat closely for it be a place that we hear of in the oldest myth and legend of many and different race not only the aztec but the maya of yucatan and the kich and cakchiquel of guatemalum bewail in woful song the loss to they of that beautiful land and count its destruction as a common start point in they annals -lrb- 1 -rrb- well might they regret it for not again would they find its like in that land the crop of maize never fail and the ear grow as long as a man 's arm the cotton burst its

as tollan the name of that land be significant it be call the white or bright land _ aztlan _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- in its midst be situate the mountain or hill colhuacan the divine _ teoculhuacan _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the base of this hill be the seven cavern _ chicomoztoc _ whence the seven tribe with they respective god have issue those god include quetzalcoatl huitzilopochtlus and the tezcatlipoca there continue to live they mother await they return -lrb- footnote 1 : the derivation of aztlan from _ aztatl _ a heron have be reject by buschmann and the best aztec scholar it be from the same root as _

serpent of the cloud or the white cloud twin _ iztac mixcoatl _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- whoever he be we can hardly mistake the mountain in which or upon which he dwell _ colhuacan _ mean the bent or curved mountain it be none other than the hill of heaven curve down on all side to the horizon upon it in all time have dwell the god and from it they have come to aid the man they favor absolutely the same name be apply by the choctaw to the mythical hill from which they say they ancestor first emerge into the light of day they call it _ nane waiyah _ the bent or curved hill -lrb- 2 -rrb- such identity of metaphorical expression leave little room for discussion -lrb- footnote 1 : mendieta _ historium eclesiastica indiana _ lib ii cap xxxiii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see my work _ the myth of the new

dwell await they return from earth no one can entirely climb the mountain for from its middle distance to the summit it be of fine and slippery sand but it have this magical virtue that whoever ascend it however old he be grow young again in proportion as he mount and be thus restore to pristine vigor the happy dweller around it have however no need of its youth restore power for in that land no

hasta donde le parece y vuelve de la edad que quiere duran in kingsborough vol viii p 201 -rrb- when quetzalcoatl therefore be allege to be the son of the lord of the seven cave it be nothing more than a variation of the legend that give he out as the son of the lord of the high heaven they both mean the same thing chimalman who appear in both myth as he mother bind the two together and stamp they as identical while mixcoatl be only another name for tezcatlipoca such a interpretation if correct would lead to the dismissal from history of the whole story of the seven city or cave and the pretended migration from they in fact the repeat endeavor of the chronicler to assign a location to these fabulous residence have lead to no result other than most admire disorder and confusion it be as vain to seek they whereabouts as it be that of the garden of eden or the isle of avalon they have not and never have a place on this sublunary sphere but belong in that ethereal world which the fancy create and the imagination paint a more prosaic account than any of the above be give by the historian alva ixtlilxochitl so prosaic that it be possible that it have some grain of actual fact in it -lrb- 1 -rrb- he tell we that a king of tollan tecpancaltzin fall in love with the daughter of one of he subject a maiden by name xochitl the rise she father be the first to collect honey from the maguey plant and on pretence of buy this delicacy the king often send for xochitl he accomplish she seduction and hide she in a rose garden on a mountain where she give birth to a infant son to the great anger of the father cast the horoscope of the infant the court astrologer find all the sign that he should be the last king of tollan and should witness the destruction of the toltec monarchy he be name _ meconetzin _ the son of the maguey and in due time become king and the prediction be accomplish -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ixtlilxochitl _ relacione historica _ p 330 in kingsborough

associate with the god of this beverage and of drunkenness hence it be probable that the name _ meconetzin _ apply to quetzalcoatl in this myth mean to convey that he be the son of tezcatlipoca -rrb- in several point however this seemingly historic narrative have a suspicious resemblance to a genuine myth preserve to we in a certain aztec manuscript know as the _ codex telleriano-remensis _ this document tell how quetzalcoatl tezcatlipoca and they brethren be at first god and dwelt as star in the heaven they pass they time in paradise in a rise garden _ xochitlycacan _ -lrb- where the rose be lift up -rrb- but on a time they begin pluck the rose from the great rise tree in the center of the garden and tonaca-tecutlus in he anger at they action hurl they to the earth where they live as mortal the significance of this myth as apply to the daily descent of sun and star from the zenith to the horizon be too obvious to need special comment and the coincidence of the rose garden on the mountain -lrb- in the one instance the hill of heaven in the other a suppose terrestrial elevation -rrb- from which quetzalcoatl issue and the anger of the parent seem to indicate that the suppose historical relation of ixtlilxochitl be but a myth dress in historic garb the second cycle of legend disclaim any miraculous parentage for the hero of tollan la casas narrate he arrival from the east from some part of yucatan he think with a few follower -lrb- 1 -rrb- a tradition which be also repeat with definitiveness by the native historian alva ixtlilxochitl but leave the locality uncertain -lrb- 2 -rrb- the historian veytium on the other hand describe he as arrive from the north a full grown man tall of stature white of skin and full-bearded barefooted and bareheaded clothe in a long white robe strew with red cross and carry a staff in he hand -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : torquemada _ monarquium indiana _ lib vi cap xxiv this be apparently the canonical doctrine in cholulum

agree as to the greatness and purity of he character and the magnificence of tollan under he reign he temple be divide into four apartment one toward the east yellow with gold one toward the west blue

-rrb- these name be interesting as illustrate the halo of symbolism which surround the history of the light-god -rrb- i have say that the history of quetzalcoatl in tollan be but a continuation of the conflict of the two primal brother god it be still the implacable tezcatlipoca who pursue and finally conquer he but there be this significant difference that whereas in the elemental warfare portray in the older myth mutual violence and alternate destruction prevail in all these later myth quetzalcoatl make no effort at defense scarcely remonstrate but accept he defeat as a decree of fate which it be vain to resist he see he people fall about he and the beautiful city sink into destruction but he know it be the hand of destiny and prepare himself to meet the inevitable with what stoicism and dignity he may the one be the quenching of the light by the darkness of the tempest and the night represent as a struggle in the other it be the gradual and calm but certain and unavoidable extinction of the sun as it noiselessly sink to the western horizon the story of the subtlety of tezcatlipoca be variously tell in what may well be its oldest and simplest version it be say that in he form as camaxtlus he catch a deer with two head which so long as he keep it secure he luck in war but fall in with one of five goddess he have create he beget a son and through this act he lose he good fortune the son be quetzalcoatl surnamed ce acatl and he become lord of tollan and a famous warrior for many year he rule the city and at last begin to build a very great temple while engage in its construction tezcatlipoca come to he one day and tell he that toward hondura in a place call tlapallan a house be ready for he and he must quit tollan and go there to live and die quetzalcoatl reply that the heaven and star have already warn he that after four year he must go hence and that he would obey the time past he take with he all the inhabitant of tulum and some he leave in cholulum from whom its inhabitant be descend and some he place in the province of cuzcatan and other in cempoal and at last he reach tlapallan and on the very day he arrive there he fall sick and die as for tulum it remain without a inhabitant for nine year -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ramirez de fuen-leal _ historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas _ cap viii -rrb- a more minute account be give by the author of the _ annals of cuauhtitlan _ a work write at a early date in the aztec tongue he assure he reader that he narrative of these particular event be minutely and accurately record from the oldest and most authentic tradition it be this : -- when those oppose to quetzalcoatl do not succeed in they design they summon to they aid a demon or sorcerer by name tezcatlipoca and he assistant he say : we will give he a drink to dull he reason and will show he he own face in a mirror and surely he will be lose then tezcatlipoca brew a intoxicating beverage the _ pulque _ from the maguey and take a mirror he wrap it in a rabbit skin and go to the house of quetzalcoatl go tell you master he say to the servant that i have come to show he he own flesh what be this say quetzalcoatl when the message be deliver what do he call my own flesh go and ask he but tezcatlipoca refuse i have not come to see you but you master he say to the servant then he be admit and quetzalcoatl say : -- welcome youth you have trouble yourself much whence come you what be this my flesh that you would show I my lord and priest reply the youth i come from the mountain-side of nonoalco look now at you flesh know yourself see yourself as you be see of other and with that he hand he the mirror as soon as quetzalcoatl see he face in the mirror he exclaim : -- how be it possible my subject can look on I without affright well might they flee from I how can a man remain among they fill as i be with foul sore he face wrinkled and he aspect loathsome i shall be see no more i shall no longer frighten my people then tezcatlipoca go away to take counsel and return say : -- my lord and master use the skill of you servant i have come to console you go forth to you people i will conceal you defect by art do what you please reply quetzalcoatl i will see what my fate be to be tezcatlipoca paint he cheek green and dye he lip red the forehead he color yellow and take feather of the _ quechol _ bird he arrange they as a beard quetzalcoatl survey himself in the mirror and rejoice at he appearance and forthwith sally forth to see he people tezcatlipoca withdraw to concoct another scheme of disgrace with he attendant he take of the strong _ pulque _ which he have brew and come again to the palace of the lord of tollan they be refuse admittance and ask they country they reply that they be from the mountain of the holy priest from the hill of tollan when quetzalcoatl hear this he order they to be admit and ask they business they offer he the _ pulque _ but he refuse say that he be sick and moreover that it would weaken he judgment and might cause he death they urge he to dip but the tip of he finger in it to taste it he comply but even so little of the magic liquor overthrow he self control and take the bowl he quaff a full draught and be drunk then these perverse man ridicule he and cry out : -- you feel finely now my son sing we a song sing worthy priest thereupon quetzalcoatl begin to sing as follow : -- my pretty house my coral house i call it zacuan by name and must i leave it do you say oh my oh I and ah for shame -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the original be -- quetzal quetzal no callus zacuan no callin tapach no callin nic yacahuaz a ya a ya a quilmach literally -- beautiful beautiful -lrb- be -rrb- my house zacuan my house of coral my house i must leave it alas alas they say zacuan instead of be a proper name may mean a rich yellow leather from the bird call _ zacuantototl _ -rrb- as the fume of the liquor still further disorder he reason he call he attendant and bid they hasten to he sister quetzalpetlatl who dwell on the mountain nonoalco and bring she that she too might taste the divine liquor the attendant hurry off and say to he sister : -- noble lady we have come for you the high priest quetzalcoatl await you it be he wish that you come and live with he she instantly obey and go with they on she arrival quetzalcoatl seat she beside he and give she to drink of the magical pulque immediately she feel its influence and quetzalcoatl begin to sing in drunken fashion -- sister mine beloved mine quetzal -- petlatl -- tzin come with I drink with I ` tis no sin sin sin soon they be so drunken that all reason be forget they say no prayer they go not to the bath and they sink asleep on the floor -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it be not clear at least in the translation whether the myth intimate a incestuous relation between quetzalcoatl and he sister in the song he call she nohueltiuh which mean strictly my elder sister but mendoza translate it querida esposa mium _ quetzalpetlatl _ mean the beautiful carpet _ petlatl _ be the rug or mat use on floor etc this would be a most appropriate figure of speech to describe a rich tropical landscape carpet with flower as we say and as the earth be in primitive cosmogony older than the sun i suspect that this story of quetzalcoatl and he sister refer to the sun sink from heaven seemingly into the earth lo nahoa remark chavero figuraban la tierra en forma de un cuadrilátero dividido en pequeños quatros lo que semijaba una estera _ petlatl _ -lrb- _ anale del museo

habitation deep under ground let they bury my bright treasure in the earth let they throw the gleaming gold and shine stone into the holy fountain where i take my daily bath all this be do and quetzalcoatl spend four day in he underground tomb when he come forth he weep and tell he follower that the time have come for he to depart for tlapallan the red land tlillan the dark land and tlatlallan the fire land all name of one locality he journey eastward until he come to a place where the sky and land and water meet together -lrb- 1 -rrb- there he attendant build a funeral pile and he throw himself into the flame as he body burn he heart rise to heaven and after four day become the planet venus -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : designate in the aztec original by the name _ teoapan ilhuicaatenco _ from _ teotl _ divine _ atl _ water _ pan _ in or near _ ilhuicac _ heaven _ atenco _ the waterside : near the divine water where the sky meet the strand -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the whole of this account be from the _ anales de cuauhtitlan _ pp 16-22 -rrb- that there be a profound moral significance in this fiction all will see but i be of opinion that it be accidental and adventitious the means that tezcatlipoca employ to remove quetzalcoatl refer to the two event that mark the decline of day the sun be reflect by a long lane of beam in the surface water of lake or sea it lose the strength of its ray and fail in vigor while the evening mist the dampness of approach dewfall and the gathering cloud obscure its power and foretell the extinction which will soon engulf the bright luminary as quetzalcoatl cast he shine gold and precious stone into the water where he take he nightly bath or bury they in underground hiding place so the sun conceal he glory under the water or in the distant hill into which he seem to sink as he disappear at certain season the star of evening shine brightly forth amid the linger and fading ray rise as it be from the die fire of the sunset to this it may be object that the legend make quetzalcoatl journey toward the east and not toward the sunset the explanation of this apparent contradiction be easy the aztec sage have at some time propound to themselves the question of how the sun which seem to set in the west can rise the next morning in the east mungo parke tell we that when he ask the desert arab this conundrum they reply that the inquiry be frivolous and childish as be wholly beyond the capacity of the human mind the aztec do not think so and have frame a definite theory which overcome the difficulty it be that in fact the sun only advance to the zenith and then return to the east from whence it start what we seem to see as the sun between the zenith and the western horizon be in reality not the orb itself but only its _ brightness _ one of its accident not its substance to use the term of metaphysics hence to the aztec astronomer and sage the house of the sun be always toward the east -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ramirez de fuen-leal _ historium _ cap xx p 102 -rrb- we need not have recourse even to this explanation the sun indeed disappear in the west but he journey must necessarily be to the east for it be from that point that he always come forth each morning the light-god must necessarily daily return to the place whence he start the symbol of the mirror and the mystic drink be perfectly familiar in aryan sun-myth the best know of the story refer to the former be the transparent tale of narcissus force by nemesis to fall in love with he own image reflect in the water and to pine away through unsatisfied longing or as pausania tell the story have lose he twin sister -lrb- the morning twilight -rrb- he waste he life in note the likeness of he own feature to those of he beloved who have pass away the sun as he look down upon he own face reflect in a lake or sea sink or die at last still gaze on it -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : sir george a cox _ the science of mythology and folk lore _ p 96 -rrb- some later writer say that the drink which quetzalcoatl quaff be to confer immortality this be not state in the earliest version of the myth the beverage be health-giving and intoxicating and excite the desire to seek tlapallan but not more it do not as the soma of the veda endow with unending life nevertheless there be another myth which countenance this view and explain it it be tell in the province of meztitlan a mountainous country to the northwest of the province of vera cruz its inhabitant speak the nahuatl tongue but be never subject to the montezuma they chief god be tezcatlipoca and it be say of he that on one occasion he slew ometochtlus -lrb- two rabbit -rrb- the god of wine at the latter 's own request he believe that he thus would be render immortal and that all other who drink of the beverage he preside over would die he death they add be indeed like the stupor of a drunkard who after he lethargy have pass rise healthy and well in this sense of renew life after death he preside over the native calendar the count of year begin with tochtlus the rabbit -lrb- 1 -rrb- thus we see that this be a myth of the return season and of nature wake to life again after the cold month usher in by the chill rain of the late autumn the principle of fertility be alone perennial while each individual must perish and die the god of wine in mexico as in greece be one with the mysterious force of reproduction -lrb- footnote 1 : gabriel de chaves _ relacion de la provincia de meztitlan _ 1556 in the _ colecion de documentos ineditos del archivo de indias _ tom iv p 536 -rrb- no writer have preserve such numerous tradition about the trick of tezcatlipoca in tollan as father sahagun they be no doubt almost verbally report as he be tell they and as he write he history first in the aztec tongue they preserve all the quaintness of the original tale some of they appear to be idle amplification of story teller while other be transparent myth i shall translate a few of they quite literally begin with that of the mystic beverage the time come for the luck of quetzalcoatl and the toltec to end for there appear against they three sorcerer name vitzilopochtli titlacauan and tlacauepan -lrb- 1 -rrb- who practice many villany in the city of tullan titlacauan begin they assume the disguise of a old man of small stature and white hair with this figure he approach the palace of quetzalcoatl and say to the servant : -- -lrb- footnote 1 : titlacauan be the common name of tezcatlipoca the three sorcerer be really quetzalcoatl 's three brother represent the three other cardinal point -rrb- i wish to see the king and speak to he away with you old man say the servant you can not see he he be sick you would only annoy he i must see he answer the old man the servant say wait and go in they tell quetzalcoatl that a old man wish to see he add sire we put he out in vain he refuse to leave and say that he absolutely must see you quetzalcoatl answer : -- let he in i have be wait he come for a long time they admit the old man and he enter the apartment of quetzalcoatl and say to he : -- my lord and son how be you i have with I a medicine for you to drink you be welcome old man reply quetzalcoatl i have be look for you arrival for many day tell I how you be ask the old man how be you body and you health i be very ill answer quetzalcoatl my whole body pain I and i can not move my hand or foot then the old man say : -- sire look at this medicine which i bring you it be good and healthful and intoxicate he who drink it if you will drink it it will intoxicate you it will heal you it will soothe you heart it will prepare you for the labor and fatigue of death or of you departure whither oh ancient man ask quetzalcoatl whither must i go the old man answer : -- you must without fail go to tullan tlapallan where there be another old man await you you and he will talk together and at you return you will be transform into a youth and you will regain the vigor of you boyhood when quetzalcoatl hear these word he heart be shake with strong emotion and the old man add : -- my lord drink this medicine oh ancient man answer the king i do not want to drink it drink it my lord insist the old man for if you do not drink it now later you will long for it at least lift it to you mouth and taste a single drop quetzalcoatl take the drop and taste it and then quaff the liquor exclaiming : -- what be this it seem something very healthful and well-flavored i be no longer sick it have cure I i be well drink again say the old man it be a good medicine and you will be healthier than ever again do quetzalcoatl drink and soon he be intoxicate he begin to weep he heart be stir and he mind turn toward the suggestion of he departure nor do the deceit of the old sorcerer permit he to abandon the thought of it the medicine which quetzalcoatl drink be the white wine of the country make of those maguey call

feel the better for it see nieremberg _ historium natura _ lib xiv cap xxxii teomatl vita et mortis index -rrb- this be but the beginning of the guile and jugglery of tezcatlipoca transform himself

with quetzalcoatl in the sovereignty of tollan -lrb- although other myth apply this name directly to quetzalcoatl and this seem the correct version -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- have a only daughter of surpass beauty whom many of the toltec have vainly seek in marriage this damsel look forth on the market where tezcatlipoca stand in he nakedness and she virginal eye fall upon the sign of he manhood

with desire you must cure she nay my lord say the stranger this may not be rather slay I here i wish to die for i be not worthy to hear such word poor as i be and seek only to gain my bread by sell green pepper but the king insist and say : -- have no fear you alone can restore my daughter you must do so thereupon the attendant cut the sham toveyo 's hair they lead he to the bath and color he body black they place a _ maxtlus _ and a robe upon he and the king say : -- go in unto my daughter tezcatlipoca go in unto she and she be heal from that hour thus do the naked stranger become the son-in-law of the great king of tulum but the toltec be deeply angered that the maiden have give he black body the preference over they bright form and they plot to have he slay he be place in the front of battle and then they leave he alone to fight the enemy but he destroy the oppose host and return to tula with a victory all the more brilliant for they desertion of he then he requite they treachery with another and pursue he intended destruction of they race he send a herald to the top of the hill of shout and through he announce a magnificent festival to celebrate he victory and he marriage the toltec swarm in crowd man woman and child to share in the joyous scene tezcatlipoca receive they with simulated friendship take he drum he begin to beat upon it accompany the music with a

than i have think wise to follow i be strongly incline to regard it as a true myth which in materialistic language set forth the close of the day and the extinction of the light may we not construe the maiden as the evening twilight the child of the day at the close of its life the black lover with whom she be fatally enamored be he not the darkness in which the twilight fade away the countless crowd of toltec that come to the wedding festivity and be drown before midnight in the water of the strangely name river be they not the infinitely numerous light-ray which be quench in the world-stream when the sun have sink and the gloaming be lose in the night may we not go farther and in this rock of light which stand hard by the river recognize the heavenly hill which rise beside the world stream the bright light of one day can not extend to the next the bridge be break by the intervene night and the ray be lose in the dark water but whether this interpretation be too venturesome or not we can not deny the deep human interest in the story and its poetic capacity the overmastering passion of love be evidently as present to the indian mind as to that of the mediaeval italian in new as well as in old spain it could break the barrier of rank and overcome the hesitation of maidenly modesty love clouding the soul as night obscure the day be a figure of speech use i remember by the most pathetic of ireland 's modern bard : -- love the tyrant evince alas a omnipotent might he tread on the neck of prince he darken the mind like night -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : clarence mangan _ poem _ the mariner 's bride -rrb- i shall not detail the many other wiles with which tezcatlipoca lead the toltec to they destruction a mere reference to they must suffice he summon thousand to come to labor in the rose-garden of quetzalcoatl and when they have gather together he fall upon they and slew they with a hoe disguise with huitzilopochtlus he irritated the people until they stone the brother god to death and from the corrupting body spread a pestilential odor to which crowd of the toltec fall victim he turn the thought of thousand into madness so that they voluntarily offer themselves to be sacrifice by he spell all article of food soured and many perish of famine at length quetzalcoatl weary with misfortune give order to burn the beautiful house of tollan to bury he treasure and to begin the journey to tlapallan he transform the cacao tree into plant of no value and order the bird of rich plumage to leave the land before he the first station he arrive at be quauhtitlan where there be a lofty and spread tree here he ask of he servant a mirror and look in it say : i be already old gather some stone he cast they at the tree they enter the wood and remain there as he journey he be precede by boy play the flute thus he reach a certain spot where he sit upon a stone by the wayside and weep for the loss of tollan the mark of he hand remain upon the stone and the tear he drop pierce it through to the day of the conquest these impression on the solid rock be point out at the fountain of cozcapan sorcerer meet he mind to prevent he departure : -- where be you go they ask why have you leave you capital in whose care be it who will perform the sacred rite but quetzalcoatl answer : -- you can in no manner hinder my departure i have no choice but to go the sorcerer ask again : whither be you go i be go reply quetzalcoatl to tlapallan i have be send for the sun call I go then with good luck say they but leave with we the art of smelting silver of work stone and wood of painting of weave feather and other such art thus they rob he and take the rich jewel he carry with he he cast they into the fountain whence it receive its name _ cozcapan _ jewel in the water again as he journey a sorcerer meet he who ask he he destination : -- i go say quetzalcoatl to tlallapan and luck go with you reply the sorcerer but first take a drink of this wine no reply quetzalcoatl not so much as a sip you must taste a little of it say the sorcerer even if it be by force to no living person would i give to drink freely of it i intoxicate they all come and drink of it quetzalcoatl take the wine and drink of it through a reed and as he drink he grow drunken and fall in the road where he sleep and snore thus he pass from place to place with various adventure he servant be all dwarf or hunchback and in cross the sierra nevada they mostly freeze to death by draw a line across the sierra he split it in two and thus make a passage he pluck up a mighty tree and hurl it through another thus form a cross at another spot he cause underground house to be build which be call mictlancalco at the house of darkness at length he arrive at the sea coast where he construct a raft of serpent and seat himself on it as in a canoe he move out to sea no one know how or in what manner he reach tlapallan -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : these myth be from the third book of sahagun 's _ historia de las cosas de nueva españa _ they be take down in the original nahuatl by he from the mouth of the native and he give they word for word as they be recount -rrb- the legend which appear to have be prevalent in cholulum be somewhat different accord to that quetzalcoatl be for many year lord of tollan ruling over a happy people at length tezcatlipoca let himself down from heaven by a cord make of spider 's web and come to tollan challenge its ruler to play a game of ball the challenge be accept and the people of the city gather in thousand to witness the sport suddenly tezcatlipoca change himself into a tiger which so frighten the populace that they flee in such confusion and panic that they rush over the precipice and into the river where nearly all be kill by the fall or drown in the water quetzalcoatl then forsake tollan and journey from city to city till he reach cholulum where he live twenty year he be at that time of light complexion noble stature he eye large he hair abundant he beard ample and cut round in life he be most chaste and honest they worship he memory especially for three thing : first because he teach they the art of work in metal which previous to he come be unknown in that land secondly because he forbid the sacrifice either of human being or the lower animal teach that bread and rose and flower incense and perfume be all that the god demand and lastly because he forbid and do he best to put a stop to war fight robbery and all deed of violence for these reason he be hold in high esteem and affectionate veneration not only by those of cholulum but by the neighbor tribe as well for many league around distant nation maintain temple in he honor in that city and make pilgrimage to it on which journey they pass in safety through they enemy 's country the twenty year past quetzalcoatl resume he journey take with he four of the principal youth of the city when he have reach a point in

of he symbol this have often be make use of by one set of writer to prove that quetzalcoatl be some christian teacher and by other as evidence that these native tale be of a date subsequent to the

sterility to one of a wealth of vegetable growth as there be a close connection in meteorology between the wind and the rain so in aztec mythology there be a equally near one between quetzalcoatl as

indulgence in sexual act here we have a example nearly all the account tell we that quetzalcoatl be never marry and that he hold himself aloof from all woman in absolute chastity we be tell that on one occasion he subject urge upon he the propriety of marriage and to they importunity he return the dark answer that yes he have determine to take a wife but that it would be when the oak tree shall

educate by he nurse toxcueye and who after the destruction of tollan collect the scatter toltec and settle with they around the lake of tezcuco -lrb- _ relacione historica _ p 394 in kingsborough vol

be in vogue house of nun the inmate of which have vow perpetual virginity and it be say that quetzalcoatl himself have found these institution -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ codex vaticanus _ tab xxii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : veitia _ historia _ cap xvii -rrb- he connection with the worship of the reproductive principle seem to be further indicate by he surname _ ce acatl _ this mean one reed and be the name of a day in the calendar but in the nahuatl language the word _ acatl _ reed cornstalk be also apply to the virile member and it have be suggest that this be the real signification of the word when apply to the hero-god the suggestion be plausible but the word do not seem to have be so construe by the early writer if such a understanding have be current it could scarcely have escape the inquiry of such a close student and thorough master of the nahuatl tongue as father sahagun on the other hand it must be say in corroboration of this identification that the same idea appear to be convey by the symbol of the serpent one correct translation of the name quetzalcoatl be the beautiful serpent he temple in the city of mexico accord to torquemada have a door in the form of a serpent 's mouth and in the _ codex vaticanus _ no 3738 publish by lord kingsborough of which we have a explanation by competent native authority he be represent as a serpent while in the same codex in the astrological sign which be suppose to control the different part of the human body the serpent be picture as the sign of the male member -lrb- 1 -rrb- this indicate the probability that in he function as god of reproduction quetzalcoatl may have stand in some relation to phallic rite -lrb- footnote 1 : compare the _ codex vaticanus _ no 3738 plate 44 and 75 kingsborough _ mexican antiquity _ vol ii -rrb- this same sign _ ce coatl _ one serpent use in they astrology be that of one of the god of the merchant and apparently for this reason some writer have identify the chief god of traffic yacatecutlus -lrb- god of journey -rrb- with quetzalcoatl this seem the more likely as another name of this divinity be _ yacacoliuhquus _ with the end curve a name which appear to refer to the curved rod or stick which be both he sign and one of those of quetzalcoatl -lrb- 1 -rrb- the merchant also constantly associate in they prayer this deity with huitzilopochtlus which be another reason for suppose they patron be one of the four primeval brother and but another manifestation of quetzalcoatl he character as patron of art the model of orator and the cultivator of peaceful intercourse among man would naturally lend itself to this position -lrb- footnote 1 : compare torquemada _ monarquium indiana _ lib vi cap xxviii and sahagun _ historia de nueva españa _ lib ix _ passim _ _ yacatecutli _ be from _ tecutlus _ lord and either _ yaqui _ traveler or else _ yacana _ to conduct _ yacacoliuhquus _ be translate by torquemada el que tiene la nariz aquileña it be from _ yaque _ a point or end and hence also the nose and _ coliuhquus _ bent or curve the translation in the text be quite as allowable as that of torquemada and more appropriate i have already mention that this divinity be suspect by dr schultz-sellack to be merely another form of quetzalcoatl see above chapter iii § 2 -rrb- but quetzalcoatl as god of the violent wind-storm which destroy the house and crop and as one who in he own history be drive from he kingdom and lose he all be not consider a deity of invariably good augury he day and sign _ ce acatl _ one reed be of bad omen a person bear on it would not succeed in life -lrb- 1 -rrb- he plan and possession would be lose blow away as it be by the wind and dissipate into thin air -lrb- footnote 1 : sahagun _ historium _ lib iv cap viii -rrb- through the association of he person with the prying wind he come curiously enough to be the patron saint of a certain class of thief who stupefy they victim before rob they they apply to he to exercise he maleficent power on those whom they plan to deprive of they goods he image be bear at the head of the gang when they make they raid and the preferred season be when he sign be in the ascendant -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be a singular parallelism to the aryan herme myth as i have previously observe -lrb- chap i -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ibid lib iv cap xxxi -rrb- the representation of quetzalcoatl in the aztec manuscript he image and the form of he temple and altar refer to he double function as lord of the light and the wind he be not represent with please feature on the contrary sahagun tell we that he face that be that of he image be very ugly with a large head and a full beard -lrb- 1 -rrb- the beard in this and similar instance be to represent the ray of the sun he hair at time be also show rise straight from he forehead for the same reason -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : la cara que tenia era muy fea y la cabeza larga y barbuda _ historia _ lib iii cap iii on the

not demand any uniformity in this respect § 5 _ the return of quetzalcoatl _ quetzalcoatl be go whether he have remove to the palace prepare for he in tlapallan whether he have float out to sea on he

quetzalcoatl be go but _ he would return _ in he own good time in the sign of he year when the age be ripe once more he would come from the east surround by he fair-faced retinue and resume the sway of he people and they descendant tezcatlipoca have conquer but not for aye the immutable law which have fix the destruction of tollan assign likewise its restoration such be the universal belief among the aztec race for this reason quetzalcoatl 's statue or one of they be in a reclining position and cover with wrapping signify that he be absent as of one who lay he down to sleep and that when he should awake from that dream of absence he should rise to rule again the land -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : torquemada _ monarquium indiana _ lib vi cap xxiv so in egyptian mythology tum be call

maya prophecy -- they explanation the high-water mark of ancient american civilization be touch by the maya the race who inhabit the peninsula of yucatan and vicinity its member extend to the pacific coast and include the tribe of vera paz guatemalum and part of chiapa and hondura and have a outlying branch in the hot lowland water by the river panuco north of vera cruz in all it have be estimate that they number at the time of the conquest perhaps two million soul to they be due the vast structure of copan palenque and uxmal and they alone possess a mode of write which rest distinctly on a phonetic basis the zenith of they prosperity have however be pass a century before the spanish conqueror invade they soil a large part of the peninsula of yucatan have be for generation rule in peace by a confederation of several tribe whose capital city be mayapan ten league south of where mérida now stand and whose ruin still cover many hundred acre of the plain somewhere about the year 1440 there be a general revolt of the eastern province mayapan itself be assault and destroy and the peninsula be divide among a number of petty chieftain such be its political condition at the time of the discovery there be numerous populous city well build of stone and mortar but they inhabitant be at war with each other and devoid of unity of purpose -lrb- 1 -rrb- hence they fall a comparatively easy prey to the conquistador -lrb- footnote 1 : francisco de montejo who be the first to explore yucatan -lrb- 1528 -rrb- have leave strong testimony to the majesty of its city and the agricultural industry of its inhabitant he write to the king in the report of he expedition : la tierra es muy poblada y de muy grandes ciudades y villas muy frescas todo lo pueblo son una huerta de frutales _ carta á su magestad 13 abril 1529 _ in the _ coleccion de documentos ineditos del archivo de indias _ tom xiii -rrb- whence come this civilization be it a offshoot of that of the aztec or do it produce the latter these interesting question i can not discuss in full at this time all that concern my present purpose be to treat of they so far as they be connect with the mythology of the race incidentally however this will throw some light on these obscure point and at any rate enable we to dismiss certain prevalent assumption as erroneous one of these be the notion that the toltec be the originator of yucatan culture i hope i have say enough in the previous chapter to exorcise permanently from ancient american history these purely imaginary being they have serve long enough as the last refuge of ignorance let we rather ask what account the maya themselves give of the origin of they art and they ancestor most unfortunately very meager source of information be open to we we have no sahagun to report to we the tradition and prayer of this strange people only fragment of they legend and hint of they history have be save almost by accident from the general wreck of they civilization from these however it be possible to piece together enough to give we a glimpse of they original form and we shall find it not unlike those we have already review there appear to have be two distinct cycle of myth in yucatan the most ancient and general that relate to itzamná the second of later date and different origin refer to kukulcan it be barely possible that these may be different version of the same but certainly they be regard as distinct by the native at and long before the time of the conquest this be see in the account they give of they origin they do not pretend to be autochthonous but claim that they ancestor come from distant region in two band the largest and most ancient immigration be from the east across or rather through the ocean -- for the god have open twelve path through it -- and this be conduct by the mythical civilizer itzamná the second band less in number and later in time come in from the west and with they be kukulcan the former be call the great arrival the latter the less arrival -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cogolludo contradict himself in describe these event say first that the greater band come from the west but later in the same chapter correct himself and criticize father lizana for have commit the same error cogolludo 's authority be the original mss of gaspar antonio a educate native of royal lineage who write in 1582

first priest and teach they the proper rite wherewith to please the god and appease they ill-will he be the patron of the healer and diviner and have disclose to they the mysterious virtue of plant in the month _ uo _ they assemble and make new fire and burn to he incense and have cleanse they book with water draw from a fountain from which no woman have ever drunk the most learn of the sage open the volume to forecast the character of the coming year it be itzamná who first invent the character or letter in which the maya write they numerous book and which they carve in such profusion on the stone and wood of they edifice he also devise they calendar one more perfect even than that of the mexican though in a general way similar to it -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the authority on this phase of itzamná 's character be cogolludo _ historia de yucatan _ lib iv cap iii landa _ cosas de yucatan _ pp 285 289 and beltran de santa rosa maria _ arte del idioma maya _ p 16 the latter have a particularly valuable extract from the now lose maya dictionary of f gabriel de san buenaventura el primero que halló las letras de la lengua maya é hizo el computo de los años meses y edades y lo

happiness of he people for a indefinite period thus itzamna regard as ruler priest and teacher be no doubt speak of as a historical personage and be so put down by various historian even to the most recent -lrb- 1 -rrb- but another form in which he appear prove he to have be a incarnation of deity and carry he history from earth to heaven this be show in the very earliest account we have of the maya mythology -lrb- footnote 1 : crescencio carrillo _ historium antigua de yucatan _ p 144 mérida 1881 though oblige to differ on many point with this indefatigable archaeologist i must not omit to state my appreciation and respect for he earnest interest in the language and antiquity of he country i know of no other yucatecan who have equal enthusiasm or so just a estimate of the antiquarian riches of he native land -rrb- for this account we be indebted to the celebrated las casas the apostle of the indian in 1545 he send a certain priest francisco hernandez by name into the peninsula as a missionary hernandez have already traverse it as chaplain to montejo 's expedition in 1528 and be to some degree familiar with the maya tongue after nearly a year spend among the native he forward a report to las casas in which among other matter he note a resemblance which seem to exist between the myth recount by the maya priest and the christian dogma they tell he that the highest deity they worship be izona who have make man and all thing to he be bear a son name bacab or bacabab by a virgin chibilia whose mother be ixchel bacab be slay by a certain eopuco on the day call _ hemix _ but after three day rise from the dead and ascend into heaven the holy ghost be represent by echuac who furnish the world with all thing necessary to man 's life and comfort ask what bacab mean they reply the son of the great father and echuac they translate by the merchant -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : las casas _ historia apologetica de las indias occidentales _ cap cxxiii -rrb- this be the story that a modern writer say ought to be repudiate without question -lrb- 1 -rrb- but i think not it be not difficult to restore these name to they correct form and then the fancy resemblance to christian theology disappear while the character of the original myth become apparent -lrb- footnote 1 : john t short _ the north american of antiquity _ p 231 -rrb- cogolludo long since justly construe _ izona

number four gigantic brother who support the four corner of the heaven who blow the four wind from the four cardinal point and who preside over the four dominical sign of the calendar as each year in the calendar be suppose to be under the influence of one or the other of these brother one bacab be say to die at the close of the year and after the nameless or intercalary day have pass the next bacab would live and as each computation of the year begin on the day _ imix _ which be the third before the close of the maya week this be say figuratively to be the day of death of the bacab of that year and whereas three -lrb- or four -rrb- day later a new year begin with another bacab the one be say to have die and rise again the myth further relate that the bacab be son of ix-chel she be the goddess of the rainbow which she name signify she be likewise believe to be the guardian of woman in childbirth and one of the patron of the art of medicine the early historian roman and landa also associate she with itzamna -lrb- 1 -rrb- thus verify the legend record by hernandez -lrb- footnote 1 : fray hieronimo roman _ de la republica de las indias occidentales _ lib ii cap xv diego de landa

which also change the noun from the inanimate to the animate sense -rrb- that the rainbow should be personify as wife of the light-god and mother of the rain-god be a idea strictly in accordance with the course of mythological thought in the red race and be found on natural relation too evident to be misconstrue the rainbow be never see but during a shower and while the sun be shine hence it be always associate with these two meteorological phenomenon i may quote in comparison the rainbow myth of the moxo of south america they hold it to be the wife of arama they god of light and she duty be to pour the refreshing rain on the soil parch by the glaring eye of she mighty spouse hence they look upon she as goddess of water of tree and plant and of fertility in general -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb-

both of woman in childbirth and of the medical art a juno sospita as well as a juno lucina the statement be also significant that the bacab be suppose to be the victim of ah-puchah the despoiler or

as these be no doubt what lead the worthy hernandez to suppose that the maya have trinitarian doctrine when they say that the god of the merchant and planter supply the want of man and furnish the world with desirable thing it be but a slightly figurative way of state a simple truth the four bacab be call by cogolludo the god of the wind each be identify with a particular color and a certain cardinal point the first be that of the south he be call hobnil the belly he color be yellow which as that of the ripe ear be regard as a favorable and promising hue the augury of he year be

out and have now be generally acknowledge to be correct -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be another such cross about eight foot high in a temple on the island of cozumel this be worship as the god of rain or more correctly as the symbol of the four rain god the bacab in period of drought offering be make to it of bird -lrb- symbol of the wind -rrb- and it be sprinkle with water when this have be do add the

that actual phallic worship be not customary in yucatan the bacab and itzamná be closely related to idea of fertility and reproduction indeed but it appear to have be especially as god of the rain the harvest and the food supply generally the spanish writer be eager to discover all the depravity possible in the religion of the native and they certainly would not have miss such a opportunity for they tirade have it exist as it be the reference to it be not many and not clear -lrb- footnote 1 : the feast of the bacab acantun be describe in landa 's work the name he do not explain i take it to

kukulcan this be in no way connect with that of itzamna and be probably later in date and less national in character the first reference to it we also owe to father francisco hernandez whom i have already quote and who report it to bishop las casas in 1545 he word clearly indicate that we have here to do with a myth relate to the formation of the calendar a opinion which can likewise be support from other source the native affirm say las casas that in ancient time there come to that land twenty man the chief of whom be call cocolcan and he they speak of as the god of fever or ague two of the other as god of fishing another two as the god of farm and field another be the thunder god etc they wear flow robe and sandal on they foot they have long beard and they head be bare they order that the people should confess and fast and some of the native fast on friday because on that day the god bacab die and the name of that day in they language be _ himix _ which they especially honor and hold in reverence as the day of the death of bacab -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : las casas _ historia apologetica de las indias occidentales _ cap cxxii -rrb- in the manuscript of hernandez which las casas have before he when he be write he _ apologetical history _ the name of all the twenty be give but unfortunately for antiquarian research the good bishop excuse himself from quote they on account of they barbarous appearance i have little doubt however that have he do so we should find they to be the name of the twenty day of the native calendar month these be the visitor who come one every morning with flow robe full beard and hair and bring with they we good or bad luck -- whatever the day bring forth hernandez make the same mistake as do father francisco de bobadillum when he

to have stand in the same relation in yucatan to the other divinity of the day as do votan in chiapa and quetzalcoatl ce acatl in cholulum he name have usually be suppose to be a compound mean a serpent adorn with feather but there be no word in the maya language to justify such a render there be some variation in its orthography and its original pronunciation may possibly be lose but if we adopt as correct the spelling which i have give above of which however i have some doubt then it mean the god of the mighty speech -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : eligio ancona after give the render

serpent for can be a homonym with these and other meaning and we be without positive proof which be intend to bring kukulcan into closer relation with other american hero-god we must turn to the locality where he be especially worship to the tradition of the ancient and opulent city of chichen itza whose ruin still rank among the most impose on the peninsula the fragment of its chronicle as preserve to we in the book of chilan balam and by bishop landa tell we that its site be first settle by four band who come from the four cardinal point and be rule over by four brother these brother choose no wife but live chastely and rule righteously until at a certain time one die or depart and two begin to act unjustly and be put to death the one remain be kukulcan he appease the strife which he brother ' act have arouse direct the mind of the people to the art of peace and cause to be build various important structure after he have complete he work in chichen itza he found and name the great city of mayapan destine to be the capital of the confederacy of the maya in it be build a temple in he honor and name for he as there be one in chichen itza these be unlike other in yucatan have

themselves with snare and trap at length the time draw near for kukulcan to depart he gather the chief together and expound to they he law from among they he choose as he successor a member of the ancient and wealthy family of the cocom he arrangement complete he be say by some to have journey westward to mexico or to some other spot toward the sun-setting but by the people at large he be confidently believe to have ascend into the heaven and there from he lofty house he be suppose to watch over the interest of he faithful adherent such be the tradition of they mythical hero tell by the itza no wonder that the early missionary many of whom like landa have live in mexico and have become familiar with the story of quetzalcoatl and he alleged departure toward the east identify he with kukulcan and that follow the notion of this assume identity numerous later writer have frame theory to account for the civilization of ancient yucatan through colony of toltec immigrant it can indeed be show beyond doubt that there be various point of contact between the aztec and maya civilization the complex and artificial method of reckoning time be one of these certain architectural device be other a small number of word probably a hundred all tell have be borrow by the one tongue from the other mexican merchant trade with yucatan and band of aztec warrior with they family from tabasco dwelt in mayapan by invitation of its ruler and after its destruction settle in the province of canul on the western coast where they live strictly separate from the maya-speaking population at the time the spaniard conquer the country -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ el libro de chilan balam de chumayel _ ms landa _ relacion _ p 54 -rrb- but all this be very far from show that at any time a race speak the aztec tongue rule the peninsula there be very strong grounds to deny this the tradition which point to a migration from the west or southwest may well have refer to the depopulation of palenque a city which undoubtedly be a product of maya architect the language of yucatan be too absolutely dissimilar from the nahuatl for it ever to have be mould by leader of that race the detail of maya civilization be markedly its own and show a evolution peculiar to the people and they surroundings how far they borrow from the fertile mythology of they nahuatl visitor be not easily answer that the circular temple in mayapan with four door specify by landa as different from any other in yucatan be erect to quetzalcoatl by or because of the aztec colony there may plausibly be suppose when we recall how peculiarly this form be devote to he worship again one of the maya chronicle -- that translate by pio perez and publish by stephen in he _ travel in yucatan _ -- open with a distinct reference to tulum and nonoal name inseparable from the quetzalcoatl myth a statue of a sleep god hold a vase be disinter by dr le plongeon at chichen itza and it be too entirely similar to other find at tlaxcalum and near the city of mexico for we to doubt but that they represent the same divinity and that the god of rain fertility and the harvest -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote

perez in he manuscript dictionary in my possession but be omit in the print copy as lucifer the morning star be identify with quetzalcoatl in mexican mythology and as the word _ cum _ vase aztec _ comitl _ be the same in both tongue there be good ground to suppose that this lord of the vase the prince of devil be the god of fertility common to both cult -rrb- the version of the tradition which make kukulcan arrive from the west and at he disappearance return to the west -- a version quote by landa and which evidently originally refer to the westward course of the sun easily lead to a identification of he with the aztec quetzalcoatl by those acquaint with both myth the probability seem to be that kukulcan be a original maya divinity one of they hero-god whose myth have in it so many similarity to that of quetzalcoatl that the priest of the two nation come to regard the one as the same as the other after the destruction of mayapan about the middle of the fifteenth century when the aztec mercenary be banish to canul and the reign family -lrb- the xiu -rrb- who support they become reduce in power the worship of kukulcan fall to some extent into disfavor of this we be inform by landa in a interesting passage he tell we that many of the native believe that kukulcan after he earthly labor have ascend into heaven and become one of they god previous to the destruction of mayapan temple be build to he and he be worship throughout the land but after that event he be pay such honor only in the province of mani -lrb- govern by the xiu -rrb- nevertheless in gratitude for what all recognize they owe to he the king of the neighboring province send yearly to mani on the occasion of he annual festival which take place on the 16th of the month xul -lrb- November 8th

salt or pepper and drink from bean and gourd seed this last five night and five day and add bishop landa they say and hold it for certain that on the last day of the festival kukulcan himself descend from heaven and personally receive the sacrifice and offering which be make in he honor the celebration itself be call the festival of the founder -lrb- 1 -rrb- with reference i suppose to the alleged founding of the city of mayapan and chichen itza by this hero-god the five day and five sacred banner again bring to mind the close relation of this with the quetzalcoatl symbolism -lrb- footnote 1 :

-rrb- as itzamná have disappear without undergo the pain of death as kukulcan have rise into the heaven and thence return annually though but for a moment on the last day of the festival in he honor so it be devoutly believe by the maya that the time would come when the worship of other god should be do away with and these mighty deity alone demand the adoration of they race none of the american nation seem to have be more given than they to prognostic and prophecy and of none other have we so large a amount of this kind of literature remain some of it have be preserve by the spanish missionary who use it with good effect for they own purpose of proselyting but that it be not manufacture by they for this purpose as some late writer have think be prove by the existence of copy of these prophecy make by native writer themselves at the time of the conquest and at date shortly subsequent these prophecy be as obscure and ambiguous as all successful prophet be accustom to make they prediction but the one point that be clear in they be that they distinctly refer to the arrival of white and bearded stranger from the east who should control the land and alter the prevail religion

such prophecy be i have no doubt the expect return of the hero-god whose myth i have be record both of they represent in they original form the light of day which disappear at nightfall but return at

viracocha as the first cause -- he name illum ticcus -- qquichua prayer -- other name and title of viracocha -- he worship a true monotheism -- the myth of the four brother -- myth of the twin brother viracocha as tunapa he who perfect -- various incident in he life -- relation to manco capac -- he disappear in the west viracocha rise from lake titicaca and journey to the west -- derivation of he

around lake titicaca and south of it the latter in phonetics and in many root-word betray a relationship to the qquichua but a remote one the qquichua be a race of considerable cultivation they have a develop metrical system and be especially fond of the drama several specimen of they poetical and dramatic composition have be preserve and indicate a correct taste although they do not possess a method of write they have various mnemonic aid by which they be enable to recall they verse and they historical tradition in the mythology of the qquichua and apparently also of the aymaras the lead figure be _ viracocha _ he August presence be in one cycle of legend that of infinite creator the primal cause in another he be the beneficent teacher and wise ruler in other word he too like

and life form and existence to all that be therefore it be say a old writer with more than usual insight into man 's moral nature with more than usual charity for a persecute race that when these native worship some swift river or pellucid spring some mountain or grove it be not that they believe that some particular divinity be there or that it be a living thing but because they believe that the great god illum ticcus have create and place it there and impressed upon it some mark of distinction beyond other object of its class that it might thus be designate as a appropriate spot whereat to worship the maker of all thing and this be manifest from the prayer they utter when engage in adoration because they be not address to that mountain or river or cave but to the great illum ticcus viracocha who they believe live in the heaven and yet be invisibly present in that sacred object -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ibid p 140 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ibid p 147 -rrb- in the prayer for the dead illum ticcus be appeal to to protect the body that it should not see corruption nor become lose in the earth and that he should not allow the soul to wander aimlessly in the infinite space but that it should be conduct to some secure haven of contentment where it might receive the sacrifice and offering which loving hand lay upon the tomb -lrb- 1 -rrb- be other god also call upon it be that they might intercede with the supreme divinity in favor of these petition of mortal -lrb- footnote 1 : ibid p 154 -rrb- to he likewise the chief priest at certain time offer a child of six year with a prayer for the prosperity of the inca in such term as these : -- oh lord we offer thee this child in order that thou wilt maintain we in comfort and give we victory in war and keep to we lord the inca he greatness and he state and grant he wisdom that he may govern we righteously -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : herrera _ historia de las indias _ dec v lib iv cap i -rrb- or such a prayer as this be offer up by the assemble multitude : -- oh viracocha ever present viracocha cause of all viracocha the helper the ceaseless worker viracocha who give the beginning viracocha who encourage viracocha the always fortunate viracocha ever near listen to this we prayer send health send prosperity to we thy people -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : christoval de molina _ the fable and rite of the inca _ p 29 molina give the original qquichua the translation of which be obviously incomplete and i have extend it -rrb- thus viracocha be place above and beyond all other god the essential first cause infinite incorporeal invisible above the sun older than the beginning but omnipresent accessible beneficent do this seem too abstract too elevated a notion of god for a race whom we be accustom to deem gross and barbaric i can not help it the testimony of the earliest observer and the living proof of language be too strong to allow of doubt the adjective which be apply to this divinity by the native priest be still on record and that they be not a loan from christian theology be conclusively show by the fact that the very writer who preserve they often do not know they meaning and translate they incorrectly thus even garcilasso de la vega himself of the blood of the inca tell we that neither he nor the native of that day could translate _ ticcus _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- thus also garcium and acosta inform we that viracocha be surname _ usapu _ which they translate admirable -lrb- 2 -rrb- but really it mean he who accomplish all that he undertake he who be successful in all thing molina have preserve the term _ ymamana _ which mean he who control or own all thing -lrb- 3 -rrb- the title _ pachayachachus _ which the spanish writer render creator really mean the teacher of the world that of _ cayllum _ signify the ever-present one _ taripaca _ which have be guess to be the same as _ tarapaca _ a eagle be really a derivative of _ taripanus _ to sit in judgment and be apply to viracocha as the final arbiter of the action and destiny of man another of he frequent appellation for which no explanation have be offer be _ tokay _ or _ tocapo _ properly _ tukupay _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- it mean he who finish who complete and perfect and be antithetical to _ ticcus _ he who begin these two term express the eternity of divinity they convey the same idea of mastery over time and the thing of time as do those word hear by the evangelist in he vision in the isle call patmo i be alpha and omega i be the beginning and the end -lrb- footnote 1 : dan -lrb- lo indio -rrb- otro

1852 -rrb- -rrb- nor must it be suppose that this monotheism be unconscious that it be for example a form of henotheism where the devotion of the adorer fill he soul merely to the forgetfulness of other deity or that it be simply the logical law of unity assert itself as be the case with many of the apparently monotheistic utterance of the greek and roman writer no the evidence be such that we be oblige to acknowledge that the religion of peru be a consciously monotheistic cult every whit as much so as the greek or roman catholic church of christendom those writer who have call the inca religion a sun worship have be lead astray by superficial resemblance one of the best early authority christoval de molina repeat with emphasis the statement they do not recognize the sun as they creator but as create by the creator and this creator be not bear of woman but be unchangeable and eternal -lrb- 1 -rrb- for conclusive testimony on this point however we may turn to a _ informacion _ or inquiry as to the ancient belief institute in 1571 by order of the viceroy don francisco de toledo the oldest indian especially those of noble birth include many descendant of the inca be assemble at different time and in different part of the country and carefully question through the official interpreter as to just what the old religion be the question be not lead one and the reply have great uniformity they all agree that viracocha be worship as creator and as the ever-present active divinity he alone answer prayer and aid in time of need he be the sole efficient god all prayer to the sun or to the deceased inca or to idol be direct to they as intercessor only on this point the statement be most positive -lrb- 2 -rrb- the sun be but one of viracocha 's creation not itself the creator -lrb- footnote 1 : christoval de molina _ the fable and rite of the inca _ pp 8 17 eng tran -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ello solo viracocha tenian por hacedor de todas las cosas y que el solo lo podium

verdadera _ information de las idolatras de los incas é indios _ in the _ coleccion de documentos ineditos del archivo de indias _ vol xxi p 198 other witness say : lo dicho ingas y sus antepasados tenian por criador al solo viracocha y que solo lo podium socorrer id p 184 adoraban á viracocha por hacedor de toda las cosas como á el sol y a hachaccuna lo adoraban porque lo tenia por hijo de viracocha y por cosa muy allegada suya p 133 -rrb- it be singular that historian have continue to repeat that the qquichua adore the sun as they principal divinity in the face of such evidence to the contrary if this inquiry and its important statement have not be accessible to they at any rate they could readily have learn the same lesson from the well known history of father joseph de acosta that author say and repeat with great positiveness that the sun be in peru a secondary divinity and that the supreme deity the creator and ruler of the world be viracocha -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : sientan y confiessan un supremo señor y hazedor de todo al qual los del piru llamavan viracocha \* \* despue del viracocha o supremo dio fui y es en los infieles el que mas comunmente veneran y adoran el sol acosta _ de la historia moral de las indias _ lib v cap iii iv -lrb- barcelona 1591 -rrb- -rrb- another misapprehension be that these native worship directly they ancestor thus mr markham write : the inca worship they ancestor the _ pacarina _ or forefather of the _ ayllu _ or lineage be idolize as the soul or essence of he descendant -lrb- 1 -rrb- but in the _ inquiry _ above quote it be explain that the belief in fact be that the soul of the inca go at death to the presence of the deity viracocha and its emblem the actual body carefully preserve be pay divine honor in order that the soul might intercede with viracocha for the fulfillment of the prayer -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : clement r markham _ journal of the royal geographical society _ 1871 p 291 _ pacarina _ be the present participle of _ pacarinus _ to dawn to begin to be bear -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ informacion _ etc p 209 -rrb- we be compel therefore by the best evidence now attainable to adopt the conclusion that the inca religion in its purity deserve the name of monotheism the statement of the native and the term of they religious language unite in confirm this opinion it be not right to depreciate the force of these fact simply because we have make up we mind that a people in the intellectual stage of the peruvian could not have mount to such a pure air of religion a prejudgment of this kind be unworthy of a scientific mind the evidence be complete that the term i have quote do belong to the religious language of ancient peru they express the conception of divinity which the thinker of that people have form and whether it be think to be in keep or not with the rest of they development it be we bounden duty to accept it and explain it as best we can other instance might be quote from the religious history of the old world where a nation 's insight into the attribute of deity be singularly in advance of they general state of cultivation the best thinker of the semitic race for example from mose to spinoza have be in this respect far ahead of they often more generally enlighten aryan contemporary the more interesting in view of this lofty ideal of divinity they have attain become the peruvian myth of the incarnation of viracocha he life and doings as a man among man these myth present themselves in different but to the reader who have accompany I thus far now familiar form once more we meet the story of the four brother the first of man they appear on the earth after it have be rescue from the primeval water and the face of the land be divide between they manco capac take the north collum the south pinahua the west and the east the region whence come the sun and the light be give to tokay or tocapa to viracocha under he name of the finisher he who complete and perfect -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : garcilasso de la vega _ comentarios reales _ lib i cap xviii -rrb- the outline of this legend be identical with another where viracocha appear under the name of ayar cachus this be in its broad outline the most general myth that which have be hand down by the most numerous authority and which they tell we be take directly from the ancient song of the indian as repeat by those who could recall the day of the inca huascar and atahualpa -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : parece por lo cantares de los indios \* \* \* afirmaron los orejones que quedaron de los tiempos de guascar i de atahualpa \* \* \* cuentan lo indios del cuzco mas viejos etc repeat the historian herrera _ historia de las indias occidental _ dec v lib iii cap vii viii -rrb- it run in this wise : in the beginning of thing there appear on the earth four brother whose name be of the oldest ayar cachus which mean he who give be or who cause -lrb- 1 -rrb- of the youngest ayar manco and of the other ayar aucca -lrb- the enemy -rrb- and ayar uchu they father be the sun and the place of they birth or rather of they appearance on earth be paccari-tampu which mean _ the house of the morning _ or the _ mansion of the dawn _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- in after day a certain cave near cuzco be so call and point out as the scene of this momentous event

powerful and proud and determine to rule the whole earth and for this purpose divide it into four part the north the south the east and the west hence they be call by the people _ tahuantin suyu kapac _ lord of all four quarter of the earth -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ tahuantin _ all four from _ tahua _ four _ suyu _ division section _ kapac _ king -rrb- the most powerful of these be ayar cachus he possess a sling of gold and in it a stone with which he could demolish lofty mountain and hurl aloft to the cloud themselves he gather together the native of the country at pacarus tampu and accumulate at the house of the dawn a great treasure of yellow gold like the glittering hoard which we read of in the lay of the nibelung the treasure bring with it the destruction of its owner for he brother envious of the wondrous pile persuade ayar cachus to enter the cave where he keep he hoard in order to bring out a certain vase and also to pray to they father the sun to aid they to rule they domain as soon as he have enter they stop the mouth of the cave with huge stone and thus rid of he they set about collect the people and make a settlement at a certain place call _ tampu quiru _ -lrb- the tooth of the house -rrb- but they do not know the magical power of they brother while they be busy with they plan what be they dismay to see ayar cachus free from the cave and with great wing of brilliantly color feather hover like a bird in the air over they head they expect swift retribution for they intended fratricide but instead of this they hear reassure word from he lip have no fear he say i leave you in order that the great empire of the inca might be know to man leave therefore this settlement of tampu quiru and descend into the valley of cuzco where you shall find a famous city and in it build a sumptuous temple to the sun as for I i shall remain in the form in which you see I and shall dwell in the mountain peak guanacaure ready to help you and on that mountain you must build I a altar and make to I sacrifice and the sign that you shall wear whereby you shall be fear and respect of you subject be that you shall have you ear pierce as be mine say which he show they he ear pierce and carry large round plate of gold they promise he obedience in all thing and forthwith build a altar on the mountain guanacaure which ever after be esteem a most holy place here again ayar cachus appear to they and bestow on ayar manco the scarlet fillet which become the perpetual insignia of the reign inca the remain brother be turn into stone and manco assume the title of _ kapac _ king and the metaphorical surname of _ pirhua _ the granary or treasure house found the city of cuzco marry he four sister and become the first of the dynasty of the inca he live to a great age and during the whole of he life never omit to pay divine honor to he brother and especially to ayar cachus in another myth of the incarnation the infinite creator ticcus viracocha duplicate himself in the twin incarnation of _ ymamana viracocha _ and _ tocapu viracocha _ name which we have already see mean he who have all thing and he who perfect all thing the legend be that these brother start in the distant east and journey toward the west the one go by way of the mountain the other by the path of the lowland and each on he journey like itzamna in yucatecan story give name to the place he pass and also to all tree and herb of the field and to all fruit and teach the people which be good for food which of virtue as medicine and which be poisonous and to be shun thus they journey westward impart knowledge and do good work until they reach the western ocean the great pacific whose wave seem to stretch westward into infinity there have accomplish all they have to do in this world they ascend into heaven once more to form part of the infinite be for the venerable authority whom i be follow be careful to add most explicitly that these indian believe for a certainty that neither the creator nor he son be bear of woman but that they all be unchangeable and eternal -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : christoval de molina _ fable and rite of the inca _ p 6 -rrb- still more human do viracocha become in the myth where he appear under the surname _ tunapa _ and _ taripaca _ the latter i have already explain to mean he who judge and the former be a synonym of tocapu as it be from the verb _ ttaniy _ or _ ttaninus _ and mean he who finish complete or perfect although like several other of he name the significance of this one have up to the present remain unexplained and lose the myth have be preserve to we by a native indian writer joan de santa cruz pachacutus who write it out somewhere about the year 1600 -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ relacion de antiguedade deste

in civilization but so far as i have be able to study the mythology of the aymara which be but very superficially on account of the lack of source it do not seem to be entitle to this credit -rrb- he tell we that at a very remote period shortly after the country of peru have be populate there come from lake titicaca to the tribe a elderly man with flow beard and abundant white hair support himself on a staff and dress in wide-spreading robe he go among the people call they he son and daughter relieve they infirmity and teach they the precept of wisdom often however he meet the fate of so many other wise teacher and be reject and scornfully entreat by those whom he be strive to instruct swift retribution sometimes fall upon such stiff-necked listener thus he once enter the town of yamquesupa the principal place in the province of the south and begin teach the inhabitant but they heed he not and seize he and with insult and blow drive he from the town so that he have to sleep in the open field thereupon he curse they town and straightway it sink into the earth with all its inhabitant and the depression be fill with water and all be drown to this day it be know as the lake of yamquesupa and all the people about there well know that what be now a sheet of water be once the site of a flourishing city at another time he visit tiahuanaco where may yet be see the colossal ruin of some ancient city and massive figure in stone of man and woman in he time this be a populous mart its people rich and proud give to revelry to drunkenness and dance little they care for the word of the preacher and they treat he with disdain then he turn upon they he anger and in a instant the dancer be change into stone just as they stand and there they remain to this day as any one can see perpetual warning not to scorn the word of the wise on another occasion he be seize by the people who dwell by the great lake of carapaco and tie hand and foot with stout cord it be they intention to put he to a cruel death the next day but very early in the morning just at the time of the dawn a beautiful youth enter and say fear not i have come to call you in the name of the lady who be await you that you may go with she to the place of joy with that he touch the fetter on tunapa 's limb and the rope snap asunder and they go forth untouched by the guard who stand around they descend to the lake shore and just as the dawn appear tunapa spread he mantle on the wave and he and he companion step upon it as upon a raft be waft rapidly away into the ray of the morning light the cautious pachacutus do not let we into the secret of this mysterious assignation either because he do not know or because he would not disclose the mystery of he ancestral faith but i be not so discreet and i vehemently suspect that the lady who be await the virtuous tunapa be chasca the dawn maiden she of the beautiful hair which distil the dew and that the place of joy whither she invite he be the mansion of the sky into which daily the light-god at the hour of the morning twilight be usher by the chaste maiden aurora as the anger of tunapa be dreadful so he favor be more than regal at the close of a day he once reach the town of the chief apotampo otherwise pacari tampu which mean the house or lodgings of the dawn where the festivity of a wedding be in progress the guest intent upon the pleasure of the hour listen with small patience to the word of the old man but the chief himself hear they with profound attention and delight therefore as tunapa be leave he present to the chief as a reward for he hospitality and respect the staff which have assist he feeble limb in many a journey it be of no great seemliness but upon it be inscribe character of magic power and the chief wisely cherish it among he treasure it be well he do for on the day of the birth of he next child the staff turn into fine gold and that child be none other than the far-famed manco capac destine to become the ancestor of the illustrious line of the inca son of the sun and famous in all country that it shine upon and as for the golden staff it become through all after time until the spanish conquest the sceptre of the inca and the sign of they sovereignty the famous and sacred _ tupa yaurus _ the royal wand -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ tupa yaurus _ el cetro real vara insignia real

seven brother and seven sister of they to seek new land take this staff in he hand like the seven brother who in mexican legend leave aztlan the white land to find nation and city so the brother of manco capac leave pacarus tampu the lodgings of the dawn become the _ sinchus _ or head of various noble house and chief of tribe in the empire of the inca as for manco it be well know that with he golden wand he journey on overcome demon and destroy he enemy until he reach the mountain over against the spot where the city of cuzco now stand here the sacred wand sink of its own motion into the earth and manco capac recognize the divine monition name the mountain _ huanacaurus _ the place of repose in the valley at the base he found the great city which he call _ cuzco _ the navel its inhabitant ever afterwards class huanacaurus as one of they principal deity -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : don gavino pacheco zegarra derive huanacaurus from _ huanaya _ to rest oneself and _ cayrus

and become the planet jupiter under the name _ pirua _ from this accord to some writer the country of peru derive its name -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the identification of manco capac with the planet jupiter be mention in the _ relacion anonima _ on the authority of melchior hernandez -rrb- it may fairly be suppose that this founder of the inca dynasty be a actual historical personage but it be evident that much that be tell about he be imagery draw from the legend of the light-god and what become of tunapa we leave he sailing on he outspread mantle into the light of the morning over lake carapace but the legend do not stop there whereever he go that day he return to he toil and pursue he way down the river chacamarca till he reach the sea there he fate become obscure but add pachacutus i understand that he pass by the strait -lrb- of panama -rrb- into the other sea -lrb- back toward the east -rrb- this be what be aver by the most ancient sage of the inca line -lrb- _ por aquello ingas antiquissimo _ -rrb- we may well believe he do for the light of day which be quench in the western ocean pass back again by the strait or in some other way and appear again the next morning not in the west where we watch its die ray but in the east where again it be bear to pursue its daily and ever recur journey accord to another and also very early account viracocha be precede by a host of attendant who be he messenger and soldier when he reach the sea he and these he follower march out upon the wave as if it have be dry land and disappear in the west -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : garcium _ origen de los indios _ lib v cap vii -rrb- these follower be like himself white and bearded just as in mexico the native attribute the erection of building the history of which have be lose to the white toltec the subject of quetzalcoatl -lrb- see above chapter iii § 2 -rrb- so in peru various ancient ruin whose builder have be lose to memory be point out to the spaniard as the work of a white and bearded race who hold the country in possession long before the inca have found they dynasty -lrb- 1 -rrb- the explanation in both case be the same in both the early work of art of unknown origin be suppose to be the production of the personify light ray which be the source of skill because they supply the means indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge -lrb- footnote

which have be preserve to we by juan de betanzo and the document on which the historian herrera found he narrative be in the main identical with that which i have quote from the narrative of pachacutus i shall however give that of herrera as it have some interesting feature he tell we that the tradition and song which the indian have receive from they remote ancestor relate that in very early time there be a period when there be no sun and man live in darkness at length in answer to they urgent prayer the sun emerge from lake titicaca and soon afterwards there come a man from the south of fair complexion large in stature and of venerable presence whose power be boundless he remove mountain fill up valley cause fountain to burst from the solid rock and give life to man and animal hence the people call he the beginning of all create thing and father of the sun many good work he perform bring order among the people give they wise counsel work miracle and teaching he go on he journey toward the north but until the latest time they bear he deed and person in memory under the name of ticus viracocha and tuapaca and elsewhere as arnava they erect many temple to he in which they place he figure and image as describe they also say that after a certain length of time there re-appear another like this first one or else he be the same who also give wise counsel and cure the sick he meet disfavor and at one spot the people set about to slay he but he call down upon they fire from heaven which burn they village and scorch the mountain into cinder then they throw away they weapon and beg of he to deliver they from the danger which he do -lrb- 1 -rrb- he pass on toward the west until he reach the shore of the sea there he spread out he mantle and seat himself upon it sail away and be never see again for this reason add the chronicler the name be give to he _ viracocha _ which mean foam of the sea though afterwards it change in signification -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : this incident be also relate by pachacutus and betanzo all three locate the scene of the event at carcha eighteen league from cuzco where the cana tribe live at the conquest pachacutus state that the cause of the anger of viracocha be that upon the sierra there be the statue of a woman to whom human victim be sacrifice if this be the tradition it would offer another point of identity with that of quetzalcoatl who be also say to have forbid human sacrifice -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : herrera _ historia de las indias occidentales _ dec v lib iii cap vi -rrb- this lead I to the etymology of the name it be confessedly obscure the translation which herrera give be that generally offer by the spanish writer but it be not literal the word _ uira _ mean fat and _ cocha _ lake sea or other large body of water therefore as the genitive must be prefix in the qquichua tongue the translation must be lake or sea of fat this be show by garcilasso de la vega in he _ royal commentary _ and as he could see no sense or propriety in apply such a term as lake of grease to the supreme divinity he reject this derivation and contented himself by say that the meaning of the name be totally unknown -lrb- 1 -rrb- in this mr clement r markham who be a authority on peruvian matter coincide though acknowledge that no other meaning suggest itself -lrb- 2 -rrb- i shall not say anything about the derivation of this name from the sanskrit -lrb- 3 -rrb- or the ancient egyptian -lrb- 4 -rrb- these be etymological amusement with which serious study have nothing to do -lrb- footnote 1 : donde

gavino pacheco zegarra who in the introduction to he most excellent edition of the drama of _ ollantaï _ maintain that viracocha literally lake of fat be a simile apply to the frothing foam sea and add that as a personal name in this signification it be in entire conformity with the genius of the qquichua tongue -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ollantaus drame en ver quechua _ introd p xxxvi -lrb- pari 1878 -rrb- there be a class of diviner in peru who foretell the future by inspect the fat of animal they be call vira-piricuc molina _ fable and rite _ p 13 -rrb- to quote he word : -- the tradition be that viracocha 's face be extremely white and beard from this he name be derive which mean take literally ` lake of fat ' by extension however the word mean ` sea-foam ' as in the qquichua language the foam be call _ fat _ no doubt on account of its whiteness it have a double appropriateness in its application to the hero-god not only be he suppose in the one myth to have rise from the wave of lake titicaca and in another to have appear when the primeval ocean leave the land dry but he be universally describe as of fair complexion _ a white man _ strange indeed it be that these people who have never see a member of the white race should so persistently have represent they highest god as of this hue and what be more with the flow beard and abundant light hair which be they characteristic there be no deny however that such be the fact do it depend on legend alone we might however strong the consensus of testimony harbor some doubt about it but it do not the monument themselves attest it there be indeed a singular uniformity of statement in the myth viracocha under any and all he surname be always describe as white and bearded dress in flow robe and of impose mien he robe be also white and thus he be figure at the entrance of one of he most celebrated temple that of urco he image at that place be of a man with a white robe fall to he waist and thence to he foot by he cut in stone be he bird the eagle and the falcon -lrb- 1 -rrb- so also on a certain occasion when he be say to have appear in a dream to one of the inca who afterwards adopt he name he be say to have come with beard more than a span in length and clothe in a large and loose mantle which fall to he foot while with he hand he hold by a cord to its neck some unknown animal and thus in after time he be represent in painting and statue by order of that inca -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : christoval de molina _ ubi supra _ p 29 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : garcilasso de la vega _ comentarios

footnote 1 : _ relacion anonima _ p 148 -rrb- mislead by the statement of the historian garcilasso de la vega some later writer among whom i may note the eminent german traveler von tschudus have suppose that viracocha belong to the historical deity of peru and that he worship be of comparatively recent origin -lrb- 1 -rrb- la vega who could not understand the name of the divinity and moreover either know little about the ancient religion or else conceal he knowledge -lrb- as be show by he reiterate statement that human sacrifice be unknown -rrb- pretend that viracocha first come to be honor through a dream of the inca who assume he name but the narrative of the occurrence that he himself give show that even at that time the myth be well know and of great antiquity -lrb- 2 -rrb-

much alike that they be probably repetition of teaching familiar to the noble and higher priest both inca maintain that the sun could not be the chief god because he run daily he accustomed course like a slave or a animal that be lead he must therefore be the subject of a mightier power than himself -lrb- footnote 3 : _ comentario reale _ pt i lib viii cap viii -rrb- we may reasonably suppose that these expression be proof of a grow sense of the attribute of divinity they be indication of the evolution of religious thought and go to show that the monotheistic idea which i have point out in the title and name of the highest god be clearly recognize and publicly announce viracocha be also worship under the title _ con-ticci-viracocha _ various explanation of the name _ con _ have be offer it be not positively certain that it belong to the qquichua tongue a myth preserve by gomara treat con as a distinct deity he be say to have come from the north to have be without bone muscle or member to have the power of run with infinite swiftness and to have level mountain fill up valley and deprive the coast plain of rain at the same time he be call a son of the sun and the moon and it be owe to he good will and creative power that man and woman be form and maize and fruit give they upon which to subsist another more powerful god however by name pachacamac also a son of the sun and moon and hence brother to con rise up against he and drive he from the land the man and woman whom con have form be change by pachacamac into brute and other create who be the ancestor of the present race these he supply with what be necessary for they support and teach they the art of war and peace for these reason they venerate he as a god and construct for he worship a sumptuous temple a league and a half from the present city of lima -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : francisco lopez de gomara _ historia de las indias _ p 233 -lrb- ed paris 1852 -rrb- -rrb- this myth of the conflict of the two brother be too similar to other i have quote for its significance to be mistaken unfortunately it have be hand down in so fragmentary a condition that it do not seem possible to assign it its proper relation to the cycle of viracocha legend as i have hint we be not sure of the meaning of the name con nor whether it be of qquichua origin if it be as be indeed likely then we may suppose that it be a transcription of the word _ ccun _ which in qquichua be the third person singular present indicative of _ ccunus _ i give he give the giver would seem a appropriate name for the first creator of thing but the myth itself and the description of the deity incorporeal and swift bringer at one time of the fertilize rain at another of the drought seem to point unmistakably to a god of the wind linguistic analogy bear this out for the name give to a whirlwind or violent wind storm be _ conchuy _ with a additional word to signify whether it be one of rain or merely a dust storm -lrb- 1 -rrb- for this reason i think m wiener 's attempt to make of con -lrb- or _ qquonn _ as he prefer to spell it -rrb- merely a deity of the rain be too narrow -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : a whirlwind with

indicate that this be not the case one of the most remarkable antiquity in peru be at a place call _ concacha _ three league south of abancay on the road from cuzco to lima m leonce angrand have observe that this be evidently one of the great religious centre of the primitive people of peru here be find a enormous block of granite very curiously carve to facilitate the dispersion of a liquid pour on its summit into varied stream and to quaint receptacle whether the liquid be the blood of victim the intoxicating beverage of the country or pure water all of which have be suggest we do not positively know but i be incline to believe with m wiener that it be the last mention and that it be as the beneficent deity of the rain that con be worship at this sacred spot its name _ con cacha _ the messenger of con point to this -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : these remains be carefully describe by charle wiener _ perou et bolivie _ p 282 seq from the note of m angrand by desjardin _ le perou avant la conquête espagnole _ p 132 and in a superficial manner by squier _ peru _ p 555 -rrb- the word _ pacha camac _ mean animating or give life to the world it be say by father acosta to have be one of the name of viracocha -lrb- 1 -rrb- and in a sacred song preserve by garcilasso de la vega he be appeal to by this title -lrb- 2 -rrb- the identity of these two divinity seem therefore sufficiently establish -lrb- footnote 1 : _ historium natural y moral de las indias _ lib v cap iii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ comentario reale _ lib ii cap xxviii -rrb- the worship of pachacamac be assert by competent antiquarian student to have be more extended in ancient peru than the older historian suppose this be indicate by the many remains of temple which local tradition attribute to he worship and by the custom of the native -lrb- 1 -rrb- for instance at the birth of a child it be formally offer to he and he protection solicit on reach some arduous height the toiling indian would address a few word of thanks to pachacamac and the pile of stone which be the simple sign of they gratitude be still visible in all part of the country -lrb- footnote 1 : von tschudi who in one part of he work maintain that sun-worship be the prevalent religion of peru modify the assertion considerably in the following passage : el culto de pachacamac se hallaba mucho mas extendido de lo que suponen lo historiadore y se puede sin error aventurar la opinion de que era la deidad popular y acatada por las masas peruanas mientras que la religion del sol era la de la corte culto que por mas adoptado que fuese entre los indios nunca llegó á desarraigar la fe y la devocion al numen primitivo en effecto en todas las relaciones de la vida de los indios resalta la profunda veneracion que tributavan á pachacamac _ antiguedade peruana _ p 149 inasmuch as elsewhere this author take pain to show that the inca discard the worship of the sun and institute in place of it that of viracocha the above would seem to diminish the sphere of sun-worship very much -rrb- this variation of the story of viracocha aid to a understanding of he mythical purport the oft-recurring epithet contice viracocha show a close relationship between he character and that of the divinity con in fact a identity which deserve close attention it be explain i believe by the supposition that viracocha be the lord of the wind as well as of the light like all the other light god and deity of the cardinal point he be at the same time the wind from they what have be save from the ancient mythology be enough to show this but not enough to allow we to reconcile the seeming contradiction which it suggest moreover it must be ever remember that all religion repose on contradiction contradiction of fact of logic and of statement so that we must not seek to force any one of they into consistent unity of form even with itself i have yet to add another point of similarity between the myth of viracocha and those of quetzalcoatl itzamna and the other which i have already narrate as in mexico yucatan and elsewhere so in the realm of the inca the spaniard find themselves not unexpected guest here too text of ancient prophecy be call to mind word of warn from solemn and antique song foretell that other viracocha man of fair complexion and flow beard would some day come from the sun the father of existent nature and subject the empire to they rule when the great inca huayna capac be on he death-bed he recall these prophecy and impress they upon the mind of he successor so that when de soto the lieutenant of pizarro have he first interview with the envoy of atahuallpa the latter humbly address he as viracocha the great god son of the sun and tell he that it be huayna capac 's last command to pay homage to the white man when they should arrive -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : garcilasso de la vega _ comentarios reales _ lib ix cap xiv xv cieza de leon _ relacion _ ms in prescott _ conquest

necessary to indulge in they be too generally parallel in other american hero-myth to leave the slightest doubt as to they reality or as to they significance they be again the expression of the expect return of the light-god after he departure and disappearance in the western horizon modification of what be originally a statement of a simple occurrence of daily routine they become transmit in the limbeck of mythology to the story of the beneficent god of the past and the promise of golden day when again he should return to the people whom erstwhile he rule and teach the qquichua expect the return of viracocha not merely as a earthly ruler to govern they nation but as a god who by he divine power would call the dead to life precisely as in ancient egypt the literal belief in the resurrection of the body lead to the custom of preserve the corpse with the most sedulous care so in peru the cadaver be mummied and deposit in the most secret and inaccessible spot so that it should remain undisturbed to the great day of resurrection and when be that to be we be not leave in doubt on this point it be to be when viracocha should return to earth in he bodily form then he would restore the dead to life and they should enjoy the good thing of a land far more glorious than this work-a-day world of ours -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : dijeron quello oyeron decir a sus padres y

the foregoing chapter i have pass in review the hero-myth of five nation widely asunder in location in culture and in language i have show the strange similarity in they account of they mysterious early benefactor and teacher and they still more strange because true presentiment of the arrival of pale-faced conqueror from the east i have select these nation because they myth have be most fully record not that they alone possess this striking legend it be i repeat the fundamental myth in the religious lore of american nation not indeed that it can be discover in all tribe especially in the amplitude of incident which it possess among some but there be comparatively few of the native mythology that do not betray some of its element some fragment of it and often enough to justify we in the supposition that have we the complete body of they sacred story we should find this one in quite as define a form as i have give it the student of american mythology unfortunately labor under peculiar disadvantage when he seek for he material he find a extraordinary dearth of it the missionary usually refuse to preserve the native myth because they believe they harmful or at least foolish while man of science who have have such opportunity reject all those that seem the least like a biblical story as they suspect they to be modern and valueless composition and thus lose the very life of the genuine ancient faith a further disadvantage be the slight attention which have be pay to the aboriginal american tongue and the sad deficiency of material for they study it be now recognize on all hand that the key of a mythology be to be find in the language of its believer as a german writer remark the formation of the language and the evolution of the myth go hand in hand -lrb- 1 -rrb- we must know the language of a tribe at least we must understand the grammatical construction and have facility to trace out the meaning and derivation of name before we can obtain any accurate notion of the foundation in nature of its religious belief no convenient generality will help we -lrb- footnote 1 : in der sprache herrscht immer und erneut sich stet die sinnliche anschauung die vor

einst hand in hand gegangen dr flw schwartz _ der ursprung der mythologie dargelegt a griechischer und deutscher sage _ p 23 -lrb- berlin 1860 -rrb- -rrb- i make these remark as a sort of apology for the shortcoming of the present study and especially for the imperfection of the fragment i have still to present they be however sufficiently define to make it certain that they belong to cycle of myth closely akin to those already give they will serve to support my thesis that the seemingly confused and puerile fable of the native american be fully as worthy the attention of the student of human nature as the more poetic narrative of the veda or the edda the red man feel out after god with like childish groping as he white brother in central asia when he course be interrupted he be pursue the same path toward the discovery of truth in the word of a thoughtful writer : in a world wholly separate from that which it be customary to call the old world the religious evolution of man take place precisely in the same manner as in those surroundings which produce the civilization of western europe -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : girard de rialle _ la mythologie comparée _ vol i p 363 -lrb- pari 1878 -rrb- -rrb- but this religious development of the red man be violently break by the forcible imposition of a creed which he could not understand and which be not suit to he want and by the heavy yoke of a priesthood totally out of sympathy with he line of progress what have be the result have christianity ask the writer i have just quote exert a progressive action on these people have it bring they forward have it aid they natural evolution we be oblige to answer no -lrb- 1 -rrb- this sad reply be repeat by careful observer who have study dispassionately the native in they home -lrb- 2 -rrb- the only difference in the result of the two great division of the christian world seem to be that on catholic mission have follow the debasement on protestant mission the destruction of the race -lrb- footnote 1 : girard de rialle _ ibid _ p 862 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : those who would convince themselves of this may read the work of don francisco pimentel _ memoria

de yucatan _ prologo -lrb- mérida 1865 -rrb- that the indian of the united state have directly and positively degenerate in moral sense as a race since the introduction of christianity be also very decidedly the opinion of the late prof theodor waitz a most competent ethnologist see _ die indianer nordamerica 's eine studie _ von theodor waitz p 39 etc -lrb- leipzig 1865 -rrb- this opinion be also that of the visit committee of the society of friend who report on the indian tribe in 1842 see the _ report of a visit to some of the tribe of indian west of the mississippus river _ by john d lang and samuel taylor jr -lrb- new york 1843 -rrb- the language of this report be calm but positive as to the increase moral degradation of the tribe as the direct result of contact with the whites -rrb- it may be object to this that it be not christianity but its accompaniment the greedy horde of adventurer the profligate trader the selfish priest and the unscrupulous official that work the degradation of the native race be it so then i merely modify my assertion by say that christianity have show itself incapable of control its inevitable adjunct and that it would have be better morally and socially for the american race never to have know christianity at all than to have receive it on the only term on which it have be possible to offer it with the more earnestness therefore in view of this acknowledged failure of christian effort do i turn to the native belief and desire to vindicate for they a dignified position among the faith which have help to raise man above the level of the brute and inspire he with hope and ambition for betterment for this purpose i shall offer some additional evidence of the extension of the myth i have set forth and then proceed to discuss its influence on the mind of its believer the tarasco be a interesting nation who live in the province of michoacan due west of the valley of mexico they be a polished race speak a sonorous vocalic language so bold in war that they boast be that they have never be defeat and yet they religious rite be almost bloodless and they preference be for peace the hardy aztec have be drive back at every attempt they make to conquer michoacan but its ruler submit himself without a murmur to corte recognize in he a opponent of the common enemy and a warrior of more than human power among these tarasco we find the same legend of a hero-god who bring they out of barbarism give they law arrange they calendar which in principle be the same as that of the aztec and maya and decide on the form of they government he name be _ surite _ or _ curicaberi _ word which from my limited resource in that tongue i be not able to analyze he dwell in the town cromuscuaro which name mean the watch-tower or look-out and the hour in which he give he instruction be always at sunrise just as the orb of light appear on the eastern horizon one of the feast which he appoint to be celebrate in he honor be call _ zitacuarencuaro _ which melodious word be say by the spanish missionary to mean the resurrection from death when to this it be add that he distinctly predict that a white race of man should arrive in the country and that he himself should return -lrb- 1 -rrb- he identity with the light-god of similar american myth be too manifest to require argument -lrb- footnote 1 : p francisco xavier alegre _ historia de la compañia de jesus en la nueva españa _ tomo i pp 91 92 -lrb- mexico 1841 -rrb- the authority whom alegre quote be pp alonso de la rea _ cronica de mechoacan _ -lrb- mexico 1648 -rrb- and d basalenque _ cronica de san augustin de mechoacan _ -lrb- mexico 1673 -rrb- i regret that i have be unable to find either of these book in any library in the united state it be a great pity that the student of american history be so often limit in he investigation in this country by the lack of material it be sad to think that such a opulent and intelligent land do not possess a single complete library of its own history -rrb- the king of the tarasco be consider merely the vicegerent of the absent hero-god and ready to lay down the sceptre when curicaberi should return to earth we do not know whether the myth of the four brother prevail among the tarasco but there be hardly a nation on the continent among whom the number four be more distinctly sacred the kingdom be divide into four part -lrb- as also among the itza qquichua and numerous other tribe -rrb- the four ruler of which constitute with the king the sacred council of five in imitation i can hardly doubt of the hero-god and the four deity of the wind the goddess of water and the rain the female counterpart of curicaberi be the goddess _ cueravaperus _ she be name say the authority i quote in all they fable and speech they say that she be the mother of all the god of the earth and that it be she who bestow the harvest and the germination of seed with she ever go four attendant goddess the personification of the rain from the four cardinal point at the sacred dance which be also dramatization of she suppose action these attendant be represent by four priest clad respectively in white yellow red and black to represent the four color of the cloud -lrb- 1 -rrb- in other word she doubtless bear the same relation to curicaberi that ixchel do to itzamna in the mythology of the maya or the rainbow goddess to arama in the religious legend of the moxo -lrb- 2 -rrb- she be the divinity that preside over the rain and hence over fertility and the harvest stand in intimate relation to the god of the sun 's ray and the four wind -lrb- footnote 1 : _ relacion de las ceremonias y ritos etc de mechoacan _ in the _ coleccion de documento para la historia de españa _ vol liii pp 13 19 20 this account

mythology have be preserve to we in a rescript of they national book the _ popol vuh _ evidently they have borrow something from aztec source and a flavor of christian teaching be occasionally noticeable in this record but for all that it be one of the most valuable we possess on the subject it begin by connect the creation of man and thing with the appearance of light in other word as in so many mythology the history of the world be that of the day each begin with a dawn thus the _ popol vuh _ read : -- this be how the heaven exist how the heart of heaven exist he the god whose name be qabauil he word come in the darkness to the lord to gucumatz and it speak with the lord with gucumatz they speak together they consult and plan they understand they unite in word and plan as they consult the day appear the white light come forth mankind be produce while thus they hold counsel about the growth of tree and vine about life and mankind in the darkness in the night -lrb- the creation be bring about -rrb- by the heart of heaven whose name be hurakan -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ popol vuh le livre sacré des quichés _ p 9 -lrb- pari 1861 -rrb- -rrb- but the national culture-hero of the kich seem to have be _ xbalanque _ a name which have the literal meaning little tiger deer and be a symbolical appellation refer to day in they calendar although many of he deed be recount in the _ popol vuh _ that work do not furnish we he complete mythical history from it and other source we learn that he be one of the twin suppose to have be bear of a virgin mother in utatlan the central province of the kich to have be the guide and protector of they nation and in its interest to have make a journey to the underworld in order to revenge himself on he powerful enemy its ruler he be successful and have overcome they he set free the sun which they have seize and restore to life four hundred youth whom they have slay and who in fact be the star of heaven on he return he emerge from the bowels of the earth and the place of darkness at a point far to the east of utatlan at some place locate by the kich near coban in vera paz and come again to he people look to be receive with fitting honor but like viracocha quetzalcoatl and other of these worthy the story go that they treat he with scant courtesy and in anger at they ingratitude he leave they forever in order to seek a nobler people i need not enter into a detailed discussion of this myth many point in which be obscure the less so as i have treat they at length in a monograph readily accessible to the reader who would push he inquiry further enough if i quote the conclusion to which i there arrive it be as follow : -- suffice it to say that the hero-god whose name be thus compound of two sign in the calendar who be one of twin bear of a virgin who perform many surprising feat of prowess on the earth who descend into the world of darkness and set free the sun moon and star to perform they daily and nightly journey through the heaven present in these and other trait such numerous resemblance to the divinity of light the day-maker of the northern hunting tribe reappear in so many american legend that i do not hesitate to identify the narrative of xbalanque and he deed as but another version of this wide-spread this well-nigh universal myth -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the name of the god in the kiche myth central america _ by daniel g brinton md in the _ proceedings of the american philosophical society _ for 1881 -rrb- few of we hero-myth have give occasion for wilder speculation than that of votan he be the culture hero of the tzendal a branch of the maya race whose home be in chiapa and tabasco even the usually cautious humboldt suggest that he name might be a form of odin or buddha as for more imaginative writer they have make not the least difficulty in discover that it be identical with the odon of the tarasco the oton of the othomi the poudan of the east indian tamul the vaudoux of the louisiana negro etc all this have be do without any attempt have be make to ascertain the precise meaning and derivation of the name votan superficial phonetic similarity have be the only guide we be not well acquaint with the votan myth it appear to have be write down some time in the seventeenth century by a christianize native he manuscript of five or six folio in the tzendal tongue come into the possession of nuñez de la vega bishop of chiapa about 1690 and later into the hand of don ramon ondonez y aguiar where it be see by dr paul felix cabrera about 1790 what have become of it be not know no complete translation of it be make and the extract or abstract give by the author just name be most unsatisfactory and disfigured by ignorance and prejudice none of they probably be familiar with the tzendal tongue especially in its ancient form what they tell we run as follow : -- at some indefinitely remote epoch votan come from the far east he be send by god to divide out and assign to the different race of man the earth on which they dwell and to give to each its own language the land whence he come be vaguely call _ ualum uotan _ the land of votan he message be especially to the tzendal previous to he arrival they be ignorant barbarous and without fix habitation he collect they into village teach they how to cultivate the maize and cotton and invent the hieroglyphic sign which they learn to carve on the wall of they temple it be even say that he write he own history in they he institute civil law for they government and impart to they the proper ceremonial of religious worship for this reason he be also call master of the sacred drum the instrument with which they summon the votary to the ritual dance they especially remember he as the inventor of they calendar he name stand third in the week of twenty day and be the first dominical sign accord to which they count they year correspond to the _ kan _ of the maya as a city-builder he be speak of as the founder of palenque nachan huehuetlan -- in fact of any ancient place the origin of which have be forget near the last mention locality huehuetlan in soconusco he be report to have construct a underground temple by merely blow with he breath in this gloomy mansion he deposit he treasure and appoint a priestess to guard it for whose assistance he create the tapir votan bring with he accord to one statement or accord to another be follow from he native land by certain attendant or subordinate call in the myth _ tzequil _ petticoat from the long and flowing robe they wear these aid he in the work of civilization on four occasion he return to he former home divide the country when he be about to leave into four district over which he place these attendant when at last the time come for he final departure he do not pass through the valley of death as must all mortal but he penetrate through a cave into the under-earth and find he way to the root of heaven with this mysterious expression the native myth close its account of he -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the reference to the votan myth be nuñez de la vega _ constituciones diocesanas

asiatiques de la civilization américaine _ -lrb- alencon 1871 -rrb- -rrb- he be worship by the tzendal as they principal deity and they beneficent patron but he have a rival in they religious observance the fear _ yalahau _ lord of blackness or lord of the water he be represent as a terrible warrior cruel to the people and one of the first of man -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ yalahau _ be refer to by bishop nuñez de la vega as venerate in occhuc and other tzendal town of chiapa he translate it señor de lo negro the terminal _ ahau _ be pure maya meaning king ruler lord _ yal _ be also maya and mean water the god of the water of darkness night and blackness be often one and the same in mythology and probably have we the myth complete he would prove to be votan 's brother and antagonist -rrb- accord to a unpublished work by fuente votan be one of four brother the common ancestor of the southwestern branch of the maya family -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : quote in emeterio pineda _ descripcion geografica de chiapas y soconusco _ p 9 -lrb- mexico 1845 -rrb- -rrb- all these trait of this popular hero be too exactly similar to those of the other representative of this myth for they to leave any doubt as to what we be to make of votan like the rest of they he and he long-robed attendant be personification of the eastern light and its ray though but uncritical epitome of a fragmentary myth about he remain they be enough to stamp it as that which meet we so constantly no matter where we turn in the new world -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the title of the tzendal mss be say by cabrera to be proof that i be a chan the author write in the person of votan himself and prove he claim that he be a chan because he be a chivim chan have be translate _ serpent _ on _ chivim _ the commentator have almost give up suppose that the serpent be a totem of one of the tzendal clan then the effort would be to show that they hero-god be of that totem but how this be show by he be prove a _ chivim _ be not obvious the term _ ualum chivim _ the land of the _ chivim _ appear to be that apply in the m to the country of the tzendal or a part of it the word _ chus uinic _ would mean man of the shore and might be a local name apply to a clan on the coast but in default of the original text we can but surmise as to the precise meaning of the writer -rrb- it scarcely seem necessary for I to point out that he name votan be in no way akin to othomi or tarasco root still less to the norse wodan or the indian buddha but be derive from a radical in pure maya yet i will do so in order if possible to put a stop to such visionary etymology as we be inform by bishop nuñez de la vega _ uotan _ in tzendal means _ heart _ votan be speak of as the heart or soul of he people this derivation have be question because the word for the heart in the other maya dialect be different and it have be suggest that this be but a example of otosis where a foreign proper name be turn into a familiar common noun but these objection do not hold good in regard to derivation _ uotan _ be from the pure maya root-word _ tan _ which mean primarily the breast or that which be in front or in the middle of the body with the possessive prefix it become _ utan _ in tzendal this word mean both _ breast _ and _ heart _ this be well illustrate by a ancient manuscript date from 1707 in my possession it be a guide to priest for administer the sacrament in spanish and tzendal i quote the passage in point -lrb- 1 -rrb- : -- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ modo de administrar los sacramentos en castellano y tzendal _ 1707 4to m p 13 -rrb- con todo tu corazón hiriendote en los pechos di conmigo _ ta zpizil auotan xatigh zny auotan zghoyoc alagh ghoyoc _ -- here _ a _ be the possessive of the second person and _ uotan _ be use both for heart and breast thus the derivation of the word from the maya radical be clear the figure of speech by which the chief divinity be call the heart of the earth the heart of the sky be common in these dialect and occur repeatedly in the _ popol vuh _ the sacred legend of the kich of guatemalum -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : thus we have -lrb- _ popol vuh _ part i p 2 -rrb- _ u qux cho _ heart of the lake and _ u qux palo _ heart of the ocean as name of the highest divinity later we find _ u qux cah _ heart of the sky -lrb- p 8 -rrb- _ u qux uleu _ heart of the earth p 12 14 etc i may here repeat what i have elsewhere write on this figurative expression in the maya language : the literal or physical sense of the word heart be not that which be here intend in these dialect this word have a richer metaphorical meaning than in we tongue it stand for all the psychical power the memory will and reasoning faculty the life the spirit the soul it would be more correct to render these name the ` spirit ' or ` soul ' of the lake etc than the ` heart ' they indicate a dimly understand sense of the unity of spirit or energy in

-lrb- 1 -rrb- these prediction be carefully note by the missionary and regard as the unconscious prophecy of heathendom of the advent of christianity but to I they bear too unmistakably the stamp of the light-myth i have be follow up in so many locality of the new world for I to entertain a doubt about they origin and meaning -lrb- footnote 1 : ilium quoque pollicitum fuisse se aliquando have

des americaines tupis-caribe _ p 62 -lrb- vienna 1876 -rrb- -rrb- i have not yet exhaust the source from which i could bring evidence of the widespread presence of the element of this mythical creation in america but probably i have say enough to satisfy the reader on this point at any rate it will be sufficient if i close the list with some manifest fragment of the myth pick out from the confused and generally modern report we have of the religion of the athabascan race this stem be one of the most widely distribute in north america extend across the whole continent south of the eskimo and scatter toward the warmer latitudes quite into mexico it be low down in the intellectual scale its component tribe be usually migratory savage and its dialect be extremely synthetic and of difficult phonetics require as many as sixty-five letter for they proper orthography no wonder therefore that we have but limited knowledge of they mental life conspicuous in they myth be the tale of the two brother these mysterious being be upon the earth before man appear though alone they do not agree and the one attack and slay the other another brother appear on the scene who seem to be the one slay who have come to life and the two be give wife by the be who be the creator of thing these two woman be perfectly beautiful but invisible to the eye of mortal the one be name the woman of the light or the woman of the morning the other be the woman of darkness or the woman of evening the brother live together in one tent with these woman who each in turn go out to work when the woman of light be at work it be daytime when the woman of darkness be at she labor it be night in the course of time one of the brother disappear and the other determine to select a wife from one of the two woman as it seem he have not yet choose he watch what the woman of darkness do in she absence and discover that she descend into the water and enjoy the embrace of a monster while the woman of light pass she time in feed white bird in course of time the former bring forth black man-serpent while the woman of light be deliver of beautiful boy with white skin the master of the house kill the former with he arrow but preserve the latter and marry the woman of light become the father of the human race and especially of the dènè dindjié who have preserve the memory of he -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ monographie des dènè dindjié par _ crpe petitot pp 84-87 -lrb- pari 1876 -rrb- elsewhere the writer say : tout d'abord je dois rappeler mon observation que presque toujor dans les tradition dènè le couple primitif se compose de _ deux frères _ ibid p 62 -rrb- in another myth of this stock clearly a version of the former this father of the race be represent as a mighty bird call _ yêl _ or _ yale _ or _ orelbale _ from the root _ ell _ a term they apply to everything supernatural he take to wife the daughter of the sun -lrb- the woman of light -rrb- and by she begat the race of man he form the dry land for a place for they to live upon and stock the river with salmon that they might have food when he enter he nest it be day but when he leave it it be night or accord to another myth he have the two woman for wife the one of whom make the day the other the night in the begin yêl be white in plumage but he have a enemy by name _ cannook _ with whom he have various contest and by whose machination he be turn black yêl be further represent as the god of the wind and storm and of the thunder and lightning -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : for the extent and particulars of this myth many of the detail of which i omit see petitot _ ubus suprá _ pp 68 87 note matthew macfie _ travel in vancouver island and british columbium _ pp 452-455 -lrb- london 1865 -rrb- and jk lord _ the naturalist in vancouver island and british columbium _ -lrb- london 1866 -rrb- it be refer to by mackenzie and other early writer -rrb- thus we find even in this extremely low specimen of the native race the same basis for they mythology as in the most cultivate nation of central america not only this it be the same basis upon which be build the major part of the sacred story of all early religion in both continent and the excellent father petitot who be so much impress by these resemblance that he found upon they a learn argument to prove that the dènè be of oriental extraction -lrb- 1 -rrb- would have write more to the purpose have he acquaintance with american religion be as extensive as it be with those of asiatic origin -lrb- footnote 1 : see he essai sur l'origine des dènè-dindjié in he _ monographie _ above quote -rrb- there be one point in all these myth which i wish to bring out forcibly that be the distinction which be everywhere draw between the god of light and the sun unless this distinction be fully comprehend american mythology lose most of its mean the assertion have be so often repeat even down to the latest writer that the american indian be nearly all sun-worshiper that i take pain formally to contradict it neither the sun nor the spirit of the sun be they chief divinity of course the daily history of the appearance and disappearance of light be intimately connect with the apparent motion of the sun hence in the myth there be often a seeming identification of the two which i have be at no pain to avoid but the identity be superficial only it entirely disappear in other part of the myth and the conception as fundamentally distinct must be study separately to reach accurate result it be a easy but by no mean a profound method of treat these religion to dismiss they all by the facile explanation of animism and sun and moon worship i have say and quote strong authority to confirm the opinion that the native tribe of america have lose ground in moral and have retrograde in they religious life since the introduction of christianity they own faith though lower in form have in they the germ of a religious and moral evolution more likely with proper regulation to lead these people to a higher plane of thought than the aryan doctrine which be force upon they this may seem a daring even a heterodox assertion but i think that most modern ethnologist will agree that it be no more possible for race in all stage of culture and of widely different faculty to receive with benefit any one religion than it be for they to thrive under one form of government or to adopt with advantage one uniform plan of build house the moral and religious life be a growth and the brash wood of ancient date can not be graft on the green stem it be well to remember that the heathendom of america be very far from want live seed of sound morality and healthy mental education i shall endeavor to point this out in a few brief paragraph in they origin in the human mind religion and morality have nothing in common they be even antagonistic at the root of all religion be the passionate desire for the widest possible life for the most unlimited exercise of all the power the basis of all morality be self-sacrifice the willingness to give up we wish to the will of another the criterion of the power of a religion be its ability to command this sacrifice the criterion of the excellence of a religion be the extent to which its command coincide with the good of the race with the lofty standard of the categorical imperative with these axiom well in mind we can advance with confidence to examine the claim of a religion it will rise in the scale just in proportion as its behest be they universally adopt would permanently increase the happiness of the human race in they origin as i have say morality and religion be opposite but they be opposite which inevitably attract and unite the first lesson of all religion be that we gain by give that to secure any end we must sacrifice something this too be teach by all social intercourse and therefore a acute german psychologist have set up the formulum all manners be moral -lrb- 1 -rrb- because they all imply a subjection of the personal will of the individual to the general will of those who surround he as express in usage and custom -lrb- footnote 1 : alle sitten sind sittlich lazarus _ ursprung der sitte _ s 5 quote by roskoff i hardly need mention that we word _ morality _ from _ mo _ means by etymology simply what be customary and of current usage the moral man be he who conform himself to the opinion of the majority this be also at the basis of robert browning 's definition of a people : a people be but the attempt of many to rise to the completer life of one -lrb- _ a soul 's tragedy _ -rrb- -rrb- even the religion which demand bloody sacrifice which force its votary to futile and abhorrent rite be at least training its adherent in the virtue of obedience and renunciation in endurance and confidence but concern american religion i need not have recourse to such a questionable vindication they hold in they far nobler element as be prove beyond cavil by the word of many of the earliest missionary themselves bigoted and bitter hater of the native faith as they be they discover in they so much that be good so much that approximate to the purer doctrine that they themselves come to teach that they have leave on record many a attempt to prove that there must in some remote and unknown epoch have come christian teacher to the new world st thoma st bartholomew monk from ireland or asiatic disciple to acquaint the native with such salutary doctrine it be precisely in connection with the myth which i have be relate in this volume that these theory be put forth and i have refer to they in various passage the fact be as state but the credit of develop these elevated moral conception must not be refuse to the red race they be its own property the legitimate growth of its own religious sense the hero-god the embodiment of the light of day be essentially a moral and beneficent creation whether he name be michabo ioskeha or quetzalcoatl itzamna viracocha or tamu he be always the giver of law the instructor in the art of social life the founder of commonwealth the patron of agriculture he cast he influence in favor of peace and against war and deed of violence he punish those who pursue iniquity and he favor those who work for the good of the community in many instance he set a example of chaste living of strict temperance of complete subjection of the lust and appetite i have but to refer to what i have already say of the maya kukulcan and the aztec quetzalcoatl to show this both be particularly note as character free from the taint of indulgence thus it occur that the early monk often express surprise that these whom they choose to call savage and heathen have develop a moral law of undeniable purity the matter that bochica teach say the chronicler piedrahita be certainly excellent inasmuch as these native hold as right to do just the same that we do the priest of these muysca he go on to say live most chastely and with great purity of life insomuch that even in eat they food be simple and of small quantity and they refrain altogether from woman and marriage do one transgress in this respect he be dismiss from the priesthood -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : las cosas que el bochica les enseñaba eran buenas siendo assi que tenian por malo lo mismo que nosotros tenemos por tal piedrahita _ historia general de las conquistas del nuevo reyno de granada _ lib i cap iii -rrb- the prayer address to these deity breathe as pure a spirit of devotion as many now hear in christian land change the name and some of the formula preserve by christobal de molina and sahagun would not jar on the ear of a congregation in one of we own church although sanguinary rite be common they be not usual in the worship of these highest divinity but rather as propitiation to the demon of the darkness or the spirit of the terrible phenomenon of nature the mild god of light do not demand they to appreciate the effect of all this on the mind of the race let it be remember that these culture-hero be also the creator the primal and most potent of divinity and that usually many temple and a large corps of priest be devote to they worship at least in the nation of higher civilization these votary be engage in keep alive the myth in impress the suppose command of the deity on the people and in imitate he in example and precept thus they have form a lofty ideal of man and be publish this ideal to they fellow certainly this could not fail of work to the good of the nation and of elevate and purify its moral conception that it do so we have ample evidence in the authentic account of the ancient society as it exist before the european destroy and corrupt it and in the collection of law all distinctly stamped with the seal of religion which have be preserve as they be in vogue in anahuac utatlan peru and other locality -lrb- 1 -rrb- any one who peruse these will see that the great moral principle the radical doctrine of individual virtue be clearly recognize and deliberately enforce as divine and civil precept in these community moreover they be generally and cheerfully obey and the people of many of these land be industrious peaceable moral and happy far more so than they have ever be since -lrb- footnote 1 : the reader willing to pursue the argument further can find these collection of ancient american law in sahagun _ historia de nueva españa _ for mexico in geronimo roman _ republica de las indias occidentales _ for utatlan and other nation for peru in the _ relacion del origen descendencia politica y gobierno de los incas por el licenciado fernando de santillan _ -lrb- publish at madrid 1879 -rrb- and for the muysca in piedrahita _ hist gen del nuevo reyno de granada _ lib ii cap v -rrb- there be also a manifest progress in the definition of the idea of god that be of a single infinite intelligence as the source and control power of phenomenon we have it on record that in peru this be the direct fruit of the myth of viracocha it be related that the inca yupanguus publish to he people that to he have appear viracocha with admonition that he alone be lord of the world and creator of all thing that he have make the heaven the sun and man and that it be not right that these he work should receive equal homage with himself therefore the inca decree that the image of viracocha should thereafter be assign supremacy to those of all other divinity and that no tribute nor sacrifice should be pay to he for he be master of all the earth and could take from it as he choose -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be evidently a direct attempt on the part of a enlighten ruler to lift he people from a lower to a higher form of religion from idolatry to theism the inca even go so far as to banish all image of viracocha from he temple so that this the greatest of god should be worship as a immaterial spirit only -lrb- footnote 1 : p joseph de acosta _ historia natural y moral de las indias _ lib vi cap 31 -lrb- barcelona 1591 -rrb- -rrb- a parallel instance be present in aztec annals nezahualcoyotzin a enlighten ruler of tezcuco about 1450 be both a philosopher and a poet and the song which he leave seventy in number some of which be still preserved breathe a spirit of emancipation from the idolatrous superstition of he day he announce that there be one only god who sustain and create all thing and who dwell above the ninth heaven out of sight of man no image be fitting for this divinity nor do he ever appear bodily to the eye of man but he listen to they prayer and receive they soul -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see fernando de alva ixtlilxochitl _ historica chichimeca _ cap xlix and joseph joaquin granado y galvez _ tarde americana _ p 90 -lrb- mexico 1778 -rrb- -rrb- these tradition have be doubt for no other reason than because it be assume that such thought be above the level of the red race but the proper name and title unquestionably ancient and genuine which i have analyze in the precede page refute this supposition we may safely affirm that other and stronger instance of the kind could be quote have the early missionary preserve more extensively the sacred chant and prayer of the native in the maya tongue of yucatan a certain number of they have escape destruction and although they be open to some suspicion of have be color for proselytize purpose there be direct evidence from native who be adult at the time of the conquest that some of they priest have predict the time should come when the worship of one only god should prevail this be nothing more than another instance of the monotheistic idea find its expression and its apparition be not more extraordinary in yucatan or peru than in ancient egypt or greece the actual religious and moral progress of the native be designedly ignore and belittle by the early missionary and conqueror bishop las casas directly charge those of he day with magnify the vice of the indian and the cruelty of they worship and even such a liberal thinker as roger william tell we that he would not be present at they ceremony lest i should have be partaker of satan 's invention and worship -lrb- 1 -rrb- this same prejudice completely blind the first visitor to the new world and it be only the extravagant notion that christianity have at some former time be preach here that save we most of the little that we have on record -lrb- footnote 1 : roger william _ a key into the language of america _ p 152 -rrb- yet now and then the truth break through even this dense veil of prejudice for instance i have quote in this chapter the evidence of the spanish chronicler to the purity of the teaching attribute to bochica the effect of such doctrine could not be lose on a people who look upon he at once as a exemplar and a deity nor be it the spaniard have leave strong testimony to the pacific and virtuous character of that nation and its freedom from the vice so prevalent in lower race -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see especially the _ noticias sobre el nuevo reino de granada _ in the _ colleccion de documentos ineditos del archivo de indias _ vol v p 529 -rrb- now as i dismiss from the domain of actual fact all these legendary instructor the question remain whence do these secluded tribe obtain the sentiment of justice and morality which they love to attribute to they divine founder and in a measure to practice themselves the question be pertinent and with its answer i may fitly close this study in american native religion if the theory that i have advocate be correct these myth have to do at first with merely natural occurrence the advent and departure of the daylight the wind the storm and the rain the beneficent and injurious result of these phenomenon be attribute to they personification especially be the dispersal of darkness by the light regard as the transaction of all most favorable to man the facility that it give he be imputed to the goodness of the personify spirit of light and by a natural association of idea the benevolent emotion and affection develop by improve social intercourse be also bring into relation to this kindly be they come to be regard as he behest and in the national mind he grow into a teacher of the friendly relation of man to man and a ideal of those power which make for righteousness priest and chieftain favor the acceptance of these view because they feel they intrinsic wisdom and hence the moral evolution of the nation proceed steadily from its mythology that the result achieve be similar to those teach by the best religion of the eastern world should not excite any surprise for the basic principle of ethic be the same everywhere and in all time the
