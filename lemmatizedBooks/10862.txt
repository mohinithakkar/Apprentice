reference to certain portion of the white waterfall that might strain the belief of the average reader will not be out of place in the wonderful island of the pacific many thing happen that seem improbable to the mind of those who dwell close to the heart of civilization the mysterious isle of tear be not altogether a dream there be several island in polynesium that have be look upon from time immemorial as island of the dead these place be shun by the islander and the century have invest they with the same atmosphere of brooding mystery that professor herndon and he party feel when they land upon the silent isle where the wizard of the centipede perform they weird rite without interference from the outside world nor be the vermilion pit create out of thin air the savage have use many startling method to separate the bear warrior from the coward and the author have see a place just as wonderful as the pit where the young man of the tribe be test in the same manner as that related in this story the cunning savage have always think it inadvisable to pick he fight man till they courage have be thoroughly test and in dull day of peace the headman of the tribe rack they brain to discover nerve-shaking ordeal to try the daring of the grow youth the safety of the tribe depend upon the valor of the fight line and it would have be a inexcusable blunder to put the nervous one in the front rank the strange stone structure similar to the one upon which holman and verslun narrowly escape be offer up as sacrifice to the centipede be to be find in many island of the pacific at the present day in the tongan caroline and cook group these peculiar stone ruin remain as evidence of the existence of a ancient people of superior intelligence to the islander of to-day as to the meaning or use of these structure we be entirely in the dark the native of these group know nothing concern they and the polynesian builder in that dark past be too busy club and eat he neighbor to write history scientist be in doubt as in the case of the great ruin at metalanim whether they be build as sacrificial altar or as monument to ambitious chief and there be no record to enlighten we but these relic be convince proof that the island have be inhabit for many hundred of year and we be leave to conjecture regard the origin and history of the people the dance of the centipede which holman and verslun witness in the long gallery can be see to-day by any tourist who leave the beaten path every missionary to the island can tell of devil dance that take place in secluded grove and in which to he great disgust he convert often take part it take time to turn the savage from he old belief although the south sea constitute the last fortress of romance and a mention of the coral

devote to slumber and it be a wise proverb when you judge it from a polynesian standpoint no special preparation be require for slumber in the last haunt of romance and as one do not lose caste by doze in public the south sea dweller see no reason for remain awake when he could be peacefully sleep the shade of a palm tree furnish a ideal rest place and if a dog fight occur in the grass-grown street he become a box-seat spectator without move from he couch levuka the second largest town in the fiji be doze on the afternoon of December 14 1905 and i decide to follow the example set by the inhabitant the thermometer in the shack at the end of the wharf register 98 degree but the picturesque little town with its white and vermilion-tinted house look restful and cool the hot still atmosphere weigh down upon the pacific iron out the wind ruffle till the ocean resemble a plain of glass in which the union company 's steamer _ navua _ from auckland appear to be stick fast as if the glassy sea have suddenly harden around she black hull a thin strip of shadow huddle close to a pile of pearl shell at the end of the wharf and i double myself up and attempt to sleep but hardwood plank do not make a ideal rest place besides the ray of sun follow the strip of shadow around the pile and each time i slip into a doze i would be prick into wakefulness at last madden by the bite ray i collect half a dozen copra bag splintered a piece of _ kaurus _ pine and after rig up one bag as a awning i spread the other on the plank and fall asleep but another disturbing element awaken I from a short slumber from the sea end of the desert wharf come a big greasy maorus and a fuzzy-headed fijian and they word go out into the silence like sound projectile the maorus have such a high-pitched voice that i think as i roll over restlessly he would only have to raise it a little to make they hear he up in sydney eighteen hundred mile away it be one of those voice that fairly cavort over big distance and i bury my head in the shell as the pair come closer it be useless to attempt to shut out that voice i stuff a piece of bag into the ear that be not jam against the pearl shell but the noise of that fool talk fairly sizzle in my brain finally i give up all hope of try to sleep till the pair have leave the wharf and i lay upon my back as they come slowly up the sun-bitten structure it be only when i give up all thought of sleep that i recognize that the maorus be talk english up to that moment i think the pair be argue in some unfamiliar tongue but suddenly they conversation grip I and i strain my ear to listen there be the white waterfall chant the maorus yes the white waterfall repeat the fijian a ' you go along sixty pace to the right question the fijian no to the leave you fool scream he companion all right you go to the left mutter the rebuke one a ' that be the way to heaven cry the maorus the way to heaven echo the fijian then the two lift up they voice and chant : that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven out of black fernando 's hell the incident stir my curiosity if i have only hear the word of the chant i would not have puzzle my brain to determine they meaning but it be the manner in which the maorus instruct he friend as to the direction in which one must walk from the white waterfall that make I interested i turn the word over in my mind as i watch they saunter slowly toward I black fernando 's hell and the white waterfall be place that i have never hear of i thought of all the missionary hymn that i have ever listen to afloat and ashore but the line that the pair have chant be not familiar the two walk on in silence for a few minute after they have lift up they voice in the chant then the maorus begin to cross-question he companion concern the information he have just give he how many pace he ask sixty answer the fijian to the right be not it yes to the right stammer the learner you fool nigger scream the instructor it be to the left pig do you hear I you must go to the leave from the white waterfall oh you blind fool you make I sick sing it now with I the fijian who be apparently afraid of the bully hurry to obey the order and i wonder as i listen sixty pace to the left squeak the fijian sixty pace to the left roar the maorus now together that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven out of -- i be the cause of the interruption i lift myself into a sit position and the movement disturb the heap of shell part of the pile rattle down upon the plank of the wharf and the maorus and he pupil stop singing and stare at I as if they be much surprised at find any one within hear distance the wharf have appear desert and i give they a start by crawl from underneath the awning i have make from the copra bag the maorus wear a dirty khaki coat with a pair of trousers reach to he knee while the fijian instead of be short-rigged in shirt and sulu sport a full suit of duck good afternoon boss say the maorus try to wipe the look of surprise from he face with a grin mighty hot afternoon be not it boss it be i answer if i know where that white waterfall be i would go and stand under it for a few minute the small fijian give a little gurgle of surprise and look up at he big teacher who regard I with eye of wonder what white waterfall boss he ask blandly the one you be sing about i cry the maorus smile sweetly we be not singing about a white waterfall boss he splutter i just guess you be asleep a ' dream something that do not improve my temper i have a edge on the fellow on account of the high-powered voice he own so when he suggest that i have be dream i climb to my foot so that i could make my word more impressive when i start to tell he my opinion of he bluff the action startle the fijian he have a idea that i be go to use the piece of _ kaurus _ pine upon he head so he give a yell and start full speed up the wharf toward the town the maorus stand he ground for a minute then he make a face to express he contempt for I and bolt after he mate i stare at he bare leg wallop the plank and feel certain that i have lose all chance of find out where the white waterfall and black fernando 's hell be situate i find a new shadow patch and lay down again i fall asleep and dream that i be chase those two islander in a endeavor to find out the meaning of they mysterious chant but just as i have overtake the pair some one grip my arm and shake I gently when i open my eye i look up into the face of a good-looking young fellow of about two and twenty year who be smile broadly as if he think it a great joke to wake a man out of a sound sleep on a hot afternoon be you jack verslun he ask i nod it be too warm to use word recklessly pierre the rat send I after you he continue why i ask i have a berth for you he answer i be from _ the waif _ the mate die on the run down from sydney and captain newmarch send I ashore to hunt up some one for he perch do you want it where be you bind i ask manihikus group what for science expedition under the direction of professor herndon of san francisco i sit up and look across the stretch of water at _ the waif _ and the young fellow wait patiently i know the yacht a english baronet have bring the vessel out from cowe to brisbane but he have make the pace too hot in the colony out in fortitude valley one night the keeper of a saloon fire a bullet into he aristocratic head and _ the waif _ be auction she have take a hand in a number of game after that a fast yacht be a handy vessel south of the line and some queer tale be tell about the boat that have once show she heel to the crackerjack in the solent but i could not afford to be particular at that moment levuka be not the spot where a man can pick and choose so i wipe the shell grit from my drill suit and tell myself that i have better accept the berth instead of wait in expectation of something better turn up pierre the rat who run the rathole where penniless seaman and beachcomber lodge be my creditor and when pierre be very solicitous in obtain employment for one of he boarder it be a mighty good intimation that the boarder 's credit have reach highwater mark well i say climb to my foot i might as well take it i think i have enough of the island but as this have turn up i be you man say i add do you ever read pilgrim 's progress ' the young fellow look at I and grin yes i do he answer do you remember much of it i ask not much he reply be there anything in it about a white waterfall that be on the way to heaven out of black fernando 's hell i question the youngster put he head on one side and look as if he be turn thing over in he mental storehouse then he give I a quick shrewd glance and burst out laugh well i growl what be the grin for what have bunyan get to do with my business he ask i come to sign you up for a mate 's job on _ the waif _ and i be in a hurry yes i know i grumbled but i think you might have hear something of a white waterfall i be not sure that it be mention in ` pilgrim 's progress ' but it seem to taste of bunyan p ` rap so say the youngster but bunyan be not in we line at present captain newmarch tell I to hurry back to the yacht as he want to get away by sunset so if you be ready we 'll make a start my name be holman will holman we walk up the quiet street together and i begin to like will holman one could not help but like he he have the frank open way of a boy but the cut of he jaw and the manner in which he mint he word lead you to believe that he would give a man 's account of himself if any one push he up against a wall while he make some purchase in the little store i go up to the broken-down shanty where pierre the rat run he house of refuge and after i have collect my few belongings i go back to the wharf where a boat from _ the waif _ be wait to take we aboard the yacht it be when i be climb into the boat that i get a surprise one of the two native at the oar be the little fijian who have be the pupil of the maorus but he do not bat a eyelash when i stare at he what be up ask holman do you know tonus he be one of the brace that be singing that song about the white waterfall i growl the fijian let out a volley of indignant denial and holman laugh you might be mistaken he say tonus come ashore with I about two hour ago but i do not think he leave the boat i be not mistaken i say as the fijian keep on protest that he have never move from the boat but it do not matter much let it go we be about a quarter of a mile from the shore when a man race down from the town run along to the sea end of the wharf and wave he arm as if he be signal we holman turn and look at he i wonder who it be he mutter perhaps it be somebody with you board bill verslun i start to laugh then i stop suddenly the man on the wharf be shout to we and when my ear catch a word i recognize he it be the big maorus who have be instruct the fijian earlier in the afternoon i tell holman and he look at tonus but tonus 's face be blank for some reason or other he wish to ignore he instructor who be scream on the end of the wharf he must be mad muttered holman the darned fool think we -- listen a land breeze bring the last line of the chant to we ear as we near _ the waif _ and the word seem to stir I curiously as they swirl around we i have a desire to memorize the chant and even after we have get out of range of the high-powered voice of the singer i find myself murmur over and over again the word : that be the way to heaven out of black fernando 's hell -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter ii the professor 's daughter in the old day when slave-carrying be a game follow by gentleman with nerve the officer with the best nose on board the man-o ' - war that overhaul a suspect slave carrier be always send aboard to make a examination it be he business to sniff at the air in the hold in a endeavor to distinguish the slave smell no matter how the wily slaver disinfect the place the odour of caged nigger remain and a long-nosed investigator could always detect it now the trouble odour on board a ship be the same as the slave smell a experienced investigator can detect it immediately and when i climb over the low bulwark of _ the waif _ i get a whiff i could not tell exactly where it be but i know that dame trouble be aboard the craft it be a sort of sixth sense with a sailorman to be able to detect a stormy atmosphere and i feel that the yacht be not the place that the dive of peace would choose as a permanent abode i do not know how the information come to I it seem to filter in through the pore of my skin but it be information that i feel sure be correct captain newmarch be a bilious englishman with a thin scrawny beard he endeavor to make one word do the work of two -- or three if they be very short word -- and work up a conversation with he be as tough a job as one could lay hold of sometimes a word come to the tip of he tongue feel the atmosphere as you might say then slide back into he throat with a little protest gurgle and after a ten minute ' conversation with he those little gurgle from the strangle word make I look upon he as a sort of morgue for murder sentence professor herndon the head of the expedition be on the deck when the captain and i come up out of the cabin and herndon be everything the comic papers show in the make-up of science professor with a little bit extra for good luck he be sixty inch of nerve wrinkle and whisker with special adornment in the shape of a blue smoking cap and a pair of spectacles with specially ground lens of a enormous thickness newmarch grunt something which the professor and i take to be a introduction and he put a skinny hand into mine you have be a long while in the island he squeak longer than i care to say i reply have you be around the spot we be make for he ask i be on penrhyn island for three month i answer i be help a german scientist who be study the family habit of turtle i make a foolish break by admit that i possess any knowledge of polynesium the professor have leave he home at sunny sausalito on the shore of san francisco bay in search of that kind of stuff and before i could do a conversational backstep he have push I against the side of the galley and be deluge I with question the answer to which he enter in shorthand in a notebook that be bulkier than a dutchman 's bible the old spectacled ancient could fire more query in three minute than any human gatle that ever grip a brief and i look around for relief and the wonder be that the relief come i forget the professor and he anxiety concern the temba-temba devil dance when my eye happen to catch sight of the vision that be approach from the companionway a boat carry a science expedition to one of the loneliest group in the pacific be not the place where one would expect to find the handsomest girl in all the world and my tongue refuse to mould my word the girl be tall of graceful build and possess of a quiet beauty that have a most peculiar effect upon I only that afternoon as i lay in the shadow of the pile of pearl shell on levuka wharf i have think of cross to auckland and ship up to ` frisco so that i could hear good woman laugh and talk as i have hear they in my dream during the year i have spend around the island and now the woman of my dream be in front of I but i be afraid of she when she come toward I i thought of the year i have waste down in that lonely quarter where ambition be strangle by lassitude breed in tropical sunshine and the ghost of the man i might have be bang I fair between the two eye my daughter miss edith herndon squeak the professor and when i put out my big hand to take she little one i think i would fall down on the deck on account of the niagara of blood that seem to rush to my brain it be funny how all the little imperfection in you dress and manner rise up suddenly and bang you hard on the bump of observation when you find yourself in front of some one whose good opinion you want to earn i feel it so the moment i stand before the girl in the cream serge suit my drill outfit that i have think rather clean when i brush the shell grit from it after my sleep on the wharf look as black as the devil 's tail when she appear my hand appear to be several degree larger than the prize ham that come out of kansa and my tongue as if it recognize the stupidity of the remark i attempt to make start to play fool stunt as if it want to go down my throat and choke I to death the girl guess the sort of predicament i be in at that moment god only know how many month have pass since i have speak to a woman like she not that good woman be lack in the island but because they be on a different plane to I i have be belt native crew on trading schooner between the caroline and the marquesa and when ashore i have little opportunity for speak to a woman of the type of edith herndon and she understand the feeling that hold I tongue-tied to make I feel at my ease she start to tell of everything that have happen from the moment that _ the waif _ have clear sydney head and the time she spend in that recital be as precious to I as the two-minute interval between round be to a prize-fighter who have be knock silly the moment before the round end i have shake the dizziness out of my head when she finish and i have obtain control over my tongue you must tell we a lot about the south sea she cry you have be down here such a long time that you must have many interesting thing to relate captain newmarch will not talk and mr leith refuse to see anything picturesque in the sight he have see during he wanderings who be mr leith i ask he be father 's partner in this expedition she say quietly he have live down here for many year but he will not tell we much and barbara be anxious to know everything she can barbara i stammer then -- then there be another lady aboard oh yes my sister cry the girl i think i hear she come now there be no question about the latter part of she remark a burst of laughter that be more infectious than influenza come from the companion-stair and immediately in its wake come a girl who make I think as i compare she to miss edith of a beautiful yacht alongside a stately liner barbara herndon be sunshine personified laughter go with she wherever she go and a pair of tongan polish brass immediately put they molar on view as if they have understand what cause the smile upon she pretty face as she come toward we oh you be the new mate she cry as i be introduce mr holman be just tell I about you he say that you repeat a chapter of ` pilgrim 's progress ' every time you wake up after a sleep i blush as i make a mental resolve that i would punch the head of that youngster when i have a suitable opportunity and in between my stammering explanation i make note on the difference between the two girl edith be as stately as juno with a face that be so sweet and restful that a glance at it be better than a opiate for a man whose nerve be all out of tune she have that kind of repose that you see sometimes on the face of a oriental statue the repose that come to woman who have meet great trial or for whom great trial be wait barbara be altogether different she find the world rather a amusing place and it seem as if she take it for grant that she sister be capable of shoulder the care of the family leave she free to smile at all the amusing incident she find in the course of the day it appear to I that i be a amusing incident to she at that moment she return to the fool story that holman have tell and i could not sidestep she question but it be true that you be quote bunyan on the wharf when mr holman find you be not it she ask mischievously no it be not true i splutter i only ask mr holman a question to see if he be familiar with ` pilgrim 's progress ' why do you ask he that she quiz i be sure he look a perfectly respectable young man miss edith be smile but she take pity upon I at last and endeavor to rescue I from my tormentor oh barbara she cry reprovingly mr verslun will think you be very inquisitive you must not pry into he private affair but it be nothing private i gurgle i simply ask mr holman a question in a endeavor to find out what a maorus and a fijian be talk about oh it be something mysterious cry the younger girl i know it i know it we be get into the region of mystery at last oh mr verslun you be a perfect treasure it have be a nasty dull old trip from the moment we leave sydney harbor and you be the first person to bring a little color into the voyage she be so work up at the thought of hearing something wonderfully mysterious and romantic that i start to make a long yarn out of that incident on the wharf just for she benefit miss edith be interested too but i be convince as i polish up the point of the little tale and endeavor to pull in a thrill that the elder sister be derive she pleasure from watch the face of the younger one and not from my story it please barbara she cry when i have tell how tonus have deny all knowledge of he friend and how the maorus have send the farewell chant after the boat she think she will see and hear wonderful thing before we get back to civilization i hope she will i say and little do i dream that the wish i express at that moment should come true in such a remarkable manner before we have return and you do not know what they mean by they song about the white waterfall and black fernando 's hell murmur barbara no i do not i reply the maorus run away when i attempt to cross-examine he and tonus deny all knowledge of the duet on the wharf oh we must ask he again she cry there he be near the wheel i 'll go and bring he she race madly after the fijian and haul he before we in triumph i be more convinced than ever that it be tonus who have blunder over he lesson on the wharf but tonus deny the charge more vehemently than he do on the boat he assert in reply to barbara herndon 's question that he could not sing a note that he be absolutely ignorant of white waterfall and the only hell he know be the one speak of by the missionary in lower george street sydney and the girl sigh as she give up the effort it seem such a nice mystery to unravel she murmur but if tonus persist in say that he know nothing of the white waterfall the investigation fall to the ground the fijian be back away with renew protestation when a head come round the corner of the galley and a voice that be deeper than the cave of atiu fire a question at we what about the white waterfall oh mr leith cry miss barbara we have just be investigate a mystery mr verslun discover it this afternoon in levuka but you have not meet mr verslun yet have you i have not growl the owner of the voice mr verslun this be mr leith who be father 's partner say miss barbara he know a lot about the island but he refuse to tell any of he experience i look at the man who stand in front of I and a curious thing flash through my mind i be remind at that moment of a story i have read of a man charge with a attempt upon the life of a prince the would-be murderer inform the judge that a terrible hate of the princeling have grip he the moment he put eye on he and he have make the attempt upon he life before he have manage to control the unexplainable surge of hate i understand the emotion that have grip that unfortunate as i stand face to face with leith a feeling of revulsion grip I and i experience a peculiar squalmy sensation as i take he hand it be unexplainable perhaps some ancestor of mine have unsatisfactory dealings with a man of the same unusual type in a faraway past and the transmitted hate have suddenly spring into the conscious area i do know that you can keep a secretary-bird away from snake till it grow old but the first reptile it see it immediately start out to beat he up i have the inherit hate that make the secretary-bird rush madly at a snake that may be the first of its species that it have ever see and i guess that leith have no love to spare for I from the moment he take my hand he be a huge brute fully six foot tall and he be the possessor of two of the strongest-looking hand i have ever see they be claw that be what they be the great finger be slightly crooked as if wait like the tentacle of a octopus for something to get in they grip the body be heavy and in a manner that i can not explain it make I think of animal that live and die in long past age the big brute look so capable of make a inexcusable attack that one 's primitive instinct warn one to keep in a state of readiness for the onslaught that seem imminent but it be the face that be specially unattractive it be a sallow flat face and the strange eye do nothing to lighten it they be dead lustreless eye they have a coldness in they that remind I of the icicle eye of the crocodile and curiously i associate that reptile 's notion of fair warfare with leith as i look at he that sullen face with the eye that would never brighten at a tale of daring or dim from a story of pathos belong to a man who would imitate crocodile tactic by lie quiet till he prey be within striking distance what be all this about the white waterfall he repeat after the crooked finger have drop my hand oh it be something that happen to mr verslun reply miss barbara where ask leith on the wharf over there i answer coldly nod toward the structure as i speak it be really nothing important though and i relate it solely for miss herndon 's amusement but tonus he growl turn toward the two girl oh tonus put forward a alibi laugh the youngest sister he assert that he be in the boat when the incident happen and he persist in say that he know nothing about the matter leith again turn toward I and he brow straighten as he look I in the eye can not you tell the story over again he ask i would rather not i say somewhat rudely i be tired of it it be really only a small happen that i be afraid i expand a little in a endeavor to thrill miss herndon and the story be now she personal property but the bare fact he growl there be no bare fact i reply i cover they with fiction and i think miss herndon be go to copyright the whole he take the remark as a direct refusal on my part to give he a outline of the affair to satisfy he curiosity and i feel elate at note the sudden glint of anger that appear in the lustreless eye the two girl stand silent for a moment while leith and i survey each other without speak then a tahitian boy break the awkward silence by inform I that the captain wish to see I in the cabin and i hurriedly excuse myself to the sister and go below -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter iii a knife from the dark it be after nine o'clock that evening before i again see young holman and by that time levuka be far behind we have take advantage of a stiff breeze that have spring up about sunset and _ the waif _ be plunge through a moon-washed ocean send furrow of foam from she forefoot while the wind snore through she canvas i forget the happening of the day as i feel the quiver vessel that seem to thrill with the ecstasy of life as she fling herself at the watery waste ahead the tremor in she board seem to crawl into my body and warm I like wine and i feel inclined to bless holman instead of punch he head as i have think of do during the baiting i receive from miss barbara herndon the youngster have save I from day and night of weary monotony in sleepy levuka and i welcome he gladly as he join I on the poop say you make a hit with the lady he cry you fame as a story-teller be set upon a solid foundation and i do not suppose you be incline to thank I for give you the opportunity to tell of the wonderful thing that happen while you slumber on the wharf drop it i growled i have have enough of the joke by the way what position do you hold in the expedition the boy laugh i hold none he cry but i be try to make myself useful to the professor so that he 'll invite I to come ashore with he the professor and he daughter with leith and half a dozen native comprise the full strength of the expedition and i be try hard for a invitation to the field of wonder but what be you do aboard i ask my uncle own _ the waif _ answer the young fellow and he think this trip would be a nice cheap holiday for I i want to take a run to the state but that would have cost he money so i allow myself to be force aboard the yacht but gee i be mighty glad i come now i glance at he face as we turn in we walk but he move he head away quickly so it have be pleasant i say pleasant he cry why it have be a little foretaste of heaven say i like you and i know you like she by the manner in which you explain everything to she do not you think she be a jolly nice girl who why miss barbara herndon he cry oh i gurgle you take I by surprise and i hardly know -- well i do not know what have make the trip so pleasant he put out he hand and i grip it warmly there be something clean and good about the youngster when he glance up at I as i take he hand i look into a face that be as open as the day -- a face that possess all the passionate purity of youth and my grip be sincere one do not ask for credentials in deal with will holman i like you from the start he say but i want the opinion of the girl that be why i put miss barbara up to the game of firing question at you about that silly business on the wharf and do i pass muster i query sure you do he cry enthusiastically miss barbara herndon say that you be true blue and miss edith -- he stop and look at a patch of shadow near the galley some one be hide there he whisper i see he sneak into it nonsense i growl the moon and something else be affect you brain but i be sure of it he gasp he spring for the spot as he finish speak but he find nothing he return to my side shake he head as if only half convinced about the matter some one be listen to we talk but whoever it be he manage to slip away while we be argue the question well he do not learn much i say it be probably one of the islander and you have scare the life out of he now holman grip my arm as i turn away and he put a question in a tense whisper what do you think of leith he ask somehow the question do not surprise I but i be not in a hurry to give my opinion of the professor 's partner i have only speak a few word to he i counter cautiously but you impression stammer the youngster do not you think -- well of course you have not get the lay of thing yet i smile at the guilelessness of the boy who be make a confidant of a stranger what be wrong with leith i ask what be you hint at holman glance at the tongan at the wheel then at the shadow patch that have disturb he nerve a few moment before he be the devil he whisper i feel inclined to laugh leith be certainly not a person that one would take to the moment a introduction be give but the manner in which the young fellow have impart he opinion be amusing but it be evident that i have not guess wrong when i divined trouble the moment i come over the side of the yacht holman catch my coat with he left hand as we turn and he speak excitedly do you know what we be after he query hoarsely it be a scientific expedition i reply that be what you and captain newmarch tell I and i have not question any one else but do you know the particular line we be after no i reply well we be after skull leith have tell the professor about some ancient boneyard that he know of and he be drag old herndon down there i can not see the crime now i say i have go after skull before to-day i bring a hundred of they up to vavau for a german scientist last year he be take they home to european museum to prove that the polynesian of ten century back have bigger brain than the nigger of to-day yes i know that gurgle holman but leith -- oh damn it i can not get you to understand he pull the professor into this deal and the old man be as green as grass herndon supply the money and all that and he be that much of a silly old doodlebug that this fellow be bunco he out of he good gold yes i muttered and what do he daughter say say cry the youngster they can say nothing that will do any good when they be talk to a madman he see fame come down the pike and he be blind to all the trick of that devil it be a fact verslun leith be after the old man 's cash -- and after edith herndon as well i stand and look at the youngster he boyish face be aflame with indignation and any suspicion i have regard he good intention be sweep away immediately after edith herndon i repeat slowly yes he gasp oh i know you do not like the big sallow brute miss barbara tell I how you turn he down cold when he want you to repeat that yarn to satisfy he curiosity he be a bad egg do you hear he be out for trouble and we be go to run into it head on before we finish the trip only for the girl i would have stay ashore at levuka and the captain i question we do not know about he he snap he be leith 's captain i mean leith put he in he job when the professor charter the yacht anyhow he do not say enough to let any one know which side of the fence he be on he have only learn to say yes and no and he be mighty particular about the number of time he will use those word i laugh at the bitterness the youngster throw into he speech it be good to be young one can love and hate with some intensity and it appear to I that holman have find mark for both adoration and hatred on the yacht that be slip into the mysterious island of the south sea you must not look at the black side of thing i say leith 's face be not a likable one i will admit but a lot of good fellow have ugly dial it seem that the professor want skull and it appear that leith know of a spot where he can gather up the oldest specimen in polynesium there be nothing wrong about that as to miss herndon she strike I as be a young lady who be well able to look after herself that be all right stammer the youngster perhaps i say too much but i have to speak to you and i be mighty glad you do i cry he grip my hand and turn away leave I to my own reflection it be a wonderful night the silvery sea through which _ the waif _ drive a path with plunge forefoot awake strange dream and fancy within my brain all the mystery of the tropic night well up around I and my soul seem to have suddenly awaken to the beauty of life the veil of morbid pessimism that come before my eye during the weary day i have spend upon the beach at levuka be tear aside and a wave of gladness enter my be i feel that the voyage would be a eventful one to I and i tramp the poop with a light step occasionally the sallow feature of leith persist in rise before my mental vision to blot out the dream face that be continually before I but i resolutely put the professor 's partner from my mind and fed myself upon the vision breed by the splendor of the night holman have leave I about a hour when i happen to glance at the patch of shadow that have attract he attention while he be talk to I i stop and watch it intently some one have crawl into the velvety strip and be lie perfectly still who be there i ask there be no answer the strip of shadow broaden and narrow as _ the waif _ plunge but i could discern nothing outside the captain and myself the crew of _ the waif _ together with the six man that be with the professor 's party be all native and i wonder as i watch the shadow why one should be crawl around as if afraid of be see it be possible that he be attempt to thieve something from the galley and it be also possible that he be spy as holman have suggest i pick up a small iron pin and toss it at the spot where i feel sure the islander be hide i do not throw the pin with any force although the yell that come out of the shadow would convince a onlooker that i have throw it with murderous intent i spring forward while the shriek of pain be still vibrate in the air but the native be determine to have revenge for the rap from the iron pin a knife flash in the moonlight and i stagger as the blade touch my forehead like a tongue of flame a dark figure dash along the deck toward the forecastle and brushing the blood from my eye i start in pursuit at the head of the companion-stairs i collide heavily with newmarch who have just rush up from the cabin and the force of the shock nearly throw he off he foot confound it he cry what be the matter with you one of the kanaka nearly cut my eye out i roared he fling a knife at I and duck for the f ` c ` stle i leave he stand in angry astonishment and rush forward i stand at the top of the ladder and listen the only noise that come up be the shrill snore of the islander but the blood that stream down my face make I forget prudence and i scramble down into the stuffy quarter where the odour of native be overwhelming a swing lamp dimly illuminate the place and i snatch it from its hook and swing it over the face of the naked occupant of the first bunk a glance convinced I that he sleep be genuine he mouth be wide open as he snore and the native who feign sleep have not enough sense to make he imitation more real by open he mouth the man in the next bunk a muscular kanaka have he face turn away from I and in spite of he prolonged snore my suspicion be arouse i thrust my hand beneath the single blanket that cover he and be immediately convince that i have discover the culprit the blanket be cold here you scoundrel i yell drop the lamp and poke he roughly in the rib what the devil do you mean by try to knife I he open he big eye and stare at I stupidly while the occupant of the other bunk who be arouse by my shout sit up and rub they eye why do you throw that knife i scream i no throw knife he mutter I sleep very tired the pain of my wound madden I and i seize he roughly and drag he toward the ladder with the intention of bring he before the bilious captain i have grasp a ring to haul myself up when a heavy boot come down on my finger and the voice of the captain scream a objection stop that business he shriek but this devil try to knife I i protest let he go yell newmarch do you hear I let he go this instant i let go my grip of the kanaka who immediately dive for he bunk and curl himself up as if he have no further interest in the proceedings the captain be beside I then and he quick breathing betray he excitement as i lift the lamp back to its place the light fall upon he thin feature they pallor surprise I as much as he word too many wonderful thing happen to you he stammer why -- what do you mean i query never mind he snap if you start a rough house on board this boat i 'll stop you before you get well under way i be too astounded to reply the blood upon my face and hand be plain evidence of the wound i have receive and the captain 's indifference leave I breathless without another word he turn and scramble up on deck and i follow once out of earshot of the listen crew i determine to make another effort to show he that my conduct be justified that devil be sneak in the shadow of the galley all the evening i cry i attempt to stir he out and he jerk the knife at I he stop in front of I make one of he conversational feint by open he mouth and shut it again then dive hastily for the companion leave I to search for sympathy in the moonlit night i remember as i endeavored to staunch the wound the question which i have put to holman concern the captain only a hour before and i smile grimly as i bind my handkerchief about my forehead captain newmarch of _ the waif _ have not rise in my estimation since the moment i make the inquiry -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter iv the storm holman glance inquiringly at the piece of stick plaster above my right eye when he meet I on the deck the morning after the knife incident and i grin sheepishly you be right about that patch of shadow last night i remark how he query this come from it i reply touch the plaster with my finger as i speak the boy whistle and look around cautiously you 'll be get wise in a day or two he murmur she say you would when i tell she this morning about we conversation of last night i laugh and he turn suddenly toward I do you think we 'll put in anywhere in the samoan group i do not think so i reply why holman come closer if we do i be go to get the girl ashore and keep they there he mutter i do not care what you think of the proposition this trip be go to be a tough one and i be certain there be some deviltry afoot i try to laugh at the serious face upon the youngster but the conviction which he throw into he word choke my mirth whether it be the little brush with the kanaka or the gloomy foreboding of the boy i could not tell but i feel a trifle anxious after my first night aboard _ the waif _ but there be nothing to be gain by run away if we do put in to a port i growl how be that stammer holman well if leith be a admirer of edith herndon as you say i argue and if the captain be in league with leith the yacht would not leave till the girl come aboard besides the professor would not go on without they i do not know about the professor grunt holman that old doodlebug only think of the silly specimen that he be go to collect down here if he have any love for he daughter he would not have bring they along but you tell I they insist on come so they do he retort savagely but they know that the poor old fool be in the hand of a scoundrel and they would not let he go alone they think they can protect he from that devil and it nearly make I cry to hear they say so miss edith herndon and she sister come up on deck at that moment and if i be impress by the calm sweetness of the elder girl 's face on the previous afternoon the strength and beauty of it as i see it in the fresh morning sunlight make my heart pound violently against my rib the prettiness of miss barbara make the quiet dignity of the elder sister more noticeable and that apparent strength of character make I doubt holman 's contention that she would be unable to help the scientist if leith 's motive be discover to be criminal it be barbara 's keen eye that detect my plaster and i squirm as i see the light of curiosity in she eye oh tell we how it happen she cry please make it a night attack upon the yacht mr verslun i hear a wild cry just after i retire and i feel sure that war canoe have surround we they always surround the ill-fated ship do not they she continue merrily and the ship be always ill-fated in all the really thrilling sea story i have read leith come saunter aft as she fire she question at I and he stand near miss edith with he dull eye fix upon I as i answer i be afraid i can not feed you imagination to-day i reply i trip over a coil of rope and the deck spring up and bump I i glance at leith as i speak and i fancied i detect a glint of amusement in the lustreless eye that be turn in my direction whether it be cause by my hastily construct lie or by the girl 's inquiry i could not tell but my dislike for the clumsy giant make I suspicious about he knowledge of the incident of the precede evening and i feel certain that he be smile at my fib as if he wish to do something which would convince I of he ignorance of the happen he hastily change the subject the captain think we be in for a spell of bad weather mr verslun he drawl be you of the same opinion if sign go for anything we be i reply we be run into a zone of trouble he walk away without further speech and the two girl go below in response to a message from they father the professor be slightly indispose and he demand that he daughter remain with he in the cabin the selfishness of the scientist irritated holman exceedingly and he make bitter comment about he during the hour or two he keep I company i never yet meet one of those scientific gazaboo who do not think he be something more than mortal he growl i try to keep on good term with the old bone measurer but he vanity nearly turn I sick do you know what he tell I yesterday what i ask amuse at the youngster 's annoyance say that he might mention my name in the report of the expedition that he would send to some old research society in the state when i do not show any sign of elation he get offend so i guess i be cut out of the history he go grumble down into the cabin and i watch the ocean the barometer be low and out of the west a pack of fat black cloud swarm up from the horizon stack themselves one upon another till they resemble a huge pile of rounded boulder which a sudden puff of wind might bring topple down upon we the faint scout puff of air -- the devil 's breath of the poetical polynesian -- whine through the stay but the small wave that try to rise in expectation be clout back by the heavy oppressive atmosphere that iron out the ocean till one 's imagination picture it wait for the word like a strained runner on he mark it burst at last three violent blast rip over we like projectile and the song of the dead man be twang upon the strain rope _ the waif _ stop for a instant as if debate whether she would run or cower before the onslaught then she dip she nose into the mad lather that rise around she and plunge forward that jump seem to be a challenge to the storm it burst upon we in all its fury and the yacht become a tiny seesaw upon the murderous himalaya that rise around we great chunk of green water come hurtle over the rail thunder down upon we till _ the waif _ be bury in a boiling turmoil from which she would leap and shake herself only to be pull down again when the next sea fall upon we when she spring out of the lather those devilish snarl snaky wave spring after she slapping at she flank tear and bite at she like a pack of wolf there be a awful likeness to a wolf pack about storm wave when you see they all foam-lathered stretch out like a pack in full cry or watch they leap up as if they be try to see whether the unfortunate ship have be tear down by one of they band you begin to credit they with some sort of intelligence _ the waif _ be no poppycock yacht build to dodge about the solent and run for cowe if the wind blow a capful she have be build to hold she own with the hardest slamming sea that ever chase a shatter hull and it be lucky for we that she be the storm that come screech after we from way across the coral sea be one of those high-powered freak disturbance that juggle with lump of water like a vaudeville performer juggle with cheap crockery it take the top off those roller and pelt they at we and the wind seem to yell in triumph when the yacht be bury in the whirlpool in which she dive headlong all through the night we race before it and through the follow day _ the waif _ never pause for a instant in she mad race to the eastward the kanaka become demoralize with fear and i forget the trouble hang over the head of the girl and they father as i help newmarch drag the crew from they bunk to cut away the wreckage of the vessel i see a new side of the captain during those hour a very devil of energy take hold of he with the come of the storm and he become a human dynamo he pound the frightened crew unmercifully drag the scream islander back to they work by the hair of they head and heap upon they curse that be strange and blood-curdling that he be a good sailorman i have little doubt he handle _ the waif _ with skill and patience while the crew with roll eye and quiver lip be so terrorize by he wrath that they flee to do he bidding i have be wonder since the moment when he have order I to let go my grip of the kanaka in the f ` c ` stle if he be afraid that any disagreement between I and the knife-thrower would start trouble with the crew but from the way he haze the nigger during the storm i be convince that it be not through any fear of they that he order I to leave my assailant alone the conviction do not increase my love for he as i view the happen he be incline to shield the big brute who throw the knife simply because the offence do not appear to be one that merit punishment and this view be not please to my nerve it be on the second day of the storm that a little incident happen which be worth mention tonus the small fijian who have chant the song of black fernando 's hell be catch by a huge wave and pound hard against the cabin the mad turmoil of water sweep he nearly lifeless form into the scupper but before another comber could snatch he overboard i manage to reach he side and drag he into safety i forget the incident in the whirl of happening that follow but the fijian have a longer memory late that afternoon he be hold the wheel with soma the big kanaka who have jerk the knife at I and as i stop to peer at the binnacle he beckon I toward he that be I that sing he shriek as i put down my head i tell damn big lie you a ' miss herndon why i ask amuse at the peculiar manner in which he try to express he gratitude for the rescue of the morning big jacky tell I not say anything he scream he tell it to I one big secret all that talk about waterfall tell I not to tell any one you know why i glance at soma and find that he be strain he ear to catch the word the other be shriek and as i be more than suspicious of he i promptly close the conversation i 'll see you in the morning i roar the fijian nodded and i fight my way forward wonder as i clung to the rig what the pupil of the maorus have to tell I about the song the wind have cease somewhat on the morning of the third day but the snaky roller be still race after the fly yacht a watery sun peep out from between the drive cloud mass the ray glint through the head of the wave that curl menacingly as the battered yacht drive through they newmarch hail I from the poop when i come on deck and there be a peculiar look upon he scrawny feature as he address I do you know that nigger you rescue he ask toni yes what about he you do you heroic stunt for nothing he remark the fool can not be find so i guess he go overboard in the night the news come as a shock to I tonus 's last question that he have put as he cling to the wheel with soma have flash through my mind several time through the night he have ask it in a manner that insinuate that i might be interested in the reason why big jacky he companion on the wharf at levuka wish the whereabouts of the white waterfall to remain a secret and now he disappearance block my inquiry i feel annoyed with myself for not listen to what the fijian have to say at the moment he confess that he have lie and then the face of the listen soma come up before my mental eye soma be a person that i be begin to cordially dislike i turn to newmarch and fire a question at he do you think he be help overboard why no he say slowly why do you think that oh nothing i reply i think he narrow escape of the morning would have make he careful it be a few hour after this conversation that i have my first chance of speak to edith herndon since the moment we have run into the disturbance the girl poke she head out of the companionway and i hasten to assist she out on deck it be she first sight of the damage which the storm have do to the yacht and she give a cry of alarm as she look at the splintered spar and the cordage that crack in the wind like the whip of invisible devil oh mr verslun we be a wreck she cry not quite i say grip she arm to steady she as _ the waif _ take a header we have weather the worst of it and we be still sound the storm center have slip away to the north and we can count ourselves out of the ruction for the present she shapely hand clutch my wet oilskin as the yacht plunge from the back of a enormous swell and i be so busy note the beauty of the hand that i have no eye for the sallow face that peep from the companion leith 's bass voice rise above the noise of the wave and there be a angry note in it this be not a nice place for you miss edith he cry the girl half turn she head look at he for a second then without any intimation that she have hear what he say she turn again toward I and start to cross-examine I upon the amount of damage we have sustain i think that the white shapely hand tighten its grip upon my wet sleeve at the moment leith 's bass voice come boom to we ear and i bless the big brute 's interference for the thrill which i derive from the pressure of she finger upon the greasy coat but leith be not to be deny the cold stare instead of drive he back into the cabin only rouse he temper very cautiously he climb along the heave deck to the point where we be stand and clutch a rope he sway backward and forward immediately behind we miss edith he call the girl turn she head sharply well she cry this be not a proper place for you roar leith one of those sea be liable to come aboard at any moment and you might be wash away before any one could assist you edith herndon 's lip show the slightest trace of a smile you have better be careful too mr leith she retort mr verslun be hold on to I in case one of those old gray roller should make a sudden leap but you have no one to hold on to you a frown pass over leith 's face like a cloud shadow across a yellow plain he slacken he grip on the rope and lurch toward we you must go below at once he scream address the girl you father be too ill to look after you at this moment so the duty be mine there be danger here and i order you below he touch she shoulder with he big finger that resemble talon but the girl make a quick side movement and slip from he grip do not touch I she cry fiercely how dare you put you hand on I but leith 's temper be up at that moment and he be angry enough for anything he make a spring for the girl 's hand and i thrust my shoulder forward to bump he off _ the waif _ nearly stand on she end at that instant and she acrobatic feat combine with the push fling leith off he foot and send he roll ludicrously along the deck miss herndon give a little cry of alarm and spring for the companion-stair down which she disappear without take a glance at the brute on the wet plank leith pick himself up grip a loose backstay with he left hand and swing himself toward I strike out viciously with he free right hand when he come within hit distance the blow land on my shoulder and i return the compliment with a uppercut that jerk he from he swing rope and send he stumble backward against the rail the fall stun he for a few moment and he roll about in the wash then soma the kanaka who jerk the knife at I rush from the galley door and drag he to he foot the native steer he to the companionway where he stand for a moment glaring at I as if undecided whether to continue the fight or beat a retreat but the wild plunging of the yacht convinced he that the spot be not one where he figure to advantage so he stumble below i look around and see holman cling to the rig he boyish face wear a expression of extreme pleasure you be get wise he cry as he scramble toward I but do not think you have wallop he he 'll come back at you when he have a better opportunity of beat you up -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter v i make a promise the morning follow the unpleasant incident with leith break clear and sunny the pacific as if tire after its mad prank of the precede three day be a shimmering stretch of placid blue water and the shatter spar and loose cordage of _ the waif _ be the only reminder of the terrific storm that have sweep we before it captain newmarch set all hand at work to repair the damage and before midday we be bowl along under as much canvas as we could spread the storm be directly from the southwest have not carry we from we course and newmarch chuckle when he have take a observation we 'll strike it in the morning he growl what penrose island i ask no the isle of tear he answer sharply the isle of tear i repeat that be what i say he remark sourly and now you know as much as i know it be keep a little secret by the order of my employer but we be so close to the spot now that i do not think it will matter if i let the cat out of the bag and be it there that the professor will conduct he search i ask you have better ask that question of professor herndon he reply i know nothing about what they 'll do ashore he leave the poop before i have time to put another question to he and as i walk up and down i turn over in my mind the tiny morsel of information i have receive the captain 's secrecy be peculiar to say the least and as i reason that professor herndon know absolutely nothing of the island it be quite evident that the order prohibit newmarch from make know the exact destination of the yacht have come from leith it be not the first time i have hear of the isle of tear strange story float across the pacific concern the little islet east of the suvaroff group and out of the reticule of the mind i attempt to drag these story and piece they together during the minute that pass after newmarch have give I the information they be not pleasant story as i remember they at that moment the island have a past the mention of it bring hazy recollection to native -- recollection that be too misty to put into word but which the untutored mind connect with happening that be anything but pleasant and i recall a night at tonga pete 's place on the rue de rivoli at papeete when a sailor from a copra schooner in the bay who have be maroon upon the island by captain bully haye tell a wild weird story of unexplainable happening that he have witness during the two day and two night he have spend ashore holman come hurry upon deck as i be endeavor to remember all the story that the sailor have tell and the youngster immediately rush I with the news the captain have just tell I i say well leith have just give the information out in the cabin he cry they must have decide to give it out at the same moment but the professor i ask surely he know do you mean to say that he be ignorant of the fact that it be the isle of tear and not penrose island that we be make for holman laugh at my question you have not speak much to he verslun he could not remember the name of a place three minute he only know that there be archaeological treasure on this island we be go to and he do not care two cent about its name leith have tell he some tall story about the camp judge by the way the old man 's eye shine when he mention it yesterday he read I leith 's description of stone _ hamunga _ and thing that be suppose to have be build before julius caesar invade britain and he be pop-eyed with joy as he think how he 'll yank fame by the tail when he get on the ground and snapshot the affair gee i be glad i have not get a kink for digging up relic and dodge about place that go to smash thousand of year ago a vice like that be more expensive than the poker habit well newmarch say we 'll strike it early in the morning i say and then we 'll see whether you suspicion be correct i be infernally afraid they be snap the youngster i would not care ten cent about the brute only that the girl be aboard i feel sorry when i see he climb to he foot yesterday if you hit he again hit he with something that will crack he skull he be a devil verslun and before we be much older we will find it out i laugh at he gloomy foreboding and as miss barbara herndon come on deck at that moment he race away and leave I to my own meditation my thought be mixed i have pleasant and unpleasant one if leith be the scoundrel that holman suspect the two girl be in danger and now as we near the island where they would leave the yacht to accompany they father the clutch of fear be upon I on _ the waif _ i feel that i have some little power but on land more especially on the lonely island toward which we be head that feeling of protectorship which the sailorman have for he passenger would be lose if leith know the island and it be evident that he have visit it before any villainy that he contemplate would be hold in check till he be ashore and in command of the expedition and i would be powerless i recognize that holman 's fear be without solid foundation they be transmit through barbara herndon but i also recognize that the elder sister would hardly support the statement unless she have good grounds for she anxiety she woman 's intuition have brand leith 's motive in bring the professor into the island as bad and the sallow-faced giant could not erase the impression the actual reason for trickery be a matter of speculation professor herndon be wealthy it be he money that have fit out the expedition but how leith expect to benefit himself by treachery be more than i could tell still try as i would to fight off the impression that holman 's tongue have fix within my mind i be unable to alter the opinion i have form of the man the moment i meet he there be a atmosphere about the yacht that be unexplainable try as i could to find legitimate grounds for fear i could not the professor be a scientist who wish to study certain thing the whereabouts of which be know to leith apparently the professor be satisfy with the bargain he have make leith as the two girl have inform holman have call upon they father at the langham hotel in wynyard square sydney and after fascinating the old man with he story have present he credentials and make a bargain with he which result in the chartering of the yacht he former life be a mystery that he guard jealously from the probe which the girl have skilfully endeavor to use it be clear that he have spend many year in the island but that fact be not one that be generally put forward as a recommendation of good character the south sea hold a large percentage of the nimble people who manage to be in another spot when dame justice throw she lariat the law of the fringe have make curiosity a criminal offence and a new name cover more than charity i have have little chance of speak to edith herndon since the moment i come aboard but i determine after i have look at the matter from every side that i would ask she point blank if i could be of any assistance leith 's face be the only prop he put forward as a support to he claim of respectability and he face betray he my chance come early that evening a big tropical moon rise out of asia and spread a silvery wash upon the ocean professor herndon and he eldest daughter be lean over the rail but the moment i join they the old man inform we that he have to see to he scientific outfit so that everything would be in readiness for the landing on the follow morning and he hurry off and leave we together the girl do not speak for a few minute and i make no attempt to break the silence somehow i feel that she intuition have already tell she that i wish to speak about the happening of the morrow and she opening remark prove that my surmise be correct you will stay with the yacht i suppose she question i can not say i reply captain newmarch have not speak to I about the matter do you father intend to go far inland father have just tell I that the actual distance be not great but the travel be very hard it seem that it be only a few mile to the spot where mr leith say that father can see all the sight and obtain all the specimen he desire but those few mile will take we four day to travel there be all kind of obstacle in the way and you be not afraid i stammer you do not dislike the idea of go she lift she head and look I in the face the big amber eye shine softly in the moonlight i dread it she say quietly it be foolish to say so but -- she stop speak and turn she face away from I in the little silence that follow i hear the _ plop plop _ of the wave against the side of the yacht a native chant a samoan love song in the fo ` c ` stle but that and the soft whine of the pulley be the only sound that disturb the night we seem such a long way from civilization at that minute and a great pity for the girl 's plight give I sufficient courage to make a proffer of my service miss herndon i spluttered if i could do anything to help you please tell I i might help you if you wish tell I what you think be best if you stay with the yacht you can do nothing she murmur then you want I to go i cry you would like I to go with -- father and barbara and I she say softly mr holman be come and if you could come too -- i can i cry i will go with the party if you say so but if captain newmarch order you to stay with the yacht he can order away i splutter i be go where leith be go that be as long as leith accompany you and you father something move on the top of the galley as i put my resolution into word and i spring up quickly the moon make every inch of the yacht as bright as day yet i be not quick enough in my rush a tin pan knock down by the eavesdropper roll across the deck but the spy have flee some one be listen to we i explain as i return to the girl 's side i be sorry then that i ask you to accompany we she murmur i be drag you into we trouble mr verslun and it be not right hush i cry you trouble be mine just because you be a woman out on the very fringe of the earth where you can get no one else to help you bear they you see i can claim a right in this spot this be the jump off place of the world down here and a offer of assistance must not be refuse she stand in front of I a tall splendid figure the moonlight silver the pile mass of hair and give one the impression that she head be surround by a shine halo suddenly she put out she hand and take mine i accept you offer gladly she say softly you be very very kind mr verslun it may be as you say the jump off place of the world down here at the very outpost of civilization but the power that protect one in the crowded city be surely here as well good-night friend it be a hour after the time when miss herndon go below that i ask the captain 's permission to go along with the expedition he pluck he scrawny beard with a nervous hand as he stand stare at I what the devil do you want to go for he ask for the fun of the thing i do not know he mutter i 'll see leith he turn away and i walk for ` ard the beauty of the night be extraordinary the yacht seem to be veneer with a soft luminous paint that give we the appearance of a ghostly ship skimming over a ghostly ocean at the top of the fo ` c ` stle ladder i find a native stretch full length and sob mightily he wallop he head against the plank when i endeavor to get he upon he foot and the sob shake he frame what be the matter i ask toni toni toni he wail tonus he go tonus my brother all same come from suva now he dead i be sorry but it can not be help i say he should have be more careful the native lift himself from the deck and glance around fearfully satisfy that there be no listener he dry he eye and crawl upon he knee to the spot where i be stand he not wash overboard he whisper soma stick one knife in he then he tip he over I see he very much afraid when i ask night afore last he gasp captain see he do it very bad thing tonus my brother all same work one time suva holman join I when i relieve the captain late in the night i tell the youngster what i know about the disappearance of tonus who knife he he ask the big kanaka who pull leith out of the scupper when he fall yesterday holy smoke cry the boy i would like to get the strength of thing on board this boat why that big nigger be go to be the guide of the expedition on shore who say so leith point he out to the professor this afternoon answer holman i be talk to the old scientist at the time i whistle softly if soma be a henchman of leith 's it be clear to I why the captain have shield he the night he jerk the knife at I when i drop the pin upon he woolly head but why tonus have be put away be a mystery be it any good of attempt to convince the professor i ask not a bit snapped holman the girl have be implore he to turn back this last three day while we be stick in the cabin but he will not listen to they he be a maniac that be what he be he do not know what those two woman be suffer through he darned foolishness and if he do know it would not trouble he if you want the real extract of selfishness you must make a puncture in a scientific guy with a hobby and you can get as much as you want well i be go along to see what happen i say if leith refuse to accept I i be go just the same holman grip my hand -- grip it fiercely then he leave I hurriedly i tramped backward and forward as _ the waif _ sail steadily through the wave of glitter mercury a few day before when i be a occupant of the rathole in levuka life seem to be empty and cold but a wonderful change have come in those few day although i have not speak to edith herndon more than half a dozen time it appear to I that it be those few short conversation that have chase the loneliness and morbid thought from my mind she very presence stimulate I in a manner that i could not express and as i stare out across the moon-whitened ocean i start nervously at the thought which have spring suddenly into my brain it be a insane thought and i try to laugh it away edith herndon be as far above I as the moon be above the wave that be silver by she beam i picture myself lie like a beachcomber upon the pile of pearl shell when the strange chant of the maorus and the dead tonus concern the way to heaven out of black fernando 's hell have come to my ear and i bless the new influence which have come into my life my way to heaven lie in this direction i soliloquized and the quiver yacht go bound on as i allow wild dream to race unchecked through my brain -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter vi the isle of tear a sleepy samoan in the main cross-tree scream a message to the deck while the pink flush of the tropical dawn be still in the sky and _ the waif _ plunge through the water toward the island one after the other the member of the expedition come on deck leith stumble up when newmarch shout down the information and the big brute watch the tiny spot that come gradually nearer the professor dance up like a adventurous boy and he gurgle ecstatically as he peep over the rail while the two girl come up arm in arm and look in silence across the dawn-reddened water holman 's gaze travel from the island to leith and back again to the island as if he be try to trace a criminal connection between the two as the yacht draw closer a strange silence seem to fall upon the vessel the professor 's gurgle of joy die away slowly and none of the other seem incline to break the stillness the crew and the half dozen islander that leith have bring to carry provision and specimen be also silent they be group for ` ard but not a murmur come from they as _ the waif _ creep slowly ahead feel she way cautiously into the little bay on the north side of the island which leith have suggest to newmarch as a good anchorage the peculiar story that have go abroad concern the isle of tear be responsible for most of the wide-eyed look of wonder which the imaginative polynesian direct upon the shore the strange predicament in which they be place tie the tongue of the two girl the professor be think of the archaeological treasure while thought that one could only guess at prevent leith and holman from speak the island have a strange wild beauty that seem to throttle speech the underlie coral reef be of color that run from pure white to gorgeous crimson and the effect upon the water above they be wonderful to behold _ the waif _ seem to make she way over a floor of beautiful parquetry which mother nature have be construct for century chameleon-tinted seaweed stretch upward wave backward and forward like the hair of sea nymph hide in the crevice of the multi-coloured rock the vegetation on the shore be weird and wondrous the tree immediately near the edge of the bay be cover with riotous liana that loop themselves like python from limb to limb and from whose green mass blaze red flower appear at interval like watchful eye scarlet hibiscus and perfumed frangipannus be everywhere while climb jasmine try to cover up the black basalt rock in the foreground as if to hide everything that be ugly from the eye of the visitor the sweet intoxicate odour come out to we in greet yet the place seem to inspire we with a feeling of awe and mystery that become more oppressive as the yacht move lazily across the bay i glance at edith herndon at the moment the anchor plunge down into the bed of coral and the look of perplexed wonder upon she face startle I it look a nice place yet it feel a awful spot she murmur all those snaky creeper with they color flower seem to be hide something i understand she feeling regard the place that look of weird expectancy common to place that be cloak with a tremendous silence have grip the two girl and the yacht seem homelike when they compare it to the shore oh edith cry the younger sister i wish father would not go so do i dear murmur the elder girl but it be useless to attempt to persuade he to give up the quest but i hate the place cry miss barbara do not you oh no stammer edith bravely attempt to cheer the spirit of the younger girl you will not be lonely barbara mr holman and father and i will be with you and perhaps mr verslun will be in we company newmarch approach at the instant and squeak out a answer to the request i have make the previous evening i ask mr leith if you could go with he he say but he do not think you would be of any use he have all the help he require so you have better stay on the yacht there be a slight grin on he thin face as he impart the information and he merriment tickle I i have make up my mind without wait for leith 's decision and i be more pleased than annoyed at know that my presence be not desire with the party that go inland the anchor have hardly touch the bottom before leith start to transship the provision that be require for the trip across the island the sight of land seem to stir the sallow-faced giant out of the lethargy that have grip he on the way down from levuka he suddenly discover that the mantle of authority be upon he shoulder and he bully the island boy as they lower the store holman be right when he state that soma be the man that leith have pick as first assistant the big kanaka be place in charge of the other five carrier and he immediately imitate leith by shriek out order and strut about in a manner that be ludicrous professor herndon be bubble over with excitement the story which leith have feed to he continuously concern the remains of a extinct civilization have work he up to a pitch that border on insanity and it be pitiful to watch he as he make endless note in the bulky notebook i shall be know throughout the world inside three month he whisper to leith in less than that drawl the giant yes you be right snap the dream-fed scientist if everything be as you say we task will be a easy one be you ready edith barbara come along he climb down the ladder with a haste that be nearly he undoing as he let go he grip before the boat be directly beneath he holman save he from a duck but he solar topee which have a distinctly scientific look be soak in salt water before it could be rescue captain newmarch stand by with a look of unconcern upon he thin face as the two girl go over the side and he give a unintelligible grunt as leith follow within two hour after _ the waif _ have cast anchor the two boat contain the store and the ill-assorted explorer be make for a small promontory that stretch out like a green tongue into the sparkling water of the bay once on shore leith put soma and the carrier in the lead holman and the two girl next with himself and the professor bring up the rear and in that order they move across the little strip of white sand that glitter like diamond dust the heavy green foliage come out to meet they drop over they like a veil and leave we stare at the riotous creeper mass with the brilliant flower eye that appear to be watch _ the waif _ newmarch give a peculiar chuckle as he turn toward I when the party have disappear now mr verslun he cry we have plenty work to keep we busy for the week or so we will be here get about it the moment the boat return and keep the man on the jump i nod and he go below without another word leave I still stare at the spot where the explorer have dive into the leafy wall the strange loneliness of the place seem to clutch I hard at that moment and i mentally abused myself for not make a stronger protest against the whole affair but i know as i damned my own inactivity that protest would have be useless as far as the professor be concerned and the filial affection of the two girl would not allow the old ancient to wander off alone i have plan to allow the party a few hour ' start before i make any attempt to follow feel certain that i would be able to find the track and moreover i wish to catch up to the expedition at a point where leith would have no chance of verify the story i would tell to account for my presence the big brute would probably think i be lie when i tell he that newmarch have send I after he but the professor 's desire to push on would probably prevent he from make a effort to check my story by send a runner back to the boat and luck be with I at that moment as i rack my brain in the construction of a suitable excuse to account for my appearance my eye fall upon the professor 's camera that have be overlook in the hurry of departure and i spring upon it joyfully and hide it till the time have elapse know the importance which the old scientist attach to the photograph which he intend to take i know that he at least would reason that the captain have act wisely in send I in pursuit with the instrument and i trust that he gratitude would move he to get leith 's permission to allow I to remain with the expedition the party have be go some six hour when i slip over the side into the dory newmarch be below and only one of the crew be on deck i seize the oar and strike out for the shore but i have hardly cover twenty pace when the captain rush to the rail take one glance at I and then dash toward the companion-stairs i sense the motive in that mad dash for the cabin and i pull madly thought of edith herndon throng my brain and i drive the dory toward the promontory with every ounce of strength i possess to return to the yacht while she be in the eerie jungle-growth under leith 's protection would be worse than death and i do not pause for a instant when the captain 's squeaky voice hail I come back at once he shout be you come i bent my back to the oar and pull with every muscle strain the perspiration half blind I but one glance upward convinced I that i have sense the captain 's motive when i see he rush from the side he be stand on the poop take deliberate aim at I with a winchester rifle that he have take from the rack in he own cabin it seem a age before he fire the bullet miss the side of the boat by about three inch and i shriek my defiance the devil have my nerve on edge but the green tongue of land be close and i pull as never man pull before a bullet lodge in the stern of the boat another splintered the end of a oar and then the rifleman 's nerve must have get the better of he the succeed shot fall wide and i whoop like a madman as i drive the boat on to the green tongue of land spring out hastily i make a dash across the white strip of sand and dive into the moist creeper growth i lay there pant watch the yacht to see what newmarch would do it be impossible for he to leave the yacht to follow I but i guess that he would make a attempt to communicate with leith and i guess rightly i have not be five minute in the bush when a boat put off for the shore it contain three of the crew two tannese and the fijian that i have find mourn the death of tonus he all same brother who have work with he at suva they pull for the spot where i have leave the dory and here the fijian spring out while the other proceed to tow the dory back to _ the waif _ i surmise that tonus 's all same brother have be send to carry a message to leith and i lay in the bush wait as he race toward I cautiously he claw he way through the undergrowth and when he be certain that the creeper have completely veil he from the eye of watcher on the yacht he pick up a small flat stone from the ground draw a yachting knife from he belt and crouching on he heel start to sharpen the blade as he rub industriously he sing a weird tune in he native tongue round off each verse with five word in english that explain he industry the word be : now i 'll kill you soma and the chant be a poem of consolation to the spirit of the dead tonus assure it that the hour of vengeance be at hand and that soma would go to the great unknown the moment he get within reach of the yachting knife i poke my head from my hide place and the fijian turn quickly i think the captain tell soma to kill you brother i say softly if the captain do not tell he leith do kaipi kaipi stop sharpen the blade and fix he big eye upon I i not to speak to you he say kapitanus tell I not to i go catch up leith give he one piece of paper the kapitanus give I but soma i ask i kill soma when chance come mutter kaipi well we be of the same mind kaipi i say pleasantly soma be no friend of mine and i 'll help you as much as i can if you turn over the note which the captain give you and do just what i tell you otherwise kaipi i have a revolver and a knife be no match for a revolver the fijian consider the matter for a few moment he dreamy eye watch I the while at that moment duty be forget in the thirst for vengeance upon soma and the debate with he conscience be of short duration he pull a note from the fold of he pareo and toss it to I with a short laugh I not care about that he grin I catch soma that be all the note be exceedingly brief it read : the mate be follow you -- newmarch kaipus have return to the job of sharpen he knife in which i have interrupted he and at interval he assure the dead tonus that vengeance be only a matter of a few hour as far as i be concern the captain could not have choose a better messenger kaipi i say tear the note into small piece you have be send to help I find leith and the professor see i have the professor 's picture maker he forget it this morning and the captain send you and I to take it to he do you understand the fijian grinned try the edge of he knife blade with the ball of he thumb then spring to he foot and do not be in too great a hurry to fix soma i caution tonus 's spirit can wait a few day till you get a suitable opportunity now we 'll strike the trail kaipi grin again put he sharpened knife into he belt and plunge into the dense undergrowth the snaky moist liana make progress next to impossible they cling around we leg like live thing and i damned the professor 's idiotic craving for notoriety as we wade through the clammy creeper in search of the trail make by the party the prickly rope-like vine seem to be in league with the devil who be lead the aged scientist and he daughter into danger that make my brain dizzy as i attempt to dissect the possibility which imagination put forward at last we find the trace of soma 's handiwork with a axe and guide by these sign we hurry forward the ground rise gradually toward the center of the island where column of basalt loom like the tower of feudal castle against the pure venetian blue of the tropical sky but the sky be visible only for moment that be far remove from each other the crawl vine that overrun the tree make a impenetrable barrier against the sunlight and most of the time we be stumble along in a mysterious twilight that increase my nervous agony mass of rock of volcanic origin be thickly strew around and anything like fast travel be impossible the sun drop slowly toward the west and we have great difficulty in hold to the path the axe mark and the branch break by the carrier be really the only sign that we have to go by but the eye of the fijian be exceedingly sharp in detect the slightest evidence leave by the party we pass the spot where they have lunch and increase we speed in a endeavor to overtake they before nightfall the silence and unexplainable mystery of the place make I anxious to catch up with they before the darkness come down while hunger and revenge make kaipus move at a speed that be most unusual darkness come down like a suffocating blanket and we halt no go farther muttered kaipus better make fire and sleep catch um to-morrow i sit down while the fijian gather a pile of rotten wood but before he could set fire to the heap i be on my foot claw my way into the darkness in front from somewhere out of the inky night come the voice of edith herndon lift up in a little italian melody that i have hear she singing the night we leave levuka it seem to I that she suspect my near presence and that she be sing to guide I to the spot where the party have camp five minute afterward kaipi and i stumble into the circle of light round the fire and leith spring to he foot with a growl of rage what be this he cry who the devil give you permission to come here the captain send I i reply look straight at the giant as i fire the lie at he the carrier forget professor herndon 's camera and captain newmarch send kaipus and I after you leith 's muttering be drown by the scientist 's cry of joy as he take the camera from my hand and the big brute have time to recover himself before the professor have stop chatter i guess that he reason that it would be bad policy to show that he be angry at my arrival while the camera partly convinced he that i have tell the truth he surprise and the professor 's evident pleasure make I think it a opportune moment to put forward a request to stay with the party and i put my wish into word captain newmarch say that kaipus and i might go along if you and professor herndon have no objection i lie he think we would prove useful leith scowl angrily but the professor give a immediate assent to the request he short-sightedness prevent he from notice the frown which pass over the face of he partner but the sour look flee immediately the two girl express a desire to keep I in the party oh please let mr verslun come cried miss barbara it will make it ever so much more pleasant i be think of the stock of food growl leith as if attempt to explain he evident displeasure i 'll go on half measure and let mr verslun have the other half laugh holman and he can have some of mine cried miss barbara and mine murmured edith leith grin as he note the feeling of the party it would not be diplomatic to go against the wish of all and he know it with a wave of he hand he order kaipus to the fire where soma and the other five islander be sit and nod he head as a intimation that i could stay by the way he growl as i fall upon the plate of tinned salmon which edith herndon hand to I who be do the shooting this afternoon i be i reply i fire my revolver half a dozen time when we get off the trail and could not find we way back to it i think on account of the way that the path wound in and out that you party might be near the spot where we be bush he make no further comment and i breathe a sigh of relief unless newmarch send a second messenger to make sure that the news of my desertion would reach leith i feel that i be safe -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter vii the pit we be under way early on the morning after i join the party leith have the camp astir by daybreak and after a hasty breakfast we trail off behind soma and the carrier head directly toward the basalt tower that rise up in the middle of the island i for one be not sorry that we be make a early start all through the night i lay awake expect another member of the crew to rush into camp with a message from newmarch to leith and when we start on the trail i take particular care to lag behind the procession for the first few hour so that i would be in a position to intercept any diligent runner from _ the waif _ i take the first opportunity of tell holman of the manner in which the bilious englishman have hasten my departure with the winchester and the youngster 's face wear a perplexed expression that precious captain be leith 's partner in villainy he cry but we hand be tie the professor be simply crazy with delight over the thing that the brute be go to guide he to and all we suspicion do not amount to much when you put they together you see we have get nothing definite to go on at present all we can do be to watch and wait and be ready to act when the moment come soma and he five mate be leith 's pet you can bet you life on that but we have one ally in you friend kaipi the path of the precede day be smooth compare to the ground we climb over that morning there be no trail as far as we could see soma who be in the lead find he way by occasional mark that could only be visible to the eye of a native barbara herndon remark on one occasion that there be danger of we get lose but leith grin at the remark soma have be here more than once he reply what he do not know about this place be not worth know the path continue to ascend but the thick tropical growth do not lessen during the tramp of the morning leith walk with the professor who appear to be in a state of joy border upon hysteria while holman and i in the rear try to assist the two girl over the roughest section of the road i think as we scramble through impenetrable scrub and crawl over rocky pile that it be the strangest expedition that have ever set forth if leith be the wicked devil that we suspect he to be four person be risk they life to gratify the whim of a half-crazy scientist who be die for notoriety he would not be turn aside from he pursuit of the specimen which leith have tell he of he daughter would not desert he and they resolve have bring holman and myself we be blind automaton that the fame-seeking archaeologist be drag at he heel he do not consider the suffering of the two girl least of all do he think that holman or myself be do anything to safeguard he life or property he be blind to everything but the natural curiosity around he and he make frequent entry in the notebook that be to be he crutch to olympus leith do not allow I to remain long in the rear he call I up to the front and very politely ask I to help in hustle along the carrier who be incline to dawdle as the way grow rougher and although i would much rather have have the task of help the two girl i have to accept the position without demur leith be in charge and holman and i be only intruder who have on standing and whose food be pay for by the professor we halt at midday in a ugly-looking spot far up the shoulder of the mountain that we be climb and through a break in the tree we catch a glimpse of the pacific the ocean seem directly beneath we and yet as edith herndon express it we seem to be a thousand league away from it -lrb- illustration : we halt at midday in a ugly-looking spot far up the shoulder of the mountain -rrb- this horrible silence make I long for the clean sound of the wave she whisper as i roll a stone over to make she a seat this stillness stop one from speak do you know that barbara and i have not speak a word during the last hour we simply have not the courage to make the effort under the watchful eye of leith i endeavor to cheer she up while inwardly i curse the prattle old professor who chatter of the honor he expect as the reward of he discovery the affair be enough to bring tear to the eye of a man with a heart of stone i be just think we should have stop this business before it get this far mutter holman as he reach closer to get a light for he cigarette what should we have do i ask i do not know he growl we should have do something though pity we do not lose leith overboard with you friend tonus what be wrong now have anything happen no nothing have happen he reply i wish something would this silence be begin to put my nerve on edge but i be afraid to yell out for fear that i might wake something that have be dead for century do it strike you that way very much well it be the same with the girl mutter holman the stillness of the place have bring they ordinary conversational tone down to a whisper leith lurch across and interrupted we conversation get the boy go mr verslun he say we want to cross the vermilion pit while the light be good and it be hard go from here on we start forward up the boulder-strewn slope and with each step the difficulty of the ascent become greater i take a axe and help soma chop a path which would make it easier for the two sister but no matter what amount of trouble we take they find it a difficult matter to follow once goad into fury by leith 's attempt to hurry the girl when holman be assist they over a particularly rough stretch i turn upon the old scientist who be puff along with the native in the lead the half-insane ancient hear my outburst to the end stare at I through the thick lens of he glass as if i be some new kind of a bug whose appearance he wish to implant firmly within he mind science call for sacrifice he squeak if my daughter be heroine who wish to share my hardship in the pursuit of information that will be of great benefit to the world i fail to see what it have to do with you sir but they have no interest in you silly discovery i cry they be do this infernal tramp to look after you do you hear confound you sir he scream mind you own business and do not interfere with mine i choke down my wrath as leith come crash through from the rear and the old egoist flush and ruffle drop back to meet he evidently convinced of my insanity through my inability to appreciate he effort to prove that the skull of long-dead polynesian possess peculiar formation they be foreign to the islander of the present day it be about four o'clock in the afternoon when we begin to draw near the vermilion pit which leith have mention when he have urge haste at the midday luncheon the surroundings become more strange and mysterious with each step we take the basalt peak that we have notice from the deck of _ the waif _ be now quite close to we and they seem to move in upon we from both side the tree and liana become less numerous and the black rock come toward we in a sinister manner that conjure up thought of a dead something toward which the encircle ridge be guide we like the arm of a corral the place be fear-inspiring it have the unearthly appearance that make the imaginative mind of the ancient people the silent wood with devil and dryad the soft moaning of the pacific be bar out by the leafy barrier and we walk in a silence that be tremendous the ticking of we watch sound to we strained ear like the blow of a hammer and once when the professor sneeze mightily miss barbara give a scream of fear before she realize what have cause the noise the ascent become still more difficult the native puff under they load and holman rush angrily to the front and demand a halt on behalf of the girl struggle in the rear during the few minute that leith grudgingly allow they in which to recover they breath the youngster hurry up to the spot where i be busy fix the load of the native and in a nervous whisper he ask my opinion of the route where the dickens be we go he cry this be the most eerie-looking patch of country that i have ever see in my life leith say that we have to reach the vermilion pit before the sun go down i reply i guess it be somewhere at the end of this staircase that we be try to climb oh gee cry the boy say this game have get those two girl scare to death there be something wrong with the place verslun my skin feel it the island look as if it have be leave too long by itself and i be begin to think that all those rock and tree be watch we and wonder what we want here that be how it feel to I from the moment i have leave _ the waif _ and i have try vainly to overcome the feel the island seem to resent the appearance of human being it possess a personality through be too long by itself it have wrap itself round a dead past and we be fill with the awe which suddenly strike the unimaginative globe trotter who wander into the cool recess of a hindu temple and i be of the same opinion as holman regard the tree and rock trader in the lonely spot of the pacific have go insane through become convinced that the mountain and the tree be watch they movement and the tree and rock upon the isle of tear strike I as possess a watchfulness that smack of the supernatural i thought of the story which the sailor tell in the caf chantant at papeete just then and i be incline to give it more credence than i have at the moment he narrate it but i try to rally holman so that he would cheer up edith herndon and she sister you be like a old woman i growl go back to the girl and make they laugh over some funny story instead of get nightmare about the scenery why this place remind I of a real pretty bit of scenery near my home town in maine of course i lie when i say that you could not find any scenery like that outside the tropics that place be queer there be not the slightest doubt about that i recall as i stumble along how a trader at metalanim in the caroline island have swim out to we schooner when we be down there the previous year and how the poor devil have tell old hergoff the captain that a chatak tree at the back of he hut have begin to make face at he and i begin to understand the complaint that have grip that trader as i climb along by the side of the puff islander he have be jam up too close against a personality when a place have be too long by itself as holman have remark it cultivate a strength that try the nerve of a explorer more especially if it be situate near the equator place like papua the caroline island part of borneo and the never never country in inland australia seem to possess a fist that attempt to push you off when you endeavor to bring the atmosphere of civilization into a silence that have be unbroken for century holman go back to the sister and we move slowly forward the basalt rock come closer show plainly through the break in the liana that grow less thickly on the higher slope the creeper fall away slowly as if they have do the work they be require to do and before we realize it we be walk between two natural wall of rock about eighteen foot high above which the sky look like a strip of blue paper that rest upon the marvellously even top of the barrier the professor be gurgle joyfully as we tramp through that miniature caon he be bump up against new wonder at every footstep and he stumble continuously as he endeavor to jot down he impression in the fat notebook the professor feel nothing mysterious about the place he have the bullet-proof skin of you cold analyst who yearn eternally for fact wonderful geological formation he chatter my friend professor hanlaw of oakland would enjoy a glimpse of this spot a geologist could spend a lifetime here leith 's sallow face be disturb by a grin as he listen to the old science-crazed ancient disburse information regard the formation of the rock it trouble I little at that moment whether feldspar and augite be the two largest component and i know that holman and the two girl be not interested we know that the place be ugly and sinister but feldspar and augite do not give it that look the height of the wall increase as we advance we be in a narrow roadway scarcely more than twelve foot across while on each side rise the nearly perpendicular rock that block we view of the country immediately beyond the ground beneath we foot be cover with small bit of lava from the crevice of which the moist flabby leaf of the nupu plant stick up like fat green finger as we stare ahead we note that the road seem to dip suddenly as if the highest point of the island be reach at that spot and the prospects of a walk upon a down grade be cheer after the stiff climb as we near the place soma who be walk about ten pace in front of the carrier slacken speed and the islander drop back till leith and the professor lead the procession leith halted and beckon to the two girl and holman who be some distance in the rear hurry up he cry you 'll get the sight of you life in a few moment what be it gurgle the professor leith grin as the scientist dip he lead pencil into he open mouth so that he would be able to dab down first impression the moment he turn he thick lens upon the wonder you 'll see in a moment reply the big brute as he walk slowly forward and just as he speak we do see a ridge of bright vermilion come up suddenly about one hundred foot from the point where the road seem to dip and we walk forward wonder what lay between the spot where the track end and the bright barrier of rock that appear to rise higher as we approach the end of the trail we seem to sense the approach of something that chill and yet attract the place possess a devilish fascination it seem to repel with its very uncanniness and yet i be aware that i be imitate holman in thrust forward my head in a endeavor to see what fill the space that be hide from we eye the desire be soon satisfied fifteen pace bring we to a point that leave the strange curiosity naked to we eye the vermilion wall thirty yard in front of we form part of the side of a enormous circular crater and we stand spellbound as we pull up within a few foot of the ledge and look into the fearsome depths beneath lady and gentleman drawl leith look around at we with the air of a cheap showman spring a novelty upon a gaping mob you be on the edge of the vermilion pit the greatest wonder between penang and the paumotus -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter viii the ledge of death i suppose that leith be not far wrong when he give that place the credit of be the most wonderful spot in polynesium none of we feel inclined to contradict he as we stand near the lip of the crater and gaze into it the thing appal we it look as if some fiend have bore it between those barrier of black rock as a trap for man and beast the entire inner wall probably from the action of intense heat upon a peculiar kind of rock be of a bright vermilion near the top gradually change into darker shades as the eye follow they deeper and deeper till the outline be lose in the depths of the mighty cauldron the inky cloud which seem to heave like black mass of cotton wool far down in the abyss leave the imagination to perform acrobatic feat as it attempt to picture the possible depths that lay below the thing be weird terrible fear-inspiring it look like a mighty crucible in which infernal thing might have be manufacture in the day when the world be take shape the ray of the westering sun beat upon the side directly opposite we point of observation and the color seem to leap from the rock it glow in a manner that be indescribable sudden flash come from it as if the vermilion mass be stud with blaze carbuncle but the fascinating beauty of the part that be expose to the ray be in violent contrast to the cold depths where the mind picture a body fall through league of space for about five minute no one speak the awful suddenness with which the thing have appear in we path throttle conversation a inner self connect the pit with the singular feeling of depression which have grip we the moment we land upon the island and we stand breathless wonder stupidly how we have sense the vermilion-lined horror into which the path lead it be the professor who break the silence the momentary awe which he experience when the strange freak of nature spring up before he eye be dispel by the vanity which prompt he to air he knowledge concern the cause of the vivid color which seem to radiate from the wall he prattle upon the effect of heat upon mineral till he make we dizzy and holman break in upon he chatter with a question that he fire point blank at leith but what do we climb up here for ask the youngster do we come for the view alone leith grin as he survey the questioner no we do not come for the view he answer it happen to be on the way to we destination holman look around at the basalt wall that hem we in on both side and then glance at the pit in front but we can go no farther he say leith 's smile spread across he ugly flat face you be too young to know everything he sneer the youngster 's eye open as he look again at the circular pit with its brilliantly tint side the answer perplex he and he wait anxiously for a explanation but how can we he ask leith stand for a moment before reply then he move closer to the edge of the crater and point down the road be directly beneath you he remark if you come closer to the edge you can see it holman glance at I in amazement and move by the one impulse we step toward the ledge the rim of the vast pit at the point where leith be stand be compose of porphyry of a dark-green shade and as we near the edge we notice that this have be wear to that peculiar velvety smoothness that one notice on the pillar of indian temple where the sweaty hand of million of worshipper have help in the polish process through unnumbered century leith notice that we glance be direct upon the peculiar polished portion of the rim and he grin broaden you will not be the first to go over on to the track below he drawl if i have a dollar for every man who slip over here since the world begin i would not bother with specimen for american and european museum see the ledge be directly beneath and it lead away to the right we stretch out we neck and look and i try to thrust back the exclamation that come to my lip directly beneath the polished part of the rim and about four foot below it be a ledge barely three foot wide and this narrow path wound away to the right and disappear through a cavernous opening in the brightly tinted wall of the crater the ledge be bare and unprotected polish to the same velvety smoothness as the spot on the rim near which we stand and when one look at it and then let he eye glance over the infernal depths that be immediately beneath the brain reel with thought of the danger to which a climber would be expose while make he way along it to the cavern in the wall holman take a great breath of air and turn savagely upon leith what sort of a fool game be you up to he cry what do you mean leith 's lower jaw come forward menacingly you have better hold you tongue he roar if you do not i 'll -- i 'll -- he stop and glare at the young fellow a murderous expression creep over he sallow face the half-voiced objection to the route have stir all the sleep devil in he and the big stubby finger crooked as if certain they would be call upon to grip holman 's throat you 'll do what ask the youngster coolly i 'll bundle you back to the yacht scream the giant you have be allow to come on this trip through the good nature of professor herndon but you must not think you have any voice in the direction of affair holman do not reply the danger of the path over which it be evident that leith intend to take we daze he and he look at I as if ask confirmation of he opinion but the young lady i inquire look at leith do you expect they to go down on to that path i do not expect the young lady to do anything against they inclination he answer blandly they have come with the expedition through no urge from I regard the ledge there be absolutely no danger and it be the only path by which we can reach the interior of the island soma go over the rim and show they edith and barbara herndon with they father move up closer to the edge as the grin kanaka step forward to obey leith 's order he walk quickly to the polished porphyry slab move cautiously to the extreme rim then turn he back on the crater he drop upon he hand and knee and lower himself down till only he grin face appear above the top we creep closer and watch he walk along the ledge toward the cavern apparently unaffected by thought of the death which a slip of he foot would bring upon he return to the spot beneath the polished slipping-off place he put he muscular hand into two cleft in the slab above and draw himself up on to the solid earth no danger he cry all boy go over here before they could call themselves man that long long time ago the professor grab he notebook as he hear the explanation and he immediately proceed to deluge the kanaka with question what be that he squeak you say all the boy have to climb over there that be so grinned soma this place make 'em test young boy go over this quick he make plenty good fighting man feller go over slow he no good the professor 's pencil move quicker than the pen of a court stenographer the kanaka 's remark have bring he much copy and the danger of the path be forget as he jot down the information and they go over here he cry he eye wide open as he gaze at the edge of the crater right over here grin soma see rock mighty slippery here all boy ' hand and foot do that polish it mighty fine but surely this test be not carry on at the present time cry the scientist when be this wonderful custom in force about the time that christopher columbus be paddle to america reply leith there be no native on the isle of tear now soma be speak of a time when these island be inhabit the professor gurgle like a drown mule this be a most interesting morsel of information he murmur hand I my camera barbara i wish to take a snapshot of the place the delay irritated leith but he keep he temper in check while the professor fuss and focus to get a good view of the spot the old fool should be in a padded cell growl holman he be so busy digest that tale that he be not think of the danger of this path i be go to speak to he aside i hope you have better luck than i have i whisper i bully he as we be climb the slope and i believe he complain of I to leith he see a mental picture of himself with bay leave on he brow and he would not consider the nerve of twenty daughter i be right in my prophecy when holman approach the old maniac he ruffle up like a angry porcupine and he screech out he opinion concern people who would not mind they own business you be the second person who have kindly inform I what i should do he exclaim and who be you sir you have no standing with this expedition this be a scientific exploration party but it seem to I that a number of busy-body have push they way into it i shall ask mr leith if he can not stop this interference leith listen till the professor have finish speak then he turn savagely upon holman i have give you one chance he roar and you do not seem to profit by it now i be not go to speak again if i have to tell you to keep you finger out of this pie on another occasion you 'll go back to the yacht and you 'll go back without provision do you understand the youngster be not lack in courage and he stand up boldly as the bully scream out he threat i will not go back he say quietly at least i will not go back alone leith 's big finger crooked ominously as he glare at holman but edith herndon prevent the conflict that be imminent mr holman be only concerned about we safety she cry step in front of the youngster he think that the path be dangerous for woman and it be on that account he protest leith recover he temper with a effort it be not dangerous he drawl we will put a strong rope under the arm of each so that it will be impossible for a accident to happen soma will go first with one of the other boy and they will guide every one into the opening once through there the path lead into a valley in the center of the island and the road be perfectly safe edith herndon look at she sister as soma unwind the strong manilla rope which he have carry from the yacht and they exchange glance that show clearly the terror in which they view the journey across the ledge leith frown as he glance toward the pit the color be fading from the brilliant side as the sun sink lower and the inky cloud that seem to heave far down in its mysterious depths fight they way slowly upward as the invade sunbeam be drive out it become more terrifying as each moment pass leith seem to recognize this and he turn upon the professor if we do not get down in half a hour we will have to postpone it till the morning he exclaim i do not look for a hitch like this i tell you that there be not the slightest danger and the young lady will be just as safe upon that ledge as they be up here the professor turn to the two girl as he close he camera the mad hunger for notoriety evidently blind he to the danger which would have be perceptible at any other time and holman 's remark have not improve he temper come come edith he entreat we must get along you hear what mr leith say there be no danger a rope will be put around you waist and a accident will be impossible the younger girl take a glance at the terrifying abyss and shrink back to edith 's side wait till the morning she whisper what be that ask the professor barbara want you to wait till the morning reply edith i think it will be better this light do not make the place look attractive leith move he big hand in a manner that show he be willing to wait till the follow day and barbara herndon give a little gasp of relief soma coil the rope that he have lay out in expectation of a immediate descent and the whole party move back about thirty yard from the obstacle in we path as i analyze my own feeling on turn my back upon the spot i feel that barbara herndon be not alone in desire to make the trip when the wholesome sunbeam be pour into the shadowy cauldron -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter ix into the valley of echo holman and i have sit up late discuss the vermilion-lined crater on the night we halt upon its brink and it be leith 's voice that rouse we in the morning he show no sign of resentment over the difference with holman on the precede afternoon and he attempt to joke with barbara herndon as we make a hasty breakfast i hope you sleep well he grin i do not she reply i have dream of that place and they be perfectly horrid dream well dream do not amount to much he reply and this sunshine will soon make you forget they the sunshine or probably the night 's rest have a wonderful effect upon the nerve of the younger girl and she view the crater with much more composure than on the previous afternoon soma have the rope in readiness when we approach the edge and together with another carrier he slip down upon the slippery pathway and with head above the rim grin a invitation to the party to follow he example now who go first ask leith i have settle that matter with holman as we sit smoke the night before and i step forward while the youngster grip the rope with kaipus and the other four carrier we have decide that i should go down to the ledge to assist the two girl to the cavern while he should stay above ground to make certain that no hitch would occur while they be be lower that place be not so bad when you turn you back upon it after the rope have be adjust i crawl back carefully till my toe hang over the edge then thrust my hand into the two small crevice in the rock i slip over feeling at the same time that peculiar sensation in the pit of the stomach that one get when a elevator drop about six floor at a fast gait i be perfectly satisfy that a critical examiner reasoning on soma 's theory of courage would not have mark I down as a great fighter by witness the careful manner in which i make the descent i do not attempt to look at the gulf beneath I either not that one could be ignorant of its existence every inch of skin seem to be yell out the information to my brain but i keep my chin up and try to ignore the black depths which chill I whenever i allow the mental photograph of the place to rise up before my vision the professor follow I over the edge and be guide by soma to the opening in the cavern leith come next and when he land upon the smooth path he stand directly underneath the slip off spot with the evident intention of remain there to assist the two girl when they be lower down the post be one that holman have assign to I as we talk the matter over on the previous evening and the moment leith show no inclination to leave the spot i start toward he from the mouth of the cavern where i have step to allow the professor to pass I by the big bully immediately notice my movement and he wave he hand as a signal for I to go back but i be come i snap what for for the fun of the thing i shout and at that moment i forget the pit in my anxiety to reach the spot before edith herndon be lower over go back at once roar leith i will see to the safety of the lady i be close to he at that moment and i return he angry glare i be go to do that i cry if the devil himself order I out of the way leith look like the devil at that moment he sallow face seem to heave as if a disturbed emotional center be immediately beneath the flabby cheek and he curse in a undertone as edith herndon slip from the edge and swing for a moment above the ledge before she manage to get she footing leith attempt to take she arm as she foot touch the unprotected path but the girl though unnerved by the ordeal shake off he big claw and with she hand clasp mine i lead she across the short but dangerous ledge of rock that lead to the opening in the wall i feel strong enough to fight a dozen devil like leith at that moment the trust manner in which the dear girl have give she hand into mine confer upon I a strength which the crusader of old feel surge through he body when he consecrated sword blade be deliver into he hand i return in time to render the same help to miss barbara herndon while leith still remain upon the path he manner suggest that he have discover something humorous in the situation holman follow miss barbara and then come the islander who scramble over the ledge with that utter disregard for safety noticeable in the action of the unimaginative savage holman 's face seem to have alter during the precede thirty minute the ready smile which i have first notice when he awaken I on the wharf at levuka be go and a set defiant look have take its place the happening of the day before or the possible foreboding concern the immediate future have change he from a boy to a man soma stand at the mouth of the cavern as we pass through and he grin at the professor the kanaka have discover that the professor place a monetary value upon he information regard the long-dead past and he be ready to contribute to the contents of the fat notebook whenever the opportunity occur all good people in this party he cry that be mighty plain the professor dive for he lead pencil he have a scent for copy that a new york reporter would have envy how be that soma he splutter wizard man say so grin the kanaka wizard man tell much truth but what do the wizard man say they say that only the bad boy can slip answer soma no good man either big hole just for bad people that what witch doctor say long long time ago they call it ledge of death the professor 's pencil race madly across the paper and holman look back at the black depths with a grim smile upon he clean-cut feature i suppose there have be exception he remark quietly there be exception to every rule and i suppose a occasional bad egg escape a fall into this abyss in spite of the wizard man 's prophecy leith look up quickly and he flush angrily when he find that the young fellow 's eye be upon he barbara herndon give a little hysterical laugh and the professor stop write and look around inquiringly as if he be in doubt whether he have miss something of importance what be it he inquire i do not hear it be nothing reply leith in he slow drawling voice holman suggest that the word of the wizard man might not be infallible and lest we have some one who run the gauntlet under false color we have better move on so as to keep the exception out of danger the cavern into which we pass from the slippery ledge do not lead into the interior of the mountain as one would be incline to think after view it from the top of the crater we have hardly traverse it for more than sixty yard when we be once again in the bright sunlight in what appear to be a deep wide valley in the center of the island the basalt cliff surround the place on every side and although we have great doubt regard leith 's veracity we feel inclined to accept he word that the path by which we have come be the only one by which we could reach the spot where we stand the circle of black rock above the top of the highest tree though indescribably beautiful be strangely repellent in they weird conformation they strike we as the wall of a prison from which the only way to liberty lay across the path in the crater the tree -- ebony chatak dakua and sandalwood -- grow here in greater number than we have meet they on the first day while the lawyer-vine and thorny creeper rival the devilish mesh that have hold we back as we climb the slope to the vermilion pit like green serpent they cover the treetop and as we strike forward in the same order as we have march on the first day the solemnity of the place be more apparent than ever it appear that nature for some reason of she own have make the place difficult of access and that we invasion be something that the tree and vine protest against but in spite of the strange melancholy of the place the two girl be in much better spirit than they have be on the previous day the successful passage over the ledge have bring about a reaction and a remark of holman 's cause barbara herndon to laugh with all the spontaneity that be noticeable upon _ the waif _ the effect of that ripple of laughter be startling the sound rebounded from the rocky cliff cannon against the barrier opposite and then bounce backward and forward till the whole atmosphere of the valley seem alive with the laughter of sprite for quite five minute we stand listen then the silence chase the last faint echo out across the cliff and we breathe again it be the valley of echo say leith the cliff throw back the sound in a marvellous manner i 'll not laugh again not in this spot murmur barbara herndon those noise chill my blood in spite of a blaze sun we find the air unpleasantly cool in the shaded spot as we struggle slowly through the undergrowth the moist flabbiness of uncommon tropical plant startle we whenever the leaf brush against we face and hand while the constant pop of the green pod of the nupu the sound resemble nothing so much as the groan of a person in extreme pain do not have a cheer effect upon the party the professor be the only one who seem to be actually enjoy himself and even he joy be temper by a malignant fate while endeavor to dot down some information tender he by soma he have trip upon a vine that be in wait for such a opportunity and he skin he nose badly upon a project rock but rock or vine would not dampen the professor 's ardor he see himself upon a pedestal that he would build out of the polynesian lore and the relic which he would collect with spartan fortitude he would not allow the expedition to halt for one moment while the injured nose be be attend to and he take up the interrupted matter with soma before the blood have be staunch kaipi work himself close to I just before midday and with one eye upon soma and the other five carrier whisper a message soma much friend of big man how do you know i question talk to he out back of camp last night he murmur I make believe sleep I watch i think i kill he to-day kaipi i whisper if you wait a little while i promise you that you 'll have you revenge for tonus 's death you watch soma and the other and when the time come you can give he all he deserve if you stick a knife into he here leith would shoot you kaipi nod he head and trudge forward as soma come sidle toward we the fijian 's desire to get revenge for he all same brother 's death be something that might be to we advantage later on and i look upon kaipi as a staunch ally in the event of trouble we eat we midday meal in the sombre silence and again plunge forward the appearance of gayety which barbara herndon have try to assume after we have leave the vermilion pit have pass away and once again there be the look of pathetic helplessness upon the face of the two girl during the luncheon holman and i endeavor to make conversation but the thought of both be upon they surroundings and they answer question with a effort the prison-like appearance of the valley and the utter absence of sound both of bird and insect life have a depressing effect upon they nerve holman 's face show that the mental suffering of the two sister have work he into a decidedly unfriendly state of mind toward the professor and the big brute who be lead the old scientist on the mad hunt and another quarrel be barely avert during the early afternoon leith suggest that edith herndon should walk beside he so that he might assist she over the rough part of the way and in the conversation that ensue the youngster assert that the girl be in better company when she be walk with she sister and himself leith 's voice rise to a roar as he make another threat regard what he would do if the youngster do not hold he tongue but holman be defiant and a immediate conflict be only avert by the tact of edith herndon the afternoon close in with we still tramp on the blood-red sun slip hurriedly toward the basalt barrier that encircle the valley and as i glance at the cliff the picture of the creepy ledge that be we only way back to the outer world be continually in my mind the knowledge that the velvety polish upon the block of porphyry be bring there by the hand of thousand who have once people the island or visit it from the adjacent group be not provocative of mirth and i know that the feeling that they be journey in a place that have be of special veneration in long past century be produce a depressing effect upon the two girl as the tropical twilight fall upon the valley we come to one of the strange stone structure that be to be find in the tongan and cook group and which have puzzle explorer who have seek in vain to find a reason for they construction or a explanation of the method by which a savage people lift the huge block of rock into position the one that suddenly appear before we be situate on a small slope that be free from tree and creeper and as it stand there black and massive one could fancy it part of the ruin of karnak instead of a relic leave by a people that be much below the intelligence of those who raise the wonder in the land of the nile the four support pier of stone be about four foot square and fully fifteen foot in height while the immense flat rock that be lay upon they be more than twelve foot in length and breadth with a six-foot thickness it be moss-grown and gray but the support pillar have not deviate one inch from the perpendicular although the weight upon they be tremendous the bed of coral rock on which they rest have prove a reliable foundation and the singular structure have scoff at time the professor start a lengthy discourse on sacrificial altar the moment we halt range from stonehenge to toluca in search of comparison but we be too tired to give it much attention holman remark in a whisper that soma could probably outpoint the professor if it come to a array of fact concern the probable use of the gigantic table and when i glance at the kanaka as he stop to listen to the scientist 's discourse i feel inclined to agree with the scoffer soma have a intelligence that lift he above he class and i be convince that many of the professor 's surmise cause he secret merriment -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter x a midnight alarm i think that professor herndon be the only person in the company who be quite contented with the day 's doings on that evening when we camp near the table of stone the polished slide and the ledge along which we have pass to the cavern stir he imagination concern the wonder that be before he and he convince himself that he have the god of he ambition by the heel the fat notebook be make the repository of countless surmise regard the period at which the ledge be in active use as a test for courage and the stone structure that loom up immediately beside the camp be tag with countless supposition regard its use and its probable date of construction soma gather in some easily earn shilling by rake he mind in search of tradition and retail they to the scientist by the light of the fire he make magazine price for tale that he spin from he fertile brain and the professor could hardly write fast enough in the excitement bring about by the discovery of so much historical knowledge it be wonderful he cry pause for a moment to polish the thick lens of he glass upon the end of he silk coat the chance of enlighten the world upon this subject be one that i would not have miss for a million dollar the dollar for I murmur holman i do not think the old world care three cent about anything that happen a thousand year ago in this patch the professor adjust he glass and turn they upon the doubter for the space of three minute but holman be blissfully ignorant of the look which the angry archaeologist favor he with the youngster be watch the firelight upon the face of miss barbara herndon and he thought be probably in a dream-fed future instead of a dismal past leith sit silent and gloomy he head pillow against the trunk of a maupei tree he face in the shadow of he hat which he have pull down over he forehead the supper have be eat with little conversation the professor be the only one who show conversational power of any note with the notebook already partly fill he feel certain of a niche in the pantheon of fame and he could not resist a desire to prattle childishly about the sensation which he discovery would cause it be a terrible thing for a man to get the applause craving in its worst form it be liable to make he do thing which no craving for treasure would allow he to do no matter how badly he desire the tempting gold the girl retire early and soon afterward leith wrap himself up in a blanket and lay down at the foot of the tree the professor at last become tired of firing question at the wonderfully well-informed soma and the kanaka find that the market for legend be not as good as it be in the early part of the night retreat to the other fire where kaipus and the fire carrier be slumber the heavy silence that come in the night to the outpost of the world fall upon the place like a cold hand at that moment a moon that appear to have a pellicle across it like the film upon a dead man 's eye peep over the barrier of black rock -- peep over as if it wonder what we be do in that god-forgotten quarter sudden puff of wind rustle the leaf of the maupeus and flee hurriedly and from somewhere in the coral rock one of those red-striped lizard that be sometimes find in the rocky part of the caroline send he unearthly _ shik-shuck _ into the stillness where one fancy it a little projectile of sound crushed in its effort to pierce the tremendous silence of the night one 's imagination picture the place where there be light and music the tinkle of glass and the laughter of man and woman and the wilderness suffer in the comparison coral atoll with wave palm tree be delightful spot when one read of they when seat in a comfortable armchair in a snug library but the real island come down heavily upon the nerve-centre when night fall upon the spot then the fringe dweller feel that he be a outcast from the warm place of the world where man and woman meet in social intercourse holman who have be stare in silence at the fire for some twenty minute turn toward I after the professor have retire sleepy ask the youngster worse than that i muttered let 's turn in the turn in be a easy performance we lay down on the pile of leaf which the carrier have scrape together pull a rug over we and in spite of the surroundings i be soon fast asleep it be holman 's fist that disturbed my slumber it come with some force against my short rib and i sit upright the moonlight make it possible to see across the valley while every object around the camp be clearly outline holman be sit up on he leafy bed and i put a question breathlessly as i jerk myself upright what be up do not he say that this place be uninhabited ask the youngster yes i answer why well some one have just push he head and shoulder up above that stone table whisper holman he put he head up look across at we for about five minute then dodge quickly back you be not dream dream rot i have not close my eye since we retire i throw off the rug and look around leith lay under the maupei tree in the same position as we have see he in at the moment i lay down near he the professor snore dismally probably dream dream of the greatness that would be thrust upon he in the near future no sound come from the tent that sheltered the two girl but a combination of curious nasal sound rise from the spot where the native be sleep around they fire it might be one of the nigger whisper holman let we see we steal silently across the intervene space and crouching in the shadow count the sleeper there be seven the prowler that holman have see upon the top of the stone structure be evidently a outsider and the knowledge bring no pleasant feeling leith have assure the professor on several occasion that the island be uninhabited yet it be quite possible that native from the adjoining group have visit it during the period that elapse since he last visit yet we feel that it be no stray visitor from another island that have peep over the top of the massive table and it be with a suspicious eye upon the sleep leith that we creep quietly over the coral rock toward the tremendous stone pier of the structure that rise like a monster gateway against the gray sky the atmosphere of that place be indescribable we seem to be in the midst of relic that be older than the pyramid the temple of luxor may seem impressive by moonlight but the knowledge we possess of thebe in its glory somewhat modify the awe which we would feel if we know nothing of the people who have raise the great monument in the city of amen-ra and holman and i know nothing of the dead race that erect the mighty stone table on the clear slope which by its construction give evidence of a knowledge of mechanic of which the present-day polynesian be entirely ignorant i recall the nan-tauch ruin and the tomb of the mysterious chan-te-leur king ola-sipa and ola-sopa in the caroline the _ tolma _ and the _ langi _ of the marshall and gilbert group and i wish the professor anything but pleasant dream the place seem wait for the return of its dead the scenery possess that singular expectancy that compel one to turn around every few moment to convince one 's self that a unfriendly watcher be not immediately in the rear still keep in the shadow we circle the camp till we be in front of the stone table but just when i take a step into the moonlight space before it holman grasp my arm and draw I back look he gurgle look there he be again all doubt concern the youngster 's previous observation be sweep away at that moment a head and shoulder rise suddenly above the black line of the immense flat stone remain there for the space of three minute then drop back so that we could not see it from the position in which we stand take the two front pillar whisper holman i 'll watch the two back one come on we dash across the open space the youngster rush to the rear while i run to the front column it be impossible for any one to descend unless we see he and with nerve on a tension we walk around the huge support and watch anxiously for the midnight watcher to descend we must have remain on guard for twenty minute or more but there be no sign of the spy around we the massive structure cast a patch of velvety shadow but not the slightest sound come from above holman tire of the inactivity and step across to where i be stand i be go to climb that chestnut tree and see if the beggar be still there he murmur you stop here till i take a observation he dart across to the big pacific chestnut and climb hurriedly while i walk round and round the square pillar and strain my ear for the slightest sound that would give a hint that the person on the roof of the mysterious table be prepare to descend a low whistle from holman pierce the silence and i answer come up here he cry softly he be give we the slip i climb the tree to the branch where the young fellow sit await I from he position he have a clear view of the top of the big table and as i reach he i look through a opening in the thick leave the top of the stone be empty do you think he slip down while i be climb the tree ask holman i be certain he do not i answer it would have be impossible we stare at the stone in silence the top be cover with short moss that have gather there through the century and instead of be flat as we have surmise there be a noticeable slope so that the part that be directly behind the camp be fully two foot higher than the rear this be the only peculiarity in its construction and although we sit in silence stare at its moss-covered surface we be utterly unable to put forward the slightest supposition that would account for the disappearance of the watcher the incident be a extraordinary one the man could not have drop from the table before we reach the support pier and we be equally certain that he have not slip down the pillar while we stand guard beneath i be go up there mutter holman we can get the rope from the camp come along i would like a look at that place at closer quarter we climb hastily down the tree creep cautiously back to the camp and take the stout rope which we have use in reach the ledge of death the camp be quiet the curious nasal sound produce by the native together with the rather high-toned snore of professor herndon be the only sound that come through the still night holman fling one end of the rope over a project corner of the flat slab twist one half of it round and round the pillar to make occasional grip which we could use in the ascent then clutch the hang end he work himself slowly up i follow he only to find the upper surface of the table as bare of any sign of life as we have previously note from we perch in the chestnut tree the tough moss upon the stone be fully four inch long and cover the slab completely in vain we stamp around look for a possible hiding place the massive block do not offer a cranny that a lizard could hide in and with a unsolved mystery upon we hand we descend to the ground what do you make of it ask holman i shake my head the enigma baffle I we suspicion regard the honesty of leith make the strange appearance of the figure on the table of stone more perplexing than it would have be under ordinary circumstance leith have assert that the island be uninhabited yet we be not incline to rush to he with the news of the discovery we feel that it be another of the small discovery that make we pile up suspicion against the big bully at the head of the party we have no proof of the midnight visitor and the story of he sudden disappearance while we watch below would only provoke a unbelieving grin from leith and a idiotic laugh from the foolish old professor better keep it to ourselves growl holman for the present at any rate i remark if leith know that there be other upon the island and if those other be friendly to he it will only make he more careful of he action if we tell what we have see to-night arrive at this decision we come back to the camp and crawl quietly under the rug where we watch the mystical monument till the flaming tropical dawn light up the valley -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xi kaipus perform a service the professor use a roll of film in snap-shot the stone table while we be break camp he photograph it from every point of the compass and make a magnificent effort to dislocate he collarbone by fall from a tree up which holman have urge he to climb so that he could get a view of the upper surface in he mad pursuit of antiquity the professor forget that tree climbing be a accomplishment that he have never master properly in the day of he youth and we departure be somewhat delay by the shock which he receive from the fall the camera fall upon the pile of leaf which leith have use as a mattress and it escape with abrasion that be microscopical compare to those receive by the professor who glare angrily at holman as edith herndon attend to he injury i think you could climb murmur the youngster ` pon my word i do i would not have urge you to get up there if i do not think you could hang to a limb i be acquaint with a number of person who would look well hang to a limb retort the professor as he rub he ankle same here say holman unperturbed by the sharp retort when i think over they action professor i wonder how they escape be suspend from such place especially when you consider that tree be plentiful we make slow progress during the morning the professor 's accident rob he of a lot of the nimbleness which have be noticeable during the two precede day and the other member of the expedition have to move at a pace that would suit he stiff limb i be unlucky whisper holman as he sit beside I at the midday halt i try to show he how he could get a good snapshot and now he be as poisonous as a red-necked cobra just because he be silly enough to skin he shin we cross the lowest part of the valley during the early afternoon and commence to ascend gradually toward the black wall on the far side leith have remark at the lunch table that we would probably reach we destination on the follow morning and the information bring a thrill of expectation in spite of the suspicion we entertain the undefined dread have upset we nerve and i think the two girl as well as holman and myself be look forward anxiously to the arrival at the objective point so that we suspicion could be either verify or abandon leith be more affable than usual on that afternoon and he hold forth in such a gloomy fashion upon the wonder that be within reach that the professor almost forget he injury and he animus against holman as he listen to the description it be my opinion that the island be the burial ground of the chief of the nearby group remark leith there be every indication that the people who be bury here be not ordinary people as you will see when you view the wonder that will meet you eye to-morrow the professor beam through he thick glass and forget he injury give a little jump in negotiate a obstruction but the look of agony which pass across he face prove that he injured limb object to useless gambol we may be wrong after all muttered holman after he have listen to leith 's description of the wonder of the tomb of the long-dead member of polynesian royal family i hate to be suspicious of a fellow and i 'll be glad if he prove genuine in the end so will i i remark if he measure up all right i 'll be half inclined to apologize before i go back to take a gruelling from captain newmarch it be kaipi who stampede the small ray of charity that have pierce the cluster of suspicion we have collect the little fijian perform the trick about seven o'clock in the evening and it be do in a most effective manner when we have make camp leith have send soma on ahead with the ostensible purpose of locate the easiest route to the base of the cliff and a hour afterward kaipi manage to attract my attention and he indicate by sign that he have information to impart i seize a chance to help he with the small tent which sheltered the two sister and as we tug at the knot he slip a small piece of paper into my hand what be it i ask soma drop it he explain nervously i follow he just little way think get good chance kill he but no chance come he drop little piece of paper from he belt I pick 'em up i no know what it say you read i cram the note into my pocket as leith approach but at the first opportunity i dive into a thicket of leaf and open it with nervous finger it be brief exceedingly brief but no number of word could have produce the same cold chill of dread which take possession of I as i glance over the scrawl upon the paper the note read : five baby for kindergarten arrange everything meet at the long gallery i stumble out on the clearing in a half stupor the arrival of the long-expected confirmation of we suspicion have the same effect upon I as a blow from a sandbag leith be apparently everything that holman and the girl have suspect he of be and as i look around at the nearly impenetrable jungle growth upon which the night have come down with that appalling swiftness of the tropics i understand the helpless condition in which we be place soma and the other five carrier be evidently tool of the big bully the person or person to whom the note be address would also stand behind he in a fray and against this little army there be holman kaipi the two sister and myself the professor 's insane craving for a sight of the antiquity would probably make he a partisan of the big brute till he devilish trick be lay sufficiently bare to allow the childish mind of the scientist to see through they the situation be pitiful to contemplate and sick with terror at thought of the fate of the two girl i find holman and pull he out of the circle of light throw by the fire which kaipi be tend what be it he ask i have get proof i cry soma drop a note that leith send he off with when we halt kaipus find it and bring it to I i recite the few word that be now pound madly through my brain but the mere recitation would not satisfy holman he want to see the word -- to stare at they so that he eye might confirm the information which he ear have gather and together we dive deeper into the creeper till it be safe for he to light a match by which he could view the scrawl my god he cry hoarsely he be a devil verslun we be fool infernal fool do you hear I i 'll shoot the brute now he fling aside my hand and make a dash toward the fire plunge through the creeper with a strength bear of the sudden flame of temper which have come with the confirmation of leith 's duplicity the boy 's love for barbara herndon make he a madman as he race madly to obtain vengeance from the brute who have lead we into the trap like two maniac we rush into the light of the fire but only the two girl and the professor be seat round it leith be not in sight where be he gasp holman the professor look up in mild astonishment who he ask leith cry the boy where have he go mr leith have go forward to help soma squeak the professor it will be moonlight so he take the opportunity of make certain about the direction we be to go in the morning he say he would not be back before daylight holman master he anger and i beckoned the professor to one side it be necessary to make a attempt to convince the foolish old scientist that we be in the hand of a scoundrel and i determine to place the note and we suspicion before he i tell hurriedly of the appearance of the figure upon the stone table on the previous evening but before i have time to tell of the note the doddering old imbecile interrupt what be that he cry some one else upon the island well they can not steal the honor of the discovery i have first claim upon everything we find upon the place mr leith and i make that arrangement before we leave sydney besides it be mr leith 's island and if other scientist be here -- oh confound it who say they be scientist roar holman it be bad luck for we that they be not scientist be harmless but these be native or something worse leith will fix 'em cry the professor ignore the youngster 's comment on the inoffensive nature of man of he type leith will put they off the place -- stop chatter and read that i interrupted you precious friend send this ahead by soma he drop it and we get hold of it holman strike a match and hold it over the scrap of paper while the scientist stare at it through he thick glass well he query what have this nonsense to do with I the five baby snap holman five baby repeat the professor i know nothing about baby he small head wag backward and forward as he make the statement and he evident inability to see that the reference concerned we irritated the youngster beyond measure you be the biggest baby of the five he roar you be a madman come away verslun it be no use argue with he the professor give a indignant snort straighten he small body as if he contemplate a attack upon the youngster then dash madly back to the fire where we watch he bob he head up and down as he speak to the two girl he confidence in the rascal who be possibly lure he to he death be pitiful to see and we recognize at that moment that it would be useless to waste any further argument with he we have get to get out of this scrape by we own effort mutter holman the girl will not leave he worse luck if they would i would turn tail this minute and make a attempt to fight we way back to the yacht and i doubt if you will find a haven there i remark that bilious captain be in a great hurry to send word to leith that i have get safely by he farewell bombardment we be in for it old man and we might as well realize the fact right now you be not sorry i find you on that pile of pearl shell sorry i cry i be glad man -- i be infernally glad holman grip my hand and then we crawl through the bush toward the spot where soma and leith have start off on they suppose work of exploration what can we do i ask wait round here and pot he when he be come back say the youngster cheerfully but we should let the girl know something should not we that old fool will tell they a garbled account that will frighten they out of they wit one of we have better go and try to quiet they fear you go then i remark i 'll wait here till you come back holman creep quietly toward the campfire and i wait in the undergrowth the moon be rise in the east and a soft gray light wipe out the intense blackness that have come upon the place after the short twilight the top of the cliff toward which we be journey be tip by a brilliant thread of silver as the moon peep above they rampart and i creep deeper into the shadow as the full glory of the glowing orb turn the night into day i have wait some thirty minute for holman when i notice a movement beneath a small bush some fifteen pace to my right i watch the spot without move and presently a dark figure creep out of the shelter and move cautiously toward the camp convince that the visitor be soma i pull out my revolver and wait wonder as i watch what he intend to do the black figure come closer he pause to listen to the sound that come from the fire and as he lift he head the moonlight fall across he face and i put the revolver back in my pocket kaipi i murmur the fijian creep quietly to the spot where i be hide i come for you he mutter why funny thing much he gurgle light on mountain no see from here I watch it think it something bad come i 'll show you holman return at that moment and i explain what kaipus have just tell I the devil mutter the youngster the note say that he would meet they at the long gallery see the light be not visible from we camp and the brute never think that one of we would be far enough from the camp to notice it if it be a signal we might be able to reach the spot and see what be actually go on if we leave thing till to-morrow i be afraid we 'll be too late but the girl i cry we 'll get back he reply i tell they how everything be verslun and they be not afraid edith have a automatic pistol that she bring from the yacht and she 'll use it if she be force to come on we follow kaipi into the shadow the fijian pick he way with wonderful instinct through the clump at about half a mile from the camp he stop and point to the cliff I see light flash way over there he whisper you wait and see we crouch down and wait the minute pass slowly but the black barrier away to the east give no sign of life i think kaipus must have sight a star mutter holman there be nothing -- he break off abruptly and grip my arm high up in the basalt barrier at a spot about three quarter of a mile from where we be crouch a tiny flame suddenly appear blaze for a instant then die away again three time it flare up and as quickly die away but at the third disappearance holman and i with the vengeance-seeking kaipus be struggle through the network of damp vegetation toward the spot from which the signal have come -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xii the devil dancer the snaky vine seem to we to be league with leith as we try to force we way to the spot where the tiny flash of light have appear amongst the rock the lawyer-vine grip we ankle and fling we upon we face score of time but we scramble to we foot and rush on kaipus have make the discovery at a opportune moment now that we be certain that leith contemplated treachery the wait through the long night would have madden we we want to meet he quickly and instinct tell we that the appointment place mention in the note be identical with the spot to which we be fight we way we be bruise and bleed when we reach the foot of the black cliff whose perpendicular wall tower above we we be almost certain that the light have be flash from a point immediately above the spot where we come face to face with the barrier but the scaling of the black barricade be a proposition that seem incapable of solution as we rush along the base this be the spot gasp holman this big tree cluster be just to the right of the place where the light be flash that be so i remark but how be we to get up to the point where the signal come from we race madly up and down the front of the strange black wall hunting eagerly for a place that offer the slightest foothold by which we could climb to the terrace that we could see far above but the search be a futile one the tremendous mountain of ebony rock appear to have be drive up out of the earth during some volcanic disturbance and as we stumble blindly along we think it would be easier to scale the outside wall of a new york skyscraper than the slippery side of the obstruction in we path it be holman who find a key to the situation the big clump of maupei or pacific chestnut that we have take as a landmark when we be run through the moonlit night grow close to the barrier and the limb of several of the tree scrape the side of the basalt column as the faint night breeze move they backward and forward there be a ledge up there whisper the youngster look it be about fifty foot from the ground if we could climb a tree we might be able to reach it from one of the limb he have hardly outline the proposition before we be swarm up the trunk holman in the lead by right of discovery and the nimble kaipus in the rear higher and higher the youngster climb into the thick green foliage he reach the topmost branch and select one that lead toward the rocky wall he straddle it and work he way slowly forward kaipi and i clung to the fork of the limb and wait and as i watch holman the wisdom of we action be assail by a cold doubt we have leave the two girl entirely unprotected and if leith reach the camp before we return and hear from the chatter professor the story of the finding of the scrap of paper it would be reasonable to suppose that he would consider the moment have arrive for the perpetration of any deviltry he have plan but holman 's action interrupt my mental criticism of the wisdom of we plan the youngster have reach the extreme end of the limb and he be claw madly at the rock to obtain a footing he succeed after a five minute ' struggle and he send a breathless whisper back to we perch there be a ledge here he murmur i think we can climb up from it hurry along and i 'll give you a hand i need a hand when i reach the end of that leafy seesaw i be much heavier than the boy and the limb could hardly support my weight when i near the end holman reach out he hand at a moment when i think that a drop through the air would be my reward for attempt aerial exhibition and the next moment i be beside he on a little projection that barely give we a foot it be easy climb just above we whisper holman wait till we get kaipi the fijian come along the limb with the agility of a trapeze artist and when he reach the ledge we stare up at the dizzy height that rise above we little rest place small jut projection like gargoyle stick out from the wall and we look at they hungrily if we have only bring the rope cry the boy say verslun put you face against the rock and i 'll climb on to you shoulder i do so and the youngster climb up cautiously for a long time he stand there peer around in a effort to discover a path by which we could go upward and onward but at last he step off and i look up to find he cling to the wall like a huge beetle a pack of fat cloud that have harry the moon during the earlier part of the evening now close in upon she and we be in complete darkness the threshing limb of the maupei tree that be within a yard or two of the spot where kaipus and i stand wait disappear in the night and the scratch of holman 's shoe high above we head come down to we through the intense silence and prove that he be hold he position with difficulty a small piece of shale hit I on the shoulder after a long wait and i turn my face upward verslun breathe the strained voice of the youngster be you there well i ask h ` sh he murmur we be right near the spot verslun if kaipi climb up on you shoulder to this place i think the two of we could pull you up be you willing come on kaipi i whisper and the fijian climb nimbly upon I and move up into the void above now verslun muttered holman reach up till we get a grip of you wrist be you ready well try hard man think of those two helpless girl and dig you toe in i do not need any reminder concern the position of the two sister as i stand on tiptoe and scratch with my finger at the crumble ledge upon which holman and the fijian crouch the predicament of edith herndon and not fear for my own safety make I scratch madly for a foothold as i swing above the shelf i leave kaipus and holman tug till every muscle in my arm shriek out against the way they be be handle but i be go up i chin the crumble layer of rock upon which my finger have a perilous grip lay my chest across the shelf and wriggle into safety that be good whisper holman do not puff so hard man we be too close to take any chance i get upon my hand and knee and follow he along the narrow pathway over a thousand obstruction we crawl like three rock snake till finally the boy halted and turn toward I see the streak of light through that split in the rock he whisper look in front of you well they be inside the split in the rock to which holman have point be a perpendicular crevice about four foot in length but possess only a width of six inch it separate two rock mass that be fully eighteen inch thick and as we wriggle noiselessly toward it we see that it give we a glimpse of the interior of a huge cavern the part of which that be just inside we point of observation be illuminate by a swing ship 's lamp which hang by a rope that drop from the vaulted dome the lamp swing directly in front of the crevice through which we peer breathlessly and for a few seconds it be the only object that be visible gradually we eye become accustomed to the light and we find that a pair of brown leg be move slowly along the floor past we spyhole a body gorgeously decorate in mat of green and crimson parrot feather follow the leg and then come a head that be hide behind a mask of sennet daub thickly with coral lime and ochre till it appear a ghastly nightmare the horror move upon its stomach and view it as we do through the narrow cranny it appear as if the film of a biograph be be slowly drag before we eye another pair of leg follow the mask head another body and another mask that be even more fear-inspiring than the first and the procession continue three four five and six -- each succeed one be array in a mask of more ghastly appearance than those which have precede he the sixth be follow by the first who have wriggle clear around the circle of light throw by the lamp and in perfect silence the infernal snaky circle move backward round and round the faint light shine on bare leg on body from which the parrot mat be thrust aside by the contortion and upon the mask that be weirdly fantastic and mephistophelian they have circle the floor about ten time when holman tug my coat and i wriggle back from the crevice what be up my lip be dry as i put the question kaipi where be he clear out those human serpent scare he go softly man we must get he before he attempt to go down that cliff or he 'll break he thick head we catch up to the deserter on the ledge to which holman and the fijian have drag I a short time before and the youngster abuse the frightened native as he endeavor to turn he back no no shriek the fijian I no see dance like that I die if i stay why i ask it be ` tivo ' -- death dance gasp kaipi wizard man dance it something go happen damn bad but they can not get you cry holman come back and watch they soma and leith will be there directly and you 'll get you revenge but kaipi would have nothing more of the performance in the rocky chamber the repulsive mask and the backward wriggle of the six upon the floor have upset he fight stomach for the time be and we could not induce he to return well you wait here order holman we be go back but we 'll return in a few hour and pick you up do not move from this ledge kaipus would promise anything if he be not force to witness the performance and we leave he huddle up in the darkness and return to the spyhole in the wall the tivo as the fijian call it be still in progress without noise the six half-nude figure be describe circle upon the smooth floor the silence and the serpentlike motion have a peculiar hypnotic effect upon we and in a sort of dreamlike trance we watch they wriggle by the narrow aperture to which we press we face with each circle more of the brown sweat-polished body show beneath the twisted mat the pace be begin to tell upon they now slower and slower they move past the crevice till at last all movement cease and apparently lifeless they lay face downward upon the floor i thought of the two girl at the lonely camp as we sit watch and i know well that holman 's thought be turn in the same direction we have see nothing of leith but a intuition that would not be put aside connect leith with the strange ceremony that be in progress within the cavern and we be chained to the spot i have no idea how long the six figure remain motionless upon the floor it may have be a hour it may have be two the mystery of the performance we be witness seem to drag we into a world where minute and hour do not exist we be dumfound by the confirmation of we suspicion and the peculiarly devilish exhibition and i shake off the lethargy with a effort as holman prod I with he finger and point at a spot beyond the body of the dancer who lay immediately in front of the spyhole look in the direction holman point i see that another light be approach through the gloom of the cavern it bob toward we slowly a tiny pin point that come nearer and nearer as the bearer walk in the direction of the six the distance it be away from the dancer which be evident from the time that elapse from the moment we see it till it be close up convinced we that the cavern be of a enormous length and the word long gallery in the note which soma have drop come up before my mind there be no doubt that the cave be the meeting spot which leith have mention and as i feel holman 's body stiffen as he shoulder against I for a share of the peephole i know that he believe that the treacherous brute be one of the three that be approach behind the bob lamp the body of the dancer or at least the part that we could see become tense and rigid a soft hiss go round the circle and once again the wriggle movement start but this time the six go forward instead of backward they break out of the circular formation and in a long glistening line move up the cavern toward the three approach the lamp halt then it be raise high in the air as the crawl half dozen approach and holman give a curious little gurgle as the light fall upon the three newcomer wrap in parrot feather and a white mask the lamp bearer stand reveal as soma immediately behind he be a tall white man in the same outlandish garb while the last of the three barearm and bareleg and wear a immense headdress of plume be leith the snaky six circle the three at a respectful distance then again break into a single file formation they turn toward the end of the cave nearest we spyhole and behind the length of creep body soma the tall white who have only one eye and leith come slowly holman 's breath come faster as the procession approach the exhibition chill we there be a devilish suggestiveness in the proceeding in some indescribable manner it bring up mental picture that be nauseating and it require something of a effort to watch the performance the mystery of the silent night the thought of the danger which threaten the two girl and the glimpse of the astounding performance within the cavern bring a dazed mental condition that make we doubt we sanity i feel holman 's hand reach out across my shoulder as the procession move down upon we and instinctively i understand the movement the cold barrel of a revolver have slip by my face and i grip he wrist and force the hand downward the manner in which soma and the one-eyed man walk in front of the big brute make it impossible to shoot with tell effect and leith be the person we desire to kill at that moment the other seem to be but creature of he will and he stand up in we mind as a devil whose existence be a menace to everything that be pure and clean the three newcomer move to the side of the cavern so that nothing except they bare foot be visible and backward and forward in front of those foot move the human serpent with a regularity that be stupefy in a unbroken line they would move forward flatten themselves upon the floor then with a unanimity that be remarkable they would wriggle backward to repeat the same movement over again holman pull I away at last and we retire to a point that make it possible for we to converse in low whisper without be hear what will we do he gasp i can not stay there any longer i want to get inside to the devil i do not want to shoot he i want to throttle he with my two hand but the entrance to the cavern be from somewhere on the other side of the hill i remonstrate as the young fellow rave about we helplessness we must get there do not lose you head about it i remark keep cool and we 'll win out in the long run it be useless to speak of patience to that boy at the moment he claw desperately at the slippery wall in a endeavor to find a path that would lead we to the opening on the other side by which leith have make he entry but the attempt appear to be madness a dozen time the youngster scramble up rough portion that offer a slight footing but each time he slip back bruise and batter he would listen to no argument the desire to get to the mouth of the cavern and kill leith before the morning have produce a insanity and we crawl and climb along the face of those basalt cliff in a manner that chill my spinal marrow holman possess the courage of a maniac he imagination be blind to the danger that lay alongside the crumble shelf of rock and i scramble behind he wonder dimly what would happen to edith and she sister if a unkind fate fling we from the ledge into the darkness from which the soft croon of the chestnut clump come up like a warning against we foolhardiness holman pause at the end of a wearisome climb and he draw himself upright at that moment the cloud-harried moon drag herself from beneath the pack and the young fellow give a cry of joy we can do it from here verslun he cry i see a path to the top come along man what about kaipi i gasp we 'll never find we way back here let he sit there he snort hurry or the moon will be under the cloud before we cross the cliff -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xiii tomb of silence for my own part i find no great liking for the moonlight up to that moment i have follow blindly in the track of holman nerve somewhat by the thought that the trail he pass over would carry I the danger be hide by the darkness and my imagination be too stunned by the happening of the night to make any endeavor to torture my nerve by picture they but the reappearance of the moon bring a opportunity to my eye and i wonder if we could negotiate the goat track which the youngster be scramble over i turn my face to the wall and crawl timorously in the rear higher and higher we go with bleed finger and knee but at last holman reach the top and i drag myself up beside he get up he cry savagely we must kill the devil before morning we get to we foot and start to run toward what we know to be the direction of the cavern the ground slope gradually and we reason that it would continue to fall away till we reach the mouth of the cavern by which leith have enter from the far side for once we have a clear run at that height there be little vegetation and at a mad gait we speed across a bare stretch where the only obstacle be lump of rock that be scatter around in great profusion if -- if we could find the place and block the devil and all he gang inside gasp holman that be too good a thing to entertain i splutter we might verslun we might he cry i have get a feeling that we have be pick to put that devil out of existence that be why i be take a chance in leave the girl back there at the camp i believe i be go to kill he but whether it be to-night or some other time i do not know the sooner the better i stammer from what kaipus say about that dance something out of the way be go to happen and i have get a hunch that the something will happen to we holman remain silent and we race on move down the slope at a angle that we judge would bring we somewhere near the entrance at moment my brain assure I that it be a mad proceeding but something of the certainty with which the youngster look upon himself as the fate-appointed destroyer of leith come to I as i race beside he and i put aside the fear for edith herndon 's safety that besiege I as i run the last doubt about leith 's treachery have be chase away by the dance we have witness and i feel assure that the man be a monster a vile thing who for some purpose that i could not allow myself to ponder over have bring the foolish old scientist and he daughter into a place of terror treachery have be apparent from the start it be only the confidence of the old antiquarian that have blind we eye to a score of incident that should have convince we that the brute have some ulterior motive in view during that mad race through the night the big sallow-faced giant appear to we as a devil a fiend that be connect with some sort of horrible practice that have continue to exist in this remote islet long after all trace of such thing have be lose in those island that be visit by trader and missionary kaipi connect the dance with death and the same conclusion have come to we before we have hear the word of the frightened fijian holman slacken speed and we dodge through a mass of boulder that we judge be in a direct line with the crevice through which we have witness the happening in the cave we should be near the place if there be a entrance to it on this side he mutter this pile of rock look from -- oh gee here be a path it be a path sure enough it wind in and out among the rock a narrow beaten trail singularly white against the black surroundings holman stop and take up a handful of the dust they coat it with coral lime to make it plain in the darkness he growl come on verslun the wriggly batch must be straight ahead i pull the army colt from my pocket and run softly abreast of the youngster the corrosive terror of the earlier part of the evening have flee then and my nerve have take up a sort of dare-devil attitude toward all happening that the future might hold in store besides the more i thought of leith the greater he villainy appear to be and to save edith herndon from the slightest contact with the ugly ruffian be a task that would give the greatest coward in the world the courage of a warrior the white path wound in and out of the boulder which become thicker as we advance and suddenly it dive through a dark passage into the side of the hill we feel that we be at the mouth of the burrow by which leith and he dancer have enter and we move into the shadow to reconnoitre leith have inform the professor that he would not return to the camp till the follow morning so the chance be that the treacherous scoundrel be still assist at the ceremony that we have witness shall we go in whisper holman as you like i answer he move toward the mouth of the burrow then stop and turn toward I what time be it it be ten minute of midnight i reply we have get six hour he whisper come along we 'll chance it very cautiously we move into the darkness of the passageway feeling we way along the wall that be cold and damp from the moisture which have soak through from the crown of the cliff the place be not more than five foot wide and as i walk along on one side of the wall holman feel he way along the other could touch I whenever he wish to ascertain my position we shoe make no sound upon the floor of the corridor it be cover deep with fine dust upon which we walk noiselessly a occasional bat flutter past we but outside the flap of the wing not a sound disturbed the stillness of the place the silence of the outside be intensify a hundredfold in the open one hear the crooning of the tree as the soft wind from the pacific play with they heavy foliage but in the natural passage through which we crawl in search of leith the air feel as if it have not be disturb for century it be heavy and thick possess a faint odour that seem to rise from the dust beneath we foot we have walk about one hundred yard along the corridor when it widen suddenly the wall that we be follow turn off at right angle and from the moonlight which filter through a dozen small fissure high up above we head we see that we have enter a cavern of vast proportion we sense its vastness the few streak of moonlight that stab the darkness be like so many guide-post that enable we to make a mental calculation of the height and extent of the place we stop and move together instinctively holman put he mouth close to my ear what do you make of it he ask it might be a cavern lead into the one that run out to the face of the cliff i reply but how be we to cross it i can not tell you i be afraid if we leave this opening that we 'll get lose it be rather plain that we would the surround wall be as black as the opening by which we have enter the place and we stand with quick-beating heart stare out across the place through which the bar of moonlight appear like silver skewer one of these skewer fall upon a ledge of stone some few yard in front of the spot where we be stand and holman step toward it stay where you be he say if i get lose i 'll whistle softly and you can signal back to I he move away and i be leave standing in the open a bat bang heavily against my face and the odour from the dusty floor irritated my nostril so that i have difficulty in restrain myself from sneeze it be about twenty minute before holman return he whistle ever so softly and when i reply he come toward I hurriedly just walk out to that spot of moonlight he whisper i 'll keep guard on the door feel around there and tell I what you think of it i do as he direct i walk forward to the spot and feel around with my hand my finger come in contact with round smooth object that fill every available inch of a stone table in front of I and with a feeling of revulsion i hurry back to the mouth of the corridor holman grip my arm and put a question give you a shock eh why they be skull i breathe hoarsely yes hundred of 'em he say the place be chock full of they this island must have be the bury ground of all the adjoining group and it be the atmosphere of the place that keep the nigger away from it leith have be wise to that the present generation of islander know nothing of the thing that happen here hundred of year back but they have get a inborn horror of the place and they keep away well what be we to do wait here but if he do not come this way he must he answer it be the only way out i think we can not go across this wilderness so it be safer to await development here we have not long to wait from a point directly opposite we position and at a distance that we judge to be two hundred yard away a bob light break into the wall of darkness and move directly toward we holman grip my arm and pull I forward to the stone table upon which the skull be lay and side by side we crouch and wait it be the ship 's lantern that soma have carry in front of leith that be now move upon we its yellow light show the parrot-feather mat and headdress of the big kanaka while the hum of voice which drift across the vast space of the cavern inform we that the dancer who have assist at the ceremony be return with leith and the one-eyed white man holman 's breath come hot upon my cheek there be no necessity for speech i know that he intend to seize the first opportunity to attack and that opportunity be at hand behind the bob lamp that be approach we by a irregular trail as if soma be wind in and out amidst stone support similar to the one that sheltered we be the brute who hold we in he grip and after the event we have witness it seem impossible to reconcile he action with anything that smack of decency or honesty -lrb- illustration : behind the bob lamp be the brute who hold we in he grip -rrb- i attempt to drop on my knee at that minute but the moment be disastrous to the ambush which we have plan as i move my hand forward i dislodge a skull that be evidently rest upon a shelf somewhat higher than the one before we with a noise that appear terrific in that place the object crash down upon the stone and the bob lantern halt about fifteen pace in front of we leith break the silence that follow what be that he ask a bat answer soma i do not think so drone leith lift up the light soma raise the lantern high above he head and as he do so holman fire the echo be terrific high in the vaulted roof of the place echo answer each other with the sharp report of maxim and the thick air shiver leith 's voice roar a order put out the light soma immediately crash the lantern upon the ground and i hear holman groan i miss he he whisper move along a little verslun they have get a line on we position we do not move a minute too soon half a dozen shot break out from the spot where the light of the lantern have be suddenly quench and we fire twice and shift ground the moment we pull the trigger but the opposition guess the direction of we sidestep a bullet lift my hat into the darkness and as i scramble away a hand touch my thigh and be immediately take away i feel holman 's body on the other side and then club the big colt i drive it down through the darkness at a point that my imagination suggest would be the most likely place to find the head of the stranger whose hand touch my thigh the blow miss and as i make a kangaroo-like jump sideways a spurt of flame blaze out within a yard of my face i fire immediately and the soft _ plop _ of a body settle into the dry dust upon the floor convinced I that i have settle one of we enemy for about ten minute after that there be no more firing my skin more than my ear bring to my brain the information that there be other somewhere in the thick darkness but the little air tremor that come to I be so faint that it be impossible to tell in which direction they be i have lose all trace of holman with extreme caution i crawl toward what i think to be the spot where i have leave he but my groping finger find only the fragment of bone that cover the dusty floor of the charnel house i sit in the dust and endeavor to make my addled brain direct I as to the best course to pursue the silence lead I to infer that leith and he party who be evidently familiar with the cave be make for the passage by which we have enter the place and a cold chill pass over I as my imagination picture leith one eye and the oily dancer wait for holman and I in the narrow corridor to escape from the place immediately be we only chance and with a courage bear of terror conjure up by the thought of imprisonment in that place of skull i start to crawl rapidly into the dark i have not proceed half a dozen yard when my hand touch a bare leg and i draw back hastily with madly pound heart i crouch in the dust wait for a attack but as i wait i convinced myself that the leg have not be draw back when my finger encounter it with my right hand club my revolver i reach my leave out cautiously and once again my finger come in contact with the bare limb the fear leave I at that moment i be back at the spot where i have fire at a unseen foe some fifteen minute before and the body near I be the victim of my lucky bullet carefully i feel the dead man he wear a large feather cloak and a tall headdress and i conclude that he be one of the wriggle brute whose performance we have watch in the cave in the dust beside the body my finger find he revolver and the fact that he have be arm at the moment he party come unexpectedly upon we be more proof if proof be need that leith 's tactic be anything but straightforward secure the revolver i start to crawl away but a sudden inspiration come to I i strip the parrot-feather mat and the headdress from the corpse and don they over my own clothing in the darkness recognition be make through the finger and as there be eight enemy in the cavern and only one friend i consider that the danger i run of receive a bullet from holman be more than counterbalance by the protection that the dancer 's costume would give I if i run against the grope hand of leith or he gang after a wearisome crawl i touch the wall of the cavern and standing upright i debate for a moment whether i should move to the right or the left i have no definite idea as to the position of the opening through which we have enter the place and i dread the weary circuit of the cavern which i would be compel to make if i turn in the wrong direction it be possible that the corridor be within a few yard of I and if i turn away from it i might get lose in other passage lead to the long gallery where the dance of death have take place i decide to move to the right and with one hand upon the cold wall i stumble forward if holman be still a prisoner edith herndon and she sister be entirely unprotected and my torment imagination make I throw prudence to the wind i have to reach the camp before leith or any of he evil bodyguard arrive and become reckless of the terror of the dark i run blindly in my desperate desire to find the path into the open air i cannoned into a man who be stand with he back to the wall of the cave and before i could lift my arm he finger have grip my throat for a second we struggle then he release he grip and murmur some word in a dialect that i do not understand he hand have touch the parrot-feather mat that i have draw about my shoulder and he be convince that i be one of he own companion still hold my shoulder he push I a pace or two forward and instinctively i know that i be in the corridor the faintest tremor disturb the heavy air and a wild surge of joy rush through my be the place of skull have bring a terror upon I that sweep away my reason but the knowledge that i be on the way to the open where i could fill my lung with god 's pure air act as a powerful restorative as my guide 's finger slip from my shoulder i stand still and listen he heavy breathing be distinctly audible and with a prayer to providence to guide my right hand i bring the butt of the heavy revolver down through the darkness it must have catch he squarely upon the crown for he drop without a groan holman i shriek where be you holman the passage be here this way quick a revolver crack within two foot of I and the bullet rip through the tall headdress i crouch quickly and run along the corridor there be no answering cry from holman and although it be possible that he would not disclose he whereabouts by reply to my yell i decide that i could do little to help he in the impenetrable darkness besides edith herndon and she sister be in danger and the dawn be come rapidly throw off the parrot-feather mat which have serve I to such good purpose i race headlong toward the open a few bat return early to they sleep quarter bang against my face but the way be otherwise clear and with a cry of joy i rush through the mouth of the passage into the calm clear night -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xiv back to the camp the path with its coating of coral lime stretch before I and i flee along it the moon have disappear behind the hill but the lime track be quite distinct my watch have stop but i judge that there be still a good two hour before the dawn and i run as i have never run in my life i recognize what sort of feeling i possess for edith herndon as i race through the lonely night and i reproach myself bitterly for leave the camp i become convinced that leith have set out for the rest place of the professor and he two daughter after place guard at the inner opening of the corridor to see that holman and i do not escape from the cavern and i realize the terror which the two girl would experience when the big brute reach the camp the devil i mutter the fiendish brute a chuckle come from a boulder beside the track and holman 's cheery voice set my pulse beat you frighten the dickens out of I verslun he cry i think you be one of the evil legion gee i be glad to see you how do you get out i gasp as we rush on together i think i leave you in the cavern it be a good job you do not he retort there be a husky nigger at the outside entrance of the passage and he give I the fight of my life get off this track they might be after we at any moment do you think that leith have make for the camp i ask i suppose he have we must move as fast as we can verslun if he reach there before we we 'll deserve any fate that will come to we we should not have leave they the utterance of the conviction that have come to both of we bring a silence and we rush across the boulder-strewn ground that we have cross earlier in the night we feel certain that leith know of a surer and safer path back to the camp but it be useless for we to hunt for a new trail at that moment we would have to find we way down the nearly perpendicular wall up which we have climb after leave the crevice through which we have view the death dance and to I at least the recollection of that path bring feeling that be by no means pleasant but leith be make toward the camp and the horrible thought arouse by the spectacle which we have witness in the early night muzzle the thrill which the danger of the climb send through we body the dance have terrify the fijian by arouse thought of the deed that would happen in its wake and kaipus 's terror become a gauge for we to measure its dread significance we reach the cliff and run up and down the ledge in a vain search for the spot where we have claw we way to the top not that we think the finding of the place would solve the problem of the descent it be hard to conceive of a more difficult way than the one by which we have come and as if he have suddenly come to the conclusion that any other path would be preferable holman drop upon he knee and lower himself upon a ledge that be immediately below come on verslun he cry in a choke voice that be altogether different from he cheery tone if there be no path we must roll down there be the first flush of the dawn i look toward the east and groan the faint grayish tint unnerve I although it be possible that leith have already reach the camp still we have promise the two girl that we would return by daylight and although we have a hazy notion as to what we would do when we do reach they side the longing to get there make we oblivious of danger i swing down on to the crumble foothold that support holman and breathlessly we begin to scramble toward the valley it be a mad climb holman exhibit a temerity that border on insanity with reckless daring he scramble down upon dangerous niche that jut out upon the face of the cliff and my repeat warning fall upon deaf ear a task that would have appear impossible when view in daylight lose half of its terror because we only vaguely apprehend the danger that threaten we when a layer of shale crumble beneath we foot we descent become a wild toboggan slip and slide clutch wildly at every little projection that would decrease the speed at which we be travel we roll with bruise and bleeding body on to a small platform and lay half stunned for a moment as a thousand piece of rock dislodge by we body bounce past we into the valley holman pick himself up and look around the pink flush have deepen in the east and nearby object be discernible by all the god we be back on the ledge near the crevice he cry come along and we 'll hunt for kaipi it be wonderful how we have pull up in we slide near the place where we have witness the performance that prompt we to make the ascent but there be no mistake about the spot as we crawl along the platform we find that we have land not more than twenty foot from the crevice through which we have witness the blood-curdling tivo and we hurry toward the spot where we have leave the fijian whose nerve have be upset by the glimpse he have have of the strange antic of the dancer but kaipus be not at the spot where we have leave he whether he fear have increase to such a extent that they have force he to leave the place or whether he have come to the conclusion that we have return to the camp by some other route we could not determine so waste no time on useless conjecture we hurry toward the big maupeus tree up which we have climb to reach the ledge but holman 's hurry prove disastrous he have escape the danger of the cliff descent to meet a accident when he have sufficient light to see what he be about in reach for the limb of the tree that thresh against the cliff he lose he footing and before i could grip he he go crash through the foliage to the ground some fifty foot below i think that i be a hour descend that tree but i could not have be more than three minute if my skin leg could be rely upon as evidence of speed i find holman in a thorny tangle and as i drag he into the open he groan loudly and endeavor to get upon he foot be you hurt i question no no he cry i be not hurt verslun get I on my foot man quick for the love of god quick i grip he shoulder and he manage to stand upright the dawn come with tropic suddenness at that moment and i see that he be bleed from a nasty wound above the right temple while he limp painfully as i help he across a small clear patch near the tree i have hurt my leg he cry but i be go to get to the camp if i fall verslun i want you to lend I a hand promise to help I will you she -- miss barbara you know old man she be everything to I give I a hand if i tumble down i promise i answer and he wring my hand as we start off through the claw scratch vine that trip we up as we try to fight we way forward if we have think on the night before that the quarter mile of country that lay between the camp and the rocky wall be a difficult stretch to negotiate we be more than doubly certain of its impenetrable character now that daylight have come how we have ever manage to get through it in the darkness be a mystery that we try to solve as we attempt to make we way back the place be a mad riot of thorny undergrowth lace and bind with vine that be as strong as wire hawser the liana appear human to we they lasso we leg and fling we sprawl upon we face whenever we try to quicken we speed thorn of a strange fishhook variety drive they barb point into we and each yard of the tortuous path that we cut through the devilish vine be mark by a scrap of we clothing which the torment thorn seem to wave aloft as a emblem of victory he 'll beat we gasp holman i be all in verslun that fall have finish I keep at it i say we must be near the camp by now we have walk three mile mutter holman we have lose we way no we have not i cry we have strike a bad patch but we 'll get there soon the youngster clench he tooth and endeavor to forget the agony of he leg but the effort tax he courage we 'll do it i say do not let the brute beat we i -- i will not he stammer if it be anything but my leg verslun he fall on he face and i help he up but once again he collapse the injured limb make it impossible for he to stand or even crawl you get ahead he cry hoarsely leave I verslun leave I here but i would never find you again i protest yes you would i 'll crawl out after a few hour ' rest run to the camp and shoot -- shoot the devil the moment you put you eye on he i take a quick glance at the matted wall of the green creeper that hedge we in on all side holman be in the last stage of exhaustion and i reason quickly if i leave he in the middle of the thorny tangle that encompass we it would be utterly impossible for I to find he again and he would probably perish from thirst if i rush away i would be leave he to certain death and although we prospects of leave the island alive do not look too bright at that moment i consider that i would be make he demise a certainty by leave he in the maze i stop grip he round the waist and with a great effort manage to lift he upon my shoulder holman 's action do not help I as i struggle beneath he he kick like a madman when he understand what i intend to do but i hold he in spite of he protest leave I here he scream go ahead by yourself verslun what be the use of take I you be come so you can stop kick i muttered take you finger out of my eye but holman 's struggle cease then and he head fall backward the pain of he leg have make the plucky youngster swoon away and with a prayer upon my lip i spring again at the bulwark of vicious creeper i have a very vague recollection of the remainder of that trip in my subconscious mind i have memory of a insane struggle with a jungle that be alive of a fight with thorny creeper that pursue we i become convinced that those vine be alive because the same thorn that we have pass hour before rise up again in we path and wave the scrap of bloody clothing that they have tear from holman and myself at last half insane with anxiety for the safety of the girl and we own struggle we stagger blindly into the patch of clear land upon which the camp have be pitch on the previous evening it be impossible to mistake the site the ember of the big fire be still smoking and we stare with sweat-blinded eye at the place where the girl ' tent have be stand when we rush off with kaipus to investigate the light in the hill but there be no trace of the girl or the professor leith have get ahead of we and the big brute have rush the crazy scientist and he two daughter toward the hill that stand up black and defiant above the sea of green vegetation -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xv a day of skirmish we lay for a few moment upon the soft grass then holman crawl on hand and knee to the little spring of cold water and bath the wound upon he temple and he injured leg the water revive he and after a brief rest he get to he foot and stare at the festoon tree that surround the spot i be ready verslun he mutter which way do they go i point to the mark make in the soft ground by the shoe of the two girl and holman limp forward but we can not follow this fashion i protest why not we 'll be shoot down before we get within half a mile of they leith can not know that we have escape from the cavern or he would have leave some one here to interview we well we can not do any high-class tracking in this country say the youngster grimly if we stray six foot from the trail we be lose we have better trust to fortune and go ahead it be impossible to do anything else the route by which the carrier have march from the camping ground be perfectly clear while we follow they footstep but if we diverge ever so slightly the thick veil of verdure hide the path from we eye to follow the party we would have to hold to the trail and take the chance of a ambush which leith would certainly prepare for we the moment he know we have escape from the cavern of skull it would be easy for he to set he one-eyed white partner to shoot we down as we stagger along the trail which soma or one of the carrier have blaze with a axe they can not have more than three hour ' start of we cry holman give I you arm verslun now let we move as fast as we can but this be puerile i protest we 'll be run we head into the noose i do not care if we do i want to get near leith but we 'll never get near by run after he in this fashion if we could find some way to get in front of he and wait but what will happen to the girl will we death prevent it i snap if we rush after he in the open we 'll throw we chance away i be a sailor absolutely ignorant of jungle knowledge but i have sense enough to know that leith would not leave he rear expose for a moment after he have receive word from the cave i try to recall story of extraordinary trail feat as we stumble forward but i become convinced that all the marvellous performance i have ever read of have be accomplish under condition that be altogether different from those that confront we upon the isle of tear a open piece of country would have be a sight of joy to we eye that be weary of the everlasting mesh of green which encompass we like the tentacle of a malignant fate the green sweaty leave the fat bloated pod and the length of pythonesque runner produce a mental nausea the vegetation appear to we to be vicious its very luxuriance produce that fear of the wild which grip one in tropical country but which be never feel in land situate in the temperate zone we have not cover a hundred yard of the path when holman pounce upon a strip of white bark that wave to we from the thorn of a lawyer-vine cross the track a few pencilled word cover the smooth side of the strip and we absorb they in a single glance ` we be prisoner now ' mutter holman read the few word in a whisper ` the brute have declare himself barbara ' the boy turn to I he face all blood-smeared and haggard and for a moment we stare at the strip of bark there have be no doubt in we mind concern leith 's intention from the time that kaipi bring we the message which soma have drop but the knowledge that the brute have declare himself to the professor and the two girl bring we a most horrible feeling in my own case i have never experience such a sensation the strange rite connect with the tivo in the long cave have lay a foundation upon which my imagination pile skyscraper of horror if i could have fix my mind upon a definite fate that would be theirs if they be not rescue from the big brute 's clutch i would have find relief but my inability to do that leave I a victim to thought that be enough to deprive one of he reason we look upon the island as the ceremonial place for rite that be stamp out in the group where the missionary have push himself and the message from barbara herndon become a mental piledriver to ram home a thousand doubt that have obtain a footing in we mind come on cry holman if we do not catch up with he i 'll go mad he turn to hurry along the narrow path but out of the silence behind we come a shout that cause we to dive promptly into the bush the whoop come from the direction of the camping ground and we have hardly crouch in the undergrowth when a nude native crash through the vine and race past we hide place he be follow by two more the three run at top speed head forward and they chest heave in a manner that suggest they have come some distance in the glimpse we catch of they as they dash past we come to the conclusion that they be three of the tivo dancer and as we watch they bare brown back disappear in the creeper we observe something which we position on the previous evening have prevent we from see the back of the three be tattoo not with the common line tattooing but with short scar that run down the spine make a ridged representation of a centipede and as they pass i remember that the professor when take a photograph of the stone table on the previous morning have comment on the same peculiar pattern which he have discover upon one of the huge support pillar they have come to tell leith that we have escape whisper holman and they 'll be on we trail the moment they give he the news all right we 'll be ready for they how much ammunition have you three cartridge i reply and i have four we must make those seven -- look out there be another beggar come we drop quickly out of sight and peer through the leaf holman be right some one else be come along the path but the newcomer be exercise much more prudence than the three dancer judge by the little interval of silence that follow the slight noise make by the breaking of twig he be investigate each yard of the way a woolly head at last appear through the network and we nerve relax at the big brown eye that roll fearfully the timorous stranger be kaipi the fijian be shake with fear when we drag he into the bush in halt word he tell the story of he experience of the night and holman and i listen kaipus have wait upon the ledge till a few hour before the dawn and then he have make for the camp with much better luck than we have strike he reach there before daylight but fearful of the happening which would follow in the wake of the devil dance he have take up a post of observation in a neighbouring tree and await event leith accord to the fijian have arrive at dawn accompany by soma and the one-eyed white man and the big brute have immediately interview the professor kaipus 's action as he mimic the elderly scientist convinced we that the interview be not pleasant to the archaeologist and it be evident that it be at that moment leith have declare himself as barbara herndon state in she note he kick up plentee big row explain kaipi he kick porter man a ' make damn big noise outside missee tent they come out speakee he he slap big missee in face drive 'em off holman be crash through the bush before kaipus have finish he recital and i follow he with the excited fijian bring up the rear leith be rush the professor and he daughter toward the black hill and we have to do something immediately for over a hour we stumble along the track make no effort to keep under cover in case leith should have prepare a ambush it be useless to argue with holman and my own feeling be such that i prefer to take the risk of the route which soma 's axe have cut to the delay which the task of force we own passage through the labyrinth would bring upon we prudence be thrust into the background by the intense hate we entertain for the devil who have entrap we it be near midday when we pursuit meet with a interruption a revolver crack in a clump of wild ginger directly in front and we take cover immediately the bullet have whiz close to holman 's head and as we lay panting in the ribbon-grass we congratulate ourselves on the fact that we have be meet with a single shot instead of a volley we have take a big chance and have come off lucky it be impossible for leith 's party to be very far ahead and as we watch the ginger clump we wonder how we could circumvent the sharpshooter after about five minute of absolute quiet kaipus turn he head and point to the rear and holman and i listen intently the fijian 's sharper ear have detect slight sound behind we and as we strain the silence we come to the conclusion that the enemy have stealthily work they way around we and be now creep like snake through the maze with the hope that they would take we unawares we start to worm we way to the right and we hatred of the infernal island where we be reduce to the condition of burrow mole increase we eye be practically useless we have to depend upon hearing alone and when a white man pit he ear against those of a native he find that he have be suffer from partial deafness without be aware of the fact a dozen time we shift ground on a signal from kaipi whose head be continually to the earth and that game of hide and seek drive we frantic leith be hurry toward the hill while we be crawl backward and forward through the undergrowth to escape a few native who pursue they tactic with a persistency that be madden the fact that the pursuer have the advantage put a raw edge upon we temper and after a hour spend upon hand and knee holman resolutely refuse to shift he ground in response to kaipus 's signal i be just as tired of the wormlike attitude that we be compel to adopt and i wait beside holman while the fijian slip away through the creeper after warn we by many eloquent signal that one of the search party be creep toward we holman have a let - 'em - all-come expression upon he face that would have be amusing at any other time and kneel with we back to each other we endeavor to peer through the leafage to get a glimpse of the foe we remain like that for about ten minute then we attention be attract to a point about eighteen inch to the right the dry leaf be push quietly aside but instead of a head appear as we expect a bare brown leg be thrust through the creeper and remain stationary the leg fascinate we kaipi have move in the opposite direction and we be certain that the limb belong to one of we enemy the naked savage be worm he way upon he stomach and the position immediately bring to we mind a picture of the scene in the long gallery when it come to a game of this sort we would be hopelessly outclass by a batch that through assiduous training slip along with the ease of serpent holman hold he revolver in readiness and watch the leg it be difficult to judge the position of the native 's body and the scarcity of ammunition make we hesitate before firing a shot the leg be push farther out of the leafy tangle and as it come toward he a change pass over holman 's face he hand he revolver to I crouch on he thigh and spring there be something primitive about the action something which cause my heart to throb as i watch he take the pantherlike spring on the previous evening the youngster have express a desire to throttle leith and the same desire have grip he when he watch the leg come through the vine the devilishness of the batch make shoot a tame way of obtain revenge and i possess the same itchiness of the finger which have prompt holman to take the wild leap there be a joy in throttle such a brute and i delight in the grit of the boy the affair be dramatic in its swift and silent end the native take entirely unaware have no chance against the angry antagonist who have land upon he back a faint gurgle prove to I that holman 's finger have find the neck of the other and in a incredible short time the struggle be over we part the bush and examine the body it be one of the three nude native that have rush by we on the trail a few hour before and he clasp in he right hand a long knife of new zealand greenstone that have be inlay with gold in a intricate design we have never see such a weapon the crude knife that i have see throughout the island be not to be compare to the wonderfully polished blade that have be intend to free either holman or myself from all earthly care while the metalwork show a craftmanship that make one wonder how many century have elapse since the polynesian artist who have fashion the weapon have be lay in the cavern of skull the sinnet work and the parquetry of split bamboo which comprise the highest handicraft of the present-day islander could hardly be class with the exceedingly beautiful work upon the blade holman turn up the end of the haft point to a delicate design of a centipede and then look down at the back of the savage upon the ground the similarity of the two design be immediately apparent but while the one on the greenstone have be execute by a artist the figure upon the back of the dancer be a crude example of scar-tattooing that require some imagination to puzzle out what object it be suppose to represent as we glance at each other the significance of the serpentlike dance the mark upon the body of the dancer and on the knife and stone table be plainly evident the island be sacred to the centipede and in some way leith have make himself a chief wizard amongst the few savage who still perform the rite which have once make the isle of tear a place of particular importance to the surrounding group holman take the long greenstone knife and we creep quietly away in the direction take by kaipi we have one enemy less upon the island not count the carrier we reckon that the active opposition comprise leith soma the one-eyed white man and either two or three of the tivo dancer and these make a formidable batch the dancer be huge native possess all the characteristic of the tongan while leith soma and the one-eyed white man possess more than ordinary strength we must try to find the path whisper holman this delay will give leith a chance to get to the hill but the finding of the path be no easy matter so that we would be well out of the sphere of the companion of the man who carry the greenstone blade we work we way for about one hundred yard through the leafy maze before attempt to search for it and that search prove a long and tiresome one it be impossible to describe the network of wanton vegetation through which we struggle during the hot afternoon every kind of shrub and tree be weave into a ungodly tangle by the crawl leap vine that shut out the sky and make it impossible to see a person stand only a few foot away we stay we appetite with wild guava and yam and move slowly forward in the direction that we surmise that leith be move in we inability to find the path leave we the only alternative of push on toward the hill in the hope that we would intercept the party before it reach the cavern which make the basalt cliff a secure hiding place once the arch villain reach the cave it would be a difficult matter to locate he and we damned the crazy brain of the professor as we think of the lonely position of the isle of tear if the captain of _ the waif _ be in league with leith it would be absolutely impossible to obtain help to rescue the girl and they father and we would be maroon upon the island for a indefinite period it be within a few minute of sunset when we despondency be suddenly sweep away the silence of the jungle be disturb by a shrill voice that protest loudly against something which the owner be call upon to do and we heart punch we rib with mighty blow as we crawl forward the voice belong to professor clinton herndon of californium -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xvi the stone table we feeling can hardly be describe as we creep closer to the spot from which the scientist 's angry protest have go up through the silence like a thin wire the loneliness of that day have be appalling i know that edith herndon 's quiet face be continually before my mental vision while holman 's action convinced I that he be suffer acutely if we be certain that leith intend to do no wrong to the party the fact that he be within speak distance of the two girl be particularly distressing after the knowledge we have gain in the night with extreme caution we worm we way forward the professor 's piping voice act as a verbal signpost in help we to locate the spot where he be engage in hold the argument we be close enough to hear he word and we nerve be on the highest tension as he shriek a defiance against some person near we have only one thought as to who that person could be the professor be pile charge of treachery upon the head of a listener and there be only one head on the isle of tear that contain enough villainy to make the charge possible i will not sign the papers cry the scientist i want my liberty sir you be a scoundrel where be my daughter holman creep a few inch in front have draw he revolver the blood pound madly through my brain we be within a few yard of leith and even as we move snakily forward the heavy bass voice of the scoundrel come to we ear you stupid old fool he growl you can demand all day and all night if it do you any good do you know who i be i know you be a ruffian snap the professor i know you be a rogue who have no respect for he word and honor i know you be a coward who insult woman go on mock leith i have be a fool cry the old man i be blind to everything through my love of science now i know that you lie i know you bring I here to rob I and insult my daughter the sun have set and the twilight make it difficult for we to locate the two man but we be close when leith speak again he voice sound so near that i start involuntarily while holman rest upon one hand part the branch with the barrel of the revolver which he grip in the other but you will admit when all be over that i have show you some wonderful thing sneer leith the professor be silent a moment as if endeavor to fathom the meaning of the word and we move a few inch closer in the little interval how ask the scientist holman 's hand that grip the revolver remain motionless through a rift in the leafy curtain i catch a glimpse of a bulk that be within a yard of we hide place and i know that the youngster be wait for the brute to speak to make certain that he be cover the right man the silence be nerve-destroying why say leith speaking slowly and distinctly you be in the hand of the wizard of the centipede i be they head and if you be not extremely lucky you will make a sacrifice to -- something fall upon my head with tremendous force at that moment but as the blow descend holman fire and even as i fight to escape the grip of the strong finger that twine themselves around my neck i realize with a great wave of happiness that the bulk in front of I have pitch forward when the shot have shatter the silence in a wild bedlam of oath and shout we fight and struggle the tivo dancer have follow upon we track through the long afternoon and the time that we have lose in locate leith have give they a opportunity to come up with we in the gloom we thresh backward and forward but we effort to escape be vain the one-eyed white man appear mysteriously out of the shadow to help the huge native and in three minute holman and i be tie hand and foot and stretch out near the unfortunate professor who with bind limb be sit up in the center of the grassy clearing where leith and he have be exchange personality there be no sign of the girl and i wonder as my brain recover from the effect of the blow what have happen to they holman 's voice put a question that rouse I from my half stupor do i kill he cry the young fellow tell I the question be answer by a stream of blasphemy that come from leith himself the big ruffian have fall into a bunch of ribbon-grass but now with the assistance of one eye he get to he foot and stagger toward we from the action of he white partner i surmise that holman 's bullet have strike he in the left shoulder and the surmise prove true the attack of the dancer have jerk the youngster 's arm and the wound be twelve inch above the point that holman have aim at with one eye and the three dancer hold he upon he foot and the blood drip from the wound he kick we furiously howl unspeakable imprecation as he drive he heavy boot against we rib we have meet the real leith at last the devilishness that we have sense behind the lustreless eye blaze forth in full fury and to I familiar as i be with all the weird and wonderful curse phraseology use by the skipper and mate of the island boat he anathema impress I as be the most blood curdling oath that have ever come to my ear the man be a devil at that minute he tremendous strength make the restrain effort of the other four useless and we be in danger of be kick to death if a merciful interruption have not stop he the horrified professor who be sit upright during the exhibition of brutality lift up he voice in protest and he shrill denunciation bring a cry out of the surround gloom father father where be you father it be edith herndon 's voice and the note of agony in the word madden I i drive my tooth into leith 's left leg as he stand quiet for a second near my head and the brute use the sole of he right boot to loosen my grip there be no gentle way about the devil as edith 's cry be repeat he have administer a farewell kick to holman and I and shout a order in the same strange dialect which the dancer have use in address I in the cavern of the skull when the robe of parrot feather have save my life the three native immediately grip we by the heel and we be drag off into the bush it seem to I that edith herndon 's cry be repeat again and again as the native drag I at a jog trot through the undergrowth there be untold anguish in the cry it be plain that leith have take the unfortunate old professor some distance from he daughter so that they could not listen to the conversation and the scientist 's high-pitched protest against we maltreatment have cause the terror-stricken girl to think that leith be ill-using they father i imagine that the big ruffian have rush we away from the spot lest the two woman would escape from soma and run to the assistance of they father but i know that we be thankful that the interruption put a end to the football tactic in which the infuriate devil be indulge but we have escape from the frying pan to find ourselves in the flame the three dancer feel that the fate have give they a chance to avenge they friend and they take full advantage of the opportunity so that each would have a proper share in the burden they place we side by side strap we ankle together and then pass a rope through the strap the three lay hold of it and set off through the night tow we behind with a absolute disregard for we feeling they enter into the fun of the thing no norwegian peasant ever tow home a yule log with a greater exhibition of joy than those savage display as they haul we through the thicket they have a contempt for open place they choose the most intricate path they could find and if a tough liana grip holman or I around the throat the fiend find great fun in strain upon the rope till the wire-like creeper give way we suffer unbearable torture hour after hour we be jerk over the ground we clothes be strip from we back we face be tear and bloody from the thorn and we tormented flesh protest through every nerve against the treatment once holman put a question in a hoarse whisper where be they take we he ask god know i gasp it be my fault verslun why i groan i miss he i miss he i -- he voice die away in a choke sob and i imagine he swoon away as we be be tow by the leg i guess that holman be suffer excruciating pain from the limb that he have injure by the fall from the maupei tree and the lapse into unconsciousness come as a bless relief to I the rush through the jungle seem a superlative nightmare my mind play trick with I i think that the three black form leap along in front be a trinity of devil who be order to torture I for my stupidity in allow edith herndon and she sister to leave the yacht every creeper become a whip wield by a mock phantom and i be force to confess that i have a vivid recollection of cry to heaven for pardon for my criminal negligence every horror that the happening of the previous forty-eight hour have germinate within my brain spring into lusty be as my mind tremble upon the abyss of insanity and edith herndon be the person that the legion of horror threaten i come to my proper sens to find that we towing trinity have call a halt holman be repeat a question over and over again and i endeavor to moisten my dry throat so that i could answer where be we he groan where be we be you dead verslun open you eye and take a look around my peeper be bung up i manage to open my eye but i could see nothing but the encompass jungle for a few minute i think that we be alone then i make out the three figure crouch in front of we upon the grass they head be turn away from we and they be face the east where the faint luminous glow of the rise moon be just begin to appear in the sky the three be motionless they be squat upon they ham and they attitude seem uncanny when i compare it with the mad film of action which my mental machinery have record during the precede hour they have stop for some purpose but that purpose i could not determine be they there ask holman yes i murmur what be they do sit in a line stare at the hill the youngster give a grunt turn he head till he manage to wipe the mud and blood from he eye upon my shoulder then he peer at the silent three they motionless form fascinate he it be hard to connect they with the three bound devil who have bring we on a gallop that be more painful than the bareback ride which the polish nobleman give to the intriguing mazeppa what do you make of it he whisper they be rest perhaps not they they look as if they be hatch some new villainy minute after minute creep by but the three remain inactive they take no notice of we whisper conversation no hindu yogi ever sit meditate with the absolute immovability of the three and as we wound stiffen under the cold night air we become foolishly angry at the wait if we have to meet death it would please we to get it over as soon as possible if i could have one more fling at they groan holman by all that be holy verslun i feel that i could fight a million if these rope be off I he endeavor to get he face down to the bandage on my wrist but we have be strap in such a manner that it be impossible to reach any of the rope with we tooth so we lay quiet and review the legion of torment thought that march through we mind the jungle like the three native seem to be wait for a happen the silence be more horrible than the thunder of a earthquake it seem to well out from the silent three till we long with a great longing for some terrific and prolonged noise to shiver it and send battalion of echo to chase it into the hill the moon peer above the black cliff and the surroundings become more distinct we be on the edge of a clearing and there be something vaguely familiar about the tree that we cramped position allow we to see we feel certain that we have pass this place on we journey from the yacht and each minute that pass strengthen the conviction seem to I that i have see that tree before muttered holman i hold the same impression i say and those rock remark the youngster why we be go back to _ the waif _ the three native rise together at that moment and grip the rope we give a joint groan of agony as we stiffened limb be jerk forward and as we be pull from the fringe of reed-like grass we exact whereabouts be make know to we stand up against the moon the rim of the orb show just above the massive top be the great stone table that holman and i have climb two night before -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xvii beneath the centipede the native move at a slow walk across the clearing and for this little indulgence we be exceedingly thankful there be no grass cover upon the bed of coral rock in the middle of which the singular structure stand and we bleeding body could have hardly stand a swift gallop across the prickly surface as it be we be immensely glad when the trinity halt in front of the edifice say murmured holman do you remember what the professor say about this place the other night when he be speak about sacrificial altar i groan as a intimation that the subject be not a pleasant one but holman want to make public admission that he have exhibit gross ignorance in ridicule the professor 's assertion i think he be hand it out too strong verslun he murmur but it strike I now that he have the right dope about this infernal thing i believe they be go to settle we i groan again holman 's airy manner of discuss we predicament annoy I i hate the professor for make the remark about sacrificial stone when he draw comparison between the table and aztec altar because i now think that the very fear plant within my brain would carry a thought suggestion to the three devil who have we prisoner under ordinary circumstance i be not deficient in physical courage but we position in front of the strange monument on the isle of tear leave I with the valor of a jack-rabbit the terror generate by the surroundings bit into my system like a acid what i be wonder at continue holman be about that guy that we see on the top of the place how he get away be a mystery it be i reply i do not feel disposed to trust myself to make a longer comment at that moment well they be go to start operation say the youngster we be go to the top verslun it be plain that we be two of the native have shin up one of the pillar by means of small notch in one corner and now the other cut the band that tie we together promptly attach holman 's foot to the rope he comrade lower and signal that all be ready by clap he hand the youngster be quickly jerk upward and in a few minute i be beside he on the moss-grown sloping surface of the immense stone the three dancer be evidently impressed with the importance of the work they have in hand they movement on the stone become more dignified and solemn they move around we in a manner that would have provoke laughter at any other time and we watch eagerly for development with much care they place we side by side on the upper part of the stone but holman 's foot be turn to my head and as we be place crosswise upon the inclined surface my body be a few inch lower than he that we be to be sacrifice appear to be a certainty at that moment but the method by which we be to be send into eternity puzzle we not one of the three have a weapon the surface of the stone be as bare as it be upon the night that we have investigate it and we begin to think that death by starvation and thirst would probably be we fate but thought of such a end be soon put aside two of the savage slip from the stone while the other drop upon he stomach and hide he face that something be go to happen we feel certain but we could not discover the slightest clue that would guide we puzzle wit to a solution we expect death but we could not guess in what manner the job be to be perform look as if something be come verslun cry holman i be a fool to miss he old man but i guess -- oh gee the final exclamation be cause by a happen immediately beside we a section of the moss-grown stone about eight foot long and eighteen inch in width start to rise slowly and when we astonished eye fall upon it we know that we have the solution of the strange appearance of the figure upon the table on the night we camp in its shadow holman have see this movable slab rise above the top of the table but it have return to its groove before we have climb the tree and it have fit so closely into its moss-grown bed that we have be unable to detect a crevice in the moonlight we have be on the verge of a discovery but as we recall the incident lie there helpless we be doubtful if it would have save we from the fate we expect the note which soma have drop give full confirmation to all we suspicion concern leith yet we have be unable to hold we own against he one end of the slab remain stationary after it have rise a few inch from its bed but the other end which be nearest we go up and up push by some screwjack arrangement that lift it with slow jerky movement till it be nearly upright the moonlight fall upon the under surface that be turn toward we and we understand the manner in which leith 's friend have arrange for we to make we exit from this world the bottom of the stone slab have be carve into a perfect representation of a centipede and as the slab remain stationary just before it reach the perpendicular i begin to dive into my mental reticule for the scrap of prayer that have be catch and hold through a rather checkered career in place where the efficacy of prayer be look upon with a cold eye the prostrate savage rise slowly when the movement of the slab have cease and very tenderly he roll holman and I over the bed from which the stone have be lift he push we body against the wooden post that fitting into a slide groove on the body of the stone centipede have lift the thing upright and to make certain that we would be in the exact center of the depression when the stone come back to its proper rest place he strap we carefully to the support with piece of ramie fiber so that we could not move a inch with face turn upward we stare at the carve figure above we and the insecure tenure we have upon life at that moment be impress upon we mind by the extreme caution which the officiate wizard exercise in keep he own body clear of the slab lest he brethren who be evidently operate the clumsy mechanism from some place nearby should let the stone centipede return to he home without give he proper warning at last he finish the business to he satisfaction and step backward my imagination make the thing above I tremble as i look at it with eye of fear the part of my body that span the depression become numb and i breathe with difficulty holman break the silence good-bye verslun he say cheerfully it be mighty tough to go out like this but it be the fortune of war i endeavor to answer he but the word as if afraid of the horror that loom above I refuse to come out of my throat the fiendish manner in which we be to be kill unmanned I the slab paralyzed thought and it seem to I that only the inmost kernel of my be a very pin-point of the refine essence of life be throb within my body the officiate wizard step around we for a final survey he glance keenly at the position of we body and evidently satisfied that the centipede have every opportunity to make a good job he fling himself down upon he face and start to murmur softly in the strange dialect which leith have speak when address the three earlier in the night and which the dancer have use in the cavern of skull i remember that i try during those few minute to catch a word or two of the queer tongue and curiously enough in that moment of extreme peril i endeavor to connect it with some of the dialect i have hear during my long stay in the island the soft mutter seem to be a thread connect we with life itself and i dread the moment it would cease i do not know how long the chant continue it rise and fall a soft rhythmic murmur and i pray that it would never end my ear suck it in as if it be a life line to which my soul be clinging and i dimly understand my eagerness to catch the sound my ability to do so seem to be want as proof to convince my half-paralyzed body that i be still alive the low chant end with a little throaty cry and i shut my eye tight to save myself the final moment of agony which the fall of the stone would bring for a instant there be absolute silence then some one grip I by the leg and pull madly the ramie fiber hold my body to the support post of the centipede and i hear holman give a muttered order a knife saw the cord a pair of hand grip my heel and fling I forward and as i fall clear of the groove the stone horror crash back into its bed with a jolt that shake the huge table i open my eye to see kaipi look at the face of the dancer he have stab in the back as the brute be mutter he prayer oh hell say the fijian I think he soma I make mistake I go kill soma he kill tonus tonus all same my brother work long time with I at suva hurry up and cut these rope cry holman there be two more of those devil and they 'll be back before we get the cramp out of we muscle kaipi spring to obey but when we bond be cut away we find that we could not get to we foot leg and arm be completely numb and the many abrasion that we have come by during the towing process to which we have be subject make kaipus 's effort to restore circulation by rub a species of torture that would surely have earn the commendation of torquemada if it have be bring under he notice narrow squeak verslun remark holman as he endeavor to get to he knee i wonder where those two other devil go to work the machinery they must be close i whisper drag we over to the edge kaipi they 'll surely come up to see how the job be do or to see what be delay they pal kaipus help we over to the edge of the table and while he be do so he related briefly how he come to be on hand at the opportune moment we little expedition to the stone table have pass the fijian soon after the trinity have take we in tow and kaipus 's eye have mistake the biggest of the three native for soma revenge for tonus 's death be the one motive that inspire he he have follow the procession watch from the bush till the other two dancer have leave soma 's double with we on the top of the table and have then climb quietly up and knife the officiate wizard while that person be exhort the stone centipede to make a good job of holman and I the matter of we rescue have be a afterthought strictly speak he deserve no great amount of praise for drag we out of danger as he frankly admit that he be wait for a good chance to attack the person who resemble soma without have any particular worry whether the stone slab would descend before the opportunity arrive never mind kaipus say holman peer cautiously over the edge of the table i be satisfied that you be handy at the moment without consider whether you come to help we or for some other purpose tonus all the same brother to I mutter the fijian dimly understand the meaning of the remark I kill soma pretty damn soon quite so murmured holman we 'll give we consent to that operation but keep quiet for the present till we two friend come back to see how neatly the old centipede fix we we remain silent but not inactive as we wait for the miss pair we rub we limb carefully and at the end of ten minute we begin to feel alive we revolver have be lose from we pocket during the mad rush through the night -- leith have be too intent on kick we to order he guard to search we for arm -- and now we have nothing but we bare hand with which to do combat with a pair of dancer but we think we could do a lot with bare hand when we glance at the spot where the stone centipede have crash back to its bed a vision of that devilish carve standing above one in the moonlight be enough to stimulate a person to herculean task when he understand that failure would bring he again under its ghastly shadow for about twenty minute we wait patiently kaipi have assert that the two savage have slip into the jungle growth after they have leave the table and it be evident that they have go to some underground passage that connect with one of the pillar of the altar through which the crude mechanism for lift the stone slab have be operate with one eye always to the dramatic the wizard of the long ago have build the altar so that the common worshipper surround the place on day when the centipede be call upon to mash some unfortunate victim could not see how the slab be lift and would thus put the uplifting of the thing down to supernatural agency it be the tribal houdin who lay the foundation of many a strange belief amongst savage race must be wait for he to come to they say holman we 'll give they a few minute longer it be kaipus 's sharp eye that make the discovery the pair come cautiously out of the bush immediately underneath the tree which holman and i have climb to obtain a view of the surface of the table two night before and they cross the clearing with hesitate step they evidently expect the officiate wizard to announce in sport phraseology that the centipede have win the engagement with one swift blow to the body and when no news be forthcoming they be puzzle they confab in the center of the clearing and then hail the table in the strange tongue receive no answer they again debate with much vigor and finally take they courage in they hand they come forward with quicken step we creep close to the edge careful not to peer over while the pair be climb up as far as i be aware we have no plan make for they reception holman and i have no weapon neither have the two dancer kaipi have the ugly short-bladed knife with which he have dispatch soma 's double the puffing of the climb pair come to we they come near and nearer a black arm come up over the edge of the table and claw at the moss-grown stone but while holman and i reach forward with the intention of grip the climber by the throat kaipi upset we plan by drive the blade of the knife into the back of the huge paw that be endeavor to get a grip a tremendous howl of pain come from the owner of the hand the pinion member be tear from beneath the blade and as we push we head over the edge the top climber fall backward sweep he companion from the pillar and the pair strike the coral rock beneath the table with a thud that be suggestive of broken bone the native with the skewered hand pick himself up and dash toward the tree but the other remain at the foot of the pillar and he position lead we to believe that he neck have be break by the fall my knife cry kaipi he knock my knife down the fijian swing himself over the edge and with monkey-like agility slip down the pillar he shout up to we that he think that the man on the ground be dead but have find he precious knife he proceed to set all doubt upon the matter at rest soma better dodge that little fire eater mutter holman i think he a coward last night but it look as if he be a fighter when once he get start as we be unable to slip down the stone pillar in the same manner as the native we find the piece of rope by which the three dancer have haul we up to the top and make it secure upon a stone projection we lower ourselves to the ground now say holman we must make a new start and if we get beat in this round we deserve all that the big fiend who have bring all this trouble about can do to we kaipi you be a friend of mine for all time shake hand the grinning fijian shake hand with both of we and we move toward the tree head in the direction of the spot where leith have kick we so vigorously a few hour before -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xviii barbara 's messenger we have a healthy respect for the deviltry of leith and he friend as we turn we back upon the lonely throne of the centipede but the cry of father which edith herndon have utter be still ring in we ear and we be anxious to get within hit distance of the big treacherous ruffian a mental review of the engagement make we feel rather light-hearted as we push through the tangle if there be only six native dancer upon the island at the opening of the conflict in the cavern of skull we have reduce that number to one while the bullet in leith 's shoulder would depreciate he fight ability for some time outside the carrier who as far as we know be neutral in the matter we have as opponent leith one eye soma and the dancer whose hand have be puncture by kaipus and the knowledge that we be more evenly match bring we some consolation but the fact that edith and barbara herndon be in the power of the scoundrel bring thought that cast a damper upon the little scrap of joy we derive from reckon up the casualty of the enemy the passion which leith display after receive holman 's bullet make we run forward like madman each time we recall the diabolical frenzy that he exhibit we could not think of a good plan to circumvent the brute the jungle hamper and madden we and although we know that we have go about we work in a blunder fashion the circumstance be such that we could not improve we strategy in the future we plunge on till nearly midnight then holman call a halt we must sleep he say one can watch while the other two get some rest kaipus who declare that he be never less inclined for slumber agree to take first watch and holman and i flung ourselves down upon the grass we have have no slumber on the previous night and the incident in which we have take part have leave we exhaust it be daybreak before kaipus awaken we and the face of the fijian informed we that something have alarm he he be stretch full length on the ground listen as only a native can listen and we wait for he report we have much respect for kaipus 's hearing after check the signal he make concern the approach tivo dancer on the previous afternoon what be it ask holman some one go by much hurry murmur the fijian we crouch in the bush and listen it be hardly likely that leith have change he route and the only person that we know to be in we neighborhood be the dancer if we could get hold of he we might use the third degree on he to guide we to the spot that leith be make for say holman we 'll be outgenerall completely if he get into those cavern on the hill if he have provision he can snap he finger at a regiment i agree with he on that point the valley inside the basalt cliff and which as far as we could judge could only be enter by the slippery pathway in the vermilion pit be about the finest natural hiding place in the world without take the cave into consideration the luxurious vegetation in the cup between the hill make the finding of a person a matter of extreme luck it be a marvellous maze that nature seem to have construct especially for the diabolical work in which leith be engage kaipus 's ear be still to the ground and the anxious look upon he face convinced we that some one be close come back again breathe the islander one man walk slow we own ear acquaint we of the approach at that moment the sound of crackle twig be quite close and we wait breathlessly eye the green curtain through which we expect the unknown to thrust himself a black head bob through the leaf and holman plant a fist between the newcomer 's eye before the head could be withdraw the morning visitor drop to the ground and the three of we promptly fall upon he the bloodthirsty kaipus have to be restrain by main force from give another exhibition of neat knifework who be it ask holman get back kaipi and let I see we drag the panting prisoner into the light but instead of the escape dancer we find that we have trap one of the five carrier a big raretongan name maru who be possess of enormous strength holman 's punch have be no light one and it be a few seconds before the mist have clear from the raretongan 's brain then he big brown eye light up with a smile of gladness and he nod to holman I want you he say quite so muttered holman but i get you first maru smile the smile of the man who have a card up he sleeve and he fumble in the fold of he sulu till he find what he want with a dramatic flourish he draw from the cloth a small emerald ring that belong to barbara herndon and he smile childishly as he see the look of astonishment upon holman 's face as he snatch the trinket why -- who -- how the devil do you get this he ask little missee give I reply maru still convulse with the humor which he childish mind find in the situation she tell I come alonga you holman pour out a torrent of question which the smile messenger endeavor to answer to the best of he ability in pigeon english he inform we that he have desert leith 's camp about midnight that the big ruffian have turn abruptly from the direction he be move in at the time we catch up with he and that holman 's bullet have cause he serious inconvenience the two girl and the professor be in charge of soma and the one-eyed white man who we now learn be deaf and dumb it be while one eye be on guard that barbara herndon have be able to bribe the raretongan to throw the strength of he muscle upon we side of the argument holman with lover-like longing for anything own by the lady of he choice attempt to put the emerald ring in he pocket but maru object strongly the smile flee from he face and he broken english nearly strangle he in he effort to pour out enough of it to acquaint holman of the nature of the agreement which he have enter into with barbara herndon I only show you ring that be all he cry you look know little missee send I ring mine all time you give back you have better give it back to he i caution he have get the idea into he head and it will take a lot of argue to convince he that miss barbara do not give it to he to keep but she do not cry holman why would she give he a ring she just give he a loan of it to let he see that she have send he to we my ring all time protest maru that my pay fight mighty good for you give it up to he i advise he be only a overgrown child and he have set he mind on it but verslun i know she would not do that protest the lover barbara send I this as -- oh i know i cry but we want fighter now and maru be a pretty athletic person I damn good fighter cry the raretongan I plentee good fighter if I get ring holman give up the trinket with a snort of disgust and a few minute afterward when we be tramp along i make it my business to drop back beside maru and advise he to keep the ring out of the youngster 's sight till we have rescue miss barbara if the native have display he reward it be highly probable that the lovesick holman with nerve on the raw edge from want of sleep and worry would have pounce upon the mighty maru and endeavor to obtain possession of what he fondly think be a token of affection from he beloved but the arrival of the messenger be worth more than the emerald ring to we at that moment he have more woodcraft than kaipus who have spend most of he time upon the ocean and he information regard the direction in which leith be now head save we many weary hour of march yam and guava with wild passion fruit make a breakfast and dinner as we claw we way in pursuit at midday we judge that we be hot upon the trail unless leith have change he course but the black cliff be close to we at that moment and the recollection of the gloomy cavern make we silent as we push through the matted jungle we could see no trace of the path which leith would be compel to cut to enable the two girl to get through and we hear no sound a lone parrakeet startle we with its harsh cry as it rise from a maupei tree and the bird even seem to recognize that it have commit a breach in send its unmusical cry out upon the awful quiet of the place kaipus climb a tall tree in the vain hope of catch sight of leith 's party as it cross the small clear space in the middle of the impenetrable growth but nothing except the green plain of bushy top and parasitical creeper be visible as we wait beneath the tree the ticking of a wood bug sound like hammer blow in the tremendous quietude while the bursting of a pod remind one of the beginning of a fourth of July celebration we have lose all trace of leith and now immediately in front rise the cliff and we see a menace on they dark forbid front the base of the hill present the same nearly perpendicular formation that we have meet when endeavor to reach the long gallery and we hold a council to decide on what would be the best course to pursue maru be confident that leith be head for this particular point at the moment that barbara 's bribe cause the raretongan to desert and it be reasonable to think that the ruffian have retire to some hiding place to nurse he wound and decide upon the fate of the professor and he two daughter from the scrap of conversation which we have overhear before holman interrupt the argument between leith and the scientist we think it probable that the old man would visit the centipede upon the big table if he do not sign the papers that leith require while we shudder at the probable fate of the two girl unless providence direct we as to the manner in which we could effect a rescue we must divide say holman i 'll take kaipus and go north you take maru and go in the opposite direction if you find the trail camp near it and send maru on the run back to we i 'll do the same if i strike the spoor of the big devil it be about two o'clock as nearly as we could judge when we separate we agree to keep as close as possible to the rocky wall so that a messenger from one would have less difficulty in locate the other and maru and i find before we have go a hundred yard that the nearer we could get to the cliff the quicker we could get along the liana find it difficult to get a grip upon the rock and we could worm we way without much trouble we have travel about three quarter of a mile when the native drop upon he knee and i immediately follow he example the ordinary polynesian be not to be compare with the australian black fellow or the american indian in he knowledge of the forest but maru be a exception he sight and hearing be abnormally keen and he examine the grass carefully one man go by here pretty short time ago he whisper native i ask no he wear shoe the raretongan crawl forward on he knee he face close to the grass the track upon the soft grass show that the person be move in the direction we be go and for about twenty yard we follow cautiously leith the one-eyed white man and the professor be the only three man on the isle of tear outside holman and myself who would be wear shoe it be hard to think that the professor or leith would be alone at that moment so i conclude as we crawl along in the shadow of the cliff that the track be make by one eye maru suddenly spring to he foot and stand listen i listen too into the awful silence come a tremendous rumble that increase each second till i picture it as a cancer of noise grow with appalling rapidity within the encompass stillness what be it i gasp why it be -- i understand at that moment and i spring toward the jungle but the big hand of the raretongan grip my shoulder and drag I close to the cliff beneath a overhang ledge stay here he yell raise he voice above the tumult that seem to be come out of the heaven keep close much the noise be deafen the black cliff seem to rock behind we and as maru pull I down on my knee five hundred ton of rock shot from the height and flatten ten square yard of the packed shrub immediately in front of we now scream maru as the dust sweep in under the ledge and nearly choke we we get away quick plenty dust they can not see the dirt and small rock have roll back upon we till we stand ankle deep but the native 's advice be good hug the wall of the cliff we run back on we track till we have pass the area devastate by the landslide then we spring into the bush and peer up at the cliff high above the cloud of dust that be still rise from the ground and lean forward so that he could view the extent of the avalanche be the one-eyed white man maru i whisper go back and get holman i 'll wait here till you come -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xix leith score the one-eyed man stand for a long time contemplate he handiwork from he point of observation he watch the pile of rock and the surround bush and the absence of movement convinced he that the job have be well do he commence to make facial contortion as a outlet for the mirth he be generate inside and at interval he manage to produce a peculiar noise that remind one of the bubbling of a camel i begin to think that one eye besides be deaf and dumb be suffer from a shortage of gray matter inside he ugly-shaped head he strut up and down and narrowly escape toppling over the ledge through attempt a cake dance as a grand finale to the insane action prompt by the successful manner in which he have engineer the landslide the afternoon have lengthen out before maru return with holman and kaipus and we hurriedly consider the best course to pursue one eye have be with leith when maru desert so it be obvious that we be not far from the ruffian 's hiding place if we could catch this lunatic on the cliff mutter holman gee we could tickle he with kaipus 's old knife blade till he run we right into the haunt he be deaf i say there be a good chance of rope he in if we could scale the cliff I climb say maru he not hear I climb all alonga track drop down breakem he neck no do not break he neck growl holman we want he as a guide do you understand he know where leith be hide and if we could get hold of he it would be clear sailing maru borrow kaipus 's knife nod confidently as we adjure he to use caution and then slip back along the track so that he could climb to the level of the one-eyed person 's perch before attempt to creep upon he we sit down to await development the witless one be evidently a lookout and it be advisable to wait and see the success of maru 's expedition before we attempt to move it be a long wait maru do not intend to take any chance by close in hurriedly and it be nearly two hour after he departure before we see he head rise above a boulder high up over the spot where one eye be keep he vigil it be evidently not the first time that the native have stalk a human being and he fine tactic which should have call forth praise severely try the small amount of patience that we possess holman curse softly beneath he breath as maru sit for ten minute at a time study the route before attempt to move from a shelter rock and my own nail burrow into the palm of my hand as i watch the raretongan be a genius in he own particular line and i think he take more than ordinary precaution so that he success would prove to holman that barbara herndon have not overpay he when she present he with the emerald ring as a reward for he desertion from leith maru have no idea of the sentimental view of the matter which the youngster take and he think that holman 's objection against the bargain be cause by the thought that no service could be render that would be half as valuable as the trinket the unsentimental savage could not imagine that the unstrung lover want the ring as a keepsake of the girl who have win he heart on board _ the waif _ caesar 's ghost why do not he hurry cry holman that madman look as if he be go to change he camping ground it look as if the witless one be really go to move and maru have still some fifty yard to cover before he would be directly above the other 's head we nerve be in such a state that we feel inclined to scream out to the patient stalker if we could grab the scout we could probably induce he by gentle persuasion to act as guide but if he escape we we picture ourselves stumble over precipice and through dark cavern with the same lack of result as have mark we trip to the place of skull maru be decrease the distance by inch slowly very slowly with all the serpentlike cunning of the savage he advance till he be almost above the spot where the other stand take a survey of the jungle but it be a farewell glance for one eye if leith have place he there to keep watch till he have reach a safe position the watcher evidently consider that the time be up he hop to another ledge with the agility of a goat and holman groan maru notice the retreat and quicken he movement drop cautiously from ledge to ledge he creep upon the other with the swiftness of a leopard creep upon its prey one eye 's deafness leave he at the mercy of the shadow in he rear swiftly take cover whenever the white man 's head move to the right or the leave the native decrease the distance and we rise to we knee then maru spring he muscular right arm go round the neck of the white and we be rush toward the cliff without wait to see the outcome of the struggle the raretongan 's strength be immense and we know that the other could not break the strangle hold that have be put upon he we be more afraid that one eye would be choke into insensibility before we reach the post the big native be sit astride he captive when we gain the ledge and the prisoner be blinking he one good eye as he stare up at he we drop down beside he and take a look at the sun-tanned face he exhibit no fear and the weak watery eye show no glint of intelligence it be plain that he brain be slightly deranged holman jerk he into a sit position and with sign and gesture we endeavor to explain what we want he to do neither of we understand the deaf and dumb alphabet but the alphabet be hardly necessary with much pantomimic action we describe leith the professor and the two girl and kaipus enjoy himself immensely by wave he knife in front of one eye 's face to signify the fate that await he if he do not immediately guide we to the spot the fijian be so proud of the blade that he could hardly be prevent from bury a inch of the steel in the prisoner 's body one eye although obviously half-witted saw that kaipi be only look for a excuse to send he to a more undesirable place than the isle of tear and he make eager sign that he would act as we guide holman relieve he of the revolver and cartridge he have in he pocket strap he arm behind he and with maru 's hand clutch the collar of he coat we signal to he to step forward and step lively if he wish to delay he journey to the other world till he soul be in a better condition the sun be close to the high ridge in the west and we wish to close with leith before nightfall one eye tax we climb power in the next ten minute with the agility of a chamoix he scurry along the narrow ledge and several time maru be force to check he speed so that we could keep pace with he holman 's face show the joy he feel at receive another opportunity to retrieve the blunder we have make in we two previous attack now we have reduce the big villain 's fight bodyguard to two person soma and the dancer and if he have not impressed the carrier we outnumber he but leith be on he own ground and we have already discover that the isle of tear make a ideal retreat for a outlaw the nearly impassable jungle surround by the cliff that be tunnel with tremendous cavern make a hiding place in which a few man could defy a army one eye move along the side of the cliff for about five hundred yard then turn into a small caon hardly thirty foot wide the bottom of which be about twenty yard above the valley from which we have climb we intuition tell we that we be near the retreat and we halt the hurrying guide and in the shelter of a boulder explain to he with more sign and gesture that we wish to proceed with extreme caution the end of the gulch that be not more than a stone 's throw from the face of the cliff be already dark with the shadow of the hill and as we suspect that the open to leith 's refuge be close we wish to make no unnecessary noise in approach it use the scatter rock as cover we advance slowly but before we reach the end the sun have disappear and the absence of twilight noticeable in that latitude compel we to crawl along in a darkness that make it impossible to discern any object that be more than three foot distant holman be on one side of one eye while maru guard he on the other side and as the bottom of the gorge make it impossible for more than three to move abreast kaipi and i crawl in the rear we be at one eye 's mercy at that moment but the idiot appear to be much impress by the manner in which we have picture the sure and sudden fate that would fall upon he if we suspect he of treachery the mystery of the place grip we as we go forward high above we the star look as if they be float sequin in a sea of dark blue but the star be blot out suddenly and i draw holman 's attention to the fact the youngster get to he foot and grope around in the gloom while we halt till he make a investigation it be impossible to see the face of the half-witted guide to gain any information from he gesture holman stooped and whisper he finding to we we be in a covered passageway he murmur i can just touch the roof by stand on tiptoe as we be in the place we might as well walk instead of crawl we 'll get to the end quicker maru drag one eye to he foot and we push on the air of the place be much sweeter than the atmosphere of the cavern of skull the floor instead of be cover with thick dust as we have find it in the former place be one of clean smooth rock and the wall be perfectly dry i have grip one eye 's left arm while holman be make the examination of the passage and we have not proceed more than twenty yard when he intimate that he wish to turn to the right we allow he to do so and for fully twenty minute he follow a zigzag course that leave we completely nonplus as to the way we have come we could hardly count the number of the turning first to the right then to the left then back again toward the mouth of the place he trot forward with nothing to guide he yet when we check he at certain corner to find out if there be a angle in the path we find that he be right in every instance he be count the number of pace he take between the turning mutter holman no man unless he have the eye of a cat could find he way along this passage keep a grip on he or we 'll never see daylight again we guess that we have walk for over half a mile when the guide stop abruptly in the dark we endeavor to find out what have pull he up short but we try in vain a prick from kaipi 's knife blade would not make he budge a inch and we cluster together and rack we brain to find the solution p ` rap we be up against something whisper holman feel if there be anything in front verslun i walk forward a pace and grope in the blackness my finger touch solid rock it hem we in on all side one eye have walk we to the end of the passage and we have come up against a blind wall i whisper the news to holman and he swear softly maru 's finger tighten on the collar of the prisoner till he breath come in short gasp kaipi move around to the side of the prisoner but i push he roughly back the fijian 's desire to use he knife on all occasion be somewhat irritating what 'll we do ask holman get back i answer he be either fool we or he be lose he way holman grip one eye by the neck and shake he roughly the youngster 's temper be up and it look as if we have waste the hour we have spend in capture the idiot alive and the time lose in follow behind he through the caon and the crooked passage and time be precious when we think of the agony which edith and barbara herndon be suffer in he temper holman forget that the prisoner be deaf and he shout a question at he what the devil be wrong he scream damn you will -- maru interrupt with a cry of astonishment the wall at the end of the passage appear to slide away and stand directly in front of we he big frame outline against a fire of brushwood that blaze behind he be leith holman give a yell of rage and spring forward and leith turn and speed into the gloom in he astonishment at find himself confront by the enemy when the stone door have roll aside holman have forget that he have a revolver in he possession and leith have pass the brushwood fire before i yell out to the youngster to shoot holman fire immediately and leith stagger for a moment we think that he be down but he pick himself up and run on i snatch a blaze pine limb from the fire as i rush by and with the light flicker upon the wall of the place we speed madly after the fly figure that be barely discernible when the blaze branch fling a splinter of light into the gloom holman empty the revolver but the pound of leith 's foot that come back to we prove that he be still run maru and kaipus be halloo far behind but holman and i run side by side we mind unable to think of anything but the capture of the human tiger in front we be gain on he we could hear he labored breathing and i remember with a thrill of satisfaction the wound that he have receive the night before it be only a question of time when we would have we finger on he throat keep it up gasp holman we have get he verslun we have get he it look like it the red glow from the torch enable we to catch a occasional glimpse of shoe move up and down at such a rate that the limb to which they be attach always remain outside the area that be faintly illuminate the momentary view of the footgear together with the maddening _ plop plop _ it make upon the rock raise a insane idea within my brain that we be chase a pair of bewitch shoe that be entice we into the very heart of the mountain the scanty diet and the happening of the two precede day have leave I light-headed the race be unreal i have a idea that the shoe would run on forever and that every yard they cover take I farther away from edith herndon the flame of the pine branch go out and we be leave in utter darkness but the sound of the fly foot still come back to we at time we be so near that holman thrust out he hand as he run and curse softly as the sound seem to draw away from he i 'll have you yet he cry i 'll choke you you devil a chuckle come out of the darkness and at that instant i make a discovery leith be not alone keep time with the clatter of the shoe be a softer tattoo that tell I that a barefooted runner be race beside the man we be pursue holman make the discovery at the same moment soma he breathe and he run faster from some place that seem to be league in the rear come the shout of maru and kaipus but they yell die away and we be convince that they have give up the chase the _ plop plop _ of the shoe cease suddenly and we slacken speed we brain suggest that leith have stop abruptly on the chance of double back before we could pull up and a sweat of terror break out upon we if he double successfully he would reach the stone door through which we have get the first glimpse of he he be turn cry holman we 'll get he verslun after the -- o god _ look out _ holman 's warning come too late the rocky floor over which we have be run drop away from we i pitch forward after the youngster into a gulf of darkness land on my shoulder upon a mass of volcanic ash and clutch vainly at the stuff i roll at tremendous speed down into the bowels of the earth from far above we come the sound of uncontrolled merriment -- the high-pitched shriek of a native rise above the deep bass laughter of leith -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xx the black kindergarten i think we be a thousand year roll down that slope of smother ash it be a quicksand that melt beneath we we drive we arm into it but the stuff slip away like fine wood ash and we go on and on i know holman be in front of I occasionally a curse direct at leith manage to slip out when he mouth be not fill with the smother dust once i shout at he and he answer the cry with a groan that tell I how the happen have affect he the arch ruffian have checkmate we for the third time inside three day we strike the bottom at last and like mole we claw we way out of the pile of soft feathery stuff that come streaming down upon we like a river and for some minute we be busy wipe the fluffy ash from mouth and eye and ear it cling to we like down and with each breath we draw it into we lung till we cough and sneeze from the irritation it produce struggle forward knee-deep in the fine dry powder we reach a spot that be practically clear and for five minute we be busy endeavor to relieve we tortured lung how far do we roll ask holman about half a mile i reply but straight verslun what do you think over a hundred yard i be certain of that well i be go to climb back you can not do it i gasp that stuff be like quicksand all the same i be go to make a try we stumble back to the gigantic ash pile and shoulder to shoulder we make a rush at the immense mountain down which we have roll we could not see it but we feel it rise around we like a flood as we leg sink deeper it come up to we waist -- to we armpit choke and smother we come down we have roll lightly over its surface now we leg bore into it like rod and we struggle vainly to move the pile be like a high snowdrift into which we sink deeper and deeper the more we struggle and wear out with we effort we fight we way clear of the smother ash and make a attempt to review the situation he be beat we groan holman he just trot ahead of we till he have we on the verge of the thing and then he side-step o god what ass we have be we do we best i say we best repeat holman and the man who tell you that he do he best as a excuse for failure should be shoot verslun we could not tell that this infernal trench be in front i grumbled then we should not have chase he like a brace of madman i wonder if maru and kaipus come near it we might call out perhaps they would hear holman yell the name of the two native into the gloom above we but he yell only start a million echo roll through the tremendous fissure in which we be prisoner they turn back say holman they have sense enough to stay with one eye we have not it be no use argue with the youngster he denounce we stupidity till he tongue be too dry to utter the charge he half-crazed brain make against we to divert he thought i propose that we make a attempt to explore the place and without make any choice regard direction we move into the inky darkness we 'll take it in turn to lead say holman gruffly then if one of we topple over a precipice the other have a chance to save himself i 'll take first try at it and if i find that i have push my foot into a hole i 'll yell out a warning i agree and we move forward slowly the chance of ever find we way out of that place seem small at that moment leith have put we in a spot where we would not be likely to trouble he for some time and with bitterness in we heart we stagger along in the dark alternately damn the treachery of the ruffian and we own stupidity we have try to exercise caution but when we review we action it seem as holman have remark that we have use the judgment of child why do not we wait at the door of that place till the brute come out he ask i have no answer to give to the question and after a interval of silence he fire other at I why do you let go of one eye why do not we examine the cavern near the fire before chase he the girl might have be somewhere near the fire do you think they be i do not think so i answer try to soothe he i think leith be the only person at the fire he pick soma up just before we reach the gulf but where be they where have the devil put they god alone know i cry here it be my turn to take the lead in silence we go stumble on into the appalling blackness we could not see the dim outline of each other when we stand only a few inch apart the darkness of the cavern of skull have be relieve by the silver skewer of moonlight but in the night that roll around we there be not a single gleam of light we have no match everything that be in we pocket have be jolt out during the mad jaunt to the stone table and now the revolver and cartridge which we have take from one eye have be lose by holman during the slide down the mountain of volcanic ash that bring we to the bottom of the underground prison we plod on for about a hour then stop simultaneously at first i think that the horror of the situation have affect my brain but the fact that holman have stop abruptly at the same moment as i do choke back the cold fear that have rush upon I i be not insane holman be listen too i seem to feel that the tiny thread of sound which have set my pulse beat madly have also key he up to the highest tension after a minute of intense silence he put a question do you hear anything do you i stammer be we mad verslun he ask hoarsely i think -- he stop and move close to I i hear he quick breathing as he grope to find I verslun do you hear he whisper grip my arm i hear she speak i think i do i breathe perhaps -- perhaps it be a echo for a few minute we stand we ear search for the sound that have disturb we we seem afraid to call out -- afraid to quench the little spark of hope which have suddenly flare up in the despair that fill we breast we know that we ear have lie and we try to lengthen the thrill by remain perfectly silent the sound come again and holman send a wild cry into the night that hem we in we be not insane the spark of hope blaze as we rush headlong forward the silvery voice of barbara herndon have come to we again through the terrible gloom -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xxi together again it be impossible to set down any statement that will enable the reader to form a mental picture of the meeting which take place in that spot of eternal night hand grope for hand in the darkness and sob and cry and word of comfort go out into the silence edith and barbara herndon weep the professor shriek out denunciation of leith and holman and i be nearly choke by the lump that rise in we throat explanation come in broken sentence the professor 's anger prevent he from give the story in detail and the girl be not in a condition to give a lucid account of they suffering since the night we have leave they to investigate the light in the hill we gather from the hysterical utterance however that leith have rush they to the hill on hearing from the escape dancer that we have dodge the fate he intend for we when he have dispatch we to the table of the centipede the reduction in he bodyguard cause he to make immediately for the secret retreat and as he consider it inadvisable to press he argument with the professor and edith at that moment he have lower he three prisoner into the devil chamber into which we have accidentally fall this be the place you mention to I the night you leave the camp say the professor we mention repeat holman in amazement we do not know the place exist till we roll into it but you read it out of the note that soma drop cry the scientist do not you remember where he threaten to put the five baby the black kindergarten i stammer the black kindergarten say the old man that be what the inhuman brute call the place when he lower we into it we be to stay here till i sign papers that will give he possession of my property and till -- till edith consent to marry he he fling the word out into the stillness and for a few minute no one speak the horror of the situation have the same effect upon I as a blow from a sandbag three day before we be in possession of leith 's letter to the one-eyed man in which he have remark that we would be occupant of the place of eternal night and yet we have not be able to avert the fate which the brute have in store for we in case the professor and edith herndon refuse to consider he villainous proposal the professor 's money and the girl 's hand the word make I physically sick and i sit down upon the floor of the place till the dizziness have pass from my brain and food holman put the question but the word seem to come to I from a great distance he tell we he would lower it to we once a day till we -- till we come to we sens say edith herndon quietly we receive we first supply some hour ago she try to speak bravely but the little catch in she voice belie the courageous front which she endeavor to assume under cover of the darkness barbara be silent except for a occasional sob which she be unable to stifle while the professor pour forth he story of leith 's deception when he first meet he in sydney and where the big scoundrel have pour into the ear of the laurel-hungry scientist the tale of skull and ruin which he would find upon the isle of tear the skull and ruin be there but it look as if we would add we own skeleton to the crumble bone of the long-dead polynesian the peculiarity of whose whiten brain case be to supply the subject matter of the learn treatise that be to bring fame to the archaeologist it be a indescribably mournful reunion we could not see each other and when silence fall upon we i have a horrible sensation that the choke depressing darkness of the place be waft edith herndon away from I i long to find and clasp the hand that have take mine the night on board _ the waif _ when i make a offer of my service the professor have explain that the opening through which they have be lower be immediately above they head they have not move from the spot lest they would not be able to find it again to obtain the food which leith have promise to send till they see fit to accede to he proposal and when holman suggest move forward upon a tour of investigation the old man combate the idea vigorously we will lose ourselves and we will never be able to find we way back here to get the food he cry but we will never get out by remain here say holman if he have make the acceptance of those proposal the only grounds upon which he will grant you you liberty i do not see that it will serve any good to remain here take the food he throw down that be true murmured edith and i bless she mentally for the calm way in which she have utter the word the surrounding darkness have no terror for she in comparison to the fate that await she above the manner in which she speak of the sallow-faced rogue convinced I that the proposal that have be make since the time that leith have shine out in he true color have produce a terror which she endeavor to hide from she father and sister but the dark terrify the professor although he view leith 's proposal with the greatest abhorrence the hole above he head appear to he to be the only path back to the outer world and he be afraid to stray there might be another way out of the place say holman can verslun and i make the attempt and leave you three here no no cry barbara please stay here with we i think it will be better if we remain together say edith if you and mr verslun do discover a open it would be exceedingly difficult to find you way back here and if you get out of this place you might not be able to reach the opening through which we be lower perhaps the way to it be know only to leith edith 's argument be sound we find they in that black cavern be purely a accident and it be hardly probable that holman and myself would be able to find we way back to the spot if we go off on a tour of investigation personally i have no desire to leave the girl leith 's deviltry have so impressed I that i consider he capable of anything and if he think we be out of the way i have no doubt that he would take immediate step to break down the courage of the professor and he daughter by means that be familiar to he i could well understand that edith herndon 's love for she father would compel she to sacrifice herself if she see the aged professor in front of the great stone centipede and that might happen at any moment now that leith consider that he have dispose of all active opposition for hour we debate the matter and finally the professor be win over he agree to move forward on a inspection tour of the vast subterranean place the moment the next supply of food come from above and we wait anxiously during the wait holman and i make short trip into the darkness but we be careful that we do not get out of the hearing of the two girl who call at interval so that we would be able to find we way back the place be awe-inspiring its size could only be guess at stone that be fling in a certain direction where the floor slope gradually downward could be hear roll for many minute after they leave we hand we guess that it be early morning when we hear from leith a blaze torch illuminate a round hole about seventy foot above we head and holman and i immediately remain quiet so that the big scoundrel would be in ignorance of the reunion there be no possibility of the torchlight make we presence know it would take a score of torch to enable he to see we leith thrust he head over the edge of the hole while soma hold the torch and with a coarse laugh the ruffian inquire if he victim have change they mind no we have not reply the professor he thin quaver voice sound strangely weak after the deep-throated bellow of the bully on top well you 'll change it soon cry leith i 'll leave you down there for another day or two and then i 'll get you up to do some stunt mind you i mean a proper marriage with miss edith professor _ the waif _ will run we up to the german missionary station while you take charge here for you affectionate son-in-law i open my mouth to fling a answer at the taunt scoundrel but holman surmise my intention and beg I to hold my tongue they 'll get no food if you cry out he whisper do not speak to he man the professor make no answer to the offensive remark and after a few minute ' silence leith draw back and soma start to lower a bundle of food into the dark prison that rope might prove useful whisper holman feel around and see if you can get hold of it before he pull it up the light of the torch which leith hold only illuminate about six foot of the rope as the native pass it into the prison so holman and i stand directly under the opening feel around in the darkness as the bundle of food come toward the ground i have it murmur holman wait till he unhook the bundle we let the rope run through we hand till the package of food touch the rock floor the line have a small hook upon the end and the moment soma feel that the parcel have reach the bottom of the place he dexterously unhook it with a slight jerk and start to haul in now whisper the youngster a big pull we might bring the nigger through the hole we go very close to perform the feat the jolt take the native unaware he fall forward on he knee and barely save himself from drop into the open the rope come toward we with a run but as we pull furiously it stop with a sudden jerk and we know that the other end be tie to some projection on the surface leith laugh derisively and the laugh madden holman he clutch the rope and start to climb rapidly upward i could not see he but i feel he shoe as he wriggle away into the darkness above I and i hold my breath i grip the rope and keep it taut so that leith and soma might not discover the ruse but leith have more cunning than we credit he with after a futile pull at the rope he thrust the pine torch through the hole and as it drop into the cavern it illuminate the figure of holman who be then about fifteen foot from the floor cut the rope roar the ruffian quick soma cut the rope and break the -- fool 's neck holman realize that it be impossible to reach the top save himself a nasty fall by slide down the rope while the native slash at it but he have not touch the floor when the ninety foot of strong manilla come whirling down through the darkness and the rope be not the only gift we receive angry at discover that we have escape death in we plunge into the place leith pour forth a stream of blasphemy that outdo the effort he have make when kick holman and I on the afternoon the youngster have wound he he curse we till the shocked professor drag he two daughter away out of hearing and there we find the three when we have gather up the rope and the food we might as well make a try to explore the place say holman the scoundrel say that he will not send down any more food till you accept he proposal then we 'll never get any say edith herndon quietly i pray that god will show we the way out of this place -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xxii the white waterfall we find the rope exceedingly useful now that we have decide to explore the place in search of a way out it be reasonable to think that the floor of the cavern would contain innumerable fissure into which we might fall and to guard against this we decide to make a life line out of the thirty yard of manilla we have luckily obtain allow about five yard of rope between each two person i tie it in turn around the waist of holman barbara the professor edith and myself and be thus prepare against a precipice in we path holman take the lead and we follow in single file as the tightening of the rope inform each one that the immediate leader be a safe distance in front be there any choice of direction ask holman pause after he have take half a dozen step i do not think so i say unless some one have a intuition regard the path to liberty please let I pick the route murmur edith i be stretch out my arm mr holman will you come here to I and feel the direction i be point in we cluster round the girl each one feel she outstretched arm and then turn quickly toward the point indicate i be glad that no one could see my own face at that moment it be pathetic to think of any one choose a route in that abyss of horror and the trouble which the girl take to make sure that holman would move off in the direction she point bring tear to my eye i -- i might be silly in think it she stammer but i believe -- oh please mr holman try and walk in the direction i point in i certainly will try say the youngster if i go wrong you put I right will you i believe somehow that we be go to find a way out i do not know the right path to it but i have get a premonition we 'll find it now we be off again we move forward with anxious footstep imagination furrow the floor of that place with bottomless crevice and the cold hand of fear grip we heart it require a mental effort to move one foot past the other and whenever one of the girl stumble she little cry of alarm bring untold agony to holman and myself as we take a grip of the rope and brace ourselves against the happen which we excited mind expect any moment we be walk hand in hand with dread -- a dread that become greater when we think that a false step of ours might drag to death the two woman that we love on and on and on we bore into the horrible night with blind footstep we walk fearfully through the stygian wave that roll around we the place seem to be of enormous size and in the dead silence that surround we we footstep wake clatter echo that appear to mock we effort to escape the air in place have a strange odour that remind we of camphor this peculiar smell seem to be in certain strata of the atmosphere through which we pass and whenever we passage through these scented layer be unduly prolong we experience a sensation that i can only liken to the near approach of seasickness it make the girl sick and faint but they walk on without complain we strike the wall of the place after we have be walk for a period that we judge to be about three hour and we decide to rest for a while we sit close together upon the cold floor and endeavor to cheer each other 's spirit by constantly assert that the air of the place make it reasonable to suppose that there must be some other entrance besides the hole through which leith have lower the three and the fissure through which holman and i have roll down the gigantic ash pile and the assertion seem logical the two entrance that we know of open into leith 's retreat and it be hard to think that the air supply of the enormous cavern in which we be wander could come through those two opening we combat we fear with this argument as we eat a morsel of the food we have receive that morning and feeling that he who have the biggest stock of hope have the biggest grip upon life we endeavor to make light of we misfortune as we stumble on again after a short rest but that impenetrable night produce a depression that we could not shake off imagination spring ahead of the moment and picture we final struggle we fight with the nightmare that enter we mind and conversation languish we could not speak while the mental canvas be be rapidly color with scene depict we end in the darkness and the silence where a grim fate would even deny one a last look at a dearly love face a silence come upon we that have the same effect as intense cold each in he own frozen husk of despair plod forward with the idea that the other be so engross in they own thought that they be not incline to answer when address the darkness so completely isolate each person that after some hour of silence it require a tremendous effort to thoroughly convince the mind that one be walk with live people and not with phantom it be after one of these interval of silence that barbara herndon make a discovery that chill we blood she make some commonplace remark to she sister and receive no reply she repeat the observation but it bring no comment the happen seem to drag the rest of we from the strange torpor and we stop we sense that barbara herndon be feel she way toward she sister and presently the younger girl give a shriek of alarm that stir a million echo in that place of terror edith she shriek edith edith where be you holman and i claw fiercely upon the rope move toward each other in a effort to find a quick solution for the mystery we collide violently as we reach the spot where the rope have circle edith herndon 's waist and we stand stunned and speechless as we finger the cord in some manner probably sever by a knifelike projection of rock the loop which i have knot around she body have be cut through and the rope have fall unnoticed from the waist of the weary girl great god i cry where do we lose she what way do we come the question be ridiculous the numbing influence of the place have make we walk for a hour or so in complete silence and it be impossible to say when she have lose she position in the line and now as we move round and round endeavor to peer into the blackness we lose all sense of direction each have a different notion about the way we have come while we be move forward we combined effort to walk straight ahead make it impossible for one to turn and go in a opposite direction but in the few moment of we excitement as we turn and twist in claw for the loop where edith have be tie we become bewildered we do not know in which direction to turn in search for the lose one what 'll we do cry the professor do something quick find she find she i take a great breath and yell she name into the darkness the sound thunder through the place like the noise make by a freight train again and again i scream it and the million devil in the place shriek the name in mockery i exhaust myself in my mad effort to send my voice to she ear holman grip my arm when i have work myself into a insane frenzy and he beg I to be quiet barbara think she hear a answer he cry listen there it be again it be edith she voice come to we like a thread of silver and with no thought of the bottomless crevice that might be in we path we charge blindly toward the spot from which she cry have come it seem age before we meet she the sound puzzle we but at last we grip she hand and the professor and barbara hysterical with joy sob they thanks into the gloom i do not know how the rope become undo cry edith i do not find out that i have become separate from the rest of you till i attempt to draw you attention to the waterfall to the what i question to the waterfall repeat the girl do you pass it it be a beautiful little waterfall and the water flow over a white limestone rock that make it sparkle like so many firefly in the dark i can not explain what happen to I at that moment some veil within my mind be tear away by the few word that the girl have utter i be back upon levuka wharf lie under the copra bag where holman have find I and for a moment i could not speak as the subconscious mind fling a score of half-forgotten incident into my conscious area _ it be the white waterfall _ i yell it be the white waterfall that the maorus sing of on the wharf at levuka he be warn tonus and tonus be kill by soma because he know it be the way out we be save we be save it be on the road to heaven out of black fernando 's hell -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xxiii the wizard ' seat as we stumble toward the spot from which come the sound of run water the incident of the precede ten day seem to be drop into they place within my brain like the piece of a picture puzzle that have suddenly become plain to the eye of the child who be put it together i understand my brain seem burst within my skull it appear to I that god in he own way have make I a blind instrument to do he work the big maorus on the wharf at levuka know of the hell upon the isle of tear the maorus have warn toni the little fijian but fear of what might happen to any one possess the knowledge have make tonus deny that he be the companion of the maorus when he be question before and after he have reach _ the waif _ in a burst of confidence he have confess the truth to I on the afternoon after i have save he from be wash overboard but the confession have be make in the presence of soma and as kaipi assert it have cost tonus he life leith alia black fernando have order the big kanaka to put the possessor of such important information out of the way i repeat over and over again the word which the maorus have address to he woolly head pupil on that hot day at levuka they race madly round in my mind as if exultant because i have find the reason why they persist in store themselves in the cell of my brain the soul within I have know that the knowledge would be want how many pace ask the professor sixty i roar and then seize with temporary insanity i chant the song of the maorus at the top of my voice : sixty pace to the left sixty pace to the left that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven that be the way to heaven out of black fernando 's hell and here be the waterfall cry holman go easy now it must be flow into some hole and we do not want to fall into a abyss just as verslun have discover the way out we advance cautiously toward the spot where as edith have say the water sparkle like firefly in the darkness it be a eerie place we know that the water be there by the sound it make flow over the rock but except for the tiny spark of phosphorescent light that seem to fly out from it we could not see it the spectacle thrill we a million spark of light seem to rise from the bed of feldspar over which the water leap and the peculiar quality of the rock give to it the weird brilliancy which hold we spellbound as we advance with extreme caution it be not white by any means but in those inky depths it would not require a great effort of the imagination to call it white the faint luminous flash be the only particle of light that we have see since leith have throw the half-extinguished torch into the hole that morning and we could hardly turn we eye from the novelty the water fall into a opening in the rocky floor and gurgle away into depths that make we shiver as the distant tinkle come up to we as we creep forward on hand and knee we be all thirsty at that moment but we wish to put the direction of the maorus to a immediate test and we be satisfy to let we longing for a cool drink stay with we till we could prove whether the strangely luminous waterfall before we be the one about which the two native chant the strange song they say to the left do not they ask holman yes i answer i hardly recognize my own voice as i jerk out the word i could not see the face of the girl but i understand what skyscraper of hope they have build upon the announcement i have make when edith have tell of she discovery now as we move around the hole in the floor i understand what a tremendous shock it would be to they if we discover that there be no connection between the fall water and the chant i suppose the left side will be the one upon we left hand when face the fall say holman i suppose so i stammer let we move up close to the side of the water we edge along till we could touch the flash stream that drop from some point high up in the immense roof of the place and then we start to step the distance the professor chatter along behind we while the two girl bring up the rear holman chant the number aloud and a cold sweat break out upon I as he count a fear of my own sanity come upon I i think that this connection between the song and the luminous water might have be suggest by a brain that have suddenly lose its balance under the torture of the precede three day fifty-six fifty-seven fifty-eight -- it be holman 's voice but to my reel brain the sound come from the roof and thunder in my ear like a brazen bell fifty-nine _ sixty _ we stop together and the suppress sob of barbara herndon be the only sound that break the little stillness that follow there be no way out the darkness so it seem to we be thicker than ever nothing do muttered holman i count right do not i i think so i answer huskily sixty pace exactly and here be the wall alongside we my finger grope along the moist rock i feel stunned now that the test have be make it seem insanity to connect a chant that i hear at levuka with a waterfall in a cavern on the isle of tear but why have tonus be kill why have leith exhibit such curiosity about the song when he hear I relate the incident to the two sister on board the yacht my finger come to a crevice in the wall as the question present a bold front to the doubt that have grip I the fissure be some four foot wide and my exclamation make holman put a question what be it he ask nothing i answer wreck hope have make I cautious still i feel certain that i have remember those word for some purpose i recall how they have puzzle I on that hot day and how i have question holman concern pilgrim 's progress when he have rouse I from my sleep well if there be nothing here i be go back to get a drink say holman hold on i stammer as i uncoiled the piece of spare rope from my shoulder i want you a minute there be a split in this rock and i be go to explore it take the end of this rope and hang on have not i better go with you he ask not this trip i answer i have just get a feeling that i would like to see where it lead to hold tight i step cautiously into the narrow passage and immediately find that it narrow to such a extent that i have to turn sideways to squeeze through the floor slope upward and as the rock be damp and slippery i drop upon my knee so that i could climb more rapidly the place seem a narrow chute my knee be skin from the rough bottom but i scratch desperately to obtain a footing hope be still alive the maorus have say that the road to heaven be sixty pace from the white waterfall and if a all-seeing providence have guide edith to the waterfall it be surely decree that we would make we escape from the clutch of the devil who have we at he mercy we will surely escape i muttered as i scratch and claw in a effort to drag myself up the slippery path we will escape i know it we will escape i know -- the muttered word die upon my lip the crevice turn and then broaden suddenly and a blinding flash of light force I to fling myself face downward upon the rock for a moment i lay there wonder stupidly whether something have happen to my eye or whether i have come suddenly into the light of day i have see light -- the light of what slowly i lift my head and the truth come to I with stunning force it be god 's own sunlight that i have see the chute end within three pace of the spot where i lay and immediately opposite the opening through which i look be a patch of vermilion rock that blaze gloriously as the ray of the afternoon sun strike full upon it i know that rock it have thrill I as i look at it on the afternoon when leith have introduce we to the greatest natural wonder of the pacific i be at the end of a passage that open into the vermilion pit from where i lay i could not see the top of the crater when the passage have suddenly broaden the roof come down upon it so that the opening through which i look at the opposite side of the great pit be about ten foot wide but not more than two foot in height a overhang lip of rock prevent I from look up but i understand that i be lower than the slippery ledge of death that we have cross to reach the valley of echo it seem year since we have cross that path yet it be less than a week i thought of the other wait in the darkness and i turn and slide down the chute up which i have scramble the path to liberty be not yet plain but there be fresh air and sunlight at the top of the chute and one could see the face of those they love bump and bound over the jagged rock i go at a terrific speed to the bottom of the slide and scramble through the opening i shout the news to the four who wait there it open into the vermilion pit i gasp i can not see how we can climb out but there be hope -- there be hope i be foolish in make the last statement but the sight of the glorious sunbeam strike down into the abyss have make I blind to the difficulty that be yet to be face and the maorus 's chant must surely be true now that it have bring we to the light i could not but believe that it would bring we to liberty the slippery chute bring a suggestion from holman he advise that the two girl and the professor remain at the bottom while he and i take one end of the rope to the top so that we could haul they up the wet track that i have scale with difficulty we will not be five minute i cry stay where you be till we signal i do not think as holman and i crawl to the top of that place what a eventful five minute that would be but the big thing of life be cram into minute and time be bring the most thrilling one of we life toward we as we scramble up the chute we adventure upon the isle of tear be to have a climax that fit they holman stop as i have do and thrust he face down upon the rock as he eye catch a glimpse of the glittering wall of the crater that come suddenly into view the ray of the sun blaze down upon the stain side of the mysterious pit make the vein of color appear like brilliant snake the patch that be frame by the wall of the opening through which we gaze be a wild riot of scintillating blinding color that dazzle we eye as we stare at they for a minute holman breathe hungrily of the hot air then he attempt to discover we exact position in the crater we must be somewhere near the top he declare do not you remember that the color of the wall darken rapidly below the ledge of death i remember i answer we must be nearly on a level with the ledge if we could look out from under this project piece of rock mutter the youngster it be risky i 'll make a try verslun hold my leg i be go to hang out of this burrow and take a peep around to get we bearing i grip he leg and turn upon he back he push himself slowly out over the edge of the passage till he be able to look up in front of the piece of rock that project like the peak of a cap above the opening cling to this peak with he two hand the upper part of he body be out over the abyss he stare upward and as i watch he face i notice the look of joy and amazement that spread across it what be it holman i cry be we save tell I he slide hurriedly back to safety and pound the rock above he head with he bare fist do you know what this be he yell do you know i try to utter the word that come to my tongue but i could not i could see the joy in the youngster 's eye but i be afraid to speak it be the ledge of death he shout there be only six inch of rock above we then we be save i cry sure if you put the rope around I i can crawl up on it and once there i can haul up the other do you know what soma tell the professor about the bad man fall into this infernal pit i nod my head i be unable to speak at that moment well the wizard of the centipede fix that do not you see this be they seat they lean out of this place as i lean out just now and they grip the ankle of any poor devil they have a grouch against it be devilish -- i put my hand across he mouth and he become instantly mute we hold we breath and listen intently from above we come the faint sound of footstep and a cold perspiration break out upon we some one be walk slowly along the ledge of death the sound cease when the unknown be immediately above we head and a guilty look come upon holman 's face the man on the ledge have probably hear the youngster 's voice and he be puzzle to know where the sound have come from we sit without move a muscle the silence convinced we that the unknown be listen we know that he have not climb from the ledge to the top of the crater the scratch of he shoe against the rock would have come to we ear he be wait -- wait to discover from what direction the voice have come that cause he to pause and listen the minute pass like slow-dragging year the man above wear shoe and the two man who wear shoe outside we own party be leith and the one-eyed man somehow we feel that maru and kaipus have settle with one eye so there be only one person on the isle of tear who could possibly be listen ten minute pass then holman point to he own leg i understand the sign and grip he ankle my head be burst with the terror inspire by the thought that we escape might be cut off after the miraculous manner in which the way out have be show to we without noise yet with incredible swiftness the youngster turn upon he back and wriggle forward till he head and shoulder be again out over the pit he body be tense every muscle show as he stiffen himself into my mind flash a picture of the bloodthirsty wizard of the centipede stretch out in exactly the same manner century before a white man sail into the pacific the silence seem to sap my strength i watch holman with eye that be half-blinded by the perspiration that roll down my forehead there be no movement upon the ledge and the finger of the youngster be reach slowly -- slowly upward it be a yell of horror that shatter the awful quiet -- a yell that go up through the hot air like the shriek of a lose soul it swirl around and around like a lariat of brass it be a terrible yell it wrench my inmost be till the very spirit seem to go out of I for a instant and i return to consciousness to find myself struggle to hold holman from be drag into the depths below it be the youngster 's voice that seem to bring I back to a knowledge of the surroundings in a instant 's pause in the torrent of blasphemy he word come to I clear and distinct hold I tight verslun he cry hold I tight man _ i have he _ -lrb- illustration : hold I tight verslun he cry hold I tight man _ i have he _ -rrb- i shut my eye to escape the fascination of the depths and i grip holman 's ankle till my nail burrow into he flesh i feel he body heave with a tremendous effort then another yell shorter but more terrifying than the first tell I that the struggle be over i drag holman back to safety and stretch side by side upon the rock we listen down in the pit -- mile league away something be fall the youngster pull himself together after the silence have settle upon the place like a film let 's tie the rope and get the girl up here he say quietly in a while -- in a little while -- i can crawl on to the ledge and pull they up with a rope -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter xxiv the way to heaven with quick-beating pulse we fix the rope and shout direction down the slippery passage to the girl and the professor and inside of ten minute they be beside we look out with frightened eye at the color wall of the opposite side of the pit the face of edith and barbara look pale and careworn but they smile bravely when holman assure they that we be within a yard of the path by which we have cross to the valley of echo be brave he say cheerfully you 'll be on you way back to the shore before many hour have pass by there be no -- no danger now i do not know if the two girl understand the meaning of he word but they ask no question somehow i think that they know what have happen those two terrible cry must have reach they ear as they wait at the foot of the chute that lead to the wizard ' seat but if they have any doubt concern they origin they refrain from seek information but the professor know a melancholy that have tie he tongue all through the long day in the black kindergarten leave he as he come to the sunlight and he become light-hearted and merry he feel that he have be relieve of he load of nightmare and the danger of the climb to the rocky shelf above we head do not trouble he in the least it be holman who perform the heroic work on the late afternoon of that eventful day with the rope tie around he waist he push himself out as he have do twice before during the precede hour then grip the edge of the shelf drag himself forward for a moment as he swing over the depths it look as if he would be unable to drag himself up and we cling on to the rope and watch he with frightened eye but youth and courage win the day slowly inch by inch he lift himself the lip of the two girl move in dumb prayer then we lose sight of he as he draw he leg up on to the ledge and we know that we be safe the youngster secure the rope to a projection on the shelf above and the professor nervous but game be the next to make the perilous journey it be blood-curdle to watch the old man sway over the depths while holman lie flat upon he stomach grip he beneath the arm and drag the poor old scientist to safety barbara go next and when the rope be lower once more i secure it around edith 's waist i hold she in my arm as i push she body forward to holman 's strong hand that wait just below the ledge and for one brief instant she lip come close to mine and with a mad wild love that have be bear in danger where there be no time for word i stooped and kiss she and even in that moment of extreme peril a faint smile sweep over she face as she look up into mine and i know that she understand it be nearly sunset when we move away from the top of the vermilion pit but we have not go ten pace when we stop a yell come out of the place then another and another and holman and i rush back to the edge down beneath we on the slippery ledge of death two native be lock in a death grip and a single glance tell we that they be maru and soma the raretongan have chase leith 's brown lieutenant on to the path and now they be struggle like demon in the mad endeavor to thrust each other into the depths quick cry holman the rope he slip the line around he waist as the pair move to the edge maru be drag the big savage with a strength that be surprising but it be a certainty that if soma go over the edge the raretongan would keep he company holman slip down upon the ledge but before he could reach they a dusty bleeding figure stumble through the entrance to the cavern a knife flash in the sunlight and maru be draw back into safety as soma release he grip the newcomer be kaipi he kill tonus he cry tonus all same brother to I toni work with I long time suva tonus the pupil of the maorus who have instruct he on levuka wharf as to the way out of black fernando 's hell have be avenge at last it be a happy reunion we hold upon the edge of the pit edith and barbara bind up the wound of the two faithful native and the muscular raretongan be so touch with they tender ministration that he forage in he tattered sulu and with tear of gratitude in he big brown eye he hand back to barbara the emerald ring with which she have cause he to desert from leith 's service I want no pay from you he cry I work for you all same nothing we learn that the one-eyed white man and the last of the wizard of the centipede have be dispatch by maru and kaipus and we also receive the news that the four carrier have bolt back to the yacht the latter piece of information somewhat dampen we spirit we feel that leith and newmarch be friend and we wonder what the silent thin-faced captain would do when he hear the story of black fernando 's discomfiture on account of kaipus 's weak state we camp that evening on the same spot that we have occupy on the second night upon the isle of tear and at daybreak next morning we set out for the little bay we be all happy the professor be as pleased as a boy on he vacation and he have return again to he task of take note the two girl be radiant kaipus be joyful because the murder tonus have be revenge and maru be in the seventh heaven of delight because barbara have inform he that he could go to san francisco with the party as a reward for he devotion as for holman and myself we forget the loneliness of the place in we joy the same tree peer at we the same cablelike vine grip we leg and the same weird rock mass block we path but love be in we heart and morbid thought be chase away on the afternoon of the second day from the pit we reach the shore of the little bay but _ the waif _ be not there newmarch have evidently discover that leith have not be quite successful in the carry out of he plan and fearful of he own share in the business he have bolt with the yacht the south sea breed piratical thought and from we own knowledge of the captain we guess that in he particular case those thought would be easily generate he think he 'll save he own skin by clear out say holman but i be satisfied that dame justice be a expert with the lariat if he be not in jail before three month be out my name be not will holman it be the missionary schooner _ messenger of light _ that see we beacon upon the island on the fourth day after we have reach the spot where we have land from _ the waif _ the beautiful white vessel hove to outside the entrance to the little bay a boat come ashore and twenty minute after they have first sight we signal we be on the way to wellington new zealand and the ` frisco boat call
