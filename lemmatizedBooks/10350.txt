history of china 1738 there be few nation in the world more talk of or less known than the chinese the confused and imperfect account which traveller have give of they grandeur they science and they policy have hitherto excite admiration but have not be sufficient to satisfy even a superficial curiosity i therefore return you my thanks for have undertake at so great a expense to convey to english reader the most copious and accurate account yet publish of that remote and celebrated people whose antiquity magnificence power wisdom peculiar custom and excellent constitution undoubtedly deserve the attention of the publick as the satisfaction find in read description of distant country arise from a comparison which every reader naturally make between the idea which he receive from the relation and those which be familiar to he before or in other word between the country with which he be acquaint and that which the author display to he imagination so it vary accord to the likeness or dissimilitude of the manners of the two nation any custom or law unheard and unthought of before strike we with that surprise which be the effect of novelty but a practice conformable to we own please we because it flatter we self-love by show we that we opinion be approve by the general concurrence of mankind of these two pleasure the first be more violent the other more last the first seem to partake more of instinct than reason and be not easily to be explain or define the latter have its foundation in good sense and reflection and evidently depend on the same principle with most human passion a attentive reader will frequently feel each of these agreeable emotion in the perusal of du halde he will find a calm peaceful satisfaction when he read the moral precept and wise instruction of the chinese sage he will find that virtue be in every place the same and will look with new contempt on those wild reasoner who affirm that morality be merely ideal and that the distinction between good and ill be wholly chimerical but he will enjoy all the pleasure that novelty can afford when he become acquaint with the chinese government and constitution he will be amaze to find that there be a country where nobility and knowledge be the same where man advance in rank as they advance in learning and promotion be the effect of virtuous industry where no man think ignorance a mark of greatness or laziness the privilege of high birth he surprise will be still heighten by the relation he will there meet with of honest minister who however incredible it may seem have be see more than once in that monarchy and have adventure to admonish the emperor of any deviation from the law of they country or any error in they conduct that have endanger either they own safety or the happiness of they people he will read of emperor who when they have be address in this manner have neither storm nor threaten nor kick they minister nor think it majestick to be obstinate in the wrong but have with a greatness of mind worthy of a chinese monarch bring they action willingly to the test of reason law and morality and scorn to exert they power in defense of that which they could not support by argument i must confess my wonder at these relation be very great and have be much greater have i not often entertain my imagination with a instance of the like conduct in a prince of england on a occasion that happen not quite a century ago and which i shall relate that so remarkable a example of spirit and firmness in a subject and of conviction and compliance in a prince may not be forget and i hope you will look upon this letter as intend to do honor to my country and not to serve you interest by promote you undertake the prince at the christening of he first son have appoint a noble duke to stand as proxy for the father of the princess without regard to the claim of a marquis -lrb- heir apparent to a higher title -rrb- to whom as lord of the bedchamber then in wait that honor properly belong -- the marquis be wholly unacquainted with the affair till he hear at dinner the duke 's health drunk by the name of the prince he be that evening to represent this he take a opportunity after dinner of inquire the reason of and be inform by the prince 's treasurer of he highness 's intention the marquis immediately declare that he think he right invade and he honor injure which he could not bear without require satisfaction from the usurper of he privilege nor would he longer serve a prince who pay no regard to he lawful pretension the treasurer could not deny that the marquis 's claim be incontestable and by he permission acquaint the prince with he resolution the prince thereupon send for the marquis demand with a resentful and imperious air how he could dispute he command and by what authority he presume to control he in the management of he own family and the christening of he own son the marquis answer that he do not encroach upon the prince 's right but only defend he own : that he think he honor concerned and as he be a young man would not enter the world with the loss of he reputation the prince exasperate to a very high degree repeat he command but the marquis with a spirit and firmness not to be depress or shake persist in he determination to assert he claim and conclude with declare that he would do himself the justice that be deny he and that not the prince himself should trample on he character he be then order to withdraw and the duke come to he assure he that the honor be offer he unasked that when he accept it he be not inform of he lordship 's claim and that now he very willingly resign it the marquis very gracefully acknowledge the civility of the duke 's expression and declare himself satisfied with he grace 's conduct but think it inconsistent with he honor to accept the representation as a cession of the duke or on any other term than as he own acknowledge right the prince be inform of the whole conversation and have upon inquiry find all the precedent on the marquis 's side think it below he dignity to persist in a error and restore the marquis to he right upon he own condition continue he in he favor believe that he might safely trust he affair in the hand of a man who have so nice a sense of honor and so much spirit to assert it review of the account of the conduct of the dutchess of marlborough -lrb- 1 -rrb- the universal regard which be pay by mankind to such account of publick transaction as have be write by those who be engage in they may be with great probability ascribe to that ardent love of truth which nature have kindle in the breast of man and which remain even where every other laudable passion be extinguish we can not but read such narrative with uncommon curiosity because we consider the writer as indubitably possess of the ability to give we just representation and do not always reflect that very often proportionate to the opportunity of know the truth be the temptation to disguise it author of this kind have at least a incontestable superiority over those whose passion be the same and whose knowledge be less it be evident that those who write in they own defense discover often more impartiality and less contempt of evidence than the advocate which faction or interest have raise in they favor it be however to be remember that the parent of all memoirs be the ambition of be distinguish from the herd of mankind and the fear of either infamy or oblivion passion which can not but have some degree of influence and which may at least affect the writer 's choice of fact though they may not prevail upon he to advance known falsehood he may aggravate or extenuate particular circumstance though he preserve the general transaction as the general likeness may be preserve in painting though a blemish be hide or a beauty improve every man that be solicitous about the esteem of other be in a great degree desirous of he own and make by consequence he first apology for he conduct to himself and when he have once deceive he own heart which be for the greatest part too easy a task he propagate the deceit in the world without reluctance or consciousness of falsehood but to what purpose it may be ask be such reflection except to produce a general incredulity and to make history of no use the man who know not the truth can not and he who know it will not tell it what then remain but to distrust every relation and live in perpetual negligence of past event or what be still more disagreeable in perpetual suspense that by such remark some incredulity be indeed produce can not be deny but distrust be a necessary qualification of a student in history distrust quicken he discernment of different degree of probability animate he search after evidence and perhaps heighten he pleasure at the discovery of truth for truth though not always obvious be generally discoverable nor be it any where more likely to be find than in private memoirs which be generally publish at a time when any gross falsehood may be detect by live witness and which always contain a thousand incident of which the writer could not have acquire a certain knowledge and which he have no reason for disguise such be the account lately publish by the dutchess of marlborough of she own conduct by which those who be very little concerned about the character which it be principally intend to preserve or to retrieve may be entertain and instruct by the perusal of this account the inquirer into human nature may obtain a intimate acquaintance with the character of those whose name have crowd the latest history and discover the relation between they mind and they action the historian may trace the progress of great transaction and discover the secret cause of important event and to mention one use more the polite writer may learn a unaffected dignity of style and a artful simplicity of narration the method of confirm she relation by insert at length the letter that every transaction occasion have not only set the greatest part of the work above the danger of confutation but have add to the entertainment of the reader who have now the satisfaction of form to himself the character of the actor and judge how nearly such as have hitherto be give of they agree with those which they now give of themselves even of those whose letter could not be make publick we have a more exact knowledge than can be expect from general history because we see they in they private apartment in they careless hour and observe those action in which they indulge they own inclination without any regard to censure or applause thus it be that we be make acquaint with the disposition of king william of whom it may be collect from various instance that he be arbitrary insolent gloomy rapacious and brutal that he be at all time dispose to play the tyrant that he have neither in great thing nor in small the manners of a gentleman that he be capable of gain money by mean artifice and that he only regard he promise when it be he interest to keep it there be doubtless great number who will be offend with this delineation of the mind of the immortal william but they whose honesty or sense enable they to consider impartially the event of he reign will now be enable to discover the reason of the frequent opposition which he encounter and of the personal affront which he be sometimes force to endure they will observe that it be not always sufficient to do right and that it be often necessary to add gracefulness to virtue they will recollect how vain it be to endeavor to gain man by great quality while we cursory behavior be insolent and offensive and that those may be disgust by little thing who can scarcely be please with great charle the second by he affability and politeness make himself the idol of the nation which he betray and sell william the third be for he insolence and brutality hate by that people which he protect and enrich : -- have the best part of these two character be unite in one prince the house of bourbon have fall before he it be not without pain that the reader observe a shade encroach upon the light with which the memory of queen mary have be hitherto invest -- the popular the beneficent the pious the celestial queen mary from whose presence none ever withdraw without a addition to he happiness what can be charge upon this delight of human kind nothing less than that _ she want bowels _ and be insolent with she power that she be resentful and pertinacious in she resentment that she descend to mean act of revenge when heavier vengeance be not in she power that she be desirous of control where she have no authority and backward to forgive even when she have no real injury to complain of this be a character so different from all those that have be hitherto give of this celebrated princess that the reader stand in suspense till he consider the inconsistency in human conduct remember that no virtue be without its weakness and consider that queen mary 's character have hitherto have this great advantage that it have only be compare with those of king the greatest number of the letter insert in this account be write by queen anne of which it may be truly observe that they will be equally useful for the confutation of those who have exalt or depress she character they be write with great purity and correctness without any forced expression affect phrase or unnatural sentiment and show uncommon clearness of understand tenderness of affection and rectitude of intention but discover at the same time a temper timorous anxious and impatient of misfortune a tendency to burst into complaint helpless dependance on the affection of other and a weak desire of move compassion there be indeed nothing insolent or overbearing but then there be nothing great or firm or regal nothing that enforce obedience and respect or which do not rather invite opposition and petulance she seem bear for friendship not for government and to be unable to regulate the conduct of other otherwise than by she own example that this character be just appear from the occurrence in she reign in which the nation be govern for many year by a party whose principle she detest but whose influence she know not how to obviate and to whose scheme she be subservient against she inclination the charge of tyrannising over she which be make by turn against each party prove that in the opinion of both she be easily to be govern and though it may be suppose that the letter here publish be select with some regard to respect and ceremony it appear plainly enough from they that she be what she have be represent little more than the slave of the marlborough family the inferior character as they be of less importance be less accurately delineate the picture of harley be at least partially draw : all the deformity be heighten and the beauty for beauty of mind he certainly have be entirely omit review of memoirs of the court of augustus by thoma blackwell jud principal of marischal college in the university of aberdeen -lrb- 2 -rrb- the first effect which this book have upon the reader be that of disgust he with the author 's vanity he endeavor to persuade the world that here be some new treasure of literature spread before he eye that something be discover which to this happy day have be conceal in darkness that by he diligence time have be rob of some valuable monument which he be on the point of devour and that name and fact doom to oblivion be now restore to fame how must the unlearned reader be surprise when he shall be tell that mr blackwell have neither dig in the ruin of any demolish city nor find out the way to the library of fez nor have a single book in he hand that have not be in the possession of every man that be incline to read it for year and age and that he book relate to a people who above all other have furnish employment to the studious and amusement to the idle who have scarcely leave behind they a coin or a stone which have not be examine and explain a thousand time and whose dress and food and household stuff it have be the pride of learn to understand a man need not fear to incur the imputation of vicious diffidence or affect humility who should have forborne to promise many novelty when he perceive such multitude of writer possess of the same material and intent upon the same purpose mr blackwell know well the opinion of horace concern those that open they undertaking with magnificent promise and he know likewise the dictate of common sense and common honesty name of greater authority than that of horace who direct that no man should promise what he can not perform i do not mean to declare that this volume have nothing new or that the labor of those who have go before we author have make he performance a useless addition to the burden of literature new work may be construct with old material the disposition of the part may show contrivance the ornament intersperse may discover elegance it be not always without good effect that man of proper qualification write in succession on the same subject even when the latter add nothing to the information give by the former for the same idea may be deliver more intelligibly or more delightfully by one than by another or with attraction that may lure mind of a different form no writer please all and every writer may please some but after all to inherit be not to acquire to decorate be not to make and the man who have nothing to do but to read the ancient author who mention the roman affair and reduce they to common place ought not to boast himself as a great benefactor to the studious world after a preface of boast and a letter of flattery in which he seem to imitate the address of horace in he vile potabi modici sabinum -- he open he book with tell we that the roman republic after the horrible proscription be no more at _ bleeding rome _ the regal power of she consul the authority of she senate and the majesty of she people be now trample under foot these -lrb- for those -rrb- divine law and hallowed custom that have be the essence of she constitution -- be set at nought and she best friend be lie expose in they blood these be surely very dismal time to those who suffer but i know not why any one but a schoolboy in he declamation should whine over the commonwealth of rome which grow great only by the misery of the rest of mankind the roman like other as soon as they grow rich grow corrupt and in they corruption sell the life and freedom of themselves and of one another about this time brutus have he patience put to the _ highest _ trial : he have be marry to clodium but whether the family do not please he or whether he be dissatisfy with the lady 's behavior during he absence he soon entertain thought of a separation _ this raise a good deal of talk _ and the woman of the clodian family inveigh bitterly against brutus -- but he marry portium who be worthy of such a father as m cato and such a husband as m brutus she have a soul capable of a _ exalt passion _ and find a proper object to raise and give it a sanction she do not only love but adore she husband he worth he truth he every shine and heroic quality make she gaze on he like a god while the endearing return of esteem and tenderness she meet with bring she joy she pride she every wish to center in she beloved brutus when the reader have be awaken by this rapturous preparation he hear the whole story of portium in the same luxuriant style till she breathe out she last a little before the _ bloody proscription _ and brutus complain heavily of he friend at rome as not have pay due attention to he lady in the decline state of she health he be a great lover of modern term he senator and they wife be _ gentleman and lady _ in this review of brutus 's army _ who be under the command of gallant man not braver officer than true patriot _ he tell _ we _ that sextus the questor be _ paymaster secretary at war and commissary general _ and that the _ sacred discipline _ of the roman require the closest connexion like that of father and son to subsist between the general of a army and he questor cicero be _ general of the cavalry _ and the next _ general officer _ be flavius _ master of ihe artillery _ the elder lentulus be _ admiral _ and the younger _ ride _ in the _ band of volunteer _ under these the tribune _ with many other too tedious to name _ lentulus however be but a subordinate officer for we be inform afterwards that the roman have make sextus pompeius lord high admiral in all the sea of they dominion among other affectation of this writer be a furious and unnecessary zeal for liberty or rather for one form of government as preferable to another this indeed might be suffer because political institution be a subject in which man have always differ and if they continue to obey they lawful governor and attempt not to make innovation for the sake of they favorite scheme they may differ for ever without any just reproach from one another but who can bear the hardy champion who venture nothing who in full security undertake the defense of the assassination of cassar and declare he resolution to speak plain yet let not just sentiment be overlook : he have justly observe that the greater part of mankind will be naturally prejudice against brutus for all feel the benefit of private friendship but few can discern the advantage of a well-constituted government -lrb- 3 -rrb- we know not whether some apology may not be necessary for the distance between the first account of this book and its continuation the truth be that this work not be force upon we attention by much publick applause or censure be sometimes neglect and sometimes forget nor would it perhaps have be now resume but that we might avoid to disappoint we reader by a abrupt desertion of any subject it be not we design to criticise the fact of this history but the style not the veracity but the address of the writer for a account of the ancient roman as it can not nearly interest any present reader and must be draw from writings that have be long know can owe its value only to the language in which it be deliver and the reflection with which it be accompany dr blackwell however seem to have heat he imagination so as to be much affect with every event and to believe that he can affect other enthusiasm be indeed sufficiently contagious but i never find any of he reader much enamour of the _ glorious pompey the patriot approv would _ or much incense against the _ lawless caesar _ whom this author probably stab every day and night in he sleeping or wake dream he be come too late into the world with he fury for freedom with he brutus and cassius we have all on this side of the tweed long since settle we opinion : he zeal for roman liberty and declamation against the violator of the republican constitution only stand now in the reader 's way who wish to proceed in the narrative without the interruption of epithet and exclamation it be not easy to forbear laughter at a man so bold in fight shadow so busy in a dispute two thousand year past and so zealous for the honor of a people who while they be poor rob mankind and as soon as they become rich rob one another of these robbery we author seem to have no very quick sense except when they be commit by caesar 's party for every act be sanctify by the name of a patriot if this author 's skill in ancient literature be less generally acknowledge one might sometimes suspect that he have too frequently consult the french writer he tell we that archelaus the rhodian make a speech to cassius and _ in so say _ dropt some tear and that cassius after the reduction of rhode be _ cover with glory _ -- deiotarus be a keen and happy spirit -- the ingrate castor keep he court he great delight be to show he universal acquaintance with term of art with word that every other polite writer have avoid and despise when pompey conquer the pirate he destroy fifteen hundred ship of the line -- the xanthian parapet be tear down -- brutus suspect that he troops be plunder command the trumpet to sound to they color -- most people understand the act of attainder pass by the senate -- the numidian trooper be unlikely in they appearance -- the numidian beat up one quarter after another -- salvidienus resolve to pass he man over in boat of leather and he give order for equip a sufficient number of that sort of small craft -- pompey have light agile frigate and fight in a strait where the current and cavern occasion swirl and a roll -- a sharp out-look be keep by the admiral -- it be a run of about fifty roman mile -- brutus break lipellum in the sight of the army -- mark antony garble the senate he be a brave man well qualify for a commodore in he choice of phrase he frequently use word with great solemnity which every other mouth and pen have appropriate to jocularity and levity the rhodians give up the contest and in poor plight flee back to rhode -- boy and girl be easily kidnap -- deiotarus be a mighty believer of augury -- deiotarus destroy he ungracious progeny -- the regularity of the roman be they mortal aversion -- they desire the consul to curb such heinous doings -- he have such a shrewd invention that no side of a question come amiss to he -- brutus find he mistress a coquettish creature he sometimes with most unlucky dexterity mix the grand and the burlesque together _ the violation of faith sir _ say cassius _ lie at the door of the rhodian by reite-rated act of perfidy _ -- the iron grate fall down crush those under it to death and catch the rest as in a trap -- when the xanthian hear the military shout and see the flame mount they conclude there would be no mercy it be now about sunset and they have be at hot work since noon he have often word or phrase with which we language have hitherto have no knowledge -- one be a heart-friend to the republic -- a deed be expede -- the numidian begin to reel and be in hazard of fall into confusion -- the tutor embrace he pupil close in he arm -- four hundred woman be tax who have no doubt be the wife of the best roman citizen -- man not bear to action be inconsequential in government -- collectitious troops -- the foot by they violent attack begin the fatal break in the pharsaliac field -- he and he brother with a politic common to other country have take opposite side he epithet be of the gaudy or hyperbolical kind the glorious news -- eager hope and dismal fear -- bleeding rome -- divine law and hallowed custom -- merciless war -- intense anxiety sometimes the reader be suddenly ravish with a sonorous sentence of which when the noise be past the meaning do not long remain when brutus set he legion to fill a moat instead of heavy drag and slow toil they set about it with huzza and racing as if they have be strive at the olympic game they hurl impetuous down the huge tree and stone and with shout force they into the water so that the work expect to continue half the campaign be with rapid toil complete in a few day brutus 's soldier fall to the gate with resistless fury it give way at last with hideous crash -- this great and good man do he duty to he country receive a mortal wound and glorious fall in the cause of rome may he memory be ever dear to all lover of liberty learning and humanity this promise ought ever to embalm he memory -- the queen of nation be tear by no foreign invader -- rome fall a sacrifice to she own son and be ravage by she unnatural offspring : all the great man of the state all the good all the holy be openly murder by the wickedest and worst -- little island cover the harbor of brindisus and form the narrow outlet from the numerous creek that compose its capacious port -- at the appearance of brutus and cassius a shout of joy rent the heaven from the surround multitude such be the flower which may be gather by every hand in every part of this garden of eloquence but have thus freely mention we author 's fault it remain that we acknowledge he merit and confess that this book be the work of a man of letter that it be full of event display with accuracy and related with vivacity and though it be sufficiently defective to crush the vanity of its author it be sufficiently entertaining to invite reader review of four letter from sir isaac newton to dr bentley contain some argument in proof of a deity -lrb- 4 -rrb- it will certainly be require that notice should be take of a book however small write on such a subject by such a author yet i know not whether these letter will be very satisfactory for they be answer to inquiry not publish and therefore though they contain many position of great importance be in some part imperfect and obscure by they reference to dr bentley 's letter sir isaac declare that what he have do be due to nothing but industry and patient thought and indeed long consideration be so necessary in such abstruse inquiry that it be always dangerous to publish the production of great man which be not know to have be design for the press and of which it be uncertain whether much patience and thought have be bestow upon they the principal question of these letter give occasion to observe how even the mind of newton gain ground gradually upon darkness as to you first query say he it seem to I that if the matter of we sun and planet and all the matter of the universe be evenly scatter throughout all the heaven and every particle have a innate gravity towards all the rest and the whole space throughout which this matter be scatter be but finite the matter on the outside of this space would by its gravity tend towards all the matter on the inside and by consequence fall down into the middle of the whole space and there compose one great spherical mass but if the matter be evenly dispose throughout a infinite space it could never convene into one mass but some of it would convene into one mass and some into another so as to make a infinite number of great mass scatter at great distance from one to another throughout all that infinite space and thus might the sun and fix star be form suppose the matter be of a lucid nature but how the matter should divide itself into two sort and that part of it which be fit to compose a shine body should fall down into one mass and make a sun and the rest which be fit to compose a opaque body should coalesce not into one great body like the shine matter but into many little one or if the sun at first be a opaque body like the planet or the planet lucid body like the sun how he alone should be change into a shine body whilst all they continue opaque or all they be change into opaque one whilst he remain unchanged i do not think more explicable by mere natural cause but be force to ascribe it to the counsel and contrivance of a voluntary agent the hypothesis of matter evenly dispose through infinite space seem to labor with such difficulty as make it almost a contradictory supposition or a supposition destructive of itself matter evenly dispose through infinite space be either create or eternal if it be create it infer a creator if it be eternal it have be from eternity evenly spread through infinite space or it have be once coalesce in mass and afterwards be diffuse whatever state be first must have be from eternity and what have be from eternity could not be change but by a cause begin to act as it have never act before that be by the voluntary act of some external power if matter infinitely and evenly diffuse be a moment without coalition it could never coalesce at all by its own power if matter originally tend to coalesce it could never be evenly diffuse through infinite space matter be suppose eternal there never be a time when it could be diffuse before its conglobation or conglobate before its diffusion this sir isaac seem by degree to have understand for he say in he second letter : the reason why matter evenly scatter through a finite space would convene in the midst you conceive the same with I but that there should be a central particle so accurately place in the middle as to be always equally attract on all side and thereby continue without motion seem to I a supposition fully as hard as to make the sharpest needle stand upright upon its point on a looking-glass for if the very mathematical center of the central particle be not accurately in the very mathematical center of the attractive power of the whole mass the particle will not be attract equally on all side and much harder be it to suppose all the particle in a infinite space should be so accurately poise one among another as to stand still in a perfect equilibrium for i reckon this as hard as to make not one needle only but a infinite number of they -lrb- so many as there be particle in a infinite space -rrb- stand accurately poise upon they point yet i grant it possible at least by a divine power and if they be once to be place i agree with you that they would continue in that posture without motion for ever unless put into new motion by the same power when therefore i say that matter evenly spread through all space would convene by its gravity into one or more great mass i understand it of matter not rest in a accurate poise let not it be think irreverence to this great name if i observe that by matter evenly spread through infinite space he now find it necessary to mean matter not evenly spread matter not evenly spread will indeed convene but it will convene as soon as it exist and in my opinion this puzzling question about matter be only how that could be that never could have be or what a man think on when he think on nothing turn matter on all side make it eternal or of late production finite or infinite there can be no regular system produce but by a voluntary and meaning agent this the great newton always assert and this he assert in the third letter but prove in another manner in a manner perhaps more happy and conclusive the hypothesis of derive the frame of the world by mechanical principle from matter evenly spread through the heaven be inconsistent with my system i have consider it very little before you letter put I upon it and therefore trouble you with a line or two more about it if this come not too late for you use in my former i represent that the diurnal rotation of the planet could not be derive from gravity but require a divine arm to impress they and though gravity might give the planet a motion of descent towards the sun either directly or with some little obliquity yet the transverse motion by which they revolve in they several orb require the divine arm to impress they accord to the tangent of they orb i would now add that the hypothesis of matter 's be at first evenly spread through the heaven be in my opinion inconsistent with the hypothesis of innate gravity without a supernatural power to reconcile they and therefore it infer a deity for if there be innate gravity it be impossible now for the matter of the earth and all the planet and star to fly up from they and become evenly spread throughout all the heaven without a supernatural power and certainly that which can never be hereafter without a supernatural power could never be

we reader may perhaps remember that we give they a short account of this book with a letter extract from it in November 1756 the author then send we a injunction to forbear he work till a second edition should appear : this prohibition be rather too magisterial for a author be no longer the sole master of a book which he have give to the publick yet he have be punctually obey we have no

which experience do not confirm when the chinese drink tea they infuse it slightly and extract only the more volatile part but though this seem to require great quantity at a time yet the author believe perhaps only because he have a inclination to believe it that the english and dutch use more than all the inhabitant of that extensive empire the chinese drink it sometimes with acid seldom with sugar and this practice we author who have no intention to find anything right at home recommend to he countryman the history of the rise and progress of tea-drinking be truly curious tea be first import from holland by the earl of arlington and ossory in 1666 from they lady the woman of quality learn its use its price be then three pound a pound and continue the same to 1707 in 1715 we begin to use green tea and the practice of drink it descend to the lower class of the people in 1720 the french begin to send it hither by a clandestine commerce from 1717 to 1726 we import annually seven hundred thousand pound from 1732 to 1742 a million and two hundred thousand pound be every year bring to london in some year afterwards three million and in 1755 near four million of pound or two thousand ton in which we be not to reckon that which be surreptitiously introduce which perhaps be nearly as much such quantity be indeed sufficient to alarm we it be at least worth inquiry to know what be the quality of such a plant and what the consequence of such a trade he then proceed to enumerate the mischief of tea and seem willing to charge upon it every mischief that he can find he begin however by question the virtue ascribe to it and deny that the crew of the chinese ship be preserve in they voyage homewards from the scurvy by tea about this report i have make some inquiry and though i can not find that these crew be wholly exempt from scorbutick malady they seem to suffer they less than other mariner in any course of equal length this i ascribe to the tea not as possess any medicinal quality but as tempting they to drink more water to dilute they salt food more copiously and perhaps to forbear punch or other strong liquor he then proceed in the pathetick strain to tell the lady how by drink tea they injure they health and what be yet more dear they beauty to what can we ascribe the numerous complaint which prevail how many sweet creature of you sex languish with a weak digestion low spirit lassitude melancholy and twenty disorder which in spite of the faculty have yet no name except the general one of nervous complaint let they change they diet and among other article leave off drinking tea it be more than probable the greatest part of they will be restore to health hot water be also very hurtful to the tooth the chinese do not drink they tea so hot as we do and yet they have bad tooth this can not be ascribe entirely to sugar for they use very little as already observe but we all know that hot or cold thing which pain the tooth destroy they also if we drink less tea and use gentle acid for the gum and tooth particularly sour orange though we have a less number of french dentist i fancy this essential part of beauty would be much better preserve the woman in the united province who sip tea from morning till night be also as remarkable for bad tooth they also look pallid and many be trouble with certain feminine disorder arise from a relax habit the portuguese lady on the other hand entertain with sweetmeat and yet they have very good tooth but they food in general be more of a farinaceous and vegetable kind than ours they also drink cold water instead of sip hot and never taste any fermented liquor for these reason the use of sugar do not seem to be at all pernicious to they man seem to have lose they stature and comeliness and woman they beauty i be not young but methink there be not quite so much beauty in this land as there be you very chambermaid have lose they bloom i suppose by sip tea even the agitation of the passion at card be not so great enemy to female charm what shakespeare ascribe to the concealment of love be in this age more frequently occasion by the use of tea to raise the fright still higher he quote a account of a pig 's tail scald with tea on which however he do not much insist of these dreadful effect some be perhaps imaginary and some may have another cause that there be less beauty in the present race of female than in those who enter the world with we all of we be incline to think on whom beauty have cease to smile but we father and grandfather make the same complaint before we and we posterity will still find beauty irresistibly powerful that the disease commonly call nervous tremor fit habitual depression and all the malady which proceed from laxity and debility be more frequent than in any former time be i believe true however deplorable but this new race of evil will not be expel by the prohibition of tea this general languor be the effect of general luxury of general idleness if it be most to be find among tea-drinker the reason be that tea be one of the state amusement of the idle and luxurious the whole mode of life be change every kind of voluntary labor every exercise that strengthen the nerve and harden the muscle be fall into disuse the inhabitant be crowd together in populous city so that no occasion of life require much motion every one be near to all that he want and the rich and delicate seldom pass from one street to another but in carriage of pleasure yet we eat and drink or strive to eat and drink like the hunter and huntress the farmer and the housewife of the former generation and they that pass ten hour in bed and eight at card and the greater part of the other six at the table be teach to impute to tea all the disease which a life unnatural in all its part may chance to bring upon they tea among the greater part of those who use it most be drunk in no great quantity as it neither exhilarate the heart nor stimulate the palate it be commonly a entertainment merely nominal a pretence for assemble to prattle for interrupt business or diversify idleness they who drink one cup and who drink twenty be equally punctual in prepare or partake it and indeed there be few but discover by they indifference about it that they be bring together not by the tea but the tea-table three cup make the common quantity so slightly impregnate that perhaps they might be tinge with the athenian cicuta and produce less effect than these letter charge upon tea we author proceed to show yet other bad quality of this hate leaf green tea when make strong even by infusion be a emetick nay i be tell it be use as such in china a decoction of it certainly perform this operation yet by long use it be drunk by many without such a effect the infusion also when it be make strong and stand long to draw the grosser particle will convulse the bowels : even in the manner commonly use it have this effect on some constitution as i have already remark to you from my own experience you see i confess my weakness without reserve but those who be very fond of tea if they digestion be weak and they find themselves disorder they generally ascribe it to any cause except the true one i be aware that the effect just mention be imputed to the hot water let it be so and my argument be still good : but who pretend to say it be not partly owe to particular kind of tea perhaps such as partake of coppera which there be cause to apprehend be sometimes the case : if we judge from the manner in which it be say to be cure together with its ordinary effect there be some foundation for this opinion put a drop of strong tea either green or bohea but chiefly the former on the blade of a knife though it be not corrosive in the same manner as vitriol yet there appear to be a corrosive quality in it very different from that of fruit which stain the knife he afterwards quote paullus to prove that tea be a desiccative and ought not to be use after the fortieth year i have then long exceed the limit of permission but i comfort myself that all the enemy of tea can not be in the right if tea be a desiccative accord to paulli it can not weaken the fiber as we author imagine if it be emetick it must constringe the stomach rather than relax it the formidable quality of tinge the knife it have in common with acorn the bark and leave of oak and every astringent bark or leaf : the coppera which be give to the tea be really in the knife ink may be make of any ferruginous matter and astringent vegetable as it be generally make of gall and coppera from tea the writer digress to spirituous liquor about which he will have no controversy with the literary magazine we shall therefore insert almost he whole letter and add to it one testimony that the mischief arise on every side from this compendious mode of drunkenness be enormous and insupportable equally to be find among the great and the mean fill palace with disquiet and distraction harder to be bear as it can not be mention and overwhelming multitude with incurable disease and unpitied poverty though tea and gin have spread they baneful influence over this island and he majesty 's other dominion yet you may be well assure that the governor of the foundling hospital will exert they utmost skill and vigilance to prevent the child under they care from be poison or enervate by one or the other this however be not the case of workhouse : it be well know to the shame of those who be charge with the care of they that gin have be too often permit to enter they gate -- and the debauched appetite of the people who inhabit these house have be urge as a reason for it desperate disease require desperate remedy : if law be rigidly execute against murderer in the highway those who provide a draught of gin which we see be murderous ought not to be countenance i be now inform that in certain hospital where the number of the sick use to be about 5600 in 14 year from 1704 to 1718 they increase to 8189 from 1718 to 1734 still augment to 12710 and from 1734 to 1749 multiply to 38147 what a dreadful spectre do this exhibit nor must we wonder when satisfactory evidence be give before the great council of the nation that near eight million of gallon of distilled spirit at the standard it be commonly reduce to for drinking be actually consume annually in dram the shocking difference in the number of the sick and we may presume of the dead also be suppose to keep pace with gin and the most ingenious and unprejudiced physician ascribe it to this cause what be to be do under these melancholy circumstance shall we still countenance the distillery for the sake of the revenue out of tenderness to the few who will suffer by its be abolish for fear of the madness of the people or that foreigner will run it in upon we there can be no evil so great as that we now suffer except the make the same consumption and pay for it to foreigner in money which i hope never will be the case as to the revenue it certainly may be replace by tax upon the necessaries of life even upon the bread we eat or in other word upon the land which be the great source of supply to the public and to individual nor can i persuade myself but that the people may be wean from the habit of poisoning themselves the difficulty of smuggling a bulky liquid join to the severity which ought to be exercise towards smuggler whose illegal commerce be of so infernal a nature must in time produce the effect desire spirituous liquor be abolish instead of have the most undisciplined and abandon poor we might soon boast a race of man temperate religious and industrious even to a proverb we should soon see the ponderous burden of the poor 's rate decrease and the beauty and strength of the land rejuvenate school workhouse and hospital might then be sufficient to clear we street of distress and misery which never will be the case whilst the love of poison prevail and the means of ruin be sell in above one thousand house in the city of london in two thousand two hundred in westminster and one thousand nine hundred and thirty in holborn and st gile 's but if other use still demand liquid fire i would really propose that it should be sell only in quart bottle seal up with the king 's seal with a very high duty and none sell without be mix with a strong emetic many become object of charity by they intemperance and this exclude other who be such by the unavoidable accident of life or who can not by any means support themselves hence it appear that the introduce new habit of life be the most substantial charity and that the regulation of charity-school hospital and workhouse not the augmentation of they number can make they answer the wise end for which they be institute the child of beggar should be also take from they and breed up to labor as child of the public thus the distressed might be relieve at a sixth part of the present expense the idle be compel to work or starve and the mad be send to bedlam we should not see human nature disgrace by the aged the maim the sickly and young child beg they bread nor would compassion be abuse by those who have reduce it to a art to catch the unwary nothing be want but common sense and honesty in the execution of law to prevent such abuse in the street seem more practicable than to abolish bad habit within door where greater number perish we see in many familiar instance the fatal effect of example the careless spending of time among servant who be charge with the care of infant be often fatal : the nurse frequently destroy the child the poor infant be leave neglect expire whilst she be sip she tea this may appear to you as rank prejudice or jest but i be assure from the most indubitable evidence that many very extraordinary case of this kind have really happen among those whose duty do not permit of such kind of habit it be partly from such cause that nurse of the child of the public often forget themselves and become impatient when infant cry the next step to this be use extraordinary means to quiet they i have already mention the term kill nurse as know in some workhouse : venice treacle poppy water and godfrey 's cordial have be the kind instrument of lull the child to he everlasting rest if these pious woman could send up a ejaculation when the child expire all be well and no question ask by the superior a ingenious friend of mine inform I that this have be so often the case in some workhouse that venice treacle have acquire the appellation of ` the lord have mercy upon I ' in allusion to the nurse ' hackneyed expression of pretended grief when infant expire farewell i know not upon what observation mr hanway found he confidence in the governor of the foundling hospital man of whom i have not any knowledge but whom i entreat to consider a little the mind as well as body of the child i be incline to believe irreligion equally pernicious with gin and tea and therefore think it not unseasonable to mention that when a few month ago i wandered through the hospital i find not a child that seem to have hear of he creed or the commandment to breed up child in this manner be to rescue they from a early grave that they may find employment for the gibbet from die in innocence that they may perish by they crime have consider the effect of tea upon the health of the drinker which i think he have aggravate in the vehemence of he zeal and which after solicit they by this watery luxury year after year i have not yet feel he proceed to examine how it may be show to affect we interest and first calculate the national loss by the time spend in drinking tea i have no desire to appear captious and shall therefore readily admit that tea be a liquor not proper for the lower class of the people as it supply no strength to labor or relief to disease but gratify the taste without nourish the body it be a barren superfluity to which those who can hardly procure what nature require can not prudently habituate themselves its proper use be to amuse the idle and relax the studious and dilute the full meal of those who can not use exercise and will not use abstinence that time be lose in this insipid entertainment can not be deny many trifle away at the tea-table those moment which would be better spend but that any national detriment can be infer from this waste of time do not evidently appear because i know not that any work remain undo for want of hand we manufacture seem to be limit not by the possibility of work but by the possibility of sale he next argument be more clear he affirm that one hundred and fifty thousand pound in silver be pay to the chinese annually for three million of pound of tea and that for two million more bring clandestinely from the neighbouring coast we pay at twenty-penny a pound one hundred sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pound the author justly conceive that this computation will waken we for say he : the loss of health the loss of time the injury of moral be not very sensibly feel by some who be alarm when you talk of the loss of money but he excuse the east indium company as man not oblige to be political arithmetician or to inquire so much what the nation lose as how themselves may grow rich it be certain that they who drink tea have no right to complain of those that import it but if mr hanway 's computation be just the importation and the use of it ought at once to be stop by a penal law the author allow one slight argument in favor of tea which in my opinion might be with far greater justice urge both against that and many other part of we naval trade the tea-trade employ he tell we six ship and five or six hundred seaman send annually to china it likewise bring in a revenue of three hundred and sixty thousand pound which as a tax on luxury may be consider as of great utility to the state the utility of this tax i can not find : a tax on luxury be no better than another tax unless it hinder luxury which can not be say of the impost upon tea while it be thus use by the great and the mean the rich and the poor the truth be that by the loss of one hundred and fifty thousand pound we procure the means of shift three hundred and sixty thousand at best only from one hand to another but perhaps sometimes into hand by which it be not very honestly employ of the five or six hundred seaman send to china i be tell that sometimes half commonly a third part perish in the voyage so that instead of set this navigation against the inconveniency already allege we may add to they the yearly loss of two hundred man in the prime of life and reckon that the trade of china have destroy ten thousand man since the beginning of this century if tea be thus pernicious if it impoverish we country if it raise temptation and give opportunity to illicit commerce which i have always look on as one of the strongest evidence of the inefficacy of we law the weakness of we government and the corruption of we people let we at once resolve to prohibit it for ever if the question be how to promote industry most advantageously in lieu of we tea-trade supposing every branch of we commerce to be already fully supply with man and money if a quarter the sum now spend in tea be lay out annually in plantation in make public garden in paving and widen street in make road in render river navigable erect palace build ' bridge or neat and convenient house where be now only hut drain land or render those which be now barren of some use should we not be gainer and provide more for health pleasure and long life compare with the consequence of the tea-trade we riches would be much better employ to these purpose but if this project do not please let we first resolve to save we money and we shall afterwards very easily find way to spend it reply to a paper in the gazetteer of may 26 1757 -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be observe in le sage 's gil bias that a exasperated author be not easily pacify i have therefore very little hope of make my peace with the writer of the eight day ' journey indeed so little that i have long deliberate whether i should not rather sit silently down under he displeasure than aggravate my misfortune by a defense of which my heart forbode the ill success deliberation be often useless i be afraid that i have at last make the wrong choice and that i might better have resign my cause without a struggle to time and fortune since i shall run the hazard of a new oifence by the necessity of ask he why he be angry distress and terror often discover to we those fault with which we should never have reproach ourselves in a happy state yet deject as i be when i review the transaction between I and this writer i can not find that i have be deficient in reverence when he book be first print he hint that i procured a sight of it before it be publish how the sight of it be procure i do not now very exactly remember but if my curiosity be greater than my prudence if i lay rash hand on the fatal volume i have surely suffer like he who burst the box from which evil rush into the world i take it however and inspect it as the work of a author not higher than myself and be confirm in my opinion when i find that these letter be _ not write to be print _ i conclude however that though not _ write _ to be _ print _ they be _ print _ to be _ read _ and insert one of they in the collection of November last not many day after i receive a note inform I that i ought to have wait for a more correct edition this injunction be obey the edition appear and i suppose myself at liberty to tell my thought upon it as upon any other book upon a royal manifesto or a act of parliament but see the fate of ignorant temerity i now find but find too late that instead of a writer whose only power be in he pen i have irritated a important member of a important corporation a man who as he tell we in he letter put horse to he chariot it be allow to the disputant of old to yield up the controversy with little resistance to the master of forty legion those who know how weakly naked truth can defend she advocate would forgive I if i should pay the same respect to a governor of the foundling yet the consciousness of my own rectitude of intention incite I to ask once again how i have offend there be only three subject upon which my unlucky pen have happen to venture : tea the author of the journal and the foundling-hospital of tea what have i say that i have drink it twenty year without hurt and therefore believe it not to be poison that if it dry the fiber it can not soften they that if it constringe it can not relax i have modestly doubt whether it have diminish the strength of we man or the beauty of we woman and whether it much hinder the progress of we woollen or iron manufacture but i allow it to be a barren superfluity neither medicinal nor nutritious that neither supply strength nor cheerfulness neither relieved weariness nor exhilarated sorrow : i insert without charge or suspicion of falsehood the sum export to purchase it and propose a law to prohibit it for ever of the author i unfortunately say that he injunction be somewhat too magisterial this i say before i know that he be a governor of the foundling but he seem inclined to punish this failure of respect as the czar of muscovy make war upon sweden because he be not treat with sufficient honor when he pass through the country in disguise yet be not this irreverence without extenuation something be say of the merit of _ meaning well _ and the journalist be declare to be a man _ whose failing might well be pardon for he virtue _ this be the highest praise which human gratitude can confer upon human merit praise that would have more than satisfied titus or augustus but which i must own to be inadequate and penurious when offer to the member of a important corporation i be ask whether i mean to satirize the man or criticise the writer when i say that he believe only perhaps because he have inclination to believe it that the english and dutch consume more tea than the vast empire of china between the writer and the man i do not at that time consider the distinction the writer i find not of more than mortal might and i do not immediately recollect that the man put horse to he chariot but i do not write wholly without consideration i know but two cause of belief evidence and inclination what evidence the journalist could have of the chinese consumption of tea i be not able to discover the officer of the east indium company be exclude they best know why from the town and the country of china they be treat as we treat gipsy and vagrant and oblige to retire every night to they own hovel what intelligence such traveller may bring be of no great importance and though the missionary boast of have once penetrate further i think they have never calculate the tea drunk by the chinese there be thus no evidence for he opinion to what could i ascribe it but inclination i be yet charge more heavily for have say that he have no intention to find any thing right at home i believe every reader restrain this imputation to the subject which produce it and suppose I to insinuate only that he mean to spare no part of the tea-table whether essence or circumstance but this line he have select as a instance of virulence and acrimony and confute it by a lofty and splendid panegyrick on himself he assert that he find many thing right at home and that he love he oountrv almost to enthusiasm i have not the least doubt that he find in he country many thing to please he nor do i suppose that he desire the same inversion of every part of life as of the use of tea the proposal of drinking tea sour show indeed such a disposition to practical paradox that there be reason to fear lest some succeed letter should recommend the dress of the pict or the cookery of the eskimaux however i meet with no other innovation and therefore be willing to hope that he find something right at home but he love of he country seem not to rise quite to enthusiasm when amidst he rage against tea he make a smooth apology for the east indium company as man who might not think themselves oblige to be political arithmetician i hold though no enthusiastick patriot that every man who live and trade under the protection of a community be oblige to consider whether he hurt or benefit those who protect he and that the most which can be indulge to private interest be a neutral traffick if any such can be by which we country be not injure though it may not be benefit but he now renew he declamation against tea notwithstanding the greatness or power of those that have interest or inclination to support it i know not of what power or greatness he may dream the importer only have a interest in defend it i be sure they be not great and i hope they be not powerful those whose inclination lead they to continue this practice be too numerous but i believe they power be such as the journalist may defy without enthusiasm the love of we country when it rise to enthusiasm be a ambiguous and uncertain virtue : when a man be enthusiastick he cease to be reasonable and when he once depart from reason what will he do but drink sour tea as the journalist though enthusiastically zealous for he country have with regard to smaller thing the placid happiness of philosophical indifference i can give he no disturbance by advise he to restrain even the love of he country within due limit lest it should sometimes swell too high fill the whole capacity of he soul and leave less room for the love of truth nothing now remain but that i review my position concern the foundling hospital what i declare last month i declare now once more that i find none of the child that appear to have hear of the catechism it be inquire how i wander and how i examine there be doubtless subtlety in the question i know not well how to answer it happily i do not wander alone i attend some lady with another gentleman who all hear and assist the inquiry with equal grief and indignation i do not conceal my observation notice be give of this shameful defect soon after at my request to one of the highest name of the society this i be now tell be incredible but since it be true and the past be out of human power the most important corporation can not make it false but why be it incredible because in the rule of the hospital the child be order to learn the rudiment of religion order be easily make but they do not execute themselves they say they catechism at stated time under a able master but this able master be i think not elect before last February and my visit happen if i mistake not in November the child be shy when interrogate by a stranger this may be true but the same shiness i do not remember to have hinder they from answer other question and i wonder why child so much accustom to new spectator should be eminently shy my opponent in the first paragraph call the inference that i make from this negligence a hasty conclusion : to the decency of this expression i have nothing to object but as he grow hot in he career he enthusiasm begin to sparkle and in the vehemence of he postscript he charge my assertion and my reason for advance they with folly and malice he argumentation be somewhat enthusiastical i can not fully comprehend but it seem to stand thus : my insinuation be foolish or malicious since i know not one of the governor of the hospital for he that know not the governor of the hospital must be very foolish or malicious he have however so much kindness for I that he advise I to consult my safety when i talk of corporation i know not what the most important corporation can do become manhood by which my safety be endanger my reputation be safe for i can prove the fact my quiet be safe for i mean well and for any other safety i be not use to be very solicitous i be always sorry when i see any be labor in vain and in return for the journalist 's attention to my safety i will confess some compassion for he tumultuous resentment since all he invective fume into the air with so little effect upon I that i still esteem he as one that have the _ merit of mean well _ and still believe he to be a man whose _ failing may be justly pardon for he virtue _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- review -lrb- 7 -rrb- of a essay on the writings and genius of pope this be a very curious and entertaining miscellany of critical remark and literary history though the book promise nothing but observation on the writings of pope yet no opportunity be neglect of introduce the character of any other writer or the mention of any performance or event in which learning be interested from pope however he always take he hint and to pope he return again from he digression the fact which he mention though they be seldom anecdote in a rigorous sense be often such as be very little known and such as will delight more reader than naked criticism as he examine the work of this great poet in a order nearly chronological he necessarily begin with he pastoral which consider as representation of any kind of life he very justly censure for there be in they a mixture of grecian and english of ancient and modern image windsor be couple with hyblum and thame with pactolus he then compare some passage which pope have imitate or translate with the imitation or version and give the preference to the original perhaps not always upon convincing argument theocritus make he lover wish to be a bee that he might creep among the leaf that form the chaplet of he mistress pope 's enamoured swain long to be make the captive bird that sing in he fair one 's bower that she might listen to he song and reward he with she kiss the critick prefer the image of theocritus as more wild more delicate and more uncommon it be natural for a lover to wish that he might be any thing that could come near to he lady but we more naturally desire to be that which she fondle and caress than that which she would avoid at least would neglect the snperior delicacy of theocritus i can not discover nor can indeed find that either in the one or the other image there be any want of delicacy which of the two image be less common in the time of the poet who use it for on that consideration the merit of novelty depend i think it be now out of any critick 's power to decide he remark i be afraid with too much justice that there be not a single new think in the pastoral and with equal reason declare that they chief beauty consist in they correct and musical versification which have so influence the english ear as to render every moderate rhymer harmonious in he examination of the messiah he justly observe some deviation from the inspired author which weaken the imagery and dispirit the expression on windsor forest he declare i think without proof that descriptive poetry be by no mean the excellence of pope he draw this inference from the few image introduce in this poem which would not equally belong to any other place he must inquire whether windsor forest have in reality any thing peculiar the stag-chase be not he say so full so animated and so circumstantiated as somerville 's barely to say that one performance be not so good as another be to criticise with little exactness but pope have direct that we should in every work regard the author 's end the stag-chase be the main subject of somerville and might therefore be properly dilate into all its circumstance in pope it be only incidental and be to be despatch in a few line he make a just observation that the description of the external beauty of nature be usually the first effort of a young genius before he have study nature and passion some of milton 's most early as well as mo ' t exquisite piece be he lycida l'allegro and il penseroso if we may except he ode on the nativity of christ which be indeed prior in order of time and in which a penetrate critick might have observe the seed of that boundless imagination which be one day to produce the paradise lose mention thomson and other descriptive poet he remark that writer fail in they copy for want of acquaintance with original and justly ridicule those who think they can form just idea of valley mountain and river in a garret in the strand for this reason i can not regret with this author that pope lay aside he design of write american pastoral for as he must have paint scene which he never see and manners which he never know he performance though it might have be a please amusement of fancy would have exhibit no representation of nature or of life after the pastoral the critick consider the lyrick poetry of pope and dwell longest on the ode on st cecilium 's day which he like the rest of mankind place next to that of dryden and not much below it he remark after mr spence that the first stanza be a perfect concert : the second he think a little flat he justly commend the fourth but without notice of the best line in that stanza or in the poem : transport demi-god stand round and man grow hero at the sound in the latter part of the ode he object to the stanza of triumph : thus song could prevail & c as write in a measure ridiculous and burlesque and justify he answer by observe that addison use the same number in the scene of rosamond between grideline and sir trusty : how unhappy be he & c that the measure be the same in both passage must be confess and both poet perhaps choose they number properly for they both mean to express a kind of airy hilarity the two passion of merriment and exultation be undoubtedly different they be as different as a gambol and a triumph but each be a species of joy and poetical measure have not in any language be so far refine as to provide for the subdivision of passion they can only be adapt to general purpose but the particular and minuter propriety must be seek only in the sentiment and language thus the number be the same in colin 's complaint and in the ballad of darby and joan though in one sadness be represent and in the other tranquillity so the measure be the same of pope 's unfortunate lady and the praise of voiture he observe very justly that the ode both of dryden and pope conclude unsuitably and unnaturally with epigram he then spend a page upon mr handel 's musick to dryden 's ode and speak of he with that regard which he have generally obtain among the lover of sound he find something amiss in the air with ravished ear but have overlook or forget the grossest fault in that composition which be that in this line : revenge revenge timotheus cry he have lay much stress upon the two latter word which be merely word of connexion and ought in musick to be consider as parenthetical from this ode be strike out a digression on the nature of ode and the comparative excellence of the ancient and modern he mention the chorus which pope write for the duke of buckingham and thence take occasion to treat of the chorus of the ancient he then come to another ode of the die christian to he soul in which find a apparent imitation of flatman he fall into a pleasing and learn speculation on the resemble passage to be find in different poet he mention with great regard pope 's ode on solitude write when he be but twelve year old but omit to mention the poem on silence compose i think as early with much greater elegance of diction musick of number extent of observation and force of think if he have happen to think on baillet 's chapter of enfans clbres he might have make on this occasion a very entertaining dissertation on early excellence he come next to the essay on criticism the stupendous performance of a youth not yet twenty year old and after have detail the felicity of condition to which he imagine pope to have owe he wonderful prematurity of mind he tell we that he be well inform this essay be first write in prose there be nothing improbable in the report nothing indeed but what be more likely than the contrary yet i -lrb- 8 -rrb- can not forbear to hint to this writer and all other the danger and weakness of trust too readily to information nothing but experience could evince the frequency of false information or enable any man to conceive that so many groundless report should be propagate as every man of eminence may hear of himself some man relate what they think as what they know some man of confused memory and habitual inaccuracy ascribe to one man what belong to another and some talk on without thought or care a few man be sufficient to broach falsehood which be afterwards innocently diffuse by successive relater he proceed on examine passage after passage of this essay but we must pass over all these criticism to which we have not something to add or to object or where this author do not differ from the general voice of mankind we can not agree with he in he censure of the comparison of a student advance in science with a traveller pass the alp which be perhaps the best simile in we language that in which the most exact resemblance be trace between thing in appearance utterly unrelated to each other that the last line convey no new _ idea _ be not true it make particular what be before general whether the description which he add from another author be as he say more full and striking than that of pope be not to be inquire pope 's description be relative and can admit no greater length than be usually allow to a simile nor any other particulars than such as form the correspondence unvaried rhyme say this writer highly disgust reader of a good ear it be surely not the ear but the mind that be offend the fault arise from the use of common rhyme be that by read the past line the second may be guess and half the composition lose the grace of novelty on occasion of the mention of a alexandrine the critick observe that the alexandrine may be think a modern measure but that _ robert of gloucester 's wife _ be a alexandrine with the addition of two syllable and that sternhold and hopkin translate the psalm in the same measure of fourteen syllable though they be print otherwise this seem not to be accurately conceive or express : a alexandrine with the addition of two syllable be no more a alexandrine than with the detraction of two syllable sternhold and hopkin do generally write in the alternate measure of eight and six syllable but hopkin commonly rhyme the first and third sternhold only the second and fourth : so that sternhold may be consider as write couplet of long line but hopkin write regular stanza from the practice of print the long line of fourteen syllable in two short line arise the license of some of we poet who though profess to write in stanza neglect the rhyme of the first and third line pope have mention petronius among the great name of criticism as the remarker justly observe without any critical merit it be to be suspect that pope have never read he book and mention he on the credit of two or three sentence which he have often see quote imagine that where there be so much there must necessarily be more young man in haste to be renown too frequently talk of book which they have scarcely see the revival of learn mention in this poem afford a opportunity of mention the chief period of literary history of which this writer reckon five : that of alexander of ptolemy philadelphus of augustus of leo the tenth of queen anne these observation be conclude with a remark which deserve great attention : in no polished nation after criticism have be much study and the rule of write establish have any very extraordinary book ever appear the rape of the lock be always regard by pope as the highest production of he genius on occasion of this work the history of the comick-heroick be give and we be tell that it descend from fassonus to boileau from boileau to garth and from garth to pope garth be mention perhaps with too much honor but all be confess to be inferior to pope there be in he remark on this work no discovery of any latent beauty nor any thing subtle or striking he be indeed commonly right but have discuss no difficult question the next piece to be consider be the verse to the memory of a unfortunate lady the prologue to cato and epilogue to jane shore the first piece he commend on occasion of the second he digress accord to he custom into a learn dissertation on tragedy and compare the english and french with the greek stage he justly censure cato for want of action and of character but scarcely do justice to the sublimity of some speech and the philosophical exactness in the sentiment the simile of mount atla and that of the numidian traveller smother in the sand be indeed in character say the critick but sufficiently obvious the simile of the mountain be indeed common but that of the traveller i do not remember that it be obvious be easy to say and easy to deny many thing be obvious when they be teach he proceed to criticise the other work of addison till the epilogue call he attention to rowe whose character he discuss in the same manner with sufficient freedom and sufficient candor the translation of the epistle of sappho to phaon be next consider but sappho and ovid be more the subject of this disquisition than pope we shall therefore pass over it to a piece of more importance the epistle of eloisa to abelard which may justly be regard as one of the work on which the reputation of pope will stand in future time the critick pursue eloisa through all the change of passion produce the passage of she letter to which any allusion be make and intersperse many agreeable particulars and incidental relation there be not much profundity of criticism because the beauty be sentiment of nature which the learn and the ignorant feel alike it be justly remark by he that the wish of eloisa for the happy passage of abelard into the other world be form accord to the idea of mystick devotion these be the piece examine in this volume : whether the remain part of the work will be one volume or more perhaps the writer himself can not yet inform we -lrb- 9 -rrb- this piece be however a complete work so far as it go and the writer be of opinion that he have despatch the chief part of he task for he venture to remark that the reputation of pope as a poet among posterity will be principally found on he windsor forest rape of the lock and eloisa to abelard while the fact and character allude to in he late writings will be forget and unknown and they poignancy and propriety little relish for wit and satire be transitory and perishable but nature and passion be eternal he have intersperse some passage of pope 's life with which most reader will be please when pope be yet a child he father who have be a merchant in london retire to binfield he be teach to read by a aunt and learn to write without a master by copy print book he father use to order he to make english verse and would oblige he to correct and retouch they over and over and at last could say these be good rhyme at eight year of age he be commit to one taverner a priest who teach he the rudiment of the latin and greek at this time he meet with ogleby 's homer which seize he attention he fall next upon sandy 's ovid and remember these two translation with pleasure to the end of he life about ten be at school near hyde-park corner he be take to the playhouse and be so strike with the splendor of the drama that he form a kind of play out of ogleby 's homer intermix with verse of he own he persuade the head boy to act this piece and ajax be perform by he master 's gardener they be habit accord to the picture in ogleby at twelve he retire with he father to windsor forest and form himself by study in the best english poet in this extract it be think convenient to dwell chiefly upon such observation as relate immediately to pope without deviate with the author into incidental inquiry we intend to kindle not to extinguish curiosity by this slight sketch of a work abound with curious quotation and please disquisition he must be much acquaint with literary history both of remote and late time who do not find in this essay many thing which he do not know before and if there be any too learn to be instruct in fact or opinion he may yet properly read this book as a just specimen of literary moderation review of a free enquiry into the nature and origin of evil -lrb- 10 -rrb- this be a treatise consist of six letter upon a very difficult and important question which i be afraid this author 's endeavor will not free from the perplexity which have entangled the speculatist of all age and which must always continue while _ we see _ but _ in part _ he call it a _ free enquiry _ and indeed he _ freedom _ be i think greater than he modesty though he be far from the contemptible arrogance or the impious licentiousness of bolingbroke yet he decide too easily upon question out of the reach of human determination with too little consideration of mortal weakness and with too much vivacity for the necessary caution in the first letter on evil in general he observe that it be the solution of this important question whence come _ evil _ alone that can ascertain the moral characteristic of god without which there be a end of all distinction between good and evil yet he begin this inquiry by this declaration : that there be a supreme be infinitely powerful wise and benevolent the great creator and preserver of all thing be a truth so clearly demonstrate that it shall be here take for grant what be this but to say that we have already reason to grant the existence of those attribute of god which the present inquiry be design to prove the present inquiry be then surely make to no purpose the attribute to the demonstration of which the solution of this great question be necessary have be demonstrate without any solution or by means of the solution of some former writer he reject the manichean system but impute to it a absurdity from which amidst all its absurdity it seem to be free and adopt the system of mr pope that pain be no evil if assert with regard to the individual who suffer it be downright nonsense but if consider as it affect the universal system be a undoubted truth and mean only that there be no more pain in it than what be necessary to the production of happiness how many soever of these evil then force themselves into the creation so long as the good preponderate it be a work well worthy of infinite wisdom and benevolence and notwithstanding the imperfection of its part the whole be most undoubtedly perfect and in the former part of the letter he give the principle of he system in these word : omnipotence can not work contradiction it can only effect all possible thing but so little be we acquaint with the whole system of nature that we know not what be possible and what be not but if we may judge from that constant mixture of pain with pleasure and inconveniency with advantage which we must observe in every thing around we we have reason to conclude that to endue create being with perfection that be to produce good exclusive of evil be one of those impossibility which even infinite power can not accomplish this be elegant and acute but will by no means calm discontent or silence curiosity for whether evil can be wholly separate from good or not it be plain that they may be mix in various degree and as far as human eye can judge the degree of evil might have be less without any impediment to good the second letter on the evil of imperfection be little more than a paraphrase of pope 's epistle or yet less than a paraphrase a mere translation of poetry into prose this be surely to attack difficulty with very disproportionate ability to cut the gordian knot with very blunt instrument when we be tell of the insufficiency of former solution why be one of the latest which no man can have forget give we again i be tell that this pamphlet be not the effort of hunger what can it be then but the product of vanity and yet how can vanity be gratify by plagiarism or transcription when this speculatist find himself prompt to another performance let he consider whether he be about to disburden he mind or employ he finger and if i might venture to offer he a subject i should wish that he would solve this question : why he that have nothing to write should desire to be a writer yet be not this letter without some sentiment which though not new be of great importance and may be read with pleasure in the thousandth repetition whatever we enjoy be purely a free gift from we creator but that we enjoy no more can never sure be deem a injury or a just reason to question he infinite benevolence all we happiness be owe to he goodness but that it be no greater be owe only to ourselves that be to we not have any inherent right to any happiness or even to any existence at all this be no more to be imputed to god than the want of a beggar to the person who have relieve he : that he have something be owe to he benefactor but that he have no more only to he own original poverty thus far he speak what every man must approve and what every wise man have say before he he then give we the system of subordination not invent for it be know i think to the arabian metaphysician but adopt by pope and from he borrow by the diligent research of this great investigator no system can possibly be form even in imagination without a subordination of part every animal body must have different member subservient to each other every picture must be compose of various color and of light and shade all harmony must be form of treble tenor and basis every beautiful and useful edifice must consist of higher and lower more and less magnificent apartment this be in the very essence of all create thing and therefore can not be prevent by any means whatever unless by not create they at all these instance be use instead of pope 's oak and weed or jupiter and he satellite but neither pope nor this writer have much contribute to solve the difficulty perfection or imperfection of unconscious being have no meaning as refer to themselves the base and the treble be equally perfect the mean and magnificent apartment feel no pleasure or pain from the comparison pope might ask the weed why it be less than the oak but the weed would never ask the question for itself the base and treble differ only to the hearer meanness and magnificence only to the inhabitant there be no evil but must inhere in a conscious be or be refer to it that be evil must be feel before it be evil yet even on this subject many question might be offer which human understanding have not yet answer and which the present haste of this extract will not suffer I to dilate he proceed to a humble detail of pope 's opinion : the universe be a system whose very essence consist in subordination a scale of being descend by insensible degree from infinite perfection to absolute nothing in which though we may justly expect to find perfection in the whole could we possibly comprehend it yet would it be the highest absurdity to hope for it in all its part because the beauty and happiness of the whole depend altogether on the just inferiority of its part that be on the comparative imperfection of the several being of which it be compose it would have be no more a instance of god 's wisdom to have create no being but of the highest and most perfect order than it would be of a painter 's art to cover he whole piece with one single color the most beautiful he could compose have he confine himself to such nothing could have exist but demi-god or archangel and then all inferior order must have be void and uninhabited but as it be surely more agreeable to infinite benevolence that all these should be fill up with being capable of enjoy happiness themselves and contribute to that of other they must necessarily be fill with inferior being that be with such as be less perfect but from whose existence notwithstanding that less perfection more felicity upon the whole accrue to the universe than if no such have be create it be moreover highly probable that there be such a connexion between all rank and order by subordinate degree that they mutually support each other 's existence and every one in its place be absolutely necessary towards sustain the whole vast and magnificent fabric we pretence for complaint could be of this only that we be not so high in the scale of existence as we ignorant ambition may desire a pretence which must eternally subsist because be we ever so much higher there would be still room for infinite power to exalt we and since no link in the chain can be break the same reason for disquiet must remain to those who succeed to that chasm which must be occasion by we preferment a man can have no reason to repine that he be not a angel nor a horse that he be not a man much less that in they several station they possess not the faculty of another for this would be a insufferable misfortune this doctrine of the regular subordination of being the scale of existence and the chain of nature i have often consider but always leave the inquiry in doubt and uncertainty that every be not infinite compare with infinity must be imperfect be evident to intuition that whatever be imperfect must have a certain line which it can not pass be equally certain but the reason which determine this limit and for which such being be suffer to advance thus far and no farther we shall never be able to discern we discoverer tell we the creator have make being of all order and that therefore one of they must be such as man but this system seem to be establish on a concession which if it be refuse can not be extort every reason which can be bring to prove that there be being of every possible sort will prove that there be the greatest number possible of every sort of being but this with respect to man we know if we know any thing not to be true it do not appear even to the imagination that of three order of be the first and the third receive any advantage from the imperfection of the second or that indeed they may not equally exist though the second have never be or should cease to be and why should that be conclude necessary which can not be prove even to be useful the scale of existence from infinity to nothing can not possibly have be the highest be not infinite must be as have be often observe at a infinite distance below infinity cheyne who with the desire inherent in mathematician to reduce every thing to mathematical image consider all existence as a cone allow that the basis be at a infinite distance from the body and in this distance between finite and infinite there will be room for ever for a infinite series of indefinable existence between the lowest positive existence and nothing wherever we suppose positive existence to cease be another chasm infinitely deep where there be room again for endless order of subordinate nature continue for ever and for ever and yet infinitely superior to nonexistence to these meditation humanity be unequal but yet we may ask not of we maker but of each other since on the one side creation wherever it stop must stop infinitely below infinity and on the other infinitely above nothing what necessity there be that it should proceed so far either way that being so high or so low should ever have exist we may ask but i believe no create wisdom can give a adequate answer nor be this all in the scale wherever it begin or end be infinite vacuity at whatever distance we suppose the next order of being to be above man there be room for a intermediate order of being between they and if for one order then for infinite order since every thing that admit of more or less and consequently all the part of that which admit they may be infinitely divide so that as far as we can judge there may be room in the vacuity between any two step of the scale or between any two point of the cone of be for infinite exertion of infinite power thus it appear how little reason those who repose they reason upon the scale of be have to triumph over they who recur to any other expedient of solution and what difficulty arise on every side to repress the rebellion of presumptuous decision : quus pauca considerat facile pronunciat in we passage through the boundless ocean of disquisition we often take fog for land and after have long toil to approach they find instead of repose and harbor new storm of objection and fluctuation of uncertainty we be next entertain with pope 's alleviation of those evil which we be doom to suffer poverty or the want of riches be generally compensate by have more hope and fewer fear by a greater share of health and a more exquisite relish of the smallest enjoyment than those who possess they be usually bless with the want of taste and genius with all the pleasure that arise from they be commonly recompense by a more useful kind of common sense together with a wonderful delight as well as success in the busy pursuit of a scramble world the suffering of the sick be greatly relieve by many trifling gratification imperceptible to other and sometimes almost repay by the inconceivable transport occasion by the return of health and vigor folly can not be very grievous because imperceptible and i doubt not but there be some truth in that rant of a mad poet that there be a pleasure in be mad which none but madman know ignorance or the want of knowledge and literature the appoint lot of all bear to poverty and the drudgery of life be the only opiate capable of infuse that insensibility which can enable they to endure the misery of the one and the fatigue of the other it be a cordial administer by the gracious hand of providence of which they ought never to be deprive by a ill-judged and improper education it be the basis of all subordination the support of society and the privilege of individual and i have ever think it a most remarkable instance of the divine wisdom that whereas in all animal whose individual rise little above the rest of they species knowledge be instinctive in man whose individual be so widely different it be acquire by education by which mean the prince and the labourer the philosopher and the peasant be in some measure fit for they respective situation much of these position be perhaps true and the whole paragraph might well pass without censure be not objection necessary to the establishment of knowledge poverty be very gently paraphrase by want of riches in that sense almost every man may in he own opinion be poor but there be another poverty which be want of competence of all that can soften the misery of life of all that can diversify attention or delight imagination there be yet another poverty which be want of necessaries a species of poverty which no care of the publick no charity of particulars can preserve many from feel openly and many secretly that hope and fear be inseparably or very frequently connect with poverty and riches my survey of life have not inform I the milder degree of poverty be sometimes support by hope but the more severe often sink down in motionless despondence life must be see before it can be know this author and pope perhaps never see the misery which they imagine thus easy to be bear the poor indeed be insensible of many little vexation which sometimes imbitter the possession and pollute the enjoyment of the rich they be not pained by casual incivility or mortify by the mutilation of a compliment but this happiness be like that of a malefactor who cease to feel the cord that bind he when the pincers be tear he flesh that want of taste for one enjoyment be supply by the pleasure of some other may be fairly allow but the compensation of sickness i have never find near to equivalence and the transport of recovery only prove the intenseness of the pain with folly no man be willing to confess himself very intimately acquaint and therefore its pain and pleasure be keep secret but what the author say of its happiness seem applicable only to fatuity or gross dulness for that inferiority of understanding which make one man without any other reason the slave or tool or property of another which make he sometimes useless and sometimes ridiculous be often feel with very quick sensibility on the happiness of madman as the case be not very frequent it be not necessary to raise a disquisition but i can not forbear to observe that i never yet know disorder of mind increase felicity : every madman be either arrogant and irascible or gloomy and suspicious or possess by some passion or notion destructive to he quiet he have always discontent in he look and malignity in he bosom and if he have the power of choice he would soon repent who should resign he reason to secure he peace concern the portion of ignorance necessary to make the condition of the lower class of mankind safe to the publick and tolerable to themselves both moral and policy exact a nicer inquiry than will be very soon or very easily make there be undoubtedly a degree of knowledge which will direct a man to refer all to providence and to acquiesce in the condition with which omniscient goodness have determine to allot he to consider this world as a phantom that must soon glide from before he eye and the distress and vexation that encompass he as dust scatter in he path as a blast that chill he for a moment and pass off for ever such wisdom arise from the comparison of a part with the whole of we existence those that want it most can not possibly obtain from philosophy nor unless the method of education and the general tenor of life be change will very easily receive it from religion the bulk of mankind be not likely to be very wise or very good and i know not whether there be not many state of life in which all knowledge less than the highest wisdom will produce discontent and danger i believe it may be sometimes find that a _ little learning _ be to a poor man a _ dangerous thing _ but such be the condition of humanity that we easily see or quickly feel the wrong but can not always distinguish the right whatever knowledge be superfluous in irremediable poverty be hurtful but the difficulty be to determine when poverty be irremediable and at what point superfluity begin gross ignorance every man have find equally dangerous with perverted knowledge man leave wholly to they appetite and they instinct with little sense of moral or religious obligation and with very faint distinction of right and wrong can never be safely employ or confidently trust they can be honest only by obstinacy and diligent only by compulsion or caprice some instruction therefore be necessary and much perhaps may be dangerous though it should be grant that those who be _ bear to poverty and drudgery _ should not be _ deprive _ by a _ improper education _ of the _ opiate of ignorance _ even this concession will not be of much use to direct we practice unless it be determine who be those that be _ bear to poverty _ to entail irreversible poverty upon generation after generation only because the ancestor happen to be poor be in itself cruel if not unjust and be wholly contrary to the maxim of a commercial nation which always suppose and promote a rotation of property and offer every individual a chance of mend he condition by he diligence those who communicate literature to the son of a poor man consider he as one not bear to poverty but to the necessity of derive a better fortune from himself in this attempt as in other many fail and many succeed those that fail will feel they misery more acutely but since poverty be now confess to be such a calamity as can not be bear without the opiate of insensibility i hope the happiness of those whom education enable to escape from it may turn the balance against that exacerbation which the other suffer i be always afraid of determine on the side of envy or cruelty the privilege of education may sometimes be improperly bestow but i shall always fear to withhold they lest i should be yield to the suggestion of pride while i persuade myself that i be follow the maxim of policy and under the appearance of salutary restraint should be indulge the lust of dominion and that malevolence which delight in see other depress pope 's doctrine be at last exhibit in a comparison which like other proof of the same kind be better adapt to delight the fancy than convince the reason thus the universe resemble a large and well-regulated family in which all the officer and servant and even the domestic animal be subservient to each other in a proper subordination : each enjoy the privilege and perquisite peculiar to he place and at the same time contribute by that just subordination to the magnificence and happiness of the whole the magnificence of a house be of use or pleasure always to the master and sometimes to the domestick but the magnificence of the universe add nothing to the supreme be for any part of its inhabitant with which human knowledge be acquaint a universe much less spacious or splendid would have be sufficient and of happiness it do not appear that any be communicate from the being of a lower world to those of a higher the inquiry after the cause of natural evil be continue in the third letter in which as in the former there be mixture of borrow truth and native folly of some notion just and trite with other uncommon and ridiculous he opinion of the value and importance of happiness be certainly just and i shall insert it not that it will give any information to any reader but it may serve to show how the most common notion may be swell in sound and diffuse in bulk till it shall perhaps astonish the author himself happiness be the only thing of real value in existence neither riches nor power nor wisdom nor learning nor strength nor beauty nor virtue nor religion nor even life itself be of any importance but as they contribute to its production all these be in themselves neither good nor evil : happiness alone be they great end and they be desirable only as they tend to promote it success produce confidence after this discovery of the value of happiness he proceed without any distrust of himself to tell we what have be hide from all former inquirer the true solution of this important question so long and so vainly search for by the philosopher of all age and all country i take to be at last no more than this that these real evil proceed from the same source as those imaginary one of imperfection before treat of namely from that subordination without which no create system can subsist all subordination imply imperfection all imperfection evil and all evil some kind of inconveniency or suffering : so that there must be particular inconvenieucy and suffering annex to every particular rank of create being by the circumstance of thing and they mode of existence god indeed might have make we quite other creature and place we in a world quite differently constitute but then we have be no longer man and whatever being have occupy we station in the universal system they must have be liable to the same inconveniency in all this there be nothing that can silence the inquiry of curiosity or culm the perturbation of doubt whether subordination imply imperfection may be dispute the means respect themselves may be as perfect as the end the weed as a weed be no less perfect than the oak as a oak that _ imperfection imply evil and evil suffering _ be by no means evident imperfection may imply privative evil or the absence of some good but this privation produce no suffering but by the help of knowledge a infant at the breast be yet a imperfect man but there be no reason for belief that he be unhappy by he immaturity unless some positive pain be superad when this author presume to speak of the universe i would advise he a little to distrust he own faculty however large and comprehensive many word easily understand on common occasion become uncertain and figurative when apply to the work of omnipotence subordination in human affair be well understand but when it be attribute to the universal system its meaning grow less certain like the petty distinction of locality which be of good use upon we own globe but have no meaning with regard to infinite space in which nothing be _ high _ or _ low _ that if man by exaltation to a higher nature be exempt from the evil which he now suffer some other be must suffer they that if man be not man some other be must be man be a position arise from he established notion of the scale of be a notion to which pope have give some importance by adopt it and of which i have therefore endeavor to show the uncertainty and inconsistency this scale of be i have demonstrate to be raise by presumptuous imagination to rest on nothing at the bottom to lean on nothing at the top and to have vacuity from step to step through which any order of be may sink into nihility without any inconvenience so far as we can judge to the next rank above or below it we be therefore little enlighten by a writer who tell we that any be in the state of man must suffer what man suffer when the only question that require to be resolve be : why any be be in this state of poverty and labor he give just and elegant representation which yet do not remove the difficulty of the first and fundamental question though suppose the present state of man necessary they may supply some motive to content poverty be what all could not possibly have be exempt from not only by reason of the fluctuating nature of human possession but because the world could not subsist without it for have all be rich none could have submit to the command of another or the necessary drudgery of life thence all government must have be dissolve art neglect and land uncultivated and so a universal penury have overwhelm all instead of now and then pinch a few hence by the by appear the great excellence of charity by which man be enable by a particular distribution of the blessing and enjoyment of life on proper occasion to prevent that poverty which by a general one omnipotence itself could never have prevent so that by enforce this duty god as it be demand we assistance to promote universal happiness and to shut out misery at every door where it strive to intrude itself labor indeed god might easily have excuse we from since at he command the earth would readily have pour forth all she treasure without we inconsiderable assistance but if the severest labor can not sufficiently subdue the malignity of human nature what plot and machination what war rapine and devastation what profligacy and licentiousness must have be the consequence of universal idleness so that labor ought only to be look upon as a task kindly impose upon we by we indulgent creator necessary to preserve we health we safety and we innocence i be afraid that the latter end of he commonwealth forget the begin if god _ could easily have excuse we from labor _ i do not comprehend why _ he could not possibly have exempt all from poverty _ for poverty in its easier and more tolerable degree be little more than necessity of labor and in its more severe and deplorable state little more than inability for labor to be poor be to work for other or to want the succor of other without work and the same exuberant fertility which would make work unnecessary might make poverty impossible surely a man who seem not completely master of he own opinion should have speak more cautiously of omnipotence nor have presume to say what it could perform or what it could prevent i be in doubt whether those who stand highest in the _ scale of be _ speak thus confidently of the dispensation of they maker : for fool rush in where angel fear to tread of we inquietude of mind he account be still less reasonable : whilst man be injure they must be inflamed with anger and whilst they see cruelty they must be melt with pity whilst they perceive danger they must be sensible of fear this be to give a reason for all evil by show that one evil produce another if there be danger there ought to be fear but if fear be a evil why should there be danger he vindication of pain be of the same kind : pain be useful to alarm we that we may shun greater evil but those greater evil must be pre-suppose that the fitness of pain may appear treat on death he have express the known and true doctrine with sprightliness of fancy and neatness of diction i shall therefore insert it there be truth which as they be always necessary do not grow stale by repetition death the last and most dreadful of all evil be so far from be one that it be the infallible cure for all other to die be landing on some silent shore where billow never beat nor tempest roar ere well we feel the friendly stroke ` tis o'er garth for abstracted from the sickness and suffering usually attend it it be no more than the expiration of that term of life god be please to bestow on we without any claim or merit on we part but be it a evil ever so great it could not be remedy but by one much greater which be by live for ever by which mean we wickedness unrestrained by the prospect of a future state would grow so insupportable we suffering so intolerable by perseverance and we pleasure so tiresome by repetition that no be in the universe could be so completely miserable as a species of immortal man we have no reason therefore to look upon death as a evil or to fear it as a punishment even without any supposition of a future life : but if we consider it as a passage to a more perfect state or a remove only in a eternal succession of still-improving state -lrb- for which we have the strongest reason -rrb- it will then appear a new favor from the divine munificence and a man must be as absurd to repine at die as a traveller would be who propose to himself a delightful tour through various unknown country to lament that he can not take up he residence at the first dirty inn which he bait at on the road the instability of human life or of the change of its successive period of which we so frequently complain be no more than the necessary progress of it to this necessary conclusion and be so far from be evil deserving these complaint that they be the source of we greatest pleasure as they be the source of all novelty from which we greatest pleasure be ever derive the continual succession of season in the human life by daily present to we new scene render it agreeable and like those of the year afford we delight by they change which the choicest of they could not give we by they continuance in the spring of life the gilding of the sunshine the verdure of the field and the variegated painting of the sky be so exquisite in the eye of infant at they first look abroad into a new world as nothing perhaps afterwards can equal : the heat and vigor of the succeed summer of youth ripen for we new pleasure the bloom maid the nightly revel and the jovial chase : the serene autumn of complete manhood feast we with the golden harvest of we worldly pursuit : nor be the hoary winter of old age destitute of its peculiar comfort and enjoyment of which the recollection and relation of those past be perhaps none of the least : and at last death open to we a new prospect from whence we shall probably look back upon the diversion and occupation of this world with the same contempt we do now on we top and hobby horse and with the same surprise that they could ever so much entertain or engage we i would not willingly detract from the beauty of this paragraph and in gratitude to he who have so well inculcate such important truth i will venture to admonish he since the chief comfort of the old be the recollection of the past so to employ he time and he thought that when the imbecility of age shall come upon he he may be able to recreate its languor by the remembrance of hour spend not in presumptuous decision but modest inquiry not in dogmatical limitation of omnipotence but in humble acquiescence and fervent adoration old age will show he that much of the book now before we have no other use than to perplex the scrupulous and to shake the weak to encourage impious presumption or stimulate idle curiosity have thus despatch the consideration of particular evil he come at last to a general reason for which _ evil _ may be say to be _ we good _ he be of opinion that there be some inconceivable benefit in pain abstractedly consider that pain however inflict or wherever feel communicate some good to the general system of be and that every animal be some way or other the better for the pain of every other animal this opinion he carry so far as to suppose that there pass some principle of union through all animal life as attraction be communicate to all corporeal nature and that the evil suffer on this globe may by some inconceivable means contribute to the felicity of the inhabitant of the remotest planet how the origin of evil be bring nearer to human conception by any _ inconceivable _ mean i be not able to discover we believe that the present system of creation be right though we could not explain the adaptation of one part to the other or for the whole succession of cause and consequence where have this inquirer add to the little knowledge that we have before he have tell we of the benefit of evil which no man feel and relation between distant part of the universe which he can not himself conceive there be enough in this question inconceivable before and we have little advantage from a new inconceivable solution i do not mean to reproach this author for not know what be equally hide from learn and from ignorance the shame be to impose word for idea upon ourselves or other to imagine that we be go forward when we be only turn round to think that there be any difference between he that give no reason and he that give a reason which by he own confession can not be conceive but that he may not be think to conceive nothing but thing inconceivable he have at last think on a way by which human suffering may produce good effect he imagine that as we have not only animal for food but choose some for we diversion the same privilege may be allow to some being above we _ who may deceive torment or destroy we for the end only of they own pleasure or utility _ this he again find impossible to be conceive _ but that impossibility lessen not the probability of the conjecture which by analogy be so strongly confirm _ i can not resist the temptation of contemplate this analogy which i think he might have carry further very much to the advantage of he argument he might have show that these hunter whose game be man have many sport analogous to we own as we drown whelp and kitten they amuse themselves now and then with sink a ship and stand round the field of blenheim or the wall of prague as we encircle a cockpit as we shoot a bird fly they take a man in the midst of he business or pleasure and knock he down with a apoplexy some of they perhaps be virtuoso and delight in the operation of a asthma as a human philosopher in the effect of the air-pump to swell a man with a tympany be as good sport as to blow a frog many a merry bout have these frolick being at the vicissitude of a ague and good sport it be to see a man tumble with a epilepsy and revive and tumble again and all this he know not why as they be wiser and more powerful than we they have more exquisite diversion for we have no way of procure any sport so brisk and so lasting as the paroxysm of the gout and stone which undoubtedly must make high mirth especially if the play be a little diversified with the blunder and puzzle of the blind and deaf we know not how far they sphere of observation may extend perhaps now and then a merry be may place himself in such a situation as to enjoy at once all the variety of a epidemical disease or amuse he leisure with the tossing and contortion of every possible pain exhibit together one sport the merry malice of these being have find means of enjoy to which we have nothing equal or similar they now and then catch a mortal proud of he part and flattered either by the submission of those who court he kindness or the notice of those who suffer he to court theirs a head thus prepare for the reception of false opinion and the projection of vain design they easily fill with idle notion till in time they make they playthe a author they first diversion commonly begin with a ode or a epistle then rise perhaps to a political irony and be at last bring to its height by a treatise of philosophy then begin the poor animal to entangle himself in sophism and flounder in absurdity to talk confidently of the scale of be and to give solution which himself confess impossible to be understand sometimes however it happen that they pleasure be without much mischief the author feel no pain but while they be wonder at the extravagance of he opinion and point he out to one another as a new example of human folly he be enjoy he own applause and that of he companion and perhaps be elevated with the hope of standing at the head of a new sect many of the book which now crowd the world may be justly suspect to be write for the sake of some invisible order of being for surely they be of no use to any of the corporeal inhabitant of the world of the production of the last bounteous year how many can be say to serve any purpose of use or pleasure the only end of write be to enable the reader better to enjoy life or better to endure it and how will either of those be put more in we power by he who tell we that we be puppet of which some creature not much wiser than ourselves manage the wire that a set of being unseen and unheard be hover about we try experiment upon we sensibility put we in agony to see we limb quiver torture we to madness that they may laugh at we vagary sometimes obstruct the bile that they may see how a man look when he be yellow sometimes break a traveller 's bone to try how he will get home sometimes waste a man to a skeleton and sometimes kill he fat for the greater elegance of he hide this be a account of natural evil which though like the rest not quite new be very entertaining though i know not how much it may contribute to patience the only reason why we should contemplate evil be that we may bear it better and i be afraid nothing be much more placidly endure for the sake of make other sport the first page of the fourth letter be such as incline I both to hope and wish that i shall find nothing to blame in the succeed part he offer a criterion of action on account of virtue and vice for which i have often contend and which must be embrace by all who be willing to know why they act or why they forbear to give any reason of they conduct to themselves or other in order to find out the true origin of moral evil it will be necessary in the first place to enquire into its nature and essence or what it be that constitute one action evil and another good various have be the opinion of various author on this criterion of virtue and this variety have render that doubtful which must otherwise have be clear and manifest to the meanest capacity some indeed have deny that there be any such thing because different age and nation have entertain different sentiment concern it but this be just as reasonable as to assert that there be neither sun moon nor star because astronomer have support different system of the motion and magnitude of these celestial body some have place it in conformity to truth some to the fitness of thing and other to the will of god : but all this be merely superficial : they resolve we not why truth or the fitness of thing be either eligible or obligatory or why god should require we to act in one manner rather than another the true reason of which can possibly be no other than this because some action produce happiness and other misery so that all moral good and evil be nothing more than the production of natural this alone it be that make truth preferable to falsehood this that determine the fitness of thing and this that induce god to command some action and forbid other they who extol the truth beauty and harmony of virtue exclusive of its consequence deal but in pompous nonsense and they who would persuade we that good and evil be thing indifferent depend wholly on the will of god do but confound the nature of thing as well as all we notion of god himself by represent he capable of willing contradiction that be that we should be and be happy and at the same time that we should torment and destroy each other for injury can not be make benefit pain can not be make pleasure and consequently vice can not be make virtue by any power whatever it be the consequence therefore of all human action that must stamp they value so far as the general practice of any action tend to produce good and introduce happiness into the world so far we may pronounce it virtuous so much evil as it occasion such be the degree of vice it contain i say the general practice because we must always remember in judge by this rule to apply it only to the general species of action and not to particular action for the infinite wisdom of god desirous to set bound to the destructive consequence which must otherwise have follow from the universal depravity of mankind have so wonderfully contrived the nature of thing that we most vitious action may sometimes accidentally and collaterally produce good thus for instance robbery may disperse useless hoard to the benefit of the public adultery may bring heir and good humor too into many family where they would otherwise have be want and murder free the world from tyrant and oppressor luxury maintain its thousand and vanity its ten thousand superstition and arbitrary power contribute to the grandeur of many nation and the liberty of other be preserve by the perpetual contention of avarice knavery selfishness and ambition and thus the worst of vice and the worst of man be often compel by providence to serve the most beneficial purpose contrary to they own malevolent tendency and inclination and thus private vice become public benefit by the force only of accidental circumstance but this impeach not the truth of the criterion of virtue before mention the only solid foundation on which any true system of ethic can be build the only plain simple and uniform rule by which we can pass any judgment on we action but by this we may be enable not only to determine which be good and which be evil but almost mathematically to demonstrate the proportion of virtue or vice which belong to each by compare they with the degree of happiness or misery which they occasion but though the production of happiness be the essence of virtue it be by no mean the end the great end be the probation of mankind or the give they a opportunity of exalt or degrade themselves in another state by they behavior in the present and thus indeed it answer two most important purpose : those be the conservation of we happiness and the test of we obedience or have not such a test seem necessary to god 's infinite wisdom and productive of universal good he would never have permit the happiness of man even in this life to have depend on so precarious a tenure as they mutual good behavior to each other for it be observable that he who best know we formation have trust no one thing of importance to we reason or virtue : he trust only to we appetite for the support of the individual and the continuance of we species to we vanity or compassion for we bounty to other and to we fear for the preservation of ourselves often to we vice for the support of government and sometimes to we folly for the preservation of we religion but since some test of we obedience be necessary nothing sure could have be command for that end so fit and proper and at the same time so useful as the practice of virtue nothing could have be so justly reward with happiness as the production of happiness in conformity to the will of god it be this conformity alone which add merit to virtue and constitute the essential difference between morality and religion morality oblige man to live honestly and soberly because such behavior be most conducive to public happiness and consequently to they own religion to pursue the same course because conformable to the will of they creator morality induce they to embrace virtue from prudential consideration religion from those of gratitude and obedience morality therefore entirely abstract from religion can have nothing meritorious in it it be but wisdom prudence or good economy which like health beauty or riches be rather obligation confer upon we by god than merit in we towards he for though we may be justly punish for injure ourselves we can claim no reward for self-preservation as suicide deserve punishment and infamy but a man deserve no reward or honor for not be guilty of it this i take to be the meaning of all those passage in we scripture in which work be represent to have no merit without faith that be not without believe in historical fact in creed and article but without be do in pursuance of we belief in god and in obedience to he command and now have mention scripture i can not omit observe that the christian be the only religious or moral institution in the world that ever set in a right light these two material point the essence and the end of virtue that ever found the one in the production of happiness that be in universal benevolence or in they language charity to all man the other in the probation of man and he obedience to he creator sublime and magnificent as be the philosophy of the ancient all they moral system be deficient in these two important article they be all build on the sandy foundation of the innate beauty of virtue or enthusiastic patriotism and they great point in view be the contemptible reward of human glory foundation which be by no means able to support the magnificent structure which they erect upon they for the beauty of virtue independent of its effect be unmeaning nonsense patriotism which injure mankind in general for the sake of a particular country be but a more extended selfishness and really criminal and all human glory but a mean and ridiculous delusion the whole affair then of religion and morality the subject of so many thousand volume be in short no more than this : the supreme be infinitely good as well as powerful desirous to diffuse happiness by all possible means have create innumerable rank and order of being all subservient to each other by proper subordination one of these be occupy by man a creature endue with such a certain degree of knowledge reason and freewill as be suitable to he situation and place for a time on this globe as in a school of probation and education here he have a opportunity give he of improve or debase he nature in such a manner as to render himself fit for a rank of higher perfection and happiness or to degrade himself to a state of greater imperfection and misery necessary indeed towards carry on the business of the universe but very grievous and burdensome to those individual who by they own misconduct be oblige to submit to it the test of this he behavior be do good that be cooperate with he creator as far as he narrow sphere of action will permit in the production of happiness and thus the happiness and misery of a future state will be the just reward or punishment of promote or prevent happiness in this so artificially by this mean be the nature of all human virtue and vice contrived that they reward and punishment be weave as it be in they very essence they immediate effect give we a foretaste of they future and they fruit in the present life be the proper sample of what they must unavoidably produce in another we have reason give we to distinguish these consequence and regulate we conduct and lest that should neglect its post conscience also be appoint as a instinctive kind of monitor perpetually to remind we both of we interest and we duty si sic omnia dixisset to this account of the essence of vice and virtue it be only necessary to add that the consequence of human action be sometimes uncertain and sometimes remote it be not possible in many case for most man nor in all case for any man to determine what action will ultimately produce happiness and therefore it be proper that revelation should lay down a rule to be follow invariably in opposition to appearance and in every change of circumstance by which we may be certain to promote the general felicity and be set free from the dangerous temptation of _ do evil that good may come _ because it may easily happen and in effect will happen very frequently that we own private happiness may be promote by a act injurious to other when yet no man can be oblige by nature to prefer ultimately the happiness of other to he own therefore to the instruction of infinite wisdom it be necessary that infinite power should add penal sanction that every man to whom those instruction shall be impart may know that he can never ultimately injure himself by benefit other or ultimately by injure other benefit himself but that however the lot of the good and bad may be huddle together in the seeming confusion of we present state the time shall undoubtedly come when the most virtuous will be most happy i be sorry that the remain part of this letter be not equal to the first the author have indeed engage in a disquisition in which we need not wonder if he fail in the solution of question on which philosopher have employ they ability from the earliest time and find no end in wand ` ring maze lose he deny that man be create _ perfect _ because the system require subordination and because the power of lose he perfection of render himself wicked and miserable be the highest imperfection imaginable besides the regular gradation of the scale of be require somewhere such a creature as man with all he infirmity about he and the total removal of those would be alter he nature and when he become perfect he must cease to be man i have already spend some consideration on the _ scale of be _ of which yet i be oblige to renew the mention whenever a new argument be make to rest upon it and i must therefore again remark that consequence can not have greater certainty than the postulate from which they be draw and that no system can be more hypothetical than this and perhaps no hypothesis more absurd he again deceive himself with respect to the perfection with which _ man _ be hold to be originally vest that man come perfect that be endue with all possible perfection out of the hand of he creator be a false notion derive from the philosopher -- the universal system require subordination and consequently comparative imperfection that _ man be ever endue with all possible perfection _ that be with all perfection of which the idea be not contradictory or destructive of itself be undoubtedly _ false _ but it can hardly be call _ a false notion _ because no man ever think it nor can it be derive from the _ philosopher _ for without pretend to guess what philosopher he may mean it be very safe to affirm that no philosopher ever say it of those who now maintain that _ man _ be once perfect who may very easily be find let the author inquire whether _ man _ be ever omniscient whether he be ever omnipotent whether he ever have even the lower power of archangel or angel they answer will soon inform he that the suppose perfection of _ man _ be not absolute but respective that he be perfect in a sense consistent enough with subordination perfect not as compare with different being but with himself in he present degeneracy not perfect as a angel but perfect as man from this perfection whatever it be he think it necessary that man should be debar because pain be necessary to the good of the universe and the pain of one order of being extend its salutary influence to innumerable order above and below it be necessary that man should suffer but because it be not suitable to justice that pain should be inflict on innocence it be necessary that man should be criminal this be give as a satisfactory account of the original of moral evil which amount only to this that god create being whose guilt he foreknow in order that he might have proper object of pain because the pain of part be no man know how or why necessary to the felicity of the whole the perfection which man once have may be so easily conceive that without any unusual strain of imagination we can figure its revival all the duty to god or man that be neglect we may fancy perform all the crime that be commit we may conceive forborne man will then be restore to he moral perfection and into what head can it enter that by this change the universal system would be shake or the condition of any order of being alter for the worse he come in the fifth letter to political and in the sixth to religious evil of political evil if we suppose the origin of moral evil discover the account be by no means difficult polity be only the conduct of immoral man in publick affair the evil of each particular kind of government be very clearly and elegantly display and from they secondary cause very rationally deduce but the first cause lie still in its ancient obscurity there be in this letter nothing new nor any thing eminently instructive one of he practical deduction that from government evil can not be eradicate and they excess only can be prevent have be always allow the question upon which all dissension arise be when that excess begin at what point man shall cease to bear and attempt to remedy another of he precept though not new well deserve to be transcribe because it can not be too frequently impressed what have here be say of they imperfection and abuse be by no means intend as a defense of they : every wise man ought to redress they to the utmost of he power which can be effect by one method only that be by a reformation of manners for as all political evil derive they original from moral these can never be remove until those be first amend he therefore who strictly adhere to virtue and sobriety in he conduct and enforce they by he example do more real service to a state than he who displace a minister or dethrone a tyrant : this give but a temporary relief but that exterminate the cause of the disease no immoral man then can possibly be a true patriot and all those who profess outrageous zeal for the liberty and prosperity of they country and at the same time infringe she law affront she religion and debauch she people be but despicable quack by fraud or ignorance increase the disorder they pretend to remedy of religion he have say nothing but what he have learn or might have learn from the divine that it be not universal because it must be receive upon conviction and successively receive by those whom conviction reach that its evidence and sanction be not irresistible because it be intend to induce not to compel and that it be obscure because we want faculty to comprehend it what he mean by he assertion that it want policy i do not well understand he do not mean to deny that a good christian will be a good governor or a good subject and he have before justly observe that the good man only be a patriot religion have be he say corrupt by the wickedness of those to whom it be communicate and have lose part of its efficacy by its connexion with temporal interest and human passion he justly observe that from all this no conclusion can be draw against the divine original of christianity since the objection arise not from the nature of the revelation but of he to whom it be communicate all this be know and all this be true but why we have not yet discover we author if i understand he right pursue the argument thus : the religion of man produce evil because the morality of man be imperfect he morality be imperfect that he may be justly a subject of punishment he be make subject to punishment because the pain of part be necessary to the happiness of the whole pain be necessary to happiness no mortal can tell why or how thus after have clamber with great labor from one step of argumentation to another instead of rise into the light of knowledge we be devolve back into dark ignorance and all we effort end in belief that for the evil of life there be some good reason and in confession that the reason can not be find this be all that have be produce by the revival of chrysippus 's untractableness of matter and the arabian scale of existence a system have be raise which be so ready to fall to piece of itself that no great praise can be derive from its destruction to object be always easy and it have be well

first rise in which the most considerable papers communicate to the society which have hitherto not be publish be insert in they proper order as a supplement to the philosophical transaction by thoma birch d d secretary to the royal society 2 vol 4to this book might more properly have be entitle by the author a diary than a history as it proceed regularly from day to day so minutely as to number over the member present at each committee and so slowly that two large volume contain only the transaction of the eleven first year from the institution of the society i be yet far from intend to represent this work as useless many particularity be of importance to one man though they appear trifling to another and it be always more safe to admit copiousness than to affect brevity many information will be afford by this book to the biographer i know not where else it can be find but here and in ward that cowley be doctor in physick and whenever any other institution of the same kind shall be attempt the exact relation of the progress of the royal society may furnish precedent these volume consist of a exact journal of the society of some papers deliver to they which though

polybius in five book translate from the greek by mr hampton this appear to be one of the book which will long do honor to the present age it have be by some remarker observe that no man ever grow immortal by a translation and undoubtedly translation into the prose of a living language must be lay aside whenever the language change because the matter be always to be find in the original contribute nothing to the preservation of the form superinduce by the translator but such version may last long though they can scarcely last always and there be reason to believe that this will grow in reputation while the english tongue continue in its present state the great difficulty of a translator be to preserve the native form of he language and the unconstrained manner of a original writer this mr hampton seem to have attain in a degree of which there be few example he book have the dignity of antiquity and the easy flow of a modern composition it be perhaps to be desire that he have illustrate with note a author which must have many difficulty to a english reader and particularly that he have explain the ancient art of war but these omission may be easily supply by a inferior hand from the antiquary and commentator to note omission where there be so much perform would be invidious and to commend be unnecessary where the excellence of the work may be more easily

be bestow the author of the esssay in prose seem generally to have imitate or try to imitate the copiousness and luxunance of mr rowe this however be not all they praise they have labor to add to she brightness of imagery she purity of sentiment the poet have have dr watt before they eye a writer who if he stand not in the first class of genius compensate that defect by a ready application of he

liberty of thought and liberty of press we clamorous praise of liberty sufficiently prove that we enjoy it and if by liberty nothing else be mean than security from the persecution of power it be so fully possess by we that little more be to be desire except that one should talk of it less and use it better but a social being can scarcely rise to complete independence he that have any want which other can supply must study the gratification of they whose assistance he expect this be equally true whether he want be want of nature or of vanity the writer of the present time be not always candidate for preferment nor often the hireling of a patron they profess to serve no interest and speak with loud contempt of sycophant and slave there be however a power from whose influence neither they nor they predecessor have ever be free those who have set greatness at defiance have yet be the slave of fashion when a opinion have once become popular very few be willing to oppose it idleness be more willing to credit than inquire cowardice be afraid of controversy and vanity of answer and he that write merely for sale be tempt to court purchaser by flattering the prejudice of the publick it have now be fashionable for near half a century to defame and vilify the house of stuart and to exalt and magnify the reign of elizabeth the stuart have find few apologist for the dead can not pay for praise and who will without reward oppose the tide of popularity yet there remain still among we not wholly extinguish a zeal for truth a desire of establish right in opposition to fashion the author whose work be now before as have attempt a vindication of mary of scotland whose name have for some year be generally resign to infamy and who have be consider as the murderer of she husband and condemn by she own letter of these letter the author of this vindication confess the importance to be such that if they be genuine the queen be guilty and if they be spurious she be innocent he have therefore undertake to prove they spurious and divide he treatise into six part in the first be contain the history of the letter from they discovery by the earl of morton they be produce against queen mary and they several appearance in england before queen elizabeth and she commissioner until they be finally deliver back again to the earl of morton the second contain a short abstract of mr goodall 's argument for prove the letter to be spurious and forge and of dr robertson and mr hume 's objection by way of answer to mr goodall with critical observation on these author the third contain a examination of the argument of dr robertson and mr hume in support of the authenticity of the letter the fourth contain a examination of the confession of nichola hubert commonly call _ french pari _ with observation show the same to be a forgery the fifth contain a short recapitulation or summary of the argument on both side of the question the last be a historical collection of the direct or positive evidence still on record tend to show what part the earl of murray and morton and secretary lethington have in the murder of the lord darnley the author apologize for the length of this book by observe that it necessarily comprise a great number of particulars which could not easily be contract : the same plea may be make for the imperfection of we extract which will naturally fall below the force of the book because we can only select part of that evidence which owe its strength to its concatenation and which will be weaken whenever it be disjoin the account of the seizure of these controvert letter be thus give by the queen 's enemy that in the castell of edinburgh thair be leave be the erle of bothwell before he flee away and be send for be ane george dalgleish he

also and a promise of marriage by the queen to bothwell to the reality of these letter we author make some considerable objection from the nature of thing but as such argument do not always convince we will pass to the evidence of fact on June 15 1567 the queen deliver herself to morton and he party who imprison she June 20 1567 dalgleish be seize and six day after be examine by morton he examination be still extant and there be no mention of this fatal box dec 4 1567 murray 's secret council publish a act in which be the first mention of these letter and in which they be say to be _ write and subscrivit with she awin hand _ ten day after murray 's first parliament meet and pass a act in which they mention _ previe letter write halelie _ -lrb- wholly -rrb- _ with she awin hand _ the difference between _ write and subscribe _ and _ wholly write _ give the author just reason to suspect first a forgery and then a variation of the forgery it be indeed very remarkable that the first account assert more than the second though the second contain all the truth for the letter whether _ write _ by the queen or not be not _ subscribe _ have the second account differ from the first only by something add the first might have contain truth though not all the truth but as the second correct the first by diminution the first can not be clear from falsehood in October 1568 these letter be show at york to elisabeth 's commissioner by the agent of murray but not in they publick character as commissioner but by way of private information and be not therefore expose to mary 's commissioner mary however hear that some letter be intend to be produce against she direct she commissioner to require they for she inspection and in the mean time to declare they _ false and feigned forge and invent _ observe that there be many that could counterfeit she hand to counterfeit a name be easy to counterfeit a hand through eight letter very difficult but it do not appear that the letter be ever show to those who would desire to detect they and to the english commissioner a rude and remote imitation might be sufficient since they be not show as judicial proof and why they be not show as proof no other reason can be give than they must have then be examine and that examination would have detect the forgery these letter thus timorously and suspiciously communicate be all the evidence against mary for the servant of bothwell execute for the murder of the king acquit the queen at the hour of death these letter be so necessary to murray that he allege they as the reason of the queen 's imprisonment though he imprison she on the 16th and pretend not to have intercept the letter before the 20th of June of these letter on which the fate of prince and kingdom be suspend the authority should have be put out of doubt yet that such letter be ever find there be no witness but morton who accuse the queen and crawfurd a dependent on lennox another of she accuser dalgleish the bearer be hang without any interrogatory concern they and hulet mention in they though then in prison be never call to authenticate they nor be he confession produce against mary till death have leave he no power to disown it elizabeth indeed be easily satisfied she declare herself ready to receive the proof against mary and absolutely refuse mary the liberty of confront she accuser and make she defense before such a judge a very little proof would be sufficient she give the accuser of mary leave to go to scotland and the box and letter be see no more they have be since lose and the discovery which comparison of write might have make be now no longer possible hume have however endeavor to palliate the conduct of elizabeth but he account say we author be contradict almost in every sentence by the record which it appear he have himself peruse in the next part the authenticity of the letter be examine and it seem to be prove beyond contradiction that the french letter suppose to have be write by mary be translate from the scotch copy and if original which it be so much the interest of such number to preserve be want it be much more likely that they never exist than that they have be lose the argument use by dr robertson to prove the genuineness of the letter be next examine robertson make use principally of what he call the _ internal evidence _ which amount at most to conjecture be oppose by conjecture equally probable in examine the confession of nichola hubert or french pari this new apologist of mary seem to gain ground upon she accuser pari be mention in the letter as the bearer of they to bothwell when the rest of bothwell 's servant be execute clear the queen in the last moment pari instead of suffer he trial with the rest at edinburgh be convey to st andrew 's where murray be absolute put into a dungeon of murray 's citadel and two year after condemn by murray himself nobody know how several month after he death a confession in he name without the regular testification be send to cecil at what exact time nobody can tell of this confession leslie bishop of ross openly deny the genuineness in a book print at london and suppress by elizabeth and another historian of that time declare that paris die without any confession and the confession itself be never show to mary or to mary 's commissioner the author make this reflection : from the violent presumption that arise from they carry this poor ignorant stranger from edinburgh the ordinary seat of justice they keep he hide from all the world in a remote dungeon and not produce he with they other evidence so as he might have be publickly question the positive and direct testimony of the author of crawfurd 's manuscript then live and on the spot at the time with the publick affirmation of the bishop of ross at the time of paris 's death that he have vindicate the queen with he die breath the behavior of murray morton buchanan and even of hay the attester of this pretended confession on that occasion they close and reserved silence at the time when they must have have this confession of pari in they pocket and they publishing every other circumstance that could tend to blacken the queen and yet omit this confession the only direct evidence of she suppose guilt all this duly and dispassionately consider i think one may safely conclude that it be judge not fit to expose so soon to light this piece of evidence against the queen which a cloud of witness live and present at paris 's execution would surely have give clear testimony against as a notorious imposture mr hume indeed observe : it be in vain at present to seek for improbability in nichola hubert 's die confession and to magnify the smallest difficulty into a contradiction it be certainly a regular judicial paper give in regularly and judicially and ought to have be canvass at the time if the person whom it concern have be assure of they innocence to which we author make a reply which can not be shorten without weaken it : upon what do this author ground he sentence upon two very plain reason first that the confession be a judicial one that be take in presence or by authority of a judge and secondly that it be regularly and judicially give in that must be understand during the time of the conference before queen elizabeth and she council in presence of mary 's commissioner at which time she ought to have canvass it say we author if she know she innocence that it be not a judicial confession be evident : the paper itself do not bear any such mark nor do it mention that it be take in presence of any person or by any authority whatsoever and by compare it with the judicial examination of dalgleish hay and hepburn it be apparent that it be destitute of every formality requisite in a judicial evidence in what dark corner then this strange production be generate we author may endeavor to find out if he can as to he second assertion that it be regularly and judicially give in and therefore ought to have be canvass by mary during the conference we have already see that this likewise be not fact : the conference break up in February 1569 : nichola hubert be not hang till August thereafter and he die confession as mr hume call it be only date the 10th of that month how then can this gentleman gravely tell we that this confession be judicially give in and ought to have be at that very time canvass by queen mary and she commissioner such positive assertion apparently contrary to fact be unworthy the character of a historian and may very justly render he decision with respect to evidence of a higher nature very dubious in answer then to mr hume : as the queen 's accuser do not choose to produce this material witness pari whom they have alive and in they hand nor any declaration or confession from he at the critical and proper time for have it canvass by the queen i apprehend we author 's conclusion may fairly be use against himself that it be in vain at present to support the improbability and absurdity in a confession take in a clandestine way nobody know how and produce after paris 's death by nobody know whom and from every appearance destitute of every formality requisite and common to such sort of evidence : for these reason i be under no sort of hesitation to give sentence against nichola hubert 's confession as a gross imposture and forgery the state of the evidence relate to the letter be this : morton affirm that they be take in the hand of dalgleish hie examination of dalgleish be still extant and he appear never to have be once interrogate concern the letter morton and murray affirm that they be write by the queen 's hand they be carefully conceal from mary and she commissioner and be never collate by one man who could desire to disprove they several of the incident mention in the letter be confirm by the oath of crawfurd one of lennox 's defendant and some of the incident be so minute as that they could scarcely be think on by a forger crawfurd 's testimony be not without suspicion whoever practise forgery endeavor to make truth the vehicle of falsehood of a prince 's life very minute incident be know and if any be too slight to be remark they may be safely feign for they be likewise too slight to be contradict but there be still more reason for doubt the genuineness of these letter they have no date of time or place no seal no direction no superscription the only evidence that could prove they authenticity be dalgleish and pari of which dalgleish at he trial be never question about they pari be never publickly try though he be keep alive through the time of the conference the servant of bothwell who be put to death for the king 's murder clear mary with they last word the letter be first declare to be subscribe and be then produce without subscription they be show during the conference at york privately to the english commissioner but be conceal from the commissioner of mary mary always solicit the perusal of these letter and be always deny it she demand to be hear in person by elizabeth before the noble of england and the ambassador of other prince and be refuse when mary persist in demand copy of the letter she commissioner be dismiss with they box to scotland and the letter be see no more the french letter which for almost two century have be consider as original by the enemy of mary 's memory be now discover to be forgery and acknowledge to be translation and perhaps french translation of a latin translation and the modern accuser of mary be force to infer from these letter which now exist that other letter exist formerly which have be lose in spite of curiosity malice and interest the rest of this treatise be employ in a endeavor to prove that mary 's accuser be the murderer of darnly : through this inquiry it be hot necessary to follow he only let it be observe that if these letter be forge by they they may easily be think capable of other crime that the letter be forge be now make so probable that perhaps they will never more be cite as testimony marmor norfolciense : or a essay on a ancient prophetical inscription in monkish rhyme lately discover near lynn in norfolk by probus britannicus -lrb- 17 -rrb- in norfolk near the town of lynn in a field which a ancient tradition of the country affirm to have be once a deep lake or meer and which appear from authentick record to have be call about two hundred year ago _ palus _ or the marsh be discover not long since a large square stone which be find upon a exact inspection to be a kind of coarse marble of a substance not firm enough to admit of be polish yet harder than we common quarry afford and not easily susceptible of injury from weather or outward accident it be bring to light by a farmer who observe he plough obstruct by something through which the share could not make its way order he servant to remove it this be not effect without some difficulty the stone be three foot four inch deep and four foot square in the superficies and consequently of a weight not easily manageable however by the application of lever it be at length raise and convey to a corner of the field where it lay for some month entirely unregard nor perhaps have we ever be make acquaint with this venerable relick of antiquity have not we good fortune be greater than we curiosity a gentleman well know to the learn world and distinguish by the patronage of the maecena of norfolk whose name be i permit to mention it would excite the attention of my reader and add no small authority to my conjecture observe as he be walk that way that the cloud begin to gather and threaten he with a shower have recourse for shelter to the tree under which this stone happen to lie and sit down upon it in expectation of fair weather at length he begin to amuse himself in he confinement by clear the earth from he seat with the point of he cane and have continue this employment some time when he observe several trace of letter antique and irregular which by be very deeply engraven be still easily distinguishable this discovery so far raise he curiosity that go home immediately he procure a instrument proper for cut out the clay that fill up the space of the letter and with very little labor make the inscription legible which be here exhibit to the publick :

he face while he lie melting in a lewd embrace and yet more strange he vein a horse shall drain nor shall the passive coward once complain i make not the least doubt but that this learn person have give we as a antiquary a true and uncontrovertible representation of the writer 's meaning and be sure he can confirm it by innumerable quotation from the author of the middle age should he be publickly call upon by any man of eminent rank in the republick of letter nor will he deny the world that satisfaction provide the animadverter proceed with that sobriety and modesty with which it become every learn man to treat a subject of such importance yet with all proper deference to a name so justly celebrated i will take the freedom of observe that he have succeed better as a scholar than a poet have fall below the strength the conciseness and at the same time below the perspicuity of he author i shall not point out the particular passage in which this disparity be remarkable but content myself with say in general that the criticism which there be room for on this translation may be almost a incitement to some lawyer studious of antiquity to learn latin the inscription which i now proceed to consider want no argument to prove its antiquity to those among the learn who be verse in the writer of the darker age and know that the latin poetry of those time be of a peculiar cast and air not easy to be understand and very difficult to be imitate nor can it be conceive that any man would lay out he ability on a way of write which though attain with much study could gain he no reputation and engrave he chimera on a stone to astonish posterity its antiquity therefore be out of dispute but how high a degree of antiquity be to be assign it there be more ground for inquiry than determination how early latin rhyme make they appearance in the world be yet undecided by the critick verse of this kind be call leonine but whence they derive that appellation the learn camden -lrb- 18 -rrb- confess himself ignorant so that the style carry no certain mark of its age i shall only observe farther on this head that the character be nearly of the same form with those on king arthur 's coffin but whether from they similitude we may venture to pronounce they of the same date i must refer to the decision of better judge we inability to fix the age of this inscription necessarily infer we ignorance of its author with relation to whom many controversy may be start worthy of the most profound learning and most indefatigable diligence the first question that naturally arise be : whether he be a briton or a saxon i have at first conceive some hope that in this question in which not only the idle curiosity of virtuoso but the honor of two mighty nation be concern some information might be draw from the word _ patrium _ my country in the third line england be not in propriety of speech the country of the saxon at least not at they first arrival but upon farther reflection this argument appear not conclusive since we find that in all age foreigner have affect to call england they country even when like the saxon of old they come only to plunder it a argument in favor of the briton may indeed be draw from the tenderness with which the author seem to lament he country and the compassion he show for its approach calamity i who be a descendant from the saxon and therefore unwilling to say any thing derogatory from the reputation of my forefather must yet allow this argument its full force for it have be rarely very rarely know that foreigner however well treat caress enriched flattered or exalted have regard this country with the least gratitude or affection till the race have by long continuance after many generation be naturalized and assimilate they have be ready upon all occasion to prefer the petty interest of they own country though perhaps only some desolate and worthless corner of the world they have employ the wealth of england in pay troops to defend mud-wall town and uninhabitable rock and in purchase barrier for territory of which the natural sterility secure they from invasion this argument which want no particular instance to confirm it be i confess of the greatest weight in this question and incline I strongly to believe that the benevolent author of this prediction must have be bear a briton the learn discoverer of the inscription be please to insist with great warmth upon the etymology of the word _ patrium _ which signify say he _ the land of my father _ could be make use of by none but such whose ancestor have reside here but in answer to this demonstration as he call it i only desire he to take notice how common it be for intruder of yesterday to pretend the same title with the ancient proprietor and have just receive a estate by voluntary grant to erect a claim of _ hereditary right _ nor be it less difficult to form any satisfactory conjecture concern the rank or condition of the writer who contented with a consciousness of have do he duty in leave this solemn warning to he country seem studiously to have avoid that veneration to which he knowledge of futurity undoubtedly entitle he and those honor which he memory might justly claim from the gratitude of posterity and have therefore leave no trace by which the most sagacious and diligent inquirer can hope to discover he this conduct alone ought to convince we that the prediction be of no small importance to mankind since the author of it appear not to have be influence by any other motive than that noble and exalted philanthropy which be above the narrow view of recompense or applause that interest have no share in this inscription be evident beyond dispute since the age in which he live receive neither pleasure nor instruction from it nor be it less apparent from the suppression of he name that he be equally a stranger to that wild desire of fame which have sometimes infatuate the noblest mind he modesty however have not be able wholly to extinguish that curiosity which so naturally lead we when we admire a performance to inquire after the author those whom i have consult on this occasion and my zeal for the honor of this benefactor of my country have not suffer I to forget a single antiquary of reputation have almost unanimously determine that it be write by a king for where else say they be we to expect that greatness of mind and that dignity of expression so eminently conspicuous in this inscription it be with a proper sense of the weakness of my own ability that i venture to lay before the publick the reason which hinder I from concur with this opinion which i be not only inclined to favor by my respect for the author of it but by a natural affection for monarchy and a prevail inclination to believe that every excellence be inherent in a king to condemn a opinion so agreeable to the reverence due to the regal dignity and countenance by so great authority without a long and accurate discussion would be a temerity justly liable to the severest censure a supercilious and arrogant determination of a controversy of such importance would doubtless be treat by the impartial and candid with the utmost indignation but as i have too high a idea of the learning of my contemporary to obtrude any crude hasty or indigested notion on the publick i have proceed with the utmost degree of diffidence and caution i have frequently review all my argument trace they backwards to they first principle and use every method of examination to discover whether all the deduction be natural and just and whether i be not impose on by some specious fallacy but the farther i carry my inquiry and the longer i dwelt upon this great point the more be i convince in spite of all my prejudice that this wonderful prediction be not write by a king for after a laborious and attentive perusal of history memoirs chronicle live character vindication panegyrick and epitaph i could find no sufficient authority for ascribe to any of we english monarch however gracious or glorious any prophetical knowledge or prescience of futurity which when we consider how rarely regal virtue be forget how soon they be discover and how loudly they be celebrated afford a probable argument at least that none of they have lay any claim to this character for why should historian have omit to embellish they account with such a striking circumstance or if the history of that age be lose by length of time why be not so uncommon a excellence transmit to posterity in the more lasting color of poetry be that unhappy age without a laureate be there then no young -lrb- 19 -rrb- or philip -lrb- 20 -rrb- no ward -lrb- 21 -rrb- or mitchell -lrb- 22 -rrb- to snatch such wonder from oblivion and immortalize a prince of such capacity if this be really the case let we congratulate ourselves upon be reserve for better day day so fruitful of happy writer that no princely virtue can shine in vain we monarch be surround with refined spirit so penetrate that they frequently discover in they master great quality invisible to vulgar eye and which do not they publish they to mankind would be unobserved for ever nor be it easy to find in the life of we monarch many instance of that regard for posterity which seem to have be the prevail temper of this venerable man i have seldom in any of the gracious speech deliver from the throne and receive with the highest gratitude and satisfaction by both house of parliament discover any other concern than for the current year for which supplies be generally demand in very press term and sometimes such as imply no remarkable solicitude for posterity nothing indeed can be more unreasonable and absurd than to require that a monarch distract with care and surround with enemy should involve himself in superfluous anxiety by a unnecessary concern about future generation be not pretender mock-patriot masquerade opera birthnight treaty convention review drawing-room the birth of heir and the death of queen sufficient to overwhelm any capacity but that of a king surely he that acquit himself successfully of such affair may content himself with the glory he acquire and leave posterity to he successor that this have be the conduct of most prince be evident from the account of all age and nation and therefore i hope it will not be think that i have without just reason deprive this inscription of the veneration it might demand as the work of a king with what laborious struggle against prejudice and inclination with what effort of reasoning and pertinacity of self-denial i have prevail upon myself to sacrifice the honor of this monument to the love of truth none who be unacquainted with the fondness of a commentator will be able to conceive but this instance will be i hope sufficient to convince the publick that i write with sincerity and that whatever my success may be my intention be good where we be to look for we author it still remain to be consider whether in the high road of publick employment or the by-path of private life it have always be observe of those that frequent a court that they soon by a kind of contagion catch the regal spirit of neglect futurity the minister form a expedient to suspend or perplex a inquiry into he measure for a few month and applaud and triumph in he own dexterity the peer put off he creditor for the present day and forget that he be ever to see he more the frown of a prince and the loss of a pension have indeed be find of wonderful efficacy to abstract man 's thought from the present time and fill they with zeal for the liberty and welfare of age to come but i be incline to think more favourably of the author of this prediction than that he be make a patriot by disappointment or disgust if he ever see a court i would willingly believe that he do not owe he concern for posterity to he ill reception there but he ill reception there to he concern for posterity however since truth be the same in the mouth of a hermit or a prince since it be not reason but weakness that make we rate counsel by we esteem for the counsellor let we at length desist from this inquiry so useless in itself in which we have room to hope for so little satisfaction let we show we gratitude to the author by answer he intention by consider minutely the line which he have leave we and examine they import without heat precipitancy or party-prejudice let we endeavor to keep the just mean between search ambitiously for far-fetched interpretation and admit such low meaning and obvious and low sense as be inconsistent with those great and extensive view which it be reasonable to ascribe to this excellent man it may be yet further ask whether this inscription which appear in the stone be a original and not rather a version of a traditional prediction in the old british tongue which the zeal of some learn man prompt he to translate and engrave in a more known language for the instruction of future age : but as the line carry at the first view a reference both to the stone itself and very remarkably to the place where it be find i can not see any foundation for such a suspicion it remain now that we examine the sense and import of the inscription which after have long dwell upon it with the closest and most laborious attention i must confess myself not yet able fully to comprehend the follow explication therefore be by no means lay down as certain and indubitable truth but as conjecture not always wholly satisfactory even to myself and which i have not dare to propose to so enlighten a age a age which abound with those great ornament of human nature skeptick antimoralist and infidel but with hope that they would excite some person of greater ability to penetrate further into the oraculous obscurity of this wonderful prediction not even the four first line be without they difficulty in which the time of the discovery of the stone seem to be the time assign for the event foretell by it : cum lapidem hunc magnus qui nunc jacet incolum stagnus vel pede equus tanget vel arator vomere franget sentiet gra metus effundet patrium fletus littoraque ut fluctu resonabunt oppida luctu whene'er this stone now hide beneath the lake the horse shall trample or the plough shall break then o my country shall thou groan distrest grief in thine eye and terror in thy breast thy street with violence of woe shall sound loud as the billow burst on the ground when this stone say he which now lie hide beneath the water of a deep lake shall be strike upon by the horse or break by the plough then shalt thou my country be astonish with terror and drown in tear then shall thy town sound with lamentation as thy shore with the roaring of the wave these be the word literally render but how be they verify the lake be dry the stone be turn up but there be no appearance of this dismal scene be not all at home satisfaction and tranquillity all abroad submission and compliance be it the interest or inclination of any prince or state to draw a sword against we and be we not nevertheless secure by a numerous standing army and a king who be himself a army have we troops any other employment than to march to a review have we fleet encounter any thing but wind and worm to I the present state of the nation seem so far from any resemblance to the noise and agitation of a tempestuous sea that it may be much more properly compare to the dead stillness of the wave before a storm nam foecunda rubrus serpent per pra colubrus gramina vastante flore fructusque vorante omnia foedante vitiante et spoliantes quanquam haud pugnace ibunt per cuncta minace fure absque timore et pingues absque labore then through thy field shall scarlet reptile stray and rapine and pollution mark they way they hungry swarm the peaceful vale shall fright still fierce to threaten still afraid to fight the teem year 's whole product shall devour insatiate pluck the fruit and crop the flow ' r shall glutton on the industrious peasant ' spoil rob without fear and fatten without toil he seem in these verse to descend to a particular account of this dreadful calamity but he description be capable of very different sens with almost equal probability : red serpent say he -lrb- _ rubrus colubrus _ be the latin word which the poetical translator have render _ scarlet reptile _ use a general term for a particular in my opinion too licentiously -rrb- red serpent shall wander o'er she meadow and pillage and pollute & c the particular mention of the color of this destructive viper may be some guide to we in this labyrinth through which i must acknowledge i can not yet have any certain path i confess that when a few day after my perusal of this passage i hear of the multitude of lady-birds see in kent i begin to imagine that these be the fatal insect by which the island be to be lay waste and therefore look over all account of they with uncommon concern but when my first terror begin to subside i soon recollect that these creature have both wing and foot would scarcely have be call serpent and be quickly convince by they leave the country without do any hurt that they have no quality but the color in common with the ravager here describe as i be not able to determine any thing on this question i shall content myself with collect into one view the several property of this pestiferous brood with which we be threaten as hint to more sagacious and fortunate reader who when they shall find any red animal that range uncontrouled over the country and devour the labor of the trader and the husbandman that carry with it corruption rapine pollution and devastation that threaten without courage rob without fear and be pampered without labor they may know that the prediction be complete let I only remark further that if the style of this as of all other prediction be figurative the serpent a wretched animal that crawl upon the earth be a proper emblem of low view self-interest and base submission as well as of cruelty mischief and malevolence i can not forbear to observe in this place that as it be of no advantage to mankind to be forewarn of inevitable and insurmountable misfortune the author probably intend to hint to he countryman the proper remedy for the evil he describe in this calamity on which he dwell longest and which he seem to deplore with the deepest sorrow he point out one circumstance which may be of great use to disperse we apprehension and awaken we from that panick which the reader must necessarily feel at the first transient view of this dreadful description these serpent say the original be haud pugnace of no fighting race they will threaten indeed and hiss and terrify the weak and timorous and thoughtless but have no real courage or strength so that the mischief do by they they ravages devastation and robbery must be only the consequence of cowardice in the sufferer who be harass and oppress only because they suffer it without resistance we be therefore to remember whenever the pest here threaten shall invade we that submission and tameness will be certain ruin and that nothing but spirit vigilance activity and opposition can preserve we from the most hateful and reproachful misery that of be plunder starve and devour by vermin and by reptile horrida demente rapiet discordium gente plurima tunc lex mutabit plurima rege natio then o'er the world shall discord stretch she wing king change they law and kingdom change they king here the author take a general survey of the state of the world and the change that be to happen about the time of the discovery of this monument in many nation as it be not likely that he intend to touch upon the affair of other country any farther than the advantage of he own make it necessary we may reasonably conjecture that he have a full and distinct view of all the negotiation treaty confederacy of all the triple and quadruple alliance and all the league offensive and defensive in which we be to be engage either as principal accessary or guarantee whether by policy or hope or fear or we concern for preserve the balance of power or we tenderness for the liberty of europe he know that we negotiator would interest we in the affair of the whole earth and that no state could either rise or decline in power either extend or lose its dominion without affect politick and influence we council this passage will bear a easy and natural application to the present time in which so many revolution have happen so many nation have change they master and so many dispute and commotion be embroil almost in every part of the world that almost every state in europe and asia that be almost every country then know be comprehend in this prediction may be easily conceive but whether it extend to region at that time undiscovered and portend any alteration of government in carolina and georgium let more able or more daring expositor determine : conversa in rabiem tunc contremet ursa cynthium the bear enrag would th ' affright moon shall dread the terror create to the moon by the anger of the bear be a strange expression but may perhaps relate to the apprehension raise in the turkish empire of which a crescent or new moon be the imperial standard by the increase power of the emperess of russium whose dominion lie under the northern constellation call the bear tunc lati florebunt lilium prati the lily o'er the vale triumphant spread the lily bear by the king of france be a apt representation of that country and they flourish over wide-extended valley seem to regard the new increase of the french power wealth and dominion by the advancement of they trade and the accession of lorrain this be at first view a obvious but perhaps for that very reason not the true sense of the inscription how can we reconcile it with the following passage : nec fremere audebit leo sed violare timebit omnium consuetus popularus pascua laetus nor shall the lion wont of old to reign despotick o'er the desolate plain henceforth th ' inviolable bloom invade or dare to murmur in the flow ` ry glade in which the lion that use at pleasure to lay the pasture waste be represent as not daring to touch the lily or murmur at they growth the lion it be true be one of the supporter of the arm of england and may therefore figure we countryman who have in ancient time make france a desert but can it be say that the lion dare not murmur or rage -lrb- for _ fremere _ may import both -rrb- when it be evident that for many year this whole kingdom have murmur however it may be at present calm and secure by its confidence in the wisdom of we politician and the address of we negotiator : ante oculos natos calceatos et cruciatos jam feret ignavus vetitaque libidine pravus he tortur would son shall die before he face while he lie melting in a lewd embrace here be other thing mention of the lion equally unintelligible if we suppose they to be speak of we nation as that he lie sluggish and depraved with unlawful lust while he offspring be trample and tortured before he eye but in what place can the english be say to be trample or tortured where be they treat with injustice or contempt what nation be there from pole to pole that do not reverence the nod of the british king be not we commerce unrestrained be not the riches of the world we own do not we ship sail unmolested and we merchant traffick in perfect security be not the very name of england treat by foreigner in a manner never know before or if some slight injury have be offer if some of we petty trader have be stop we possession threaten we effect confiscate we flag insult or we ear crop have we lie sluggish and unactive have not we fleet be see in triumph at spithead do not hosier visit the bastimento and be not haddock now station at port mahon en quoque quod mirum quod dica denique dirum sanguinem equus sugit neque bellua victa remugit and yet more strange he vein a horse shall drain nor shall the passive coward once complain it be farther assert in the conclude line that the horse shall suck the lion 's blood this be still more obscure than any of the rest and indeed the difficulty i have meet with ever since the first mention of the lion be so many and great that i have in utter despair of surmount they once desist from my design of publish any thing upon this subject but be prevail upon by the importunity of some friend to whom i can deny nothing to resume my design and i must own that nothing animated I so much as the hope they flatter I with that my essay might be insert in the gazetteer and so become of service to my country that a weaker animal should suck the blood of a stronger without resistance be wholly improbable and inconsistent with the regard for self-preservation so observable in every order and species of being we must therefore necessarily endeavor after some figurative sense not liable to so insuperable a objection be i to proceed in the same tenor of interpretation by which i explain the moon and the lily i might observe that a horse be the arm of h -- but how then do the horse suck the lion 's blood money be the blood of the body politick -- but my zeal for the present happy establishment will not suffer I to pursue a train of thought that lead to such shocking conclusion the idea be detestable and such as it ought to be hope can enter into the mind of none but a virulent republican or bloody jacobite there be not one honest man in the nation unconvinced how weak a attempt it would be to endeavor to confute this insinuation a insinuation which no party will dare to abet and of so fatal and destructive a tendency that it may prove equally dangerous to the author whether true or false as therefore i can form no hypothesis on which a consistent interpretation may be build i must leave these loose and unconnected hint entirely to the candor of the reader and confess that i do not think my scheme of explication just since i can not apply it throughout the whole without involve myself in difficulty from which the ablest interpreter would find it no easy matter to get free be therefore convince upon a attentive and deliberate review of these observation and a consultation with my friend of whose ability i have the highest esteem and whose impartiality sincerity and probity i have long know and frequently experience that my conjecture be in general very uncertain often improbable and sometimes little less than apparently false i be long in doubt whether i ought not entirely to suppress they and content myself with publishing in the gazetteer the inscription as it stand engraven on the stone without translation or commentary unless that ingenious and learn society should favor the world with they own remark to this scheme which i think extremely well calculate for the publick good and therefore very eagerly communicate to my acquaintance and fellow-student some objection be start which as i have not foresee i be unable to answer it be observe first that the daily dissertation publish by that fraternity be write with such profundity of sentiment and fill with such uncommon mode of expression as to be themselves sufficiently unintelligible to vulgar reader and that therefore the venerable obscurity of this prediction would much less excite the curiosity and awaken the attention of mankind than if it be exhibit in any other paper and place in opposition to the clear and easy style of a author generally understand to this argument formidable as it be i answer after a short pause that with all proper deference to the great sagacity and advance age of the objector i could not but conceive that he position confute itself and that a reader of the gazetteer be by he own confession accustom to encounter difficulty and search for mean where it be not easily to be find must be better prepared than any other man for the perusal of these ambiguous expression and that besides the explication of this stone be a task which nothing could surmount but the most acute penetration join with indefatigable patience seem in reality reserve for those who have give proof of both in the highest degree by reading and understand the gazetteer this answer satisfied every one but the objector who with a obstinacy not very uncommon adhere to he own opinion though he could not defend it and not be able to make any reply attempt to laugh away my argument but find the rest of my friend so little disposed to jest upon this important question that he be force to restrain he mirth and content himself with a sullen and contemptuous silence another of my friend whom i have assemble on this occasion have own the solidity of my answer to the first objection offer a second which in he opinion could not be so easily defeat i have observe say he that the essay in the gazetteer though write on very important subject by the ablest hand which ambition can incite friendship engage or money procure have never though circulate through the kingdom with the utmost application have any remarkable influence upon the people i know many person of no common capacity that hold it sufficient to peruse these papers four time a year and other who receive they regularly and without look upon they treasure they under ground for the benefit of posterity so that the inscription may by be insert there sink once more into darkness and oblivion instead of inform the age and assist we present ministry in the regulation of they measure another observe that nothing be more unreasonable than my hope that any remark or elucidation would be draw up by that fraternity since they own employment do not allow they any leisure for such attempt every one know that panegyrick be in its own nature no easy task and that to defend be much more difficult than to attack consider then say he what industry what assiduity it must require to praise and vindicate a ministry like ours it be hint by another that a inscription which have no relation to any particular set of man amongst we but be compose many age before the party which now divide the nation have a be could not be so properly convey to the world by means of a paper dedicate to political debate another to whom i have communicate my own observation in a more private manner and who have insert some of he own argument declare it as he opinion that they be though very controvertible and unsatisfactory yet too valuable to be lose and that though to insert the inscription in a paper of which such number be daily distribute at the expense of the publick would doubtless be very agreeable to the generous design of the author yet he hope that as all the student either of politick or antiquity would receive both pleasure and improvement from the dissertation with which it be accompany none of they would regret to pay for so agreeable a entertainment it can not be wonder that i have yield at last to such weighty reason and such insinuate compliment and choose to gratify at once the inclination of friend and the vanity of a author yet i should think i have very imperfectly discharge my duty to my country do i not warn all whom either interest or curiosity shall incite to the perusal of this treatise not to lay any stress upon my explication how a more complete and indisputable interpretation may be obtain it be not easy to say this will i suppose be readily grant that it be not to be expect from any single hand but from the joint inquiry and unite labor of a numerous society of able man institute by authority select with great discernment and impartiality and support at the charge of the nation i be very far from apprehend that any proposal for the attainment of so desirable a end will be reject by this inquisitive and enlighten age and shall therefore lay before the publick the project which i have form and mature by long consideration for the institution of a society of commentator upon this inscription i humbly propose that thirty of the most distinguished genius be choose for this employment half from the inn of court and half from the army and be incorporate into a society for five year under the name of the society of commentator that great undertaking can only be execute by a great number of hand be too evident to require any proof and i be afraid all that read this scheme will think that it be chiefly defective in this respect and that when they reflect how many commissary be think necessary at seville and that even they negotiation entirely miscarry probably for want of more associate they will conclude that i have propose impossibility and that the end of the institution will be defeat by a injudicious and ill time frugality but if it be consider how well the person i recommend must have be qualify by they education and profession for the province assign they the objection will grow less weighty than it appear it be well know to be the constant study of the lawyer to discover in act of parliament meaning which escape the committee that draw they up and the senate that pass they into law and to explain will into a sense wholly contrary to the intention of the testator how easily may a adept in these admirable and useful art penetrate into the most hidden import of this prediction a man accustom to satisfy himself with the obvious and natural meaning of a sentence do not easily shake off he habit but a true-bred lawyer never contents himself with one sense when there be another to be find nor will the beneficial consequence of this scheme terminate in the explication of this monument : they will extend much further for the commentator have sharpen and improve they sagacity by this long and difficult course of study will when they return into publick life be of wonderful service to the government in examine pamphlet song and journal and in draw up information indictment and instruction for special jury they will be wonderfully fit for the post of attorney and solicitor general but will excel above all as licenser for the stage the gentleman of the army will equally adorn the province to which i have assign they of set the discovery and sentiment of they associate in a clear and agreeable light the lawyer be well know not to be very happy in express they idea be for the most part able to make themselves understand by none but they own fraternity but the genius of the army have sufficient opportunity by they free access to the levee and the toilet they constant attendance on ball and assembly and that abundant leisure which they enjoy beyond any other body of man to acquaint themselves with every new word and prevail mode of expression and to attain the utmost nicety and most polished prettiness of language it will be necessary that during they attendance upon the society they be exempt from any obligation to appear on hyde park and that upon no emergency however press they be call away from they study unless the nation be in immediate danger by a insurrection of weaver collier or smuggler there may not perhaps be find in the army such a number of man who have ever condescend to pass through the labor and irksome form of education in use among the lower class of people or submit to learn the mercantile and plebeian art of write and read i must own that though i entirely agree with the notion of the uselessness of any such trivial accomplishment in the military profession and of they inconsistency with more valuable attainment though i be convince that a man who can read and write become at least a very disagreeable companion to he brother soldier if he do not absolutely shun they acquaintance that he be apt to imbibe from he book odd notion of liberty and independency and even sometimes of morality and virtue utterly inconsistent with the desirable character of a pretty gentleman though write frequently stain the whitest finger and reading have a natural tendency to cloud the aspect and depress that airy and thoughtless vivacity which be the distinguishing characteristick of a modern warrior yet on this single occasion i can not but heartily wish that by a strict search there may be discover in the army fifteen man who can write and read i know that the knowledge of the alphabet be so disreputable among these gentleman that those who have by ill fortune formerly be teach it have partly forget it by disuse and partly conceal it from the world to avoid the raillery and insult to which they education might make they liable : i propose therefore that all the officer of the army may be examine upon oath one by one and that if fifteen can not be select who be at present so qualify the deficiency may be supply out of those who have once learn to read may perhaps with the assistance of a master in a short time refresh they memory it may be think at the first sight of this proposal that it might not be improper to assign to every commentator a reader and secretary but it may be easily conceive that not only the publick might murmur at such a addition of expense but that by the unfaithfulness or negligence of they servant the discovery of the society may be carry to foreign court and make use of to the disadvantage of we own country for the residence of this society i can not think any place more proper than greenwich hospital in which they may have thirty apartment fit up for they that they may make they observation in private and meet once a day in the paint hall to compare they if the establishment of this society be think a matter of too much importance to be defer till the new building be finish it will be necessary to make room for they reception by the expulsion of such of the seaman as have no pretension to the settlement there but fracture limb loss of eye or decayed constitution who have lately be admit in such number that it be now scarce possible to accommodate a nobleman 's groom footman or postilion in a manner suitable to the dignity of he profession and the original design of the foundation the situation of greenwich will naturally dispose they to reflection and study : and particular caution ought to be use lest any interruption be suffer to dissipate they attention or distract they meditation : for this reason all visit and letter from lady be strictly to be prohibit and if any of the member shall be detect with a lapdog pack of card box of dice draught-table snuffbox or looking-glass he shall for the first offence be confine for three month to water gruel and for the second be expel the society nothing now remain but that a estimate be make of the expense necessary for carry on this noble and generous design the salary to be allow each professor can not be less than 2000_l _ a year which be indeed more than the regular stipend of a commissioner of excise but it must be remember that the commentator have a much more difficult and important employment and can expect they salary but for the short space of five year whereas a commissioner -lrb- unless he imprudently suffer himself to be carry away by a whimsical tenderness for he country -rrb- have a establishment for life it will be necessary to allow the society in general 30000_l _ yearly for the support of the publick table and 40000_l _ for secret service thus will the ministry have a fair prospect of obtain the full sense and import of the prediction without burden the publick with more than 650000_l _ which may be pay out of the sink fund or if it be not think proper to violate that sacred treasure by convert any part of it to use not primarily intend may be easily raise by a general poll-tax or excise upon bread have now complete my scheme a scheme calculate for the publick benefit without regard to any party i entreat all sect faction and distinction of man among we to lay aside for a time they party-feud and petty animosity and by a warm concurrence on this urgent occasion teach posterity to sacrifice every private interest to the advantage of they country -lrb- in this performance which be first print in the year 1739 dr johnson in a feigned inscription suppose to have be find in norfolk the country of sir robert walpole then the obnoxious prime minister of this country inveigh against the brunswick succession and the measure of government consequent upon it to this suppose prophecy he add a commentory make each expression apply to the time with warm anti-hanoverian zeal -- boswell 's life i -rrb- observation on the state of affair in 1756 -lrb- 23 -rrb- the time be now come in which every englishman expect to be inform of the national affair and in which he have a right to have that expectation gratify for whatever may be urge by minister or those whom vanity or interest make the follower of minister concern the necessity of confidence in we governor and the presumption of prying with profane eye into the recess of policy it be evident that this reverence can be claim only by counsel yet unexecuted and project suspend in deliberation but when a design have end in miscarriage or success when every eye and every ear be witness to general discontent or general satisfaction it be then a proper time to disentangle confusion and illustrate obscurity to show by what cause every event be produce and in what effect it be likely to terminate to lay down with distinct particularity what rumor always huddle in general exclamation or perplex by undigested narrative to show whence happiness or calamity be derive and whence it may be expect and honestly to lay before the people what inquiry can gather of the past and conjecture can estimate of the future the general subject of the present war be sufficiently know it be allow on both side that hostility begin in america and that the french and english quarrel about the boundary of they settlement about grounds and river to which i be afraid neither can show any other right than that of power and which neither can occupy but by usurpation and the dispossession of the natural lord and original inhabitant such be the contest that no honest man can heartily wish success to either party it may indeed be allege that the indian have grant large tract of land both to one and to the other but these grant can add little to the validity of we title till it be experience how they be obtain for if they be extort by violence or induce by fraud by threat which the misery of other nation have show not to be vain or by promise of which no performance be ever intend what be they but new mode of usurpation but new instance of crueltv and treachery and indeed what but false hope or resistless terror can prevail upon a weaker nation to invite a stronger into they country to give they land to stranger whom no affinity of manners or similitude of opinion can be say to recommend to permit they to build town from which the native be exclude to raise fortress by which they be intimidate to settle themselves with such strength that they can not afterwards be expel but be for ever to remain the master of the original inhabitant the dictator of they conduct and the arbiter of they fate when we see man act thus against the precept of reason and the instinct of nature we can not hesitate to determine that by some means or other they be debar from choice that they be lure or fright into compliance that they either grant only what they find impossible to keep or expect advantage upon the faith of they new inmate which there be no purpose to confer upon they it can not be say that the indian originally invite we to they coast we go uncalled and unexpected to nation who have no imagination that the earth contain any inhabitant so distant and so different from themselves we astonish they with we ship with we arm and with we general superiority they yield to we as to being of another and higher race send among they from some unknown region with power which naked indian could not resist and which they be therefore by every act of humility to propitiate that they who could so easily destroy might be induce to spare to this influence and to this only be to be attribute all the cession and submission of the indian prince if indeed any such cession be ever make of which we have no witness but those who claim from they and there be no great malignity in suspect that those who have rob have also lie some colony indeed have be establish more peaceably than other the utmost extremity of wrong have not always be practice but those that have settle in the new world on the fairest term have no other merit than that of a scrivener who ruin in silence over a plunderer that seize by force all have take what have other owner and all have have recourse to arm rather than quit the prey on which they have fasten the american dispute between the french and we be therefore only the quarrel of two robber for the spoil of a passenger but as robber have term of confederacy which they be oblige to observe as member of the gang so the english and french may have relative rights and do injustice to each other while both be injure the indian and such indeed be the present contest : they have part the northern continent of america between they and be now dispute about they boundary and each be endeavor the destruction of the other by the help of the indian whose interest it be that both should be destroy both nation clamor with great vehemence about infraction of limit violation of treaty open usurpation insidious artifice and breach of faith the english rail at the perfidious french and the french at the encroach english : they quote treaty on each side charge each other with aspire to universal monarchy and complain on either part of the insecurity of possession near such turbulent neighbor through this mist of controversy it can raise no wonder that the truth be not easily discover when a quarrel have be long carry on between individual it be often very hard to tell by whom it be begin every fact be darken by distance by interest and by multitude information be not easily procure from far those whom the truth will not favor will not step voluntarily forth to tell it and where there be many agent it be easy for every single action to be conceal all these cause concur to the obscurity of the question : by whom be hostility in america commence perhaps there never can be remember a time in which hostility have cease two powerful colony inflamed with immemorial rivalry and place out of the superintendence of the mother nation be not likely to be long at rest some opposition be always go forward some mischief be every day do or meditate and the borderer be always better pleased with what they could snatch from they neighbor than what they have of they own in this disposition to reciprocal invasion a cause of dispute never could be want the forest and desert of america be without landmark and therefore can not be particularly specify in stipulation the appellation of those wide-extended region have in every mouth a different meaning and be understand on either side as inclination happen to contract or extend they who have yet pretend to define how much of america be include in brazil mexico or peru it be almost as easy to divide the atlantick ocean by a line as clearly to ascertain the limit of those uncultivated uninhabitable unmeasured region it be likewise to be consider that contract concern boundary be often left vague and indefinite without necessity by the desire of each party to interpret the ambiguity to its own advantage when a fit opportunity shall be find in form stipulation the commissary be often ignorant and often negligent they be sometimes weary with debate and contract a tedious discussion into general term or refer it to a former treaty which be never understand the weaker part be always afraid of require explanation and the stronger always have a interest in leave the question undecided : thus it will happen without great caution on either side that after long treaty solemnly ratify the rights that have be dispute be still equally open to controversy in america it may easily be suppose that there be tract of land not yet claim by either party and therefore mention in no treaty which yet one or the other may be afterwards incline to occupy but to these vacant and unsettled country each nation may pretend as each conceive itself entitle to all that be not expressly grant to the other here then be a perpetual ground of contest every enlargement of the possession of either will be consider as something take from the other and each will endeavor to regain what have never be claim but that the other occupy it thus obscure in its original be the american contest it be difficult to find the first invader or to tell where invasion properly begin but i suppose it be not to be doubt that after the last war when the french have make peace with such apparent superiority they naturally begin to treat we with less respect in distant part of the world and to consider we as a people from whom they have nothing to fear and who could no longer presume to contravene they design or to check they progress the power of do wrong with impunity seldom wait long for the will and it be reasonable to believe that in america the french would avow they purpose of aggrandize themselves with at least as little reserve as in europe we may therefore readily believe that they be unquiet neighbor and have no great regard to right which they believe we no longer able to enforce that in form a line of fort behind we colony if in no other part of they attempt they have act against the general intention if not against the literal term of treaty can scarcely be deny for it never can be suppose that we intend to be inclose between the sea and the french garrison or preclude ourselves from extend we plantation backwards to any length that we convenience should require with dominion be confer every thing that can secure dominion he that have the coast have likewise the sea to a certain distance he that possess a fortress have the right of prohibit another fortress to be build within the command of its cannon when therefore we plant the coast of north america we suppose the possession of the inland region grant to a indefinite extent and every nation that settle in that part of the world seem by the permission of every other nation to have make the same supposition in its own favor here then perhaps it will be safest to fix the justice of we cause here we be apparently and indisputably injure and this injury may accord to the practice of nation be justly resent whether we have not in return make some encroachment upon they must be leave doubtful till we practice on the ohio shall be state and vindicate there be no two nation confine on each other between whom a war may not always be kindle with plausible pretence on either part as there be always pass between they a reciprocation of injury and fluctuation of encroachment from the conclusion of the last peace perpetual complaint of the supplantation and invasion of the french have be send to europe from we colony and transmit to we minister at paris where good word be sometimes give we and the practice of the american commander be sometimes disown but no redress be ever obtain nor be it probable that any prohibition be send to america we be still amuse with such doubtful promise as those who be afraid of war be ready to interpret in they own favor and the french push forward they line of fortress and seem to resolve that before we complaint be finally dismiss all remedy should be hopeless we likewise endeavor at the same time to form a barrier against the canadian by send a colony to new scotland a cold uncomfortable tract of ground of which we have long the nominal possession before we really begin to occupy it to this those be invite whom the cessation of war deprive of employment and make burdensome to they country and settler be allure thither by many fallacious description of fertile valley and clear sky what effect these picture of american happiness have upon my countryman i be never inform but i suppose very few seek provision in those frozen region whom guilt or poverty do not drive from they native country about the boundary of this new colony there be some dispute but as there be nothing yet worth a contest the power of the french be not much exert on that side some disturbance be however give and some skirmish ensue but perhaps be people chiefly with soldier who would rather live by plunder than by agriculture and who consider war as they best trade new scotland would be more obstinately defend than some settlement of far greater value and the french be too well inform of they own interest to provoke hostility for no advantage or to select that country for invasion where they must hazard much and can win little they therefore press on southward behind we ancient and wealthy settlement and build fort after fort at such distance that they might conveniently relieve one another invade we colony with sudden incursion and retire to place of safety before we people could unite to oppose they this design of the french have be long form and long know both in america and europe and might at first have be easily repress have force be use instead of expostulation when the english attempt a settlement upon the island of st lucia the french whether justly or not consider it as neutral and forbid to be occupy by either nation immediately land upon it and destroy the house waste the plantation and drive or carry away the inhabitant this be do in the time of peace when mutual profession of friendship be daily exchange by the two court and be not consider as any violation of treaty nor be any more than a very soft remonstrance make on we part the french therefore teach we how to act but a hanoverian quarrel with the house of austrium for some time induce we to court at any expense the alliance of a nation whose very situation make they we enemy we suffer they to destroy we settlement and to advance they own which we have a equal right to attack the time however come at last when we venture to quarrel with spain and then france no longer suffer the appearance of peace to subsist between we but arm in defense of she ally the event of the war be well know : we please ourselves with a victory at dettingen where we leave we wound man to the care of we enemy but we army be break at fontenoy and val and though after the disgrace which we suffer in the mediterranean we have some naval success and a accidental dearth make peace necessary for the french yet they prescribe the condition oblige we to give hostage and act as conqueror though as conqueror of moderation in this war the american distinguish themselves in a manner unknown and unexpected the new english raise a army and under the command of pepperel take cape breton with the assistance of the fleet this be the most important fortress in america we please ourselves so much with the acquisition that we could not think of restore it and among the argument use to inflame the people against charle stuart it be very clamorously urge that if he gain the kingdom he would give cape breton back to the french the french however have a more easy expedient to regain cape breton than by exalt charle stuart to the english throne they take in they turn fort st george and have we east indium company wholly in they power whom they restore at the peace to they former possession that they may continue to export we silver cape breton therefore be restore and the french be reestablish in america with equal power and greater spirit have lose nothing by the war which they have before gain to the general reputation of they arm and that habitual superiority which they derive from it they owe they power in america rather than to any real strength or circumstance of advantage they number be yet not great they trade though daily improve be not very extensive they country be barren they fortress though numerous be weak and rather shelter from wild beast or savage nation than place build for defense against bomb or cannon cape breton have be find not to be impregnable nor if we consider the state of the place possess by the two nation in america be there any reason upon which the french should have presume to molest we but that they think we spirit so broken that we dare not resist they and in this opinion we long forbearance easily confirm they we forget or rather avoid to think that what we delay to do must be do at last and do with more difficulty as it be delay longer that while we be complain and they be elude or answer we complaint fort be rise upon fort and one invasion make a precedent for another this confidence of the french be exalt by some real advantage if they possess in those country less than we they have more to gain and less to hazard if they be less numerous they be better unite the french compose one body with one head they have all the same interest and agree to pursue it by the same means they be subject to a governor commission by a absolute monarch and participate the authority of he master design be therefore form without debate and execute without impediment they have yet more martial than mercantile ambition and seldom suffer they military scheme to be entangled with collateral project of gain : they have no wish but for conquest of which they justly consider riches as the consequence some advantage they will always have as invader they make war at the hazard of they enemy : the contest be carry on in we territory we must lose more by a victory than they will suffer by a defeat they will subsist while they stay upon we plantation and perhaps destroy they when they can stay no longer if we pursue they and carry the war into they dominion we difficulty will increase every step as we advance for we shall leave plenty behind we and find nothing in canada but lake and forest barren and trackless we enemy will shut themselves up in they fort against which it be difficult to bring cannon through so rough a country and which if they be provide with good magazine will soon starve those who besiege they all these be the natural effect of they government and situation they be accidentally more formidable as they be less happy but the favor of the indian which they enjoy with very few exception among all the nation of the northern continent we ought to consider with other thought this favor we might have enjoy if we have be careful to deserve it the french by have these savage nation on they side be always supply with spy and guide and with auxiliary like the tartar to the turk or the hussar to the german of no great use against troops range in order of battle but very well qualify to maintain a war among wood and rivulet where much mischief may be do by unexpected onset and safety be obtain by quick retreat they can waste a colony by sudden inroad surprise the straggle planter frighten the inhabitant into town hinder the cultivation of land and starve those whom they be not able to conquer -lrb- 24 -rrb- a introduction to the political state of great britain write in the year 1756 -lrb- 25 -rrb- the present system of english politick may properly be say to have take rise in the reign of queen elizabeth at this time the protestant religion be establish which naturally ally we to the reform state and make all the popish power we enemy we begin in the same reign to extend we trade by which we make it necessary to ourselves to watch the commercial progress of we neighbor and if not to incommode and obstruct they traffick to hinder they from impair ours we then likewise settle colony in america which be become the great scene of european ambition for see with what treasure the spaniard be annually enrich from mexico and peru every nation imagine that a american conquest or plantation would certainly fill the mother country with gold and silver this produce a large extent of very distant dominion of which we at this time neither know nor foresee the advantage or incumbrance we seem to have snatch they into we hand upon no very just principle of policy only because every state accord to a prejudice of long continuance conclude itself more powerful as its territory become larger the discovery of new region which be then every day make the profit of remote traffick and the necessity of long voyage produce in a few year a great multiplication of ship the sea be consider as the wealthy element and by degree a new kind of sovereignty arise call naval dominion as the chief trade of the world so the chief maritime power be at first in the hand of the portuguese and spaniard who by a compact to which the consent of other prince be not ask have divide the newly discover country between they but the crown of portugal have fall to the king of spain or be seize by he he be master of the ship of the two nation with which he keep all the coast of europe in alarm till the armada which he have raise at a vast expense for the conquest of england be destroy which put a stop and almost a end to the naval power of the spaniard at this time the dutch who be oppress by the spaniard and fear yet greater evil than they feel resolve no longer to endure the insolence of they master : they therefore revolt and after a struggle in which they be assist by the money and force of elizabeth erect a independent and powerful commonwealth when the inhabitant of the low country have form they system of government and some remission of the war give they leisure to form scheme of future prosperity they easily perceive that as they territory be narrow and they number small they could preserve themselves only by that power which be the consequence of wealth and that by a people whose country produce only the necessaries of life wealth be not to be acquire but from foreign dominion and by the transportation of the product of one country into another from this necessity thus justly estimate arise a plan of commerce which be for many year prosecute with industry and success perhaps never see in the world before and by which the poor tenant of mud-walled village and impassable bog erect themselves into high and mighty state who put the greatest monarch at defiance whose alliance be court by the proudest and whose power be dread by the fiercest nation by the establishment of this state there arise to england a new ally and a new rival at this time which seem to be the period destine for the change of the face of europe france begin first to rise into power and from defend she own province with difficulty and fluctuate success to threaten she neighbor with encroachment and devastation henry the fourth have after a long struggle obtain the crown find it easy to govern noble exhaust and weary with a long civil war and have compose the dispute between the protestant and papist so as to obtain at least a truce for both party be at leisure to accumulate treasure and raise force which he purpose to have employ in a design of settle for ever the balance of europe of this great scheme he live not to see the vanity or to feel the disappointment for he be murder in the midst of he mighty preparation the french however be in this reign teach to know they own power and the great design of a king whose wisdom they have so long experienced even though they be not bring to actual experiment dispose they to consider themselves as master of the destiny of they neighbor and from that time he that shall nicely examine they scheme and conduct will i believe find that they begin to take a air of superiority to which they have never pretend before and that they have be always employ more or less openly upon scheme of dominion though with frequent interruption from domestick trouble and with those intermission which human counsel must always suffer as man intrust with great affair be dissipate in youth and languid in age be embarrass by competitor or without any external reason change they mind france be now no longer in dread of insult and invasion from england she be not only able to maintain she own territory but prepare on all occasion to invade other and we have now a neighbor whose interest it be to be a enemy and who have disturb we from that time to this with open hostility or secret machination such be the state of england and its neighbor when elizabeth leave the crown to jame of scotland it have not i think be frequently observe by historian at how critical a time the union of the two kingdom happen have england and scotland continue separate kingdom when france be establish in the full possession of she natural power the scot in continuance of the league which it would now have be more than ever they interest to observe would upon every instigation of the french court have raise a army with french money and harass we with a invasion in which they would have think themselves successful whatever number they might have leave behind they to a people warlike and indigent a incursion into a rich country be never hurtful the pay of france and the plunder of the northern country would always have tempt they to hazard they life and we should have be under a necessity of keep a line of garrison along we border this trouble however we escape by the accession of king jame but it be uncertain whether he natural disposition do not injure we more than this accidental condition happen to benefit we he be a man of great theoretical knowledge but of no practical wisdom he be very well able to discern the true interest of himself he kingdom and he posterity but sacrifice it upon all occasion to he present pleasure or he present ease so conscious of he own knowledge and ability that he would not suffer a minister to govern and so lax of attention and timorous of opposition that he be not able to govern for himself with this character jame quietly see the dutch invade we commerce the french grow every day stronger and stronger and the protestant interest of which he boast himself the head be oppress on every side while he writ and hunt and despatch ambassador who when they master 's weakness be once know be treat in foreign court with very little ceremony jame however take care to be flatter at home and be neither angry nor ashamed at the appearance that he make in other country thus england grow weaker or what be in political estimation the same thing see she neighbor grow stronger without receive proportionable addition to she own power not that the mischief be so great as it be generally conceive or represent for i believe it may be make to appear that the wealth of the nation be in this reign very much increase though that of the crown be lessen we reputation for war be impaired but commerce seem to have be carry on with great industry and vigor and nothing be want but that we should have defend ourselves from the encroachment of we neighbor the inclination to plant colony in america still continue and this be the only project in which man of adventure and enterprise could exert they quality in a pacifick reign multitude who be discontent with they condition in they native country and such multitude there will always be seek relief or at least a change in the western region where they settle in the northern part of the continent at a distance from the spaniard at that time almost the only nation that have any power or will to obstruct we such be the condition of this country when the unhappy charle inherit the crown he have see the error of he father without be able to prevent they and when he begin he reign endeavor to raise the nation to its former dignity the french papist have begin a new war upon the protestant : charle send a fleet to invade rhe and relieve rochelle but he attempt be defeat and the protestant be subdue the dutch grown wealthy and strong claim the right of fishing in the british sea : this claim the king who see the increase power of the state of holland resolve to contest but for this end it be necessary to build a fleet and a fleet could not be build without expense : he be advise to levy ship-money which give occasion to the civil war of which the event and conclusion be too well know while the inhabitant of this island be embroil among themselves the power of france and holland be every day increase the dutch have overcome the difficulty of they infant commonwealth and as they still retain they vigor and industry from rich grow continually richer and from powerful more powerful they extend they traffick and have not yet admit luxury so that they have the means and the will to accumulate wealth without any incitement to spend it the french who want nothing to make they powerful but a prudent regulation of they revenue and a proper use of they natural advantage by the successive care of skilful minister become every day stronger and more conscious of they strength about this time it be that the french first begin to turn they thought to traffick and navigation and to desire like other nation a american territory all the fruitful and valuable part of the western world be already either occupy or claim and nothing remain for france but the leavings of other navigator for she be not yet haughty enough to seize what the neighbouring power have already appropriate the french therefore contented themselves with send a colony to canada a cold uncomfortable uninviting region from which nothing but fur and fish be to be have and where the new inhabitant could only pass a laborious and necessitous life in perpetual regret of the deliciousness and plenty of they native country notwithstanding the opinion which we countryman have be teach to entertain of the comprehension and foresight of french politician i be not able to persuade myself that when this colony be first plant it be think of much value even by those that encourage it there be probably nothing more intended than to provide a drain into which the waste of a exuberant nation might be throw a place where those who could do no good might live without the power of do mischief some new advantage they undoubtedly see or imagine themselves to see and what more be necessary to the establishment of the colony be supply by natural inclination to experiment and that impatience of do nothing to which mankind perhaps owe much of what be imagine to be effect by more splendid motive in this region of desolate sterility they settle themselves upon whatever principle and as they have from that time have the happiness of a government by which no interest have be neglect nor any part of they subject overlook they have by continual encouragement and assistance from france be perpetually enlarge they bound and increase they number these be at first like other nation who invade america inclined to consider the neighborhood of the native as troublesome and dangerous and be charge with have destroy great number but they be now grow wiser if not honester and instead of endeavor to frighten the indian away they invite they to inter-marriage and cohabitation and allure they by all practicable method to become the subject of the king of france if the spaniard when they first take possession of the newly discover world instead of destroy the inhabitant by thousand have either have the urbanity or the policy to have conciliate they by kind treatment and to have unite they gradually to they own people such a accession might have be make to the power of the king of spain as would have make he far the greatest monarch that ever yet rule in the globe but the opportunity be lose by foolishness and cruelty and now can never be recover when the parliament have finally prevail over we king and the army over the parliament the interest of the two commonwealth of england and holland soon appear to be opposite and a new government declare war against the dutch in this contest be exert the utmost power of the two nation and the dutch be finally defeat yet not with such evidence of superiority as leave we much reason to boast we victory : they be oblige however to solicit peace which be grant they on easy condition and cromwell who be now possess of the supreme power be leave at leisure to pursue other design the european power have not yet cease to look with envy on the spanish acquisition in america and therefore cromwell think that if he gain any part of these celebrated region he should exalt he own reputation and enrich the country he therefore quarrel with the spaniard upon some such subject of contention as he that be resolve upon hostility may always find and send penn and venable into the western sea they first land in hispaniolum whence they be drive off with no great reputation to themselves and that they might not return without have do something they afterwards invade jamaica where they find less resistance and obtain that island which be afterwards consign to we be probably of little value to the spaniard and continue to this day a place of great wealth and dreadful wickedness a den of tyrant and a dungeon of slave cromwell who perhaps have not leisure to study foreign politick be very fatally mistake with regard to spain and france spain have be the last power in europe which have openly pretend to give law to other nation and the memory of this terror remain when the real cause be at a end we have more lately be fright by spain than by france and though very few be then alive of the generation that have they sleep break by the armada yet the name of the spaniard be still terrible and a war against they be please to the people we own trouble have leave we very little desire to look out upon the continent a inveterate prejudice hinder we from perceive that for more than half a century the power of france have be increase and that of spain have be grow less nor do it seem to have be remember which yet require no great depth of policy to discern that of two monarch neither of which could be long we friend it be we interest to have the weaker near we or that if a war should happen spain however wealthy or strong in herself be by the dispersion of she territory more obnoxious to the attack of a naval power and consequently have more to fear from we and have it less in she power to hurt we all these consideration be overlook by the wisdom of that age and cromwell assist the french to drive the spaniard out of flander at a time when it be we interest to have support the spaniard against france as formerly the hollander against spain by which we might at least have retard the growth of the french power though i think it must have finally prevail during this time we colony which be less disturb by we commotion than the mother-country naturally increase it be probable that many who be unhappy at home take shelter in those remote region where for the sake of invite greater number every one be allow to think and live he own way the french settlement in the mean time go slowly forward too inconsiderable to raise any jealousy and too weak to attempt any encroachment when cromwell die the confusion that follow produce the restoration of monarchy and some time be employ in repair the ruin of we constitution and restore the nation to a state of peace in every change there will be many that suffer real or imaginary grievance and therefore many will be dissatisfy this be perhaps the reason why several colony have they beginning in the reign of charle the second the quaker willingly seek refuge in pennsylvanium and it be not unlikely that carolina owe its inhabitant to the remains of that restless disposition which have give so much disturbance to we country and have now no opportunity of act at home the dutch still continue to increase in wealth and power either kindle the resentment of they neighbor by they insolence or raise they envy by they prosperity charle make war upon they without much advantage but they be oblige at last to confess he the sovereign of the narrow sea they be reduce almost to extremity by a invasion from france but soon recover from they consternation and by the fluctuation of war regain they city and province with the same speed as they have lose they during the time of charle the second the power of france be every day increase and charle who never disturb himself with remote consequence see the progress of she arm and the extension of she dominion with very little uneasiness he be indeed sometimes drive by the prevail faction into confederacy against she but as he have probably a secret partiality in she favor he never persevere long in act against she nor ever act with much vigor so that by he feeble resistance he rather raise she confidence than hinder she design about this time the french first begin to perceive the advantage of commerce and the importance of a naval force and such encouragement be give to manufacture and so eagerly be every project receive by which trade could be advance that in a few year the sea be fill with they ship and all the part of the world crowd with they merchant there be perhaps no instance in human story of such a change produce in so short a time in the scheme and manners of a people of so many new source of wealth open and such number of artificer and merchant make to start out of the ground as be see in the ministry of colbert now it be that the power of france become formidable to england she dominion be large before and she army numerous but she operation be necessarily confine to the continent she have neither ship for the transportation of she troops nor money for they support in distant expedition colbert saw both these want and see that commerce only would supply they the fertility of they country furnish the french with commodity the poverty of the common people keep the price of labor low by the obvious practice of sell much and buy little it be apparent that they would soon draw the wealth of other country into they own and by carry out they merchandise in they own vessel a numerous body of sailor would quickly be raise this be project and this be perform the king of france be soon enable to bribe those whom he could not conquer and to terrify with he fleet those whom he army could not have approach the influence of france be suddenly diffuse all over the globe she arm be dread and she pension receive in remote region and those be almost ready to acknowledge she sovereignty who a few year before have scarcely hear she name she thunder on the coast of africa and receive ambassador from siam so much may be do by one wise man endeavor with honesty the advantage of the publick but that we may not rashly condemn all minister as want wisdom or integrity whose counsel have produce no such apparent benefit to they country it must be consider that colbert have means of act which we government do not allow he could enforce all he order by the power of a absolute monarch he could compel individual to sacrifice they private profit to the general good he could make one understand preside over many hand and remove difficulty by quick and violent expedient where no man think himself under any obligation to submit to another and instead of cooperate in one great scheme every one hasten through by-path to private profit no great change can suddenly be make nor be superior knowledge of much effect where every man resolve to use he own eye and he own judgment and every one applaud he own dexterity and diligence in proportion as he become rich sooner than he neighbor colony be always the effect and cause of navigation they who visit many country find some in which pleasure profit or safety invite they to settle and these settlement when they be once make must keep a perpetual correspondence with the original country to which they be subject and on which they depend for protection in danger and supplies in necessity so that a country once discover and plant must always find employment for ship more certainly than any foreign commerce which depend on casualty may be sometimes more and sometimes less and which other nation may contract or suppress a trade to colony can never be much impaired be in reality only a intercourse between distant province of the same empire from which intruder be easily exclude likewise the interest and affection of the correspondent party however distant be the same on this reason all nation whose power have be exert on the ocean have fix colony in remote part of the world and while those colony subsist navigation if it do not increase be always preserve from total decay with this policy the french be well acquaint and therefore improve and augment the settlement in america and other region in proportion as they advance they scheme of naval greatness the exact time in which they make they acquisition in america or other quarter of the globe it be not necessary to collect it be sufficient to observe that they trade and they colony increase together and if they naval armament be carry on as they really be in greater proportion to they commerce than can be practice in other country it must be attribute to the martial disposition at that time prevail in the nation to the frequent war which lewi the fourteenth make upon he neighbor and to the extensive commerce of the english and dutch which afford so much plunder to privateer that war be more lucrative than traffick thus the naval power of france continue to increase during the reign of charle the second who between he fondness of ease and pleasure the struggle of faction which he could not suppress and he inclination to the friendship of absolute monarchy have not much power or desire to repress it and of jame the second it could not be expect that he should act against he neighbor with great vigor have the whole body of he subject to oppose he be not ignorant of the real interest of he country he desire its power and its happiness and think rightly that there be no happiness without religion but he think very erroneously and absurdly that there be no religion without popery when the necessity of self-preservation have impel the subject of jame to drive he from the throne there come a time in which the passion as well as interest of the government act against the french and in which it may perhaps be reasonably doubt whether the desire of humbling france be not stronger than that of exalt england : of this however it be not necessary to inquire since though the intention may be different the event will be the same all mouth be now open to declare what every eye have observe before that the arm of france be become dangerous to europe and that if she encroachment be suffer a little longer resistance would be too late it be now determine to reassert the empire of the sea but it be more easily determine than perform : the french make a vigorous defense against the united power of england and holland and be sometimes master of the ocean though the two maritime power be unite against they at length however they be defeat at la hogue a great part of they fleet be destroy and they be reduce to carry on the war only with they privateer from whom there be suffer much petty mischief though there be no danger of conquest or invasion they distressed we merchant and oblige we to the continual expense of convoy and fleet of observation and by skulk in little cove and shallow water escape we pursuit in this reign begin we confederacy with the dutch which mutual interest have now improve into a friendship conceive by some to be inseparable and from that time the state begin to be term in the style of politician we faithful friend the ally which nature have give we we protestant confederate and by many other name of national endearment we have it be true the same interest as oppose to france and some resemblance of religion as oppose to popery but we have such a rivalry in respect of commerce as will always keep we from very close adherence to each other no mercantile man or mercantile nation have any friendship but for money and alliance between they will last no longer than they common safety or common profit be endanger no longer than they have a enemy who threaten to take from each more than either can steal from the other we be both sufficiently interested in repress the ambition and obstruct the commerce of france and therefore we concur with as much fidelity and as regular cooperation as be commonly find the dutch be in immediate danger the army of they enemy hover over they country and therefore they be oblige to dismiss for a time they love of money and they narrow project of private profit and to do what a trader do not willingly at any time believe necessary to sacrifice a part for the preservation of the whole a peace be at length make and the french with they usual vigor and industry rebuild they fleet restore they commerce and become in a very few year able to contest again the dominion of the sea they ship be well build and always very numerously man they commander have no hope but from they bravery or they fortune be resolute and be very carefully educate for the sea be eminently skilful all this be soon perceive when queen anne the then darling of england declare war against france we success by sea though sufficient to keep we from dejection be not such as dejected we enemy it be indeed to be confess that we do not exert we whole naval strength marlborough be the governor of we counsel and the great view of marlborough be a war by land which he know well how to conduct both to the honor of he country and he own profit the fleet be therefore starve that the army might be supply and naval advantage be neglect for the sake of take a town in flander to be garrison by we ally the french however be so weaken by one defeat after another that though they fleet be never destroy by any total overthrow they at last retain it in they harbor and apply they whole force to the resistance of the confederate army that now begin to approach they frontier and threaten to lay waste they province and city in the latter year of this war the danger of they neighborhood in america seem to have be consider and a fleet be fit out and supply with a proper number of land force to seize quebec the capital of canada or new france but this expedition miscarry like that of anson against the spaniard by the lateness of the season and we ignorance of the coast on which we be to act we return with loss and only excited we enemy to greater vigilance and perhaps to stronger fortification when the peace of utrecht be make which those who clamour among we most loudly against it find it they interest to keep the french apply themselves with the utmost industry to the extension of they trade which we be so far from hinder that for many year we ministry think they friendship of such value as to be cheaply purchase by whatever concession instead therefore of oppose as we have hitherto profess to do the boundless ambition of the house of bourbon we become on a sudden solicitous for its exaltation and studious of its interest we assist the scheme of france and spain with we fleet and endeavor to make these we friend by servility whom nothing but power will keep quiet and who must always be we enemy while they be endeavor to grow greater and we determine to remain free that nothing might be omit which could testify we willingness to continue on any term the good friend of france we be content to assist not only they conquest but they traffick and though we do not openly repeal the prohibitory law we yet tamely suffer commerce to be carry on between the two nation and wool be daily import to enable they to make cloth which they carry to we market and sell cheaper than we during all this time they be extend and strengthen they settlement in america contrive new mode of traffick and frame new alliance with the indian nation they begin now to find these northern region barren and desolate as they be sufficiently valuable to desire at least a nominal possession that might furnish a pretence for the exclusion of other they therefore extend they claim to tract of land which they could never hope to occupy take care to give they dominion a unlimited magnitude have give in they map the name of louisiana to a country of which part be claim by the spaniard and part by the english without any regard to ancient boundary or prior discovery when the return of columbus from he great voyage have fill all europe with wonder and curiosity henry the seventh send sebastian cabot to try what could be find for the benefit of england : he decline the track of columbus and steering to the westward fall upon the island which from that time be call by the english newfoundland we prince seem to have consider themselves as entitle by they right of prior seizure to the northern part of america as the spaniard be allow by universal consent they claim to the southern region for the same reason and we accordingly make we principal settlement within the limit of we own discovery and by degree plant the eastern coast from newfoundland to georgia as we have accord to the european principle which allow nothing to the native of these region we choice of situation in this extensive country we naturally fix we habitation along the coast for the sake of traffick and correspondence and all the conveniency of navigable river and when one port or river be occupy the next colony instead of fix themselves in the inland part behind the former go on southward till they please themselves with another maritime situation for this reason we colony have more length than depth they extent from east to west or from the sea to the interior country bear no proportion to they reach along the coast from north to south it be however understand by a kind of tacit compact among the commercial power that possession of the coast include a right to the inland and therefore the charter grant to the several colony limit they district only from north to south leave they possession from east to west unlimited and discretional supposing that as the colony increase they may take land as they shall want they the possession of the coast exclude other navigator and the unhappy indian have no right of nature or of nation this right of the first european possessor be not dispute till it become the interest of the french to question it canada or new france on which they make they first settlement be situate eastward of we colony between which they pass up the great river of st lawrence with newfoundland on the north and nova scotium on the south they establishment in this country be neither envy nor hinder and they live here in no great number a long time neither molest they european neighbor nor molest by they but when they grow stronger and more numerous they begin to extend they territory and as it be natural for man to seek they own convenience the desire of more fertile and agreeable habitation tempt they southward there be land enough to the north and west of they settlement which they may occupy with as good right as can be show by the other european usurper and which neither the english nor spaniard will contest but of this cold region they have enough already and they resolution be to get a better country this be not to be have but by settle to the west of we plantation on ground which have be hitherto suppose to belong to we hither therefore they resolve to remove and to fix at they own discretion the western border of we colony which be heretofore consider as unlimited thus by form a line of fort in some measure parallel to the coast they inclose we between they garrison and the sea and not only hinder we extension westward but whenever they have a sufficient navy in the sea can harass we on each side as they can invade we at pleasure from one or other of they fort this design be not perhaps discover as soon as it be form and be certainly not oppose so soon as it be discover : we foolishly hope that they encroachment would stop that they would be prevail on by treaty and remonstrance to give up what they have take or to put limit to themselves we suffer they to establish one settlement after another to pass boundary after boundary and add fort to fort till at last they grow strong enough to avow they design and defy we to obstruct they by these provocation long continue we be at length force into a war in which we have have hitherto very ill fortune we troops under braddock be dishonourably defeat we fleet have yet do nothing more than take a few merchant ship and have distressed some private family but have very little weaken the power of france the detention of they seaman make it indeed less easy for they to fit out they navy but this deficiency will be easily supply by the alacrity of the nation which be always eager for war it be unplease to represent we affair to we own disadvantage yet it be necessary to show the evil which we desire to be remove and therefore some account may very properly be give of the measure which have give they they present superiority they be say to be supply from france with better governor than we colony have the fate to obtain from england a french governor be seldom choose for any other reason than he qualification for he trust to be a bankrupt at home or to be so infamously vitious that he can not be decently protect in he own country seldom recommend any man to the government of a french colony they officer be commonly skilful either in war or commerce and be teach to have no expectation of honor or preferment but from the justice and vigor of they administration they great security be the friendship of the native and to this advantage they have certainly a indubitable right because it be the consequence of they virtue it be ridiculous to imagine that the friendship of nation whether civil or barbarous can be gain and keep but by kind treatment and surely they who intrude uncalled upon the country of a distant people ought to consider the native as worthy of common kindness and content themselves to rob without insulting they the french as have be already observe admit the indian by intermarriage to a equality with themselves and those nation with which they have no such near intercourse they gain over to they interest by honesty in they dealings we factor and trader have no other purpose in view than immediate profit use all the art of a european counting-house to defraud the simple hunter of he fur these be some of the cause of we present weakness we planter be always quarrel with they governor whom they consider as less to be trust than the french and we trader hourly alienate the indian by they trick and oppression and we continue every day to show by new proof that no people can be great who have cease to be virtuous observation on the treaty between he britannick majesty and imperial majesty of all the russia sign at moscow dec 11 1742 the treaty between he britannick majesty and the landgrave of hesse cassel sign June 18 1755 and the treaty between he britannick majesty and she imperial majesty of all the russia sign at st petersburg sept 19\/20 1755 -lrb- 26 -rrb- these be the treaty which for many month fill the senate with debate and the kingdom with clamor which be represent on one part as instance of the most profound policy and the most active care of the publick welfare and on the other as act of the most contemptible folly and most flagrant corruption as violation of the great trust of government by which the wealth of britain be sacrifice to private view and to a particular province what honor we minister and negotiator may expect to be pay to they wisdom it be hard to determine for the demand of vanity be not easily estimate they should consider before they call too loudly for encomium that they live in a age when the power of gold be no longer a secret and in which no man find much difficulty in make a bargain with money in he hand to hire troops be very easy to those who be willing to pay they price it appear therefore that whatever have be do be do by means which every man know how to use if fortune be kind enough to put they in he power to arm the nation of the north in the cause of britain to bring down host against france from the polar circle have indeed a sound of magnificence which might induce a mind unacquainted with publick affair to imagine that some effort of policy more than human have be exert by which distant nation be arm in we defense and the influence of britain be extend to the utmost limit of the world but when this striking phenomenon of negotiation be more nearly inspect it appear a bargain merely mercantile of one power that want troops more than money with another that want money and be burden with troops between whom they mutual want make a easy contract and who have no other friendship for each other than reciprocal convenience happen to produce we shall therefore leave the praise of we minister to other yet not without this acknowledgment that if they have do little they do not seem to boast of do much and that whether influence by modesty or frugality they have not weary the publick with mercenary panegyrist but have be content with the concurrence of the parliament and have not much solicit the applause of the people in publick as in private transaction man more frequently deviate from the right for want of virtue than of wisdom and those who declare themselves dissatisfy with these treaty impute they not to folly but corruption by these advocate for the independence of britain who whether they argument be just or not seem to be most favourably hear by the people it be allege that these treaty be expensive without advantage that they waste the treasure which we want for we own defense upon a foreign interest and pour the gain of we commerce into the coffer of prince whose enmity can not hurt nor friendship help we who set they subject to sale like sheep or ox without any inquiry after the intention of the buyer and will withdraw the troops with which they have supply we whenever a higher bidder shall be find this perhaps be true but whether it be true or false be not worth inquiry we do not expect to buy they friendship but they troops nor do we examine upon what principle we be supply with assistance it be sufficient that we want force and that they be willing to furnish they policy never pretend to make man wise and good the utmost of she power be to make the best use of man such as they be to lay hold on lucky hour to watch the present want and present interest of other and make they subservient to she own convenience it be further urge with great vehemence that these troops of russium and hesse be not hire in defense of britain that we be engage in a naval war for territory on a distant continent and that these troops though mercenary can never be auxiliary that they increase the burden of the war without hasten its conclusion or promote its success since they can neither be send into america the only part of the world where england can on the present occasion have any employment for land-force nor be put into we ship by which and by which only we be now to oppose and subdue we enemy nature have station we in a island inaccessible but by sea and we be now at war with a enemy whose naval power be inferior to we own and from whom therefore we be in no danger of invasion : to what purpose then be troops hire in such uncommon number to what end do we procure strength which we can not exert and exhaust the nation with subsidy at a time when nothing be dispute which the prince who receive we subsidy can defend if we have purchase ship and hire seaman we have apparently increase we power and make ourselves formidable to we enemy and if any increase of security be possible have secure ourselves still better from invasion : but what can the regiment of russium or of hesse contribute to the defense of the coast of england or by what assistance can they repay we the sum which we have stipulate to pay for they costly friendship the king of great britain have indeed a territory on the continent of which the native of this island scarcely know the name till the present family be call to the throne and yet know little more than that we king visit it from time to time yet for the defense of this country be these subsidy apparently pay and these troops evidently levy the riches of we nation be send into distant country and the strength which should be employ in we own quarrel consequently impaired for the sake of dominion the interest of which have no connexion with ours and which by the act of succession we take care to keep separate from the british kingdom to this the advocate for the subsidy say that unreasonable stipulation whether in the act of settlement or any other contract be in themselves void and that if a country connect with england by subjection to the same sovereign be endanger by a english quarrel it must be defend by english force and that we do not engage in a war for the sake of hanover but that hanover be for we sake expose to danger those who bring in these foreign troops have still something further to say in they defense and of no honest plea be it we intention to defraud they they grant that the terror of invasion may possibly be groundless that the french may want the power or the courage to attack we in we own country but they maintain likewise that a invasion be possible that the army of france be so numerous that she may hazard a large body on the ocean without leave herself expose that she be exasperate to the utmost degree of acrimony and would be willing to do we mischief at she own peril they allow that the invader may be intercept at sea or that if they land they may be defeat by we native troops but they say and say justly that danger be better avoid than encounter that those minister consult more the good of they country who prevent invasion than repel it and that if these auxiliary have only save we from the anxiety of expect a enemy at we door or from the tumult and distress which a invasion how soon soever repress would have produce the publick money be not spend in vain these argument be admit by some and by other reject but even those that admit they can admit they only as plea of necessity for they consider the reception of mercenary into we country as the desperate remedy of desperate distress and think with great reason that all means of prevention should be try to save we from any second need of such doubtful succor that we be able to defend we own country that arm be most safely entrust to we own hand and that we have strength and skill and courage equal to the best of the nation of the continent be the opinion of every englishman who can think without prejudice and speak without influence and therefore it will not be easy to persuade the nation a nation long renown for valor that it can need the help of foreigner to defend it from invasion we have be long without the need of arm by we good fortune and long without the use by we negligence so long that the practice and almost the name of we old trained band be forget but the story of ancient time will tell we that the trained band be once able to maintain the quiet and safety of they country and reason without history will inform we that those man be most likely to fight bravely or at least to fight obstinately who fight for they own house and farm for they own wife and child a bill be therefore offer for the prevention of any future danger or invasion or necessity of mercenary force by reestablish and improve the militia it be pass by the common but reject by the lord that this bill the first essay of political consideration as a subject long forget should be liable to objection can not be strange but surely justice policy common reason require that we should be trust with we own defense and be keep no longer in such a helpless state as at once to dread we enemy and confederate by the bill such as it be form sixty thousand man would always be in arm we have show -lrb- 27 -rrb- how they may be upon any exigence easily increase to a hundred and fifty thousand and i believe neither we friend nor enemy will think it proper to insult we coast when they expect to find upon they a hundred and fifty thousand englishman with sword in they hand introduction to the proceedings of the committee appoint to manage the contribution begin at london December 18 1758 for clothing french prisoner of war the committee intrust with the money contribute to the relief of the subject of france now prisoner in the british dominion here lay before the publick a exact account of all the sum receive and expend that the donor may judge how properly they benefaction have be apply charity would lose its name be it influence by so mean a motive as human praise it be therefore not intend to celebrate by any particular memorial the liberality of single person or distinct society it be sufficient that they work praise they yet he who be far from seek honor may very justly obviate censure if a good example have be set it may lose its influence by misrepresentation and to free charity from reproach be itself a charitable action against the relief of the french only one argument have be bring but that one be so popular and specious that if it be to remain unexamined it would by many be think irrefragable it have be urge that charity like other virtue may be improperly and unseasonably exert that while we be relieve frenchman there remain many englishman unrelieved that while we lavish pity on we enemy we forget the misery of we friend grant this argument all it can prove and what be the conclusion -- that to relieve the french be a good action but that a better may be conceive this be all the result and this all be very little to do the best can seldom be the lot of man : it be sufficient if when opportunity be present he be ready to do good how little virtue could be practice if beneficence be to wait always for the most proper object and the noblest occasion occasion that may never happen and object that may never be find it be far from certain that a single englishman will suffer by the charity to the french new scene of misery make new impression and much of the charity which produce these donation may be suppose to have be generate by a species of calamity never know among we before some imagine that the law have provide all necessary relief in common case and remit the poor to the care of the publick some have be deceive by fictitious misery and be afraid of encourage imposture many have observe want to be the effect of vice and consider casual alms-giver as patron of idleness but all these difficulty vanish in the present case : we know that for the prisoner of war there be no legal provision we see they distress and be certain of its cause we know that they be poor and naked and poor and naked without a crime but it be not necessary to make any concession the opponent of this charity must allow it to be good and will not easily prove it not to be the best that charity be best of which the consequence be most extensive : the relief of enemy have a tendency to unite mankind in fraternal affection to soften the acrimony of adverse nation and dispose they to peace and amity in the mean time it alleviate captivity and take away something from the misery of war the rage of war however mitigate will always fill the world with calamity and horror let it not then be unnecessarily extend let animosity and hostility cease together and no man be longer deem a enemy than while he sword be draw against we the effect of these contribution may perhaps reach still further truth be best support by virtue : we may hope from those who feel or who see we charity that they shall no longer detest as heresy that religion which make its professor the follower of he who have command we to do good to they that hate we on the bravery of the english common soldier -lrb- 28 -rrb- by those who have compare the military genius of the english with that of the french nation it be remark that the french officer will always lead if the soldier will follow and that the english soldier will always follow if they officer will lead in all pointed sentence some degree of accuracy must be sacrifice to conciseness and in this comparison we officer seem to lose what we soldier gain i know not any reason for suppose that the english officer be less willing than the french to lead but it be i think universally allow that the english soldier be more willing to follow we nation may boast beyond any other people in the world of a kind of epidemick bravery diffuse equally through all its rank we can show a peasantry of hero and fill we army with clown whose courage may vie with that of they general there may be some pleasure in trace the cause of this plebeian magnanimity the quality which commonly make a army formidable be long habit of regularity great exactness of discipline and great confidence in the commander regularity may in time produce a kind of mechanical obedience to signal and command like that which the perverse cartesian impute to animal discipline may impress such a awe upon the mind that any danger shall be less dreaded than the danger of punishment and confidence in the wisdom or fortune of the general may induce the soldier to follow he blindly to the most dangerous enterprise what may be do by discipline and regularity may be see in the troops of the russian emperess and prussian monarch we find that they may be break without confusion and repulse without flight but the english troops have none of these requisite in any eminent degree regularity be by no means part of they character : they be rarely exercise and therefore show very little dexterity in they evolution as body of man or in the manual use of they weapon as individual they neither be think by other nor by themselves more active or exact than they enemy and therefore derive none of they courage from such imaginary superiority the manner in which they be disperse in quarter over the country during time of peace naturally produce laxity of discipline : they be very little in sight of they officer and when they be not engage in the slight duty of the guard be suffer to live every man he own way the equality of english privilege the impartiality of we law the freedom of we tenure and the prosperity of we trade dispose we very little to reverence superior it be not to any great esteem of the officer that the english soldier be indebted for he spirit in the hour of battle for perhaps it do not often happen that he think much better of he leader than of himself the french count who have lately publish the art of war remark how much soldier be animated when they see all they danger share by those who be bear to be they master and whom they consider as being of a different rank the englishman despise such motive of courage : he be bear without a master and look not on any man however dignified by lace or title as derive from nature any claim to he respect or inherit any quality superior to he own there be some perhaps who would imagine that every englishman fight better than the subject of absolute government because he have more to defend but what have the english more than the french soldier property they be both commonly without liberty be to the lowest rank of every nation little more than the choice of work or starve and this choice be i suppose equally allow in every country the english soldier seldom have he head very full of the constitution nor have there be for more than a century any war that put the property or liberty of a single englishman in danger whence then be the courage of the english vulgar it proceed in my opinion from that dissolution of dependence which oblige every man to regard he own character while every man be feed by he own hand he have no need of any servile art he may always have wages for he labor and be no less necessary to he employer than he employer be to he while he look for no protection from other he be naturally rouse to be he own protector and have nothing to abate he esteem of himself he consequently aspire to the esteem of other thus every man that crowd we street be a man of honor disdainful of obligation impatient of reproach and desirous of extend he reputation among those of he own rank and as courage be in most frequent use the fame of courage be most eagerly pursue from this neglect of subordination i do not deny that some inconveniency may from time to time proceed : the power of the law do not always sufficiently supply the want of reverence or maintain the proper distinction between different rank but good and evil will grow up in this world together and they who complain in peace of the insolence of the populace must remember that they insolence in peace be bravery in war political tract fallitur egregio quisqui sub principe credit servitium nunquam liberta gratior extat quam sub rege pio claudianus prefatory observation to political tract on johnson 's character as a political writer we can not dwell with pleasure since we can not speak of it with praise in the follow pamphlet however though we can not honestly subscribe to they doctrine we must admire the same power of composition the same play of imagination the same keen sarcasm and indignant reproof that embellish he other production he might and do think wrongly on these subject but he never write what he do not believe to be true and therefore must be acquit of all charge of servility or dishonesty the false alarm be publish in 1770 and intend say mr boswell to justify the conduct of the ministry and they majority in the house of common for have virtually assume it as a axiom that the expulsion of a member of parliament be equivalent to exclusion and thus have declare colonel lutterel to be duly elect for the county of middlesex notwithstanding mr wilke have a great majority of vote this be justly consider as a gross violation of the right of election a alarm for the constitution extend itself all over the kingdom to prove this alarm to be false be the purpose of johnson 's pamphlet but even he vast power be inadequate to cope with constitutional truth and reason and he argument fail of effect and the house of common have since expunge the offensive resolution from they journal that the house of common might have expel mr wilke repeatedly and as often as he should be rechosen be not to be deny but incapacitation can not be but by a act of the whole legislature it be wonderful to see how a prejudice in favor of government in general and a aversion to popular clamor could blind and contract such a understanding as johnson 's in this particular case where boswell express himself with regard to johnson in term so reprehensive as the above we can not be accuse of severity in repeat he just censure several answer appear but perhaps all of they in compliance with the excite feeling of the time deal rather in personal abuse of johnson as a pensioner and hireling than in fair and manly argument the chief be the crisis a letter to dr samuel johnson and the constitution defender and pensioner expose in remark on the false alarm the false alarm 1770 one of the chief advantage derive by the present generation from the improvement and diffusion of philosophy be deliverance from unnecessary terror and exemption from false alarm the unusual appearance whether regular or accidental which once spread consternation over age of ignorance be now the recreation of inquisitive security the sun be no more lament when it be eclipse than when it set and meteor play they coruscation without prognostick or prediction the advancement of political knowledge may be expect to produce in time the like effect causeless discontent and seditious violence will grow less frequent and less formidable as the science of government be better ascertain by a diligent study of the theory of man it be not indeed to be expect that physical and political truth should meet with equal acceptance or gain ground upon the world with equal facility the notion of the naturalist find mankind in a state of neutrality or at worst have nothing to encounter but prejudice and vanity prejudice without malignity and vanity without interest but the politician 's improvement be oppose by every passion that can exclude conviction or suppress it by ambition by avarice by hope and by terror by publick faction and private animosity it be evident whatever be the cause that this nation with all its renown for speculation and for learning have yet make little proficiency in civil wisdom we be still so much unacquainted with we own state and so unskilful in the pursuit of happiness that we shudder without danger complain without grievance and suffer we quiet to be disturbed and we commerce to be interrupt by a opposition to the government raise only by interest and support only by clamor which yet have so far prevail upon ignorance and timidity that many favor it as reasonable and many dread it as powerful what be urge by those who have be so industrious to spread suspicion and incite fury from one end of the kingdom to the other may be know by peruse the papers which have be at once present as petition to the king and exhibit in print as remonstrance to the people it may therefore not be improper to lay before the publick the reflection of a man who can not favor the opposition for he think it wicked and can not fear it for he think it weak the grievance which have produce all this tempest of outrage the oppression in which all other oppression be include the invasion which have leave we no property the alarm that suffer no patriot to sleep in quiet be comprise in a vote of the house of common by which the freeholder of middlesex be deprive of a briton 's birthright -- representation in parliament they have indeed receive the usual writ of election but that writ alas be malicious mockery : they be insult with the form but deny the reality for there be one man except from they choice : non de vi neque cde nec veneno sed lis est mihi de tribus capellis the character of the man thus fatally excepted i have no purpose to delineate lampoon itself would disdain to speak ill of he of whom no man speak well it be sufficient that he be expel the house of common and confine in gaol as be legally convict of sedition and impiety that this man can not be appoint one of the guardian and counsellor of the church and state be a grievance not to be endure every lover of liberty stand doubtful of the fate of posterity because the chief county in england can not take its representative from a gaol whence middlesex should obtain the right of be denominate the chief county can not easily be discover it be indeed the county where the chief city happen to stand but how that city treat the favorite of middlesex be not yet forget the county as distinguish from the city have no claim to particular consideration that a man be in gaol for sedition and impiety would i believe have be within memory a sufficient reason why he should not come out of gaol a legislator this reason notwithstanding the mutability of fashion happen still to operate on the house of common they notion however strange may be justify by a common observation that few be mend by imprisonment and that he whose crime have make confinement necessary seldom make any other use of he enlargement than to do with greater cunning what he do before with less but the people have be tell with great confidence that the house can not control the right of constitute representative that he who can persuade lawful elector to choose he whatever be he character be lawfully choose and have a claim to a seat in parliament from which no human authority can depose he here however the patron of opposition be in some perplexity they be force to confess that by a train of precedent sufficient to establish a custom of parliament the house of common have jurisdiction over its own member that the whole have power over individual and that this power have be exercise sometimes in imprisonment and often in expulsion that such power should reside in the house of common in some case be inevitably necessary since it be require by every polity that where there be a possibility of offence there should be a possibility of punishment a member of the house can not be cite for he conduct in parliament before any other court and therefore if the house can not punish he he may attack with impunity the rights of the people and the title of the king this exemption from the authority of other court be i think first establish in favor of the five member in the long parliament it be not to be consider as a usurpation for it be imply in the principle of government if legislative power be not coordinate they cease in part to be legislative and if they be coordinate they be unaccountable for to whom must that power account which have no superior the house of common be indeed dissoluble by the king as the nation have of late be very clamorously tell but while it subsist it be coordinate with the other power and this coordination cease only when the house by dissolution cease to subsist as the particular representative of the people be in they publick character above the control of the court of law they must be subject to the jurisdiction of the house and as the house in the exercise of its authority can be neither direct nor restrain its own resolution must be its law at least if there be no antecedent decision of the whole legislature this privilege not confirm by any written law or positive compact but by the resistless power of political necessity they have exercise probably from they first institution but certainly as they record inform we from the 23rd of elizabeth when they expel a member for derogate from they privilege it may perhaps be doubt whether it be originally necessary that this right of control and punishment should extend beyond offence in the exercise of parliamentary duty since all other crime be cognizable by other court but they who be the only judge of they own rights have exert the power of expulsion on other occasion and when wickedness arrive at a certain magnitude have consider a offence against society as a offence against the house they have therefore divest notorious delinquent of they legislative character and deliver they up to shame or punishment naked and unprotected that they might not contaminate the dignity of parliament it be allow that a man attaint of felony can not sit in parliament and the common probably judge that not be bind to the form of law they might treat these as felon whose crime be in they opinion equivalent to felony and that as a known felon could not be choose a man so like a felon that he could not easily be distinguish ought to be expel the first law have no law to enforce they the first authority be constitute by itself the power exercise by the house of common be of this kind a power root in the principle of government and branch out by occasional practice a power which necessity make just and precedent have make legal it will occur that authority thus uncontroulable may in time of heat and contest be oppressively and injuriously exert and that he who suffer injustice be without redress however innocent however miserable the position be true but the argument be useless the common must be control or be exempt from control if they be exempt they may do injury which can not be redress if they be control they be no longer legislative if the possibility of abuse be a argument against authority no authority ever can be establish : if the actual abuse destroy its legality there be no legal government now in the world this power which the common have so long exercise they venture to use once more against mr wilke and on the 3rd of February 1769 expel he the house for have print and publish a seditious libel and three obscene and impious libel if these imputation be just the expulsion be surely seasonable and that they be just the house have reason to determine as he have confess himself at the bar the author of the libel which they term seditious and be convict in the king 's bench of both the publication but the freeholder of middlesex be of another opinion they either think he innocent or be not offend by he guilt when a writ be issue for the election of a knight for middlesex in the room of john wilkes esq expel the house he friend on the sixteenth of February choose he again on the 17th it be resolve that john wilkes esq have be in this session of parliament expel the house be and be incapable of be elect a member to serve in this present parliament as there be no other candidate it be resolve at the same time that the election of the sixteenth be a void election the freeholder still continue to think that no other man be fit to represent they and on the sixteenth of march elect he once more they resolution be now so well know that no opponent venture to appear the common begin to find that power without material for operation can produce no effect they might make the election void for ever but if no other candidate could be find they determination could only be negative they however make void the last election and order a new writ on the 13th of April be a new election at which mr lutterel and other offer themselves candidate every method of intimidation be use and some act of violence be do to hinder mr lutterel from appear he be not deter and the poll be take which exhibit for mr wilke 1143 mr lutterel 296 the sheriff return mr wilke but the house on April the fifteenth determine that mr lutterel be lawfully elect from this day begin the clamor which have continue till now those who have undertake to oppose the ministry have no grievance of greater magnitude endeavor to swell this decision into bulk and distort it into deformity and then hold it out to terrify the nation every artifice of sedition have be since practice to awaken discontent and inflame indignation the papers of every day have be fill with exhortation and menace of faction the madness have spread through all rank and through both sex woman and child have clamour for mr wilke honest simplicity have be cheat into fury and only the wise have escape infection the greater part may justly be suspect of not believe they own position and with they it be not necessary to dispute they can not be convince who be convinced already and it be well know that they will not be ashamed the decision however by which the smaller number of vote be prefer to the greater have perplex the mind of some whose opinion it be indecent to despise and who by they integrity well deserve to have they doubt appease every diffuse and complicated question may be examine by different method upon different principle and that truth which be easily find by one investigator may be miss by another equally honest and equally diligent those who inquire whether a smaller number of legal vote can elect a representative in opposition to a greater must receive from every tongue the same answer the question therefore must be whether a smaller number of legal vote shall not prevail against a greater number of vote not legal it must be consider that those vote only be legal which be legally give and that those only be legally give which be give for a legal candidate it remain then to be discuss whether a man expel can be so disqualify by a vote of the house as that he shall be no longer eligible by lawful elector here we must again recur not to positive institution but to the unwritten law of social nature to the great and pregnant principle of political necessity all government suppose subject all authority imply obedience : to suppose in one the right to command what another have the right to refuse be absurd and contradictory a state so constitute must rest for ever in motionless equipoise with equal attraction of contrary tendency with equal weight of power balancing each other law which can not be enforce can neither prevent nor rectify disorder a sentence which can not be execute can have no power to warn or to reform if the common have only the power of dismiss for a few day the man whom he constituent can immediately send back if they can expel but can not exclude they have nothing more than nominal authority to which perhaps obedience never may be pay the representative of we ancestor have a opinion very different : they fine and imprison they member on great provocation they disable they for ever and this power of pronounce perpetual disability be maintain by selden himself these claim seem to have be make and allow when the constitution of we government have not yet be sufficiently study such power be not legal because they be not necessary and of that power which only necessity justify no more be to be admit than necessity obtrude the common can not make law they can only pass resolution which like all resolution be of force only to those that make they and to those only while they be willing to observe they the vote of the house of common have therefore only so far the force of a law as that force be necessary to preserve the vote from lose its efficacy it must begin by operate upon themselves and extend its influence to other only by consequence arise from the first intention he that start game on he own manor may pursue it into another they can properly make law only for themselves : a member while he keep he seat be subject to these law but when he be expel the jurisdiction cease for he be now no longer within they dominion the disability which a vote can superinduce to expulsion be no more than be include in expulsion itself it be only a declaration of the common that they will permit no longer he whom they thus censure to sit with they in parliament a declaration make by that right which they necessarily possess of regulate they own house and of inflict punishment on they own delinquent they have therefore no other way to enforce the sentence of incapacity than that of adhering to it they can not otherwise punish the candidate so disqualify for offer himself nor the elector for accept he but if he have any competitor that competitor must prevail and if he have none he election will be void for the right of the house to reject annihilate with regard to the man so reject the right of elect it have be urge that the power of the house terminate with they session since a prisoner commit by the speaker 's warrant can not be detain during the recess that power indeed cease with the session which must operate by the agency of other because when they do not sit they can employ no agent have no longer any legal existence but that which be exercise on themselves revive at they meeting when the subject of that power still subsist : they can in the next session refuse to re-admit he whom in the former session they expel that expulsion infer exclusion in the present case must be i think easily admit the expulsion and the writ issue for a new election be in the same session and since the house be by the rule of parliament bind for the session by a vote once pass the expel member can not be admit he that can not be admit can not be elect and the vote give to a man ineligible be give in vain the highest number for a eligible candidate become a majority to these conclusion as to most moral and to all political position many objection may be make the perpetual subject of political disquisition be not absolute but comparative good of two system of government or two law relate to the same subject neither will ever be such as theoretical nicety would desire and therefore neither can easily force its way against prejudice and obstinacy each will have its excellency and defect and every man with a little help from pride may think he own the best it seem to be the opinion of many that expulsion be only a dismission of the representative to he constituent with such a testimony against he as he sentence may comprise and that if he constituent notwithstanding the censure of the house think he case hard he fault trifling or he excellency such as overbalance it should again choose he as still worthy of they trust the house can not refuse he for he punishment have purge he fault and the right of elector must not be violate this be plausible but not cogent it be a scheme of representation which would make a specious appearance in a political romance but can not be bring into practice among we who see every day the towering head of speculation bow down unwillingly to grovel experience government form by chance and gradually improve by such expedient as the successive discovery of they defect happen to suggest be never to be try by a regular theory they be fabrick of dissimilar material raise by different architect upon different plan we must be content with they as they be should we attempt to mend they disproportion we might easily demolish and difficultly rebuild they law be now make and custom be establish these be we rule and by they we must be guide it be uncontrovertibly certain that the common never intend to leave elector the liberty of return they a expel member for they always require one to be choose in the room of he that be expel and i see not with what propriety a man can be rechosen in he own room expulsion if this be its whole effect might very often be desirable sedition or obscenity might be no greater crime in the opinion of other elector than in that of the freeholder of middlesex and many a wretch whom he colleague should expel might come back persecute into fame and provoke with harder front a second expulsion many of the representative of the people can hardly be say to have be choose at all some by inherit a borough inherit a seat and some sit by the favor of other whom perhaps they may gratify by the act which provoke the expulsion some be safe by they popularity and some by they alliance none would dread expulsion if this doctrine be receive but those who buy they election and who would be oblige to buy they again at a higher price but as uncertainty be to be determine by thing certain and custom to be explain where it be possible by written law the patriot have triumph with a quotation from a act of the fourth and fifth of anne which permit those to be rechosen whose seat be vacate by the acceptance of a place of profit this they wisely consider as a expulsion and from the permission in this case of a reelection infer that every other expulsion leave the delinquent entitle to the same indulgence this be the paragraph : if any person be choose a member of the house of common shall accept of any office from the crown during such time as he shall continue a member he election shall be and be hereby declare to be void and a new writ shall issue for a new election as if such person so accept be naturally dead nevertheless such person shall be capable of be again elect as if he place have not become void as aforesaid how this favor the doctrine of readmission by a second choice i be not able to discover the statute of the thirtieth of charle the second have enact that he who should sit in the house of common without take the oath and subscribe the test should be disabled to sit in the house during that parliament and a writ should issue for the election of a new member in place of the member so disabled as if such member have naturally die this last clause be apparently copy in the act of anne but with the common fate of imitator in the act of charle the political death continue during the parliament in that of anne it be hardly worth the while to kill the man whom the next breath be to revive it be however apparent that in the opinion of the parliament the dead-doing line would have keep he motionless if he have not be recover by a kind exception a seat vacate could not be regain without express permission of the same statute the right of be choose again to a seat thus vacate be not enjoy by any general right but require a special clause and solicitous provision but what resemblance can imagination conceive between one man vacate he seat by a mark of favor from the crown and another drive from it for sedition and obscenity the acceptance of a place contaminate no character the crown that give it intend to give with it always dignity sometimes authority the common it be well know think not worse of themselves or other for they office of profit yet profit imply temptation and may expose a representative to the suspicion of he constituent though if they still think he worthy of they confidence they may again elect he such be the consequence when a man be dismiss by law to he constituent with new trust and new dignity they may if they think he incorruptible restore he to he seat what can follow therefore but that when the house drive out a varlet with publick infamy he go away with the like permission to return if infatuation be as the proverb tell we the forerunner of destruction how near must be the ruin of a nation that can be incite against its governor by sophistry like this i may be excuse if i catch the panick and join my groan at this alarming crisis with the general lamentation of weep patriot another objection be that the common by pronounce the sentence of disqualification make a law and take upon themselves the power of the whole legislature many quotation be then produce to prove that the house of common can make no law three act have be cite disable member for different term on different occasion and it be profoundly remark that if the common could by they own privilege have make a disqualification they jealousy of they privilege would never have admit the concurrent sanction of the other power i must for ever remind these puny controvertist that those act be law of permanent obligation that two of they be now in force and that the other expire only when it have fulfil its end such law the common can not make they could perhaps have determine for themselves that they would expel all who should not take the test but they could leave no authority behind they that should oblige the next parliament to expel they they could refuse the south sea director but they could not entail the refusal they can disqualify by vote but not by law they can not know that the sentence of disqualification pronounce to-day may not become void to-morrow by the dissolution of they own house yet while the same parliament sit the disqualification continue unless the vote be rescind and while it so continue make the vote which freeholder may give to the interdicted candidate useless and dead since there can not exist with respect to the same subject at the same time a absolute power to choose and a absolute power to reject in 1614 the attorney general be vote incapable of a seat in the house of common and the nation be triumphantly tell that though the vote never be revoke the attorney general be now a member he certainly may now be a member without revocation of the vote a law be of perpetual obligation but a vote be nothing when the voter be go a law be a compact reciprocally make by the legislative power and therefore not to be abrogate but by all the party a vote be simply a resolution which bind only he that be willing to be bind i have thus punctiliously and minutely pursue this disquisition because i suspect that these reasoner whose business be to deceive other have sometimes deceive themselves and i be willing to free they from they embarrassment though i do not expect much gratitude for my kindness other objection be yet remain for of political objection there can not easily be a end it have be observe that vice be no proper cause of expulsion for if the worst man in the house be always to be expel in time none would be leave but no man be expel for be worst he be expel for be enormously bad he conduct be compare not with that of other but with the rule of action the punishment of expulsion be in its own nature uncertain may be too great or too little for the fault this must be the case of many punishment forfeiture of chattel be nothing to he that have no possession exile itself may be accidentally a good and indeed any punishment less than death be very different to different man but if this precedent be admit and establish no man can hereafter be sure that he shall be represent by he whom he would choose one half of the house may meet early in the morning and snatch a opportunity to expel the other and the greater part of the nation may by this stratagem be without its lawful representative he that see all this see very far but i can tell he of greater evil yet behind there be one possibility of wickedness which at this alarming crisis have not yet be mention every one know the malice the subtlety the industry the vigilance and the greediness of the scot the scotch member be about the number sufficient to make a house i propose it to the consideration of the supporter of the bill of rights whether there be not reason to suspect that these hungry intruder from the north be now contrive to expel all the english we may then curse the hour in which it be determine that expulsion and exclusion be the same for who can guess what may be do when the scot have the whole house to themselves thus agreeable to custom and reason notwithstanding all objection real or imaginary thus consistent with the practice of former time and thus consequential to the original principle of government be that decision by which so much violence of discontent have be excite which have be so dolorously bewail and so outrageously resent let we however not be seduce to put too much confidence in justice or in truth : they have often be find inactive in they own defense and give more confidence than help to they friend and they advocate it may perhaps be prudent to make one momentary concession to falsehood by suppose the vote in mr lutterel 's favor to be wrong all wrong ought to be rectify if mr wilke be deprive of a lawful seat both he and he elector have reason to complain but it will not be easily find why among the innumerable wrong of which a great part of mankind be hourly complain the whole care of the publick should be transfer to mr wilke and the freeholder of middlesex who might all sink into nonexistence without any other effect than that there would be room make for a new rabble and a new retailer of sedition and obscenity the cause of we country would suffer little the rabble whencesoever they come will be always patriot and always supporter of the bill of rights the house of common decide the dispute arise from election be it ever suppose that in all case they decision be right every man whose lawful election be defeat be equally wrong with mr wilke and he constituent feel they disappointment with no less anguish than the freeholder of middlesex these decision have often be apparently partial and sometimes tyrannically oppressive a majority have be give to a favorite candidate by expunge vote which have always be allow and which therefore have the authority by which all vote be give that of custom uninterrupted when the common determine who shall be constituent they may with some propriety be say to make law because those determination have hitherto for the sake of quiet be adopt by succeed parliament a vote therefore of the house when it operate as a law be to individual a law only temporary but to community perpetual yet though all this have be do and though at every new parliament much of this be expect to be do again it have never produce in any former time such a alarming crisis we have find by experience that though a squire have give ale and venison in vain and a borough have be compel to see its dearest interest in the hand of he whom it do not trust yet the general state of the nation have continue the same the sun have rise and the corn have grow and whatever talk have be of the danger of property yet he that plough the field commonly reap it and he that build a house be master of the door the vexation excite by injustice suffer or suppose to be suffer by any private man or single community be local and temporary it neither spread far nor last long the nation look on with little care because there do not seem to be much danger the consequence of small irregularity be not feel and we have not yet learn to be terrify by very distant enemy but quiet and security be now at a end we vigilance be quicken and we comprehension be enlarged we not only see event in they cause but before they cause we hear the thunder while the sky be clear and see the mine spring before it be dig political wisdom have by the force of english genius be improve at last not only to political intuition but to political prescience but it can not i be afraid be say that as we be grow wise we be make happy it be say of those who have the wonderful power call second sight that they seldom see any thing but evil : political second sight have the same effect we hear of nothing but of a alarming crisis of violate rights and expire liberty the morning rise upon new wrong and the dreamer pass the night in imaginary shackle the sphere of anxiety be now enlarged he that hitherto care only for himself now care for the publick for he have learn that the happiness of individual be comprise in the prosperity of the whole and that he country never suffer but he suffer with it however it happen that he feel no pain fire with this fever of epidemick patriotism the tailor slip he thimble the draper drop he yard and the blacksmith lay down he hammer they meet at a honest ale-house consider the state of the nation read or hear the last petition lament the misery of the time be alarm at the dreadful crisis and subscribe to the support of the bill of rights it sometimes indeed happen that a intruder of more benevolence than prudence attempt to disperse they cloud of dejection and ease they heart by seasonable consolation he tell they that though the government can not be too diligently watch it may be too hastily accuse and that though private judgment be every man 's right yet we can not judge of what we do not know that we feel at present no evil which government can alleviate and that the publick business be commit to man who have as much right to confidence as they adversary that the freeholder of middlesex if they could not choose mr wilke might have choose any other man and that he trust we have within the realm five hundred as good as he that even if this which have happen to middlesex have happen to every other county that one man should be make incapable of be elect it could produce no great change in the parliament nor much contract the power of election that what have be do be probably right and that if it be wrong it be of little consequence since a like case can not easily occur that expulsion be very rare and if they should by unbounded insolence of faction become more frequent the elector may easily provide a second choice all this he may say but not half of this will be hear he opponent will stun he and themselves with a confused sound of pension and place venality and corruption oppression and invasion slavery and ruin outcry like these utter by malignity and echo by folly general accusation of indeterminate wickedness and obscure hint of impossible design disperse among those that do not know they meaning by those that know they to be false have dispose part of the nation though but a small part to pester the court with ridiculous petition the progress of a petition be well know a eject placeman go down to he county or he borough tell he friend of he inability to serve they and he constituent of the corruption of the government he friend readily understand that he who can get nothing will have nothing to give they agree to proclaim a meeting meat and drink be plentifully provide a crowd be easily bring together and those who think that they know the reason of they meeting undertake to tell those who know it not ale and clamor unite they power the crowd condensed and heated begin to ferment with the leaven of sedition : all see a thousand evil though they can not show they and grow impatient for a remedy though they know not what a speech be then make by the _ cicero _ of the day he say much and suppress more and credit be equally give to what he tell and what he conceal the petition be read and universally approve those who be sober enough to write add they name and the rest would sign it if they could every man go home and tell he neighbor of the glory of the day how he be consult and what he advise how he be invite into the great room where he lordship call he by he name how he be caress by sir franci sir joseph or sir george how he eat turtle and venison and drink unanimity to the three brother the poor loiterer whose shop have confine he or whose wife have lock he up hear the tale of luxury with envy and at last inquire what be they petition of the petition nothing be remember by the narrator but that it speak much of fear and apprehension and something very alarming and that he be sure it be against the government the other be convince that it must be right and wish he have be there for he love wine and venison and be resolve as long as he live to be against the government the petition be then hand from town to town and from house to house and wherever it come the inhabitant flock together that they may see that which must be send to the king name be easily collect one man sign because he hate the papist another because he have vow destruction to the tumpike one because it will vex the parson another because he owe he landlord nothing one because he be rich another because he be poor one to show that he be not afraid and another to show that he can write the passage however be not always smooth those who collect contribution to sedition sometimes apply to a man of higher rank and more enlighten mind who instead of lend they he name calmly reprove they for be seducer of the people you who be here say he complain of venality be yourselve the agent of those who have estimate themselves at too high a price be only angry that they be not buy you be appeal from the parliament to the rabble and invite those who scarcely in the most common affair distinguish right from wrong to judge of a question complicate with law write and unwritten with the general principle of government and the particular custom of the house of common you be show they a grievance so distant that they can not see it and so light that they can not feel it for how but by unnecessary intelligence and artificial provocation should the farmer and shopkeeper of yorkshire and cumberland know or care how middlesex be represent instead of wander thus round the county to exasperate the rage of party and darken the suspicion of ignorance it be the duty of man like you who have leisure for inquiry to lead back the people to they honest labor to tell they that submission be the duty of the ignorant and content the virtue of the poor that they have no skill in the art of government nor any interest in the dissension of the great and when you meet with any as some there be whose understanding be capable of conviction it will become you to allay this foam ebullition by show they that they have as much happiness as the condition of life will easily receive and that a government of which a erroneous or unjust representation of middlesex be the greatest crime that interest can discover or malice can upbraid be government approach nearer to perfection than any that experience have know or history related the drudge of sedition wish to change they ground they hear he with sullen silence feel conviction without repentance and be confound but not abashed they go forward to another door and find a kinder reception from a man enrage against the government because he have just be pay the tax upon he window that a petition for a dissolution of the parliament will at all time have its favourer may be easily imagine the people indeed do not expect that one house of common will be much honester or much wiser than another they do not suppose that the tax will be lighten or though they have be so often teach to hope it that soap and candle will be cheaper they expect no redress of grievance for of no grievance but tax do they complain they wish not the extension of liberty for they do not feel any restraint about the security of privilege or property they be totally careless for they see no property invade nor know till they be tell that any privilege have suffer violation least of all do they expect that any future parliament will lessen its own power or communicate to the people that authority which it have once obtain yet a new parliament be sufficiently desirable the year of election be a year of jollity and what be still more delightful a year of equality : the glutton now eat the delicacy for which he long when he could not purchase they and the drunkard have the pleasure of wine without the cost : the drone live awhile without work and the shopkeeper in the flow of money raise he price : the mechanick that tremble at the presence of sir joseph now bid he come again for a answer : and the poacher whose gun have be seize now find a opportunity to reclaim it even the honest man be not displeased to see himself important and willingly resume in two year that power which he have resign for seven few love they friend so well as not to desire superiority by unexpensive benefaction yet notwithstanding all these motive to compliance the promoter of petition have not be successful few could be persuade to lament evil which they do not suffer or to solicit for redress which they do not want the petition have be in some place reject and perhaps in all but one sign only by the meanest and grossest of the people since this expedient now invent or revive to distress the government and equally practicable at all time by all who shall be exclude from power and from profit have produce so little effect let we consider the opposition as no longer formidable the great engine have recoil upon they they think that _ the term _ they _ send be term of weight _ which would have _ amaze all and stumble many _ but the consternation be now over and they foe _ stand upright _ as before with great propriety and dignity the king have in he speech neglect or forget they he might easily know that what be present as the sense of the people be the sense only of the profligate and dissolute and that whatever parliament should be convene the same petitioner would be ready for the same reason to request its dissolution as we once have a rebellion of the clown we have now a opposition of the pedler the quiet of the nation have be for year disturb by a faction against which all faction ought to conspire for its original principle be the desire of level it be only animated under the name of zeal by the natural malignity of the mean against the great when in the confusion which the english invasion produce in france the villain imagine that they have find the golden hour of emancipation take arm in they hand the knight of both nation consider the cause as common and suspend the general hostility unite to chastise they the whole conduct of this despicable faction be distinguish by plebeian grossness and savage indecency to misrepresent the action and the principle of they enemy be common to all party but the insolence of invective and brutality of reproach which have lately prevail be peculiar to this a infallible characteristick of meanness be cruelty this be the only faction that have shout at the condemnation of a criminal and that when he innocence procure he pardon have clamour for he blood all other party however enrage at each other have agree to treat the throne with decency but these low-born railer have attack not only the authority but the character of they sovereign and have endeavor surely without effect to alienate the affection of the people from the only king who for almost a century have much appear to desire or much endeavor to deserve they they have insult he with rudeness and with menace which be never excite by the gloomy sullenness of william even when half the nation deny he they allegiance nor by the dangerous bigotry of jame unless when he be finally drive from he palace and with which scarcely the open hostility of rebellion venture to vilify the unhappy charle even in the remark on the cabinet of naseby it be surely not unreasonable to hope that the nation will consult its dignity if not its safety and disdain to be protect or enslave by the declaimer or the plotter of a city tavern have rome fall by the catilinarian conspiracy she might have console she fate by the greatness of she destroyer but what would have alleviate the disgrace of england have she government be change by tiler or by ket one part of the nation have never before contend with the other but for some weighty and apparent interest if the means be violent the end be great the civil war be fight for what each army call and believe the best religion and the best government the struggle in the reign of anne be to exclude or restore a exile king we be now dispute with almost equal animosity whether middlesex shall be represent or not by a criminal from a gaol the only comfort leave in such degeneracy be that a lower state can be no longer possible in this contemptuous censure i mean not to include every single man in all lead say the chymist there be silver and in all copper there be gold but mingled mass be justly denominate by the greater quantity and when the precious particle be not worth extraction a faction and a pig must be melt down together to the form and office that chance allot they : fiunt urceolus pelve sartago patell a few week will now show whether the government can be shake by empty noise and whether the faction which depend upon its influence have not deceive alike the publick and itself that it should have continue till now be sufficiently shameful none can indeed wonder that it have be support by the sectary the natural fomenter of sedition and confederate of the rabble of whose religion little now remain but hatred of establishment and who be angry to find separation now only tolerate which be once reward but every honest man must lament that it have be regard with frigid neutrality by the tory who be long accustomed to signalize they principle by opposition to the court do not yet consider that they have at last a king who know not the name of party and who wish to be the common father of all he people as a man inebriate only by vapor soon recover in the open air a nation discontent to madness without any adequate cause will return to its wit and its allegiance when a little pause have cool it to reflection nothing therefore be necessary at this alarming crisis but to consider the alarm as false to make concession be to encourage encroachment let the court despise the faction and the disappointed people will soon deride it prefatory observation on falkland 's island the following thought be publish in 1771 from material furnish to the author by the ministry he description of the misery of war be most eloquently persuasive and he invective against the opposition and they mysterious champion abound with the most forcible and poignant satire in a letter to mr langton from johnson we find that lord north stop the sale before many copy have be disperse johnson avow to he friend that he do not distinctly know the reason of the minister 's conduct but in all probability it be dictate by a dread of the effect of unqualified asperity and accordingly in the second edition many of the more violent expression be soften down or expunge it have be think by some that dr johnson rate the value of the falkland island to england too low -- ed thought on the late transaction respect falkland 's island 1771 to proportion the eagerness of contest to its importance seem too hard a task for human wisdom the pride of wit have keep age busy in the discussion of useless question and the pride of power have destroy army to gain or to keep unprofitable possession not many year have pass since the cruelty of war be fill the world with terror and with sorrow rage be at last appease or strength exhaust and to the harass nation peace be restore with its pleasure and its benefit of this state all feel the happiness and all implore the continuance but what continuance of happiness can be expect when the whole system of european empire can be in danger of a new concussion by a contention for a few spot of earth which in the desert of the ocean have almost escape human notice and which if they have not happen to make a seamark have perhaps never have a name fortune often delight to dignify what nature have neglect and that renown which can not be claim by intrinsick excellence or greatness be sometimes derive from unexpected accident the rubicon be ennoble by the passage of caesar and the time be now come when falkland 's island demand they historian but the writer to whom this employment shall be assign will have few opportunity of descriptive splendor or narrative elegance of other country it be tell how often they have change they government these island have hitherto change only they name of hero to conquer or legislator to civilize here have be no appearance nothing have happen to they but that they have be sometimes see by wander navigator who pass by they in search of better habitation when the spaniard who under the conduct of columbus discover america have take possession of its most wealthy region they surprise and terrify europe by a sudden and unexampled influx of riches they be make at once insupportably insolent and might perhaps have become irresistibly powerful have not they mountainous treasure be scatter in the air with the ignorant profusion of unaccustomed opulence the greater part of the european potentate see this stream of riches flow into spain without attempt to dip they own hand in the golden fountain france have no naval skill or power portugal be extend she dominion in the east over region form in the gaiety of nature the hanseatick league be plan only for the security of traffick have no tendency to discovery or invasion and the commercial state of italy grow rich by trade between asia and europe and not lie upon the ocean do not desire to seek by great hazard at a distance what be almost at home to be find with safety the english alone be animated by the success of the spanish navigator to try if any thing be leave that might reward adventure or incite appropriation they send cabot into the north but in the north there be no gold or silver to be find the best region be pre-occupied yet they still continue they hope and they labor they be the second nation that dare the extent of the pacifick ocean and the second circumnavigator of the globe by the war between elizabeth and philip the wealth of america become lawful prize and those who be less afraid of danger than of poverty suppose that riches might easily be obtain by plunder the spaniard nothing be difficult when gain and honor unite they influence the spirit and vigor of these expedition enlarged we view of the new world and make we first acquaint with its remoter coast in the fatal voyage of cavendish -lrb- 1592 -rrb- captain davi who be send out as he associate be afterwards part from he or desert he as he be drive by violence of weather about the strait of magellan be suppose to have be the first who see the land now call falkland 's island but he distress permit he not to make any observation and he leave they as he find they without a name not long afterwards -lrb- 1594 -rrb- sir richard hawkin be in the same sea with the same design see these island again if they be indeed the same island and in honor of he mistress call they hawkin 's maiden land this voyage be not of renown sufficient to procure a general reception to the new name for when the dutch who have now become strong enough not only to defend themselves but to attack they master send -lrb- 1598 -rrb- verhagen and sebald de wert into the south sea these island which be not suppose to have be know before obtain the denomination of sebald 's island and be from that time place in the chart though frezier tell we that they be yet consider as of doubtful existence they present english name be probably give they -lrb- 1689 -rrb- by strong whose journal yet unprinted may be find in the museum this name be adopt by halley and have from that time i believe be receive into we map the privateer which be put into motion by the war of william and anne see those island and mention they but they be yet not consider as territory worth a contest strong affirm that there be no wood and dampier suspect that they have no water frezier describe they appearance with more distinctness and mention some ship of st malo 's by which they have be visit and to which he seem willing enough to ascribe the honor of discover island which yet he admit to have be see by hawkin and name by sebald de wert he i suppose in honor of he countryman call they the malouine the denomination now use by the spaniard who seem not till very lately to have think they important enough to deserve a name since the publication of anson 's voyage they have very much change they opinion find a settlement in pepy 's or falkland 's island recommend by the author as necessary to the success of we future expedition against the coast of chili and as of such use and importance that it would produce many advantage in peace and in war would make we master of the south sea scarcely any degree of judgment be sufficient to restrain the imagination from magnify that on which it be long detain the relater of anson 's voyage have heat he mind with its various event have partake the hope with which it be begin and the vexation suffer by its various miscarriage and then think nothing could be of greater benefit to the nation than that which might promote the success of such another enterprise have the hero of that history even perform and attain all that when they first spread they sail they venture to hope the consequence would yet have produce very little hurt to the spaniard and very little benefit to the english they would have take a few town anson and he companion would have share the plunder or the ransome and the spaniard find they southern territory accessible would for the future have guard they better that such a settlement may be of use in war no man that consider its situation will deny but war be not the whole business of life it happen but seldom and every man either good or wise wish that its frequency be still less that conduct which betray design of future hostility if it do not excite violence will always generate malignity it must for ever exclude confidence and friendship and continue a cold and sluggish rivalry by a sly reciprocation of indirect injury without the bravery of war or the security of peace the advantage of such a settlement in time of peace be i think not easily to be prove for what use can it have but of a station for contraband trader a nursery of fraud and a receptacle of theft narborough about a century ago be of opinion that no advantage could be obtain in voyage to the south sea except by such a armament as with a sailor 's morality _ might trade by force _ it be well know that the prohibition of foreign commerce be in these country to the last degree rigorous and that no man not authorize by the king of spain can trade there but by force or stealth whatever profit be obtain must be gain by the violence of rapine or dexterity of fraud government will not perhaps soon arrive at such purity and excellence but that some connivance at least will be indulge to the triumphant robber and successful cheat he that bring wealth home be seldom interrogate by what mean it be obtain this however be one of those mode of corruption with which mankind ought always to struggle and which they may in time hope to overcome there be reason to expect that as the world be more enlighten policy and morality will at last be reconcile and that nation will learn not to do what they would not suffer but the silent toleration of suspect guilt be a degree of depravity far below that which openly incite and manifestly protect it to pardon a pirate may be injurious to mankind but how much greater be the crime of open a port in which all pirate shall be safe the contraband trader be not more worthy of protection if with narborough he trade by force he be a pirate if he trade secretly he be only a thief those who honestly refuse he traffick he hate as obstructer of he profit and those with whom he deal he cheat because he know that they dare not complain he live with a heart full of that malignity which fear of detection always generate in those who be to defend unjust acquisition against lawful authority and when he come home with riches thus acquire he bring a mind harden in evil too proud for reproof and too stupid for reflection he offend the high by he insolence and corrupt the low by he example whether these truth be forget or despise or whether some better purpose be then in agitation the representation make in anson 's voyage have such effect upon the statesman of that time that in 1748 some sloop be fit out for the fuller knowledge of pepy 's and falkland 's island and for further discovery in the south sea this expedition though perhaps design to be secret be not long conceal from wall the spanish ambassador who so vehemently oppose it and so strongly maintain the right of the spaniard to the exclusive dominion of the south sea that the english ministry relinquish part of they original design and declare that the examination of those two island be the utmost that they order should comprise this concession be sufficiently liberal or sufficiently submissive yet the spanish court be neither gratify by we kindness nor soften by we humility sir benjamin keene who then reside at madrid be interrogate by carvajal concern the visit intend to pepy 's and falkland 's island in term of great jealousy and discontent and the intended expedition be represent if not as a direct violation of the late peace yet as a act inconsistent with amicable intention and contrary to the profession of mutual kindness which then pass between spain and england keene be direct to protest that nothing more than mere discovery be intend and that no settlement be to be establish the spaniard readily reply that if this be a voyage of wanton curiosity it might be gratify with less trouble for he be willing to communicate whatever be know that to go so far only to come back be no reasonable act and it would be a slender sacrifice to peace and friendship to omit a voyage in which nothing be to be gain that if we leave the place as we find they the voyage be useless and if we take possession it be a hostile armament nor could we expect that the spaniard would suppose we to visit the southern part of america only from curiosity after the scheme propose by the author of anson 's voyage when once we have disown all purpose of settle it be apparent that we could not defend the propriety of we expedition by argument equivalent to carvajal 's objection the ministry therefore dismiss the whole design but no declaration be require by which we right to pursue it hereafter might be annul from this time falkland 's island be forget or neglect till the conduct of naval affair be intrust to the earl of egmont a man whose mind be vigorous and ardent whose knowledge be extensive and whose design be magnificent but who have somewhat vitiate he judgment by too much indulgence of romantick project and airy speculation lord egmont 's eagerness after something new determine he to make inquiry after falkland 's island and he send out captain byron who in the beginning of the year 1765 take he say a formal possession in the name of he britannick majesty the possession of this place be accord to mr byron 's representation no despicable acquisition he conceive the island to be six or seven hundred mile round and represent it as a region naked indeed of wood but which if that defect be supply would have all that nature almost all that luxury could want the harbor he find capacious and secure and therefore think it worthy of the name of egmont of water there be no want and the ground he describe as have all the excellency of soil and as cover with antiscorbutick herb the restorative of the sailor provision be easily to be have for they kill almost every day a hundred goose to each ship by pelt they with stone not content with physick and with food he search yet deeper for the value of the new dominion he dig in quest of ore find iron in abundance and do not despair of nobler metal a country thus fertile and delightful fortunately find where none would have expect it about the fiftieth degree of southern latitude could not without great supineness be neglect early in the next year -lrb- January 8 1766 -rrb- captain macbride arrive at port egmont where he erect a small block-house and station a garrison he description be less flattering he find what he call a mass of island and broken land of which the soil be nothing but a bog with no better prospect than that of barren mountain beat by storm almost perpetual yet this say he be summer and if the wind of winter hold they natural proportion those who lie but two cable ' length from the shore must pass week without any communication with it the plenty which regale mr byron and which might have support not only army but army of patagon be no longer to be find the goose be too wise to stay when man violate they haunt and mr macbride 's crew could only now and then kill a goose when the weather would permit all the quadruped which he meet there be fox suppose by he to have be bring upon the ice but of useless animal such as sea lion and penguin which he call vermin the number be incredible he allow however that those who touch at these island may find goose and snipe and in the summer month wild celery and sorrel no token be see by either of any settlement ever make upon this island and mr macbride think himself so secure from hostile disturbance that when he erect he wooden block-house he omit to open the port and loophole when a garrison be station at port egmont it be necessary to try what sustenance the ground could be by culture excite to produce a garden be prepared but the plant that spring up wither away in immaturity : some fir seed be sow but though this be the native tree of rugged climate the young fir that rise above the ground die like weaker herbage : the cold continued long and the ocean seldom be at rest cattle succeed better than vegetable goat sheep and hog that be carry thither be find to thrive and increase as in other place nil mortalibus arduum est : there be nothing which human courage will not undertake and little that human patience will not endure the garrison live upon falkland 's island shrink from the blast and shudder at the billow this be a colony which could never become independent for it never could be able to maintain itself the necessary supplies be annually send from england at a expense which the admiralty begin to think would not quickly be repay but shame of desert a project and unwillingness to contend with a projector that mean well continue the garrison and supply it with regular remittance of store and provision that of which we be almost weary ourselves we do not expect any one to envy and therefore suppose that we should be permit to reside in falkland 's island the undisputed lord of tempest-beaten barrenness but on the 28th of November 1769 captain hunt observe a spanish schooner hover about the island and survey it send the commander a message by which he require he to depart the spaniard make a appearance of obey but in two day come back with letter write by the governor of port solidad and bring by the chief officer of a settlement on the east part of falkland 's island in this letter date malouina November 30 the governor complain that captain hunt when he order the schooner to depart assume a power to which he could have no pretension by send a imperious message to the spaniard in the king of spain 's own dominion in another letter send at the same time he suppose the english to be in that part only by accident and to be ready to depart at the first warning this letter be accompany by a present of which say he if it be neither equal to my desire nor to you merit you must impute the deficiency to the situation of we both in return to this hostile civility captain hunt warn they from the island which he claim in the name of the king as belong to the english by right of the first discovery and the first settlement this be a assertion of more confidence than certainty the right of discovery indeed have already appear to be probable but the right which priority of settlement confer i know not whether we yet can establish on December 10 the officer send by the governor of port solidad make three protest against captain hunt for threaten to fire upon he for oppose he entrance into port egmont and for enter himself into port solidad on the 12th the governor of port solidad formally warn captain hunt to leave port egmont and to forbear the navigation of these sea without permission from the king of spain to this captain hunt reply by repeat he former claim by declare that he order be to keep possession and by once more warn the spaniard to depart the next month produce more protest and more reply of which the tenor be nearly the same the operation of such harmless enmity have produce no effect be then reciprocally discontinue and the english be leave for a time to enjoy the pleasure of falkland 's island without molestation this tranquillity however do not last long a few month afterwards -lrb- June 4 1770 -rrb- the industry a spanish frigate command by a officer whose name be madariaga anchor in port egmont bind as be say for port solidad and reduce by a passage from bueno ayre of fifty-three day to want of water three day afterwards four other frigate enter the port and a broad pendant such as be bear by the commander of a naval armament be display from the industry captain farmer of the swift frigate who command the garrison order the crew of the swift to come on shore and assist in its defense and direct captain maltby to bring the favorite frigate which he command nearer to the land the spaniard easily discover the purpose of he motion let he know that if he weigh he anchor they would fire upon he ship but pay no regard to these menace he advance toward the shore the spanish fleet follow and two shot be fire which fall at a distance from he he then send to inquire the reason of such hostility and be tell that the shot be intend only as signal both the english captain write the next day to madariaga the spanish commodore warn he from the island as from a place which the english hold by right of discovery madariaga who seem to have have no desire of unnecessary mischief invite they -lrb- June 9 -rrb- to send a officer who should take a view of he force that they might be convince of the vanity of resistance and do that without compulsion which he be upon refusal prepare to enfcrce a officer be send who find sixteen hundred man with a train of twenty-seven cannon four mortar and two hundred bomb the fleet consist of five frigate from twenty to thirty gun which be now station opposite to the block-house he then send they a formal memorial in which he maintain he master 's right to the whole magellanick region and exhort the english to retire quietly from the settlement which they could neither justify by right nor maintain by power he offer they the liberty of carry away whatever they be desirous to remove and promise he receipt for what should be leave that no loss might be suffer by they he proposition be express in term of great civility but he conclude with demand a answer in fifteen minute have while he be write receive the letter of warn write the day before by the english captain he tell they that he think himself able to prove the king of spain 's title to all those country but that this be no time for verbal altercation he persist in he determination and allow only fifteen minute for a answer to this it be reply by captain farmer that though there have be prescribe yet a shorter time he should still resolutely defend he charge that this whether menace or force would be consider as a insult on the british flag and that satisfaction would certainly be require on the next day June 10 madariaga land he force and it may be easily imagine that he have no bloody conquest the english have only a wooden block-house build at woolwich and carry in piece to the island with a small battery of cannon to contend with obstinacy have be only to lavish life without use or hope after the exchange of a very few shot a capitulation be propose the spanish commander act with moderation he exert little of the conqueror what he have offer before the attack he grant after the victory the english be allow to leave the place with every honor only they departure be delay by the term of the capitulation twenty day and to secure they stay the rudder of the favorite be take off what they desire to carry away they remove without molestation and of what they leave a inventory be draw for which the spanish officer by he receipt promise to be accountable of this petty revolution so sudden and so distant the english ministry could not possibly have such notice as might enable they to prevent it the conquest if such it may be call cost but three day for the spaniard either suppose the garrison stronger than it be or resolve to trust nothing to chance or consider that as they force be greater there be less dariger of bloodshed come with a power that make resistance ridiculous and at once demand and obtain possession the first account of any discontent express by the spaniard be bring by captain hunt who arrive at plymouth June 3 1770 inform the admiralty that the island have be claim in December by the governor of port solidad this claim make by a officer of so little dignity without any known direction from he superior could be consider only as the zeal or officiousness of a individual unworthy of publick notice or the formality of remonstrance in August mr harri the resident at madrid give notice to lord weymouth of a account newly bring to cadiz that the english be in possession of port cuizada the same which we call port egmont in the magellanick sea that in January they have warn away two spanish ship and that a armament be send out in may from bueno ayre to dislodge they it be perhaps not yet certain that this account be true but the information however faithful be too late for prevention it be easily know that a fleet despatch in may have before August succeed or miscarry in October captain maltby come to england and give the account which i have now epitomise of he expulsion from falkland 's island from this moment the whole nation can witness that no time be lose the navy be survey the ship refit and commander appoint and a powerful fleet be assemble well manned and well store with expedition after so long a peace perhaps never know before and with vigor which after the waste of so long a war scarcely any other nation have be capable of exert this preparation so illustrious in the eye of europe and so efficacious in its event be obstruct by the utmost power of that noisy faction which have too long fill the kingdom sometimes with the roar of empty menace and sometimes with the yell of hypocritical lamentation every man saw and every honest man see with detestation that they who desire to force they sovereign into war endeavor at the same time to disable he from action the vigor and spirit of the ministry easily break through all the machination of these pygmy rebel and we armament be quickly such as be likely to make we negotiation effectual the prince of masseran in he first conference with the english minister on this occasion own that he have from madrid receive intelligence that the english have be forcibly expel from falkland 's island by buccarellus the governor of bueno ayre without any particular order from the king of spain but be ask whether in he master 's name he disavow buccarellus 's violence he refuse to answer without direction the scene of negotiation be now remove to madrid and in September mr harris be direct to demand from grimaldus the spanish minister the restitution of falkland 's island and a disavowal of buccarellus 's hostility it be to be expect that grimaldus would object to we we own behavior who have order the spaniard to depart from the same island to this it be reply that the english force be indeed direct to warn other nation away but if compliance be refuse to proceed quietly in make they settlement and suffer the subject of whatever power to remain there without molestation by possession thus take there be only a disputable claim advance which might be peaceably and regularly decide without insult and without force and if the spaniard have complain at the british court they reason would have be hear and all injury redress but that by presuppose the justice of they own title and have recourse to arm without any previous notice or remonstrance they have violate the peace and insult the british government and therefore it be expect that satisfaction should be make by publick disavowal and immediate restitution the answer of grimaldus be ambiguous and cold he do not allow that any particular order have be give for drive the english from they settlement but make no scruple of declare that such a ejection be nothing more than the settler might have expect and that buccarellus have not in he opinion incur any blame as the general injunction to the american governor be to suffer no encroachment on the spanish dominion in October the prince of masseran propose a convention for the accommodation of difference by mutual concession in which the warning give to the spaniard by hunt should be disavow on one side and the violence use by buccarellus on the other this offer be consider as little less than a new insult and grimaldus be tell that injury require reparation that when either party have suffer evident wrong there be not the parity subsist which be imply in convention and contract that we consider ourselves as openly insult and demand satisfaction plenary and unconditional grimaldus affect to wonder that we be not yet appease by they concession they have he say grant all that be require they have offer to restore the island in the state in which they find it but he think that they likewise might hope for some regard and that the warning send by hunt would be disavow mr harri we minister at madrid insist that the injured party have a right to unconditional reparation and grimaldus delay he answer that a council might be call in a few day order be despatch to prince masseran by which he be commission to declare the king of spain 's readiness to satisfy the demand of the king of england in expectation of receive from he reciprocal satisfaction by the disavowal so often require of hunt 's warning find the spaniard dispose to make no other acknowledgment the english ministry consider a war as not likely to be long avoid in the latter end of November private notice be give of they danger to the merchant at cadiz and the officer absent from gibraltar be remand to they post we naval force be every day increase and we make no abatement of we original demand the obstinacy of the spanish court still continue and about the end of the year all hope of reconciliation be so nearly extinguish that mr harri be direct to withdraw with the usual form from he residence at madrid moderation be commonly firm and firmness be commonly successful have not swell we first requisition with any superfluous appendage we have nothing to yield we therefore only repeat we first proposition prepare for war though desirous of peace about this time as be well know the king of france dismiss choiseul from he employment what effect this revolution of the french court have upon the spanish counsel i pretend not to be inform choiseul have always profess pacifick disposition nor be it certain however it may be suspect that he talk in different strain to different party it seem to be almost the universal error of historian to suppose it politically as it be physically true that every effect have a proportionate cause in the inanimate action of matter upon matter the motion produce can be but equal to the force of the move power but the operation of life whether private or publick admit no such law the caprice of voluntary agent laugh at calculation it be not always that there be a strong reason for a great event obstinacy and flexibility malignity and kindness give place alternately to each other and the reason of these vicissitude however important may be the consequence often escape the mind in which the change be make whether the alteration which begin in January to appear in the spanish counsel have any other cause than conviction of the impropriety of they past conduct and of the danger of a new war it be not easy to decide but they begin whatever be the reason to relax they haughtiness and mr harri 's departure be countermand the demand first make by england be still continue and on January 22d the prince of masseran deliver a declaration in which the king of spain disavow the violent enterprise of buccarellus and promise to restore the port and fort call egmont with all the artillery and store accord to the inventory to this promise of restitution be subjoin that this engagement to restore port egmont can not nor ought in any wise to affect the question of the prior right of sovereignty of the _ malouine _ otherwise call falkland 's island this concession be accept by the earl of rochford who declare on the part of he master that the prince of masseran be authorize by he catholick majesty to offer in he majesty 's name to the king of great britain a satisfaction for the injury do he by dispossess he of port egmont and have sign a declaration express that he catholick majesty disavow the expedition against port egmont and engage to restore it in the state in which it stand before the 10th of June 1770 he britannick majesty will look upon the say declaration together with the full performance of the engagement on the part of he catholick majesty as a satisfaction for the injury do to the crown of great britain this be all that be originally demand the expedition be disavow and the island be restore a injury be acknowledge by the reception of lord rochford 's paper who twice mention the word _ injury _ and twice the word _ satisfaction _ the spaniard have stipulate that the grant of possession shall not preclude the question of prior right a question which we shall probably make no haste to discuss and a right of which no formal resignation be ever require this reserve have supply matter for much clamor and perhaps the english ministry would have be better pleased have the declaration be without it but when we have obtain all that be ask why should we complain that we have not more when the possession be concede where be the evil that the right which that concession suppose to be merely hypothetical be refer to the greek calends for a future disquisition be the switzer less free or less secure because after they defection from the house of austrium they have never be declare independent before the treaty of westphalium be the king of france less a sovereign because the king of england partake he title if sovereignty imply undisputed right scarce any prince be a sovereign through he whole dominion if sovereignty consist in this that no superior be acknowledge we king reign at port egmont with sovereign authority almost every new-acquired territory be in some degree controvertible and till the controversy be decide a term very difficult to be fix all that can be have be real possession and actual dominion this surely be a sufficient answer to the feudal gabble of a man who be every day lessen that splendor of character which once illuminate the kingdom then dazzle and afterwards inflamed it and for whom it will be happy if the nation shall at last dismiss he to nameless obscurity with that equipoise of blame and praise which corneille allow to richelieu a man who i think have much of he merit and many of he fault : chacun parle  son gr de ce grand cardinal mai pour moi je n'en dirai rien : il m ' a fait trop de bien pour en dire du mal il m ' a fait trop de mal pour en dire du bien to push advantage too far be neither generous nor just have we insist on a concession of antecedent right it may not misbecome we either as moralist or politician to consider what grimaldus could have answer we have already he might say grant you the whole effect of right and have not deny you the name we have not say that the right be ours before this concession but only that what right we have be not by this concession vacate we have now for more than two century rule large tract of the american continent by a claim which perhaps be valid only upon this consideration that no power can produce a better by the right of discovery and prior settlement and by such title almost all the dominion of the earth be holden except that they original be beyond memory and greater obscurity give they greater veneration should we allow this plea to be annul the whole fabrick of we empire shake at the foundation when you suppose yourselve to have first descry the disputed island you suppose what you can hardly prove we be at least the general discoverer of the magellanick region and have hitherto hold it with all its adjacency the justice of this tenure the world have hitherto admit and yourselve at least tacitly allow it when about twenty year ago you desist from you purpose expedition and expressly disown any design of settle where you be now not content to settle and to reign without extort such a confession of original right as may invite every other nation to follow you to consideration such as these it be reasonable to impute that anxiety of the spaniard from which the importance of this island be infer by junius one of the few writer of he despicable faction whose name do not disgrace the page of a opponent the value of the thing dispute may be very different to he that gain and he that lose it the spaniard by yield falkland 's island have admit a precedent of what they think encroachment have suffer a breach to be make in the outwork of they empire and notwithstanding the reserve of prior right have suffer a dangerous exception to the prescriptive tenure of they american territory such be the loss of spain let we now compute the profit of britain we have by obtain a disavowal of buccarellus 's expedition and a restitution of we settlement maintain the honor of the crown and the superiority of we influence beyond this what have we acquire what but a bleak and gloomy solitude a island throw aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in summer a island which not the southern savage have dignified with habitation where a garrison must be keep in a state that contemplate with envy the exile of siberium of which the expense will be perpetual and the use only occasional and which if fortune smile upon we labor may become a nest of smuggler in peace and in war the refuge of future bucanier to all this the government have now give ample attestation for the island have be since abandon and perhaps be keep only to quiet clamor with a intention not then wholly conceal of quit it in a short time this be the country of which we have now possession and of which a numerous party pretend to wish that we have murder thousand for the titular sovereignty to charge any man with such madness approach to a accusation defeat by its own incredibility as they have be long accumulate falsehood it be possible that they be now only add another to the heap and that they do not mean all that they profess but of this faction what evil may not be credit they have hitherto show no virtue and very little wit beyond that mischievous cunning for which it be hold by hale that child may be hang as war be the last of remedy cuncta prius tentanda all lawful expedient must be use to avoid it as war be the extremity of evil it be surely the duty of those whose station intrust they with the care of nation to avert it from they charge there be disease of animal nature which nothing but amputation can remove so there may by the depravation of human passion be sometimes a gangrene in collective life for which fire and the sword be the necessary remedy but in what can skill or caution be better show than prevent such dreadful operation while there be yet room for gentler method it be wonderful with what coolness and indifference the greater part of mankind see war commence those that hear of it at a distance or read of it in book but have never present its evil to they mind consider it as little more than a splendid game a proclamation a army a battle and a triumph some indeed must perish in the most successful field but they die upon the bed of honor resign they life amidst the joy of conquest and fill with england 's glory smile in death the life of a modern soldier be ill represent by heroick fiction war have means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword of the thousand and ten thousand that perish in we late contest with france and spain a very small part ever feel the stroke of a enemy the rest languish in tent and ship amidst damp and putrefaction pale torpid spiritless and helpless gasping and groan unpitied among man make obdurate by long continuance of hopeless misery and be at last whelmed in pit or heave into the ocean without notice and without remembrance by incommodious encampment and unwholesome station where courage be useless and enterprise impracticable fleet be silently dispeopled and army sluggishly melt away thus be a people gradually exhaust for the most part with little effect the war of civilized nation make very slow change in the system of empire the publick perceive scarcely any alteration but a increase of debt and the few individual who be benefit be not suppose to have the clearest right to they advantage if he that share the danger enjoy the profit and after bleed in the battle grow rich by the victory he might show he gain without envy but at the conclusion of a ten year ' war how be we recompense for the death of multitude and the expense of million but by contemplate the sudden glory of paymaster and agent contractor and commissary whose equipage shine like meteor and whose palace rise like exhalation these be the man who without virtue labor or hazard be grow rich as they country be impoverish they rejoice when obstinacy or ambition add another year to slaughter and devastation and laugh from they desk at bravery and science while they be add figure to figure and cipher to cipher hope for a new contract from a new armament and compute the profit of a siege or tempest those who suffer they mind to dwell on these consideration will think it no great crime in the ministry that they have not snatch with eagerness the first opportunity of rush into the field when they be able to obtain by quiet negotiation all the real good that victory could have bring we of victory indeed every nation be confident before the sword be draw and this mutual confidence produce that wantonness of bloodshed that have so often desolate the world but it be evident that of contradictory opinion one must be wrong and the history of mankind do not want example that may teach caution to the daring and moderation to the proud let we not think we laurel blast by condescend to inquire whether we might not possibly grow rather less than greater by attack spain whether we should have to contend with spain alone whatever have be promise by we patriot may very reasonably be doubt a war declare for the empty sound of a ancient title to a magellanick rock would raise the indignation of the earth against we these encroacher on the waste of nature say we ally the russian if they succeed in they first effort of usurpation will make war upon we for a title to kamtschatka these universal settler say we ally the dane will in a short time settle upon greenland and a fleet will batter copenhagen till we be willing to confess that it always be they own in a quarrel like this it be not possible that any power should favor we and it be very likely that some would oppose we the french we be tell be otherwise employ : the contest between the king of france and he own subject be sufficient to withhold he from support spain but who do not know that a foreign war have often put a stop to civil discord it withdraw the attention of the publick from domestick grievance and afford opportunity of dismiss the turbulent and restless to distant employment the spaniard have always a argument of irresistible persuasion : if france will not support they against england they will strengthen england against france but let we indulge a dream of idle speculation and suppose that we be to engage with spain and with spain alone it be not even yet very certain that much advantage will be gain spain be not easily vulnerable she kingdom by the loss or cession of many fragment of dominion be become solid and compact the spaniard have indeed no fleet able to oppose we but they will not endeavor actual opposition : they will shut themselves up in they own territory and let we exhaust we seaman in a hopeless siege : they will give commission to privateer of every nation who will prey upon we merchant without possibility of reprisal if they think they plata fleet in danger they will forbid it to set sail and live awhile upon the credit of treasure which all europe know to be safe and which if we obstinacy should continue till they can no longer be without it will be convey to they with secrecy and security by we natural enemy the french or by the dutch we natural ally but the whole continent of spanish america will lie open to invasion we shall have nothing to do but march into these wealthy region and make they present master confess that they be always ours by ancient right we shall throw brass and iron out of we house and nothing but silver will be see among we all this be very desirable but it be not certain that it can be easily attain large tract of america be add by the last war to the british dominion but if the faction credit they own apollo they be conquer in germany they at best be only the barren part of the continent the refuse of the earlier adventurer which the french who come last have take only as better than nothing against the spanish dominion we have never hitherto be able to do much a few privateer have grow rich at they expense but no scheme of conquest have yet be successful they be defend not by wall mount with cannon which by cannon may be batter but by the storm of the deep and the vapor of the land by the flame of calenture and blast of pestilence in the reign of elizabeth the favorite period of english greatness no enterprise against america have any other consequence than that of extend english navigation here cavendish perish after all he hazard and here drake and hawkin great as they be in knowledge and in fame have promise honor to themselves and dominion to the country sink by desperation and misery in dishonourable grave during the protectorship of cromwell a time of which the patriotick tribe still more ardently desire the return the spanish dominion be again attempt but here and only here the fortune of cromwell make a pause he force be drive from hispaniolum he hope of possess the west indy vanish and jamaica be take only that the whole expedition might not grow ridiculous the attack of carthagena be yet remember where the spaniard from the rampart see they invader destroy by the hostility of the element poison by the air and cripple by the dew where every hour sweep away battalion and in the three day that pass between the descent and reembarkation half a army perish in the last war the havanna be take at what expense be too well remember may my country be never curse with such another conquest these instance of miscarriage and these argument of difficulty may perhaps abate the military ardor of the publick upon the opponent of the government they operation will be different they wish for war but not for conquest victory would defeat they purpose equally with peace because prosperity would naturally continue the trust in those hand which have use it fortunately the patriot gratify themselves with expectation that some sinistrous accident or erroneous conduct might diffuse discontent and inflame malignity they hope be malevolence and they good be evil of they zeal for they country we have already have a specimen while they be terrifying the nation with doubt whether it be any longer to exist while they represent invasive army as hover in the cloud and hostile fleet as emerge from the deep they obstruct we levy of seaman and embarrassed we endeavor of defense of such man he think with unnecessary candor who do not believe they likely to have promote the miscarriage which they desire by intimidate we troops or betray we counsel it be consider as a injury to the publick by those sanguinary statesman that though the fleet have be refit and man yet no hostility have follow and they who sit wish for misery and slaughter be disappoint of they pleasure but as peace be the end of war it be the end likewise of preparation for war and he may be justly hunt down as the enemy of mankind that can choose to snatch by violence and bloodsh what gentler means can equally obtain the ministry be reproach as not daring to provoke a enemy lest ill success should discredit and displace they i hope that they have better reason that they pay some regard to equity and humanity and consider themselves as intrusted with the safety of they fellow-subject and as the destroyer of all that should be superfluously slaughter but let we suppose that they own safety have some influence on they conduct they will not however sink to a level with they enemy though the motive might be selfish the act be innocent they who grow rich by administer physick be not to be number with they that get money by dispense poison if they maintain power by harmlessness and peace they must for ever be at a great distance from ruffian who would gain it by mischief and confusion the watch of a city may guard it for hire but be well employ in protect it from those who lie in wait to fire the street and rob the house amidst the conflagration a unsuccessful war would undoubtedly have have the effect which the enemy of the ministry so earnestly desire for who could have sustain the disgrace of folly end in misfortune but have wanton invasion undeservedly prosper have falkland 's island be yield unconditionally with every right prior and posterior though the rabble might have shout and the window have blaze yet those who know the value of life and the uncertainty of publick credit would have murmur perhaps unheard at the increase of we debt and the loss of we people this thirst of blood however the visible promoter of sedition may think it convenient to shrink from the accusation be loudly avow by junius the writer to whom he party owe much of its pride and some of its popularity of junius it can not be say as of ulyss that he scatter ambiguous expression among the vulgar for he cry havock without reserve and endeavor to let slip the dog of foreign or of civil war ignorant whither they be go and careless what may be they prey junius have sometimes make he satire feel but let not injudicious admiration mistake the venom of the shaft for the vigor of the bow he have sometimes sport with lucky malice but to he that know he company it be not hard to be sarcastick in a mask while he walk like jack the giant-killer in a coat of darkness he may do much mischief with little strength novelty captivate the superficial and thoughtless vehemence delight the discontented and turbulent he that contradict acknowledge truth will always have a audience he that vilify established authority will always find abettor junius burst into notice with a blaze of impudence which have rarely glare upon the world before and draw the rabble after he as a monster make a show when he have once provide for he safety by impenetrable secrecy he have nothing to combat but truth and justice enemy whom he know to be feeble in the dark be then at liberty to indulge himself in all the immunity of invisibility out of the reach of danger he have be bold out of the reach of shame he have be confident as a rhetorician he have have the art of persuade when he second desire as a reasoner he have convince those who have no doubt before as a moralist he have teach that virtue may disgrace and as a patriot he have gratify the mean by insult on the high finding sedition ascendant he have be able to advance it find the nation combustible he have be able to inflame it let we abstract from he wit the vivacity of insolence and withdraw from he efficacy the sympathetick favor of plebeian malignity i do not say that we shall leave he nothing the cause that i defend scorn the help of falsehood but if we leave he only he merit what will be he praise it be not by he liveliness of imagery he pungency of period or he fertility of allusion that he detain the cit of london and the boor of middlesex of style and sentiment they take no cognizance they admire he for virtue like they own for contempt of order and violence of outrage for rage of defamation and audacity of falsehood the supporter of the bill of rights feel no nicety of composition nor dexterity of sophistry they faculty be better proportion to the bawl of bellas or barbarity of beckford but they be tell that junius be on they side and they be therefore sure that junius be infallible those who know not whither he would lead they resolve to follow he and those who can not find he mean hope he mean rebellion junius be a unusual phenomenon on which some have gaze with wonder and some with terror but wonder and terror be transitory passion he will soon be more closely view or more attentively examine and what folly have take for a comet that from its flaming hair shake pestilence and war inquiry will find to be only a meteor form by the vapor of putrefying democracy and kindle into flame by the effervescence of interest struggle with conviction which after have plunge its follower in a bog will leave we inquire why we regard it yet though i can not think the style of junius secure from criticism though he expression be often trite and he period feeble i should never have station he where he have place himself have i not rate he by he moral rather than he faculty what say pope must be the priest where a monkey be the god what must be the drudge of a party of which the head be wilke and crosby sawbridge and townsend junius know he own meaning and can therefore tell it he be a enemy to the ministry he see they grow hourly stronger he know that a war at once unjust and unsuccessful would have certainly displace they and be therefore in he zeal for he country angry that war be not unjustly make and unsuccessfully conduct but there be other whose thought be less clearly express and whose scheme perhaps be less consequentially digest who declare that they do not wish for a rupture yet condemn the ministry for not do that by which a rupture would naturally have be make if one party resolve to demand what the other resolve to refuse the dispute can be determine only by arbitration and between power who have no common superior there be no other arbitrator than the sword whether the ministry might not equitably have demand more be not worth a question the utmost exertion of right be always invidious and where claim be not easily determinable be always dangerous we ask all that be necessary and persist in we first claim without mean recession or wanton aggravation the spaniard find we resolute and comply after a short struggle the real crime of the ministry be that they have find the means of avoid they own ruin but the charge against they be multifarious and confused as will happen when malice and discontent be ashamed of they complaint the past and the future be complicate in the censure we have hear a tumultuous clamor about honor and rights injury and insult the british flag and the favorite 's rudder buccarellus 's conduct and grimaldus 's declaration the manilla ransome delay and reparation through the whole argument of the faction run the general error that we settlement on falkland 's island be not only lawful but unquestionable that we right be not only certain but acknowledge and that the equity of we conduct be such that the spaniard could not blame or obstruct it without combate they own conviction and oppose the general opinion of mankind if once it be discover that in the opinion of the spaniard we settlement be usurped we claim arbitrary and we conduct insolent all that have happen will appear to follow by a natural concatenation doubt will produce dispute and disquisition disquisition require delay and delay cause inconvenience have the spanish government immediately yield unconditionally all that be require we might have be satisfied but what would europe have judge of they submission that they shrink before we as a conquered people who have lately yield to we arm be now compel to sacrifice to we pride the honor of the publick be indeed of high importance but we must remember that we have have to transact with a mighty king and a powerful nation who have unluckily be teach to think that they have honor to keep or lose as well as ourselves when the admiralty be tell in June of the warning give to hunt they be i suppose inform that hunt have first provoke it by warn away the spaniard and naturally consider one act of insolence as balance by another without expect that more would be do on either side of representation and remonstrance there would be no end if they be to be make whenever small commander be uncivil to each other nor could peace ever be enjoy if upon such transient provocation it be imagine necessary to prepare for war we might then it be say have increase we force with more leisure and less inconvenience but this be to judge only by the event we omit to disturb the publick because we do not suppose that a armament would be necessary some month afterwards as have be tell buccarellus the governor of bueno ayre send against the settlement of port egmont a force which ensure the conquest the spanish commander require the english captain to depart but they think that resistance necessary which they know to be useless give the spaniard the right of prescribe term of capitulation the spaniard impose no new condition except that the sloop should not sail under twenty day and of this they secure the performance by take off the rudder to a inhabitant of the land there appear nothing in all this unreasonable or offensive if the english intend to keep they stipulation how be they injure by the detention of the rudder if the rudder be to a ship what he tail be in fable to a fox the part in which honor be place and of which the violation be never to be endure i be sorry that the favorite suffer a indignity but can not yet think it a cause for which nation should slaughter one another when buccarellus 's invasion be know and the dignity of the crown infringe we demand reparation and prepare for war and we gain equal respect by the moderation of we term and the spirit of we exertion the spanish minister immediately deny that buccarellus have receive any particular order to seize port egmont nor pretend that he be justified otherwise than by the general instruction by which the american governor be require to exclude the subject of other power to have inquire whether we settlement at port egmont be any violation of the spanish rights have be to enter upon a discussion which the pertinacity of political disputant might have continue without end we therefore call for restitution not as a confession of right but as a reparation of honor which require that we should be restore to we former state upon the island and that the king of spain should disavow the action of he governor in return to this demand the spaniard expect from we a disavowal of the menace with which they have be first insult by hunt and if the claim to the island be suppose doubtful they certainly expect it with equal reason this however be refuse and we superiority of strength give validity to we argument but we be tell that the disavowal of the king of spain be temporary and fallacious that buccarellus 's armament have all the appearance of regular force and a concerted expedition and that he be not treat at home as a man guilty of piracy or as disobedient to the order of he master that the expedition be well plan and the force properly supply afford no proof of communication between the governor and he court those who be intrust with the care of kingdom in another hemisphere must always be trust with power to defend they as little can be infer from he reception at the spanish court he be not punish indeed for what have he do that deserve punishment he be send into america to govern and defend the dominion of spain he think the english be encroach and drive they away no spaniard think that he have exceed he duty nor do the king of spain charge he with excess the boundary of dominion in that part of the world have not yet be settle and he mistake if a mistake there be like a zealous subject in he master 's favor but all this inquiry be superfluous consider as a reparation of honor the disavowal of the king of spain make in the sight of all europe be of equal value whether true or false there be indeed no reason to question its veracity they however who do not believe it must allow the weight of that influence by which a great prince be reduce to disown he own commission but the general order upon which the governor be acknowledge to have act be neither disavow _ nor _ explain why the spaniard should disavow the defense of they own territory the warmest disputant will find it difficult to tell and if by a explanation be mean a accurate delineation of the southern empire and the limitation of they claim beyond the line it can not be imputed to any very culpable remissness that what have be deny for two century to the european power be not obtain in a hasty wrangle about a petty settlement the ministry be too well acquaint with negotiation to fill they head with such idle expectation the question of right be inexplicable and endless they leave it as it stand to be restore to actual possession be easily practicable this restoration they require and obtain but they should say they opponent have insist upon more they should have exact not only reparation of we honor but repayment of we expense nor be they all satisfy with the recovery of the cost and damages of the present contest they be for take this opportunity of call in old debt and revive we right to the ransome of manilla the manilla ransome have i think be most mention by the inferior bellower of sedition those who lead the faction know that it can not be remember much to they advantage the follower of lord rockingham remember that he ministry begin and end without obtain it the adherent to grenville would be tell that he could never be teach to understand we claim the law of nation make little of he knowledge let he not however be depreciate in he grave if he be sometimes wrong he be often right -lrb- 29 -rrb- of reimbursement the talk have be more confident though not more reasonable the expense of war have be often desire have be sometimes require but be never pay or never but when resistance be hopeless and there remain no choice between submission and destruction of we late equipment i know not from whom the charge can be very properly expect the king of spain disavow the violence which provoke we to arm and for the mischief which he do not do why should he pay buccarellus though he have learn all the art of a east indian governor could hardly have collect at bueno ayre a sum sufficient to satisfy we demand if he be honest he be hardly rich and if he be dispose to rob he have the misfortune of be place where robber have be before he the king of spain indeed delay to comply with we proposal and we armament be make necessary by unsatisfactory answer and dilatory debate the delay certainly increase we expense and it be not unlikely that the increase of we expense put a end to the delay but this be the inevitable process of human affair negotiation require time what be not apparent to intuition must be find by inquiry claim that have remain doubtful for age can not be settle in a day reciprocal complaint be not easily adjust but by reciprocal compliance the spaniard think themselves entitle to the island and injure by captain hunt in they turn demand satisfaction which be refuse and where be the wonder if they concession be delay they may tell we that a independent nation be to be influence not by command but by persuasion that if we expect we proposal to be receive without deliberation we assume that sovereignty which they do not grant we and that if we arm while they be deliberate we must indulge we martial ardor at we own charge the english ministry ask all that be reasonable and enforce all that they ask we national honor be advance and we interest if any interest we have be sufficiently secure there can be none amongst we to whom this transaction do not seem happily conclude but those who have fix they hope on publick calamity sit like vulture wait for a day of carnage have wear out all the art of domestick sedition have wearied violence and exhaust falsehood they yet flatter themselves with some assistance from the pride or malice of spain and when they could no longer make the people complain of grievance which they do not feel they have the comfort yet of know that real evil be possible and they resolution be well know of charge all evil on they governor the reconciliation be therefore consider as the loss of they last anchor and receive not only with the fretfulness of disappointment but the rage of desperation when they find that all be happy in spite of they machination and the soft effulgence of peace shine out upon the nation they feel no motion but that of sullen envy they could not like milton 's prince of hell abstract themselves a moment from they evil as they have not the wit of satan they have not he virtue they try once again what could be do by sophistry without art and confidence without credit they represent they sovereign as dishonoured and they country as betray or in they fiercer paroxysm of fury revile they sovereign as betray it they pretence i have here endeavor to expose by show that more than have be yield be not to be expect that more perhaps be not to be desire and that if all have be refuse there have scarcely be a adequate reason for a war there be perhaps never much danger of war or of refusal but what danger there be proceed from the faction foreign nation unacquainted with the insolence of common council and unaccustomed to the howl of plebeian patriotism when they hear of rabble and riot of petition and remonstrance of discontent in surrey derbyshire and yorkshire when they see the chain of subordination broken and the legislature threaten and defy naturally imagine that such a government have little leisure for falkland 's island they suppose that the english when they return eject from port egmont would find wilke invest with the protectorate or see the mayor of london what the french have formerly see they mayor of the palace the commander of the army and tutor of the king that they would be call to tell they tale before the common council and that the world be to expect war or peace from a vote of the subscriber to the bill of rights but we enemy have now lose they hope and we friend i hope be recover from they fear to fancy that we government can be subvert by the rabble whom its lenity have pampered into impudence be to fear that a city may be drown by the overflow of its kennel the distemper which cowardice or malice think either decay of the vitals or resolution of the nerve appear at last to have be nothing more than a political _ phtheiriasis _ a disease too loathsome for a plainer name but the effect of negligence rather than of weakness and of which the shame be greater than the danger among the disturber of we quiet be some animal of greater bulk whom they power of roar persuade we to think formidable but we now perceive that sound and force do not always go together the noise of a savage prove nothing but he hunger after all we broil foreign and domestick we may at last hope to remain awhile in quiet amuse with the view of we own success we have gain political strength by the increase of we reputation we have gain real strength by the reparation of we navy we have show europe that ten year of war have not yet exhaust we and we have enforce we settlement on a island on which twenty year ago we dare not venture to look these be the gratification only of honest mind but there be a time in which hope come to all from the present happiness of the publick the patriot themselves may derive advantage to be harmless though by impotence obtain some degree of kindness : no man hate a worm as he hate a viper they be once dread enough to be detest as serpent that could bite they have now show that they can only hiss and may therefore quietly slink into hole and change they slough unmolested and forget the patriot -lrb- 30 -rrb- address to the elector of great britain 1774 they bawl for freedom in they senseless mood yet still revolt when truth would set they free license they mean when they cry liberty for who love that must first be wise and good milton to improve the golden moment of opportunity and catch the good that be within we reach be the great art of life many want be suffer which might once have be supply and much time be lose in regret the time which have be lose before at the end of every seven year come the saturnalian season when the freeman of great britain may please themselves with the choice of they representative this happy day have now arrive somewhat sooner than it could be claim to select and depute those by whom law be to be make and tax to be grant be a high dignity and a important trust and it be the business of every elector to consider how this dignity may be well sustained and this trust faithfully discharge it ought to be deeply impressed on the mind of all who have voice in this national deliberation that no man can deserve a seat in parliament who be not a patriot no other man will protect we rights : no other man can merit we confidence a patriot be he whose publick conduct be regulate by one single motive the love of he country who as a agent in parliament have for himself neither hope nor fear neither kindness nor resentment but refer every thing to the common interest that of five hundred man such as this degenerate age afford a majority can be find thus virtuously abstract who will affirm yet there be no good in despondence : vigilance and activity often effect more than be expect let we take a patriot where we can meet he and that we may not flatter ourselves by false appearance distinguish those mark which be certain from those which may deceive for a man may have the external appearance of a patriot without the constituent quality as false coin have often lustre though they want weight some claim a place in the list of patriot by a acrimonious and unremitting opposition to the court this mark be by no means infallible patriotism be not necessarily include in rebellion a man may hate he king yet not love he country he that have be refuse a reasonable or unreasonable request who think he merit underrated and see he influence decline begin soon to talk of natural equality the absurdity of many make for one the original compact the foundation of authority and the majesty of the people as he political melancholy increase he tell and perhaps dream of the advance of the prerogative and the danger of arbitrary power yet he design in all he declamation be not to benefit he country but to gratify he malice these however be the most honest of the opponent of government they patriotism be a species of disease and they feel some part of what they express but the greater far the greater number of those who rave and rail and inquire and accuse neither suspect nor fear nor care for the publick but hope to force they way to riches by virulence and invective and be vehement and clamorous only that they may be sooner hire to be silent a man sometimes start up a patriot only by disseminate discontent and propagate report of secret influence of dangerous counsel of violate rights and encroach usurpation this practice be no certain note of patriotism to instigate the populace with rage beyond the provocation be to suspend publick happiness if not to destroy it he be no lover of he country that unnecessarily disturb its peace few error and few fault of government can justify a appeal to the rabble who ought not to judge of what they can not understand and whose opinion be not propagate by reason but catch by contagion the fallaciousness of this note of patriotism be particularly apparent when the clamor continue after the evil be past they who be still fill we ear with mr wilke and the freeholder of middlesex lament a grievance that be now at a end mr wilke may be choose if any will choose he and the precedent of he exclusion make not any honest or any decent man think himself in clanger it may be doubt whether the name of a patriot can be fairly give as the reward of secret satire or open outrage to fill the newspaper with sly hint of corruption and intrigue to circulate the middlesex journal and london pacquet may indeed be zeal but it may likewise be interest and malice to offer a petition not expect to be grant to insult a king-with a rude remonstrance only because there be no punishment for legal insolence be not courage for there be no danger nor patriotism for it tend to the subversion of order and let wickedness loose upon the land by destroy the reverence due to sovereign authority it be the quality of patriotism to be jealous and watchful to observe all secret machination and to see publick danger at a distance the true lover of he country be ready to communicate he fear and to sound the alarm whenever he perceive the approach of mischief but he sound no alarm when there be no enemy he never terrify he countryman till he be terrify himself the patriotism therefore may be justly doubt of he who profess to be disturb by incredibility who tell that the last peace be obtain by bribe the princess of wale that the king be grasp at arbitrary power and that because the french in the new conquest enjoy they own law there be a design at court of abolish in england the trial by jury still less do the true patriot circulate opinion which he know to be false no man who love he country fill the nation with clamorous complaint that the protestant religion be in danger because popery be establish in the extensive province of quebec a falsehood so open and shameless that it can need no confutation among those who know that of which it be almost impossible for the most unenlightened zealot to be ignorant : that quebec be on the other side of the atlantick at too great a distance to do much good or harm to the european world : that the inhabitant be french be always papist who be certainly more dangerous as enemy than as subject : that though the province be wide the people be few probably not so many as may be find in one of the larger english county : that persecution be not more virtuous in a protestant than a papist and that while we blame lewi the fourteenth for he dragoon and he galley we ought when power come into we hand to use it with greater equity : that when canada with its inhabitant be yield the free enjoyment of they religion be stipulate a condition of which king william who be no propagator of popery give a example nearer home at the surrender of limerick : that in a age where every mouth be open for _ liberty of conscience _ it be equitable to show some regard to the conscience of a papist who may be suppose like other man to think himself safest in he own religion and that those at least who enjoy a toleration ought not to deny it to we new subject if liberty of conscience be a natural right we have no power to withhold it if it be a indulgence it may be allow to papist while it be not deny to other sect a patriot be necessarily and invariably a lover of the people but even this mark may sometimes deceive we the people be a very heterogeneous and confused mass of the wealthy and the poor the wise and the foolish the good and the bad before we confer on a man who caress the people the title of patriot we must examine to what part of the people he direct he notice it be proverbially say that he who dissemble he own character may be know by that of he companion if the candidate of patriotism endeavor to infuse right opinion into the higher rank and by they influence to regulate the lower if he consort chiefly with the wise the temperate the regular and the virtuous he love of the people may be rational and honest but if he first or principal application be to the indigent who be always inflammable to the weak who be naturally suspicious to the ignorant who be easily mislead and to the profligate who have no hope but from mischief and confusion let he love of the people be no longer boast no man can reasonably be think a lover of he country for roast a ox or burn a boot or attend the meeting at mile-end or register he name in the lumber troop he may among the drunkard be a hearty fellow and among sober handicraftsman a free-spoken gentleman but he must have some better distinction before he be a patriot a patriot be always ready to countenance the just claim and animate the reasonable hope of the people he remind they frequently of they rights and stimulate they to resent encroachment and to multiply security but all this may be do in appearance without real patriotism he that raise false hope to serve a present purpose only make a way for disappointment and discontent he who promise to endeavor what he know he endeavor unable to effect mean only to delude he follower by a empty clamor of ineffectual zeal a true patriot be no lavish promiser : he undertake not to shorten parliament to repeal law or to change the mode of representation transmit by we ancestor he know that futurity be not in he power and that all time be not alike favourable to change much less do he make a vague and indefinite promise of obey the mandate of he constituent he know the prejudice of faction and the inconstancy of the multitude he would first inquire how the opinion of he constituent shall be take popular instruction be commonly the work not of the wise and steady but the violent and rash meeting hold for direct representative be seldom attend but by the idle and the dissolute and he be not without suspicion that of he constituent as of other number of man the smaller part may often be the wiser he consider himself as depute to promote the publick good and to preserve he constituent with the rest of he countryman not only from be hurt by other but from hurt themselves the common mark of patriotism have be examine and show to be such as artifice may counterfeit or folly misapply it can not be improper to consider whether there be not some characteristical mode of speak or act which may prove a man to be not a patriot in this inquiry perhaps clearer evidence may be discover and firmer persuasion attain for it be commonly easier to know what be wrong than what be right to find what we should avoid than what we should pursue as war be one of the heaviest of national evil a calamity in which every species of misery be involve as it set the general safety to hazard suspend commerce and desolate the country as it expose great number to hardship danger captivity and death no man who desire the publick prosperity will inflame general resentment by aggravate minute injury or enforce disputable rights of little importance it may therefore be safely pronounce that those man be no patriot who when the national honor be vindicate in the sight of europe and the spaniard have invade what they call they own have shrink to a disavowal of they attempt and a relaxation of they claim would still have instigate we to a war for a bleak and barren spot in the magellanick ocean of which no use could be make unless it be a place of exile for the hypocrite of patriotism yet let it not be forget that by the howling violence of patriotick rage the nation be for a time exasperated to such madness that for a barren rock under a stormy sky we might have now be fight and die have not we competitor be wiser than ourselves and those who be now court the favor of the people by noisy profession of publick spirit would while they be count the profit of they artifice have enjoy the patriotick pleasure of hearing sometimes that thousand have be slaughter in a battle and sometimes that a navy have be dispeople by poison air and corrupted food he that wish to see he country rob of its rights can not be a patriot that man therefore be no patriot who justify the ridiculous claim of american usurpation who endeavor to deprive the nation of its natural and lawful authority over its own colony those colony which be settle under english protection be constitute by a english charter and have be defend by english arm to suppose that by send out a colony the nation establish a independent power that when by indulgence and favor emigrant be become rich they shall not contribute to they own defense but at they own pleasure and that they shall not be include like million of they fellow-subject in the general system of representation involve such a accumulation of absurdity as nothing but the show of patriotism could palliate he that accept protection stipulate obedience we have always protect the american we may therefore subject they to government the less be include in the greater that power which can take away life may seize upon property the parliament may enact for america a law of capital punishment it may therefore establish a mode and proportion of taxation but there be some who lament the state of the poor bostonian because they can not all be suppose to have commit act of rebellion yet all be involve in the penalty impose this they say be to violate the first rule of justice by condemn the innocent to suffer with the guilty this deserve some notice as it seem dictate by equity and humanity however it may raise contempt by the ignorance which it betray of the state of man and the system of thing that the innocent should be confound with the guilty be undoubtedly a evil but it be a evil which no care or caution can prevent national crime require national punishment of which many must necessarily have they part who have not incur they by personal guilt if rebel should fortify a town the cannon of lawful authority will endanger equally the harmless burgher and the criminal garrison in some case those suffer most who be least intend to be hurt if the french in the late war have take a english city and permit the native to keep they dwelling how could it have be recover but by the slaughter of we friend a bomb might as well destroy a englishman as a frenchman and by famine we know that the inhabitant would be the first that should perish this infliction of promiscuous evil may therefore be lament but can not be blame the power of lawful government must be maintain and the misery which rebellion produce can be charge only on the rebel that man likewise be not a patriot who deny he governor they due praise and who conceal from the people the benefit which they receive those therefore can lay no claim to this illustrious appellation who impute want of publick spirit to the late parliament a assembly of man whom notwithstanding some fluctuation of counsel and some weakness of agency the nation must always remember with gratitude since it be indebted to they for a very ample concession in the resignation of protection and a wise and honest attempt to improve the constitution in the new judicature institute for the trial of election the right of protection which might be necessary when it be first claim and be very consistent with that liberality of immunity in which the feudal constitution delighted be by its nature liable to abuse and have in reality be sometimes misapply to the evasion of the law and the defeat of justice the evil be perhaps not adequate to the clamor nor be it very certain that the possible good of this privilege be not more than equal to the possible evil it be however plain that whether they give any thing or not to the publick they at least lose something from themselves they divest they dignity of a very splendid distinction and show that they be more willing than they predecessor to stand on a level with they fellow-subject the new mode of try election if it be find effectual will diffuse its consequence further than seem yet to be foresee it be i believe generally consider as advantageous only to those who claim seat in parliament but if to choose representative be one of the most valuable rights of englishman every voter must consider that law as add to he happiness which make he suffrage efficacious since it be vain to choose while the election could be control by any other power with what imperious contempt of ancient rights and what audaciousness of arbitrary authority former parliament have judge the dispute about election it be not necessary to relate the claim of a candidate and the right of elector be say scarcely to have be even in appearance refer to conscience but to have be decide by party by passion by prejudice or by frolick to have friend in the borough be of little use to he who want friend in the house a pretence be easily find to evade a majority and the seat be at last he that be choose not by he elector but he fellow-senator thus the nation be insult with a mock election and the parliament be fill with spurious representative one of the most important claim that of right to sit in the supreme council of the kingdom be debate in jest and no man could be confident of success from the justice of he cause a dispute election be now try with the same scrupulousness and solemnity as any other title the candidate that have deserve well of he neighbor may now be certain of enjoy the effect of they approbation and the elector who have vote honestly for known merit may be certain that he have not vote in vain such be the parliament which some of those who be now aspire to sit in another have teach the rabble to consider as a unlawful convention of man worthless venal and prostitute slave of the court and tyrant of the people that the next house of common may act upon the principle of the last with more constancy and higher spirit must be the wish of all who wish well to the publick and it be surely not too much to expect that the nation will recover from its delusion and unite in a general abhorrence of those who by deceive the credulous with fictitious mischief overbear the weak by audacity of falsehood by appeal to the judgment of ignorance and flattering the vanity of meanness by slander honesty and insulting dignity have gather round they whatever the kingdom can supply of base and gross and profligate and raise by merit to this bad eminence arrogate to themselves the name of patriot taxation no tyranny a answer -lrb- 31 -rrb- to the resolution and address of the american congress 1775 in all the part of human knowledge whether terminate in science merely speculative or operating upon life private or civil be admit some fundamental principle or common axiom which being-generally receive be little doubt and be little doubt have be rarely prove of these gratuitous and acknowledge truth it be often the fate to become less evident by endeavor to explain they however necessary such endeavor may be make by the misapprehension of absurdity or the sophistry of interest it be difficult to prove the principle of science because notion can not always be find more intelligible than those which be question it be difficult to prove the principle of practice because they have for the most part not be discover by investigation but obtrude by experience and the demonstrator will find after a operose deduction that he have be try to make that see which can be only feel of this kind be the position that the supreme power of every community have the right of require from all its subject such contribution as be necessary to the publick safety or publick prosperity which be consider by all mankind as comprise the primary and essential condition of all political society till it become dispute by those zealot of anarchy who have deny to the parliament of britain the right of tax the american colony in favor of this exemption of the american from the authority of they lawful sovereign and the dominion of they mother-country very loud clamor have be raise and many wild assertion advance which by such as borrow they opinion from the reign fashion have be admit as argument and what be strange though they tendency be to lessen english honor and english power have be hear by englishman with a wish to find they true passion have in its first violence controlled interest as the eddy for awhile run against the stream to be prejudice be always to be weak yet there be prejudice so near to laudable that they have be often praise and be always pardon to love they country have be consider as virtue in man whose love could not be otherwise than blind because they preference be make without a comparison but it have never be my fortune to find either in ancient or modern writer any honorable mention of those who have with equal blindness hate they country these antipatriotick prejudice be the abortion of folly impregnate by faction which be produce against the standing order of nature have not strength sufficient for long life they be bear only to scream and perish and leave those to contempt or detestation whose kindness be employ to nurse they into mischief to perplex the opinion of the publick many artifice have be use which as usually happen when falsehood be to be maintain by fraud lose they force by counteract one another the nation be sometimes to be mollify by a tender tale of man who flee from tyranny to rock and desert and be persuade to lose all claim of justice and all sense of dignity in compassion for a harmless people who have work hard for bread in a wild country and obtain by the slow progression of manual industry the accommodation of life be now invade by unprecedented oppression and plunder of they property by the harpy of taxation we be tell how they industry be obstruct by unnatural restraint and they trade confine by rigorous prohibition how they be forbid to enjoy the product of they own soil to manufacture the material which nature spread before they or to carry they own goods to the nearest market and surely the generosity of english virtue will never heap new weight upon those that be already overladen will never delight in that dominion which can not be exercise but by cruelty and outrage but while we be melting in silent sorrow and in the transport of delirious pity drop both the sword and balance from we hand another friend of the american think it better to awaken another passion and try to alarm we interest or excite we veneration by account of they greatness and they opulence of the fertility of they land and the splendor of they town we then begin to consider the question with more evenness of mind be ready to conclude that those restriction be not very oppressive which have be find consistent with this speedy growth of prosperity and begin to think it reasonable that they who thus flourish under the protection of we government should contribute something towards its expense but we be soon tell that the american however wealthy can not be tax that they be the descendant of man who leave all for liberty and that they have constantly preserve the principle and stubbornness of they progenitor that they be too obstinate for persuasion and too powerful for constraint that they will laugh at argument and defeat violence that the continent of north america contain three million not of man merely but of whig of whig fierce for liberty and disdainful of dominion that they multiply with the fecundity of they own rattlesnake so that every quarter of a century double they number man accustom to think themselves master do not love to be threaten this talk be i hope commonly throw away or raise passion different from those which it be intend to excite instead of terrifying the english hearer to tame acquiescence it dispose he to hasten the experiment of bend obstinacy before it be become yet more obdurate and convince he that it be necessary to attack a nation thus prolifick while we may yet hope to prevail when he be tell through what extent of territory we must travel to subdue they he recollect how far a few year ago we travel in they defense when it be urge that they will shoot up like the hydra he naturally consider how the hydra be destroy nothing deject a trader like the interruption of he profit a commercial people however magnanimous shrink at the thought of decline traffick and a unfavourable balance the effect of this terror have be try we have be stun with the importance of we american commerce and hear of merchant with warehouse that be never to be empty and of manufacturer starve for want of work that we commerce with america be profitable however less than ostentatious or deceitful estimate have make it and that it be we interest to preserve it have never be deny but surely it will most effectually be preserve by be keep always in we own power concession may promote it for a moment but superiority only can ensure its continuance there will always be a part and always a very large part of every community that have no care but for themselves and whose care for themselves reach little further than impatience of immediate pain and eagerness for the nearest good the blind be say to feel with peculiar nicety they who look but little into futurity have perhaps the quickest sensation of the present a merchant 's desire be not of glory but of gain not of publick wealth but of private emolument he be therefore rarely to be consult about war and peace or any design of wide extent and distant consequence yet this like other general character will sometimes fail the trader of birmingham have rescue themselves from all imputation of narrow selfishness by a manly recommendation to parliament of the rights and dignity of they native country to these man i do not intend to ascribe a absurd and enthusiastick contempt of interest but to give they the rational and just praise of distinguish real from seem good of be able to see through the cloud of interpose difficulty to the lasting and solid happiness of victory and settlement lest all these topick of persuasion should fail the greater actor of patriotism have try another in which terror and pity be happily combine not without a proper superaddition of that admiration which latter age have bring into the drama the hero of boston he tell we if the stamp act have not be repeal would have leave they town they port and they trade have resign the splendor of opulence and quit the delight of neighborhood to disperse themselves over the country where they would till the ground and fish in the river and range the mountain and be free these surely be brave word if the mere sound of freedom can operate thus powerfully let no man hereafter doubt the story of the pied piper the removal of the people of boston into the country seem even to the congress not only difficult in its execution but important in its consequence the difficulty of execution be best know to the bostonian themselves the consequence alas will only be that they will leave good house to wiser man yet before they quit the comfort of a warm home for the sound something which they think better he can not be think they enemy who advise they to consider well whether they shall find it by turn fisherman or hunter woodman or shepherd they may become wild but it be not so easy to conceive they free for who can be more a slave than he that be drive by force from the comfort of life be compel to leave he house to a casual comer and whatever he do or wherever he wander find every moment some new testimony of he own subjection if choice of evil be freedom the felon in the galley have he option of labor or of stripe the bostonian may quit he house to starve in the field he dog may refuse to set and smart under the lash and they may then congratulate each other upon the smile of liberty profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight to treat such design as serious would be to think too contemptuously of bostonian understanding the artifice indeed be not new : the blusterer who threaten in vain to destroy he opponent have sometimes obtain he end by make it believe that he would hang himself but terror and pity be not the only means by which the taxation of the american be oppose there be those who profess to use they only as auxiliary to reason and justice who tell we that to tax the colony be usurpation and oppression a invasion of natural and legal rights and a violation of those principle which support the constitution of english government this question be of great importance that the american be able to bear taxation be indubitable that they refusal may be overrule be highly probable but power be no sufficient evidence of truth let we examine we own claim and the objection of the recusant with caution proportion to the event of the decision which must convict one part of robbery or the other of rebellion a tax be a payment exact by authority from part of the community for the benefit of the whole from whom and in what proportion such payment shall be require and to what use it shall be apply those only be to judge to whom government be intrust in the british dominion tax be apportion levy and appropriate by the state assemble in parliament of every empire all the subordinate community be liable to taxation because they all share the benefit of government and therefore ought all to furnish they proportion of the expense this the american have never openly deny that it be they duty to pay the cost of they own safety they seem to admit nor do they refuse they contribution to the exigency whatever they may be of the british empire but they make this participation of the publick burden a duty of very uncertain extent and imperfect obligation a duty temporary occasional and elective of which they reserve to themselves the right of settle the degree the time and the duration of judge when it may be require and when it have be perform they allow to the supreme power nothing more than the liberty of notify to they its demand or its necessity of this notification they profess to think for themselves how far it shall influence they counsel and of the necessity allege how far they shall endeavor to relieve they they assume the exclusive power of settle not only the mode but the quantity of this payment they be ready to cooperate with all the other dominion of the king but they will cooperate by no means which they do not like and at no greater charge than they be willing to bear this claim wild as it may seem this claim which suppose dominion without authority and subject without subordination have find among the libertine of policy many clamorous and hardy vindicator the law of nature the rights of humanity the faith of charter the danger of liberty the encroachment of usurpation have be thunder in we ear sometimes by interested faction and sometimes by honest stupidity it be say by fontenelle that if twenty philosopher shall resolutely deny that the presence of the sun make the day he will not despair but whole nation may adopt the opinion so many political dogmatist have deny to the mother-country the power of tax the colony and have enforce they denial with so much violence of outcry that they sect be already very numerous and the publick voice suspend its decision in moral and political question the contest between interest and justice have be often tedious and often fierce but perhaps it never happen before that justice find much opposition with interest on she side for the satisfaction of this inquiry it be necessary to consider how a colony be constitute what be the term of migration as dictate by nature or settle by compact and what social or political rights the man lose or acquire that leave he country to establish himself hi a distant plantation of two mode of migration the history of mankind inform we and so far as i can yet discover of two only in country where life be yet unadjusted and policy unform it sometimes happen that by the dissension of head of family by the ambition of daring adventurer by some accidental pressure of distress or by the mere discontent of idleness one part of the community break off from the rest and number greater or smaller forsake they habitation put themselves under the command of some favorite of fortune and with or without the consent of they countryman or governor go out to see what better region they could occupy and in what place by conquest or by treaty they could gain a habitation son of enterprise like these who commit to they own sword they hope and they life when they leave they country become another nation with design and prospects and interest of they own they look back no more to they former home they expect no help from those whom they have leave behind if they conquer they conquer for themselves if they be destroy they be not by any other power either lament or revenge of this kind seem to have be all the migration of the early world whether historical or fabulous and of this kind be the eruption of those nation which from the north invade the roman empire and fill europe with new sovereignty but when by the gradual admission of wiser law and gentler manners society become more compacted and better regulate it be find that the power of every people consist in union produce by one common interest and operating in joint effort and consistent counsel from this time independence perceptibly waste away no part of the nation be permit to act for itself all now have the same enemy and the same friend the government protect individual and individual be require to refer they design to the prosperity of the government by this principle it be that state be form and consolidated every man be teach to consider he own happiness as combine with the publick prosperity and to think himself great and powerful in proportion to the greatness and power of he governor have the western continent be discover between the fourth and tenth century when all the northen world be in motion and have navigation be at that time sufficiently advance to make so long a passage easily practicable there be little reason for doubt but the intumescence of nation would have find its vent like all other expansive violence where there be least resistance and that hun and vandal instead of fight they way to the south of europe would have go by thousand and by myriad under they several chief to take possession of region smile with pleasure and wave with fertility from which the naked inhabitant be unable to repel they every expedition would in those day of laxity have produce a distinct and independent state the scandinavian hero might have divide the country among they and have spread the feudal subdivision of regality from hudson 's bay to the pacifick ocean but columbus come five or six hundred year too late for the candidate of sovereignty when he form he project of discovery the fluctuation of military turbulence have subside and europe begin to regain a settled form by established government and regular subordination no man could any longer erect himself into a chieftain and lead out he fellow-subject by he own authority to plunder or to war he that commit any act of hostility by land or sea without the commission of some acknowledged sovereign be consider by all mankind as a robber or pirate name which be now of little credit and of which therefore no man be ambitious columbus in a remoter time would have find he way to some discontented lord or some younger brother of a petty sovereign who would have take fire at he proposal and have quickly kindle with equal heat a troop of follower : they would have build ship or have seize they and have wander with he at all adventure as far as they could keep hope in they company but the age be now past of vagrant excursion and fortuitous hostility he be under the necessity of travel from court to court scorn and repulse as a wild projector a idle promiser of kingdom in the cloud nor have any part of the world yet have reason to rejoice that he find at last reception and employment in the same year in a year hitherto disastrous to mankind by the portuguese be discover the passage of the indy and by the spaniard the coast of america the nation of europe be fire with boundless expectation and the discoverer pursue they enterprise make conquest in both hemisphere of wide extent but the adventurer be not contented with plunder : though they take gold and silver to themselves they seize island and kingdom in the name of they sovereign when a new region be gain a governor be appoint by that power which have give the commission to the conqueror nor have i meet with any european but stukely of london that form a design of exalt himself in the newly find country to independent dominion to secure a conquest it be always necessary to plant a colony and territory thus occupy and settle be rightly consider as mere extension or process of empire as ramification which by the circulation of one publick interest communicate with the original source of dominion and which be keep flourish and spread by the radical vigor of the mother-country the colony of england differ no otherwise from those of other nation than as the english constitution differ from theirs all government be ultimately and essentially absolute but subordinate society may have more immunity or individual greater liberty as the operation of government be differently conduct a englishman in the common course of life and action feel no restraint a english colony have very liberal power of regulate its own manners and adjust its own affair but a english individual may by the supreme authority be deprive of liberty and a colony divest of its power for reason of which that authority be the only judge in sovereignty there be no gradation there may be limit royalty there may be limit consulship but there can be no limited government there must in every society be some power or other from which there be no appeal which admit no restriction which pervade the whole mass of the community regulate and adjust all subordination enact law or repeal they erect or annul judicature extend or contract privilege exempt itself from question or control and bound only by physical necessity by this power wherever it subsist all legislation and jurisdiction be animated and maintain from this all legal rights be emanation which whether equitably or not may be legally recall it be not infallible for it may do wrong but it be irresistible for it can be resist only by rebellion by a act which make it questionable what shall be thenceforward the supreme power a english colony be a number of person to whom the king grant a charter permit they to settle in some distant country and enable they to constitute a corporation enjoy such power as the charter grant to be administer in such form as the charter prescribe as a corporation they make law for themselves but as a corporation subsist by a grant from higher authority to the control of that authority they continue subject as man be place at a greater distance from the supreme council of the kingdom they must be intrust with ampler liberty of regulate they conduct by they own wisdom as they be more secluded from easy recourse to national judicature they must be more extensively commission to pass judgment on each other for this reason we more important and opulent colony see the appearance and feel the effect of a regular legislature which in some place have act so long with unquestioned authority that it have forget whence that authority be originally derive to they charter the colony owe like other corporation they political existence the solemnity of legislation the administration of justice the security of property be all bestow upon they by the royal grant without they charter there would be no power among they by which any law could be make or duty enjoin any debt recover or criminal punish a charter be a grant of certain power or privilege give to a part of the community for the advantage of the whole and be therefore liable by its nature to change or to revocation every act of government aim at publick good a charter which experience have show to be detrimental to the nation be to be repeal because general prosperity must always be prefer to particular interest if a charter be use to evil purpose it be forfeit as the weapon be take away which be injuriously employ the charter therefore by which provincial government be constitute may be always legally and where it be either inconvenient in its nature or misapply in its use may be equitably repeal by such repeal the whole fabrick of subordination be immediately destroy and the constitution sink at once into a chaos the society be dissolve into a tumult of individual without authority to command or obligation to obey without any punishment of wrong but by personal resentment or any protection of right but by the hand of the possessor a colony be to the mother-country as a member to the body derive its action and its strength from the general principle of vitality receive from the body and communicate to it all the benefit and evil of health and disease liable in dangerous malady to sharp application of which the body however must partake the pain and expose if incurably taint to amputation by which the body likewise will be mutilate the mother-country always consider the colony thus connect as part of itself the prosperity or unhappiness of either be the prosperity or unhappiness of both not perhaps of both in the same degree for the body may subsist though less commodiously without a limb but the limb must perish if it be part from the body we colony therefore however distant have be hitherto treat as constituent part of the british empire the inhabitant incorporate by english charter be entitle to all the rights of englishman they be govern by english law entitle to english dignity regulate by english counsel and protect by english arm and it seem to follow by consequence not easily avoid that they be subject to english government and chargeable by english taxation to he that consider the nature the original the progress and the constitution of the colony who remember that the first discoverer have commission from the crown that the first settler owe to a charter they civil form and regular magistracy and that all personal immunity and legal security by which the condition of the subject have be from time to time improve have be extend to the colonist it will not be doubt but the parliament of england have a right to bind they by statute and to bind they in all case whatsoever and have therefore a natural and constitutional power of lay upon they any tax or impost whether external or internal upon the product of land or the manufacture of industry in the exigency of war or in the time of profound peace for the defense of america for the purpose of raise a revenue or for any other end beneficial to the empire there be some and those not inconsiderable for number nor contemptible for knowledge who except the power of taxation from the general dominion of parliament and hold that whatever degress of obedience may be exact or whatever authority may be exercise in other act of government there be still reverence to be pay to money and that legislation pass its limit when it violate the purse of this exception which by a head not fully impregnate with politick be not easily comprehend it be allege as a unanswerable reason that the colony send no representative to the house of common it be say the american advocate the natural distinction of a freeman and the legal privilege of a englishman that he be able to call he possession he own that he can sit secure in the enjoyment of inheritance or acquisition that he house be fortify by the law and that nothing can be take from he but by he own consent this consent be give for every man by he representative in parliament the american unrepresented can not consent to english taxation as a corporation and they will not consent as individual of this argument it have be observe by more than one that its force extend equally to all other law for a freeman be not to be expose to punishment or be call to any onerous service but by he own consent the congress have extract a position from the fanciful montesquieu that in a free state every man be a free agent ought to be concern in he own government whatever be true of taxation be true of every other law that he who be bind by it without he consent be not free for he be not concern in he own government he that deny the english parliament the right of taxation deny it likewise the right of make any other law civil or criminal yet this power over the colony be never yet dispute by themselves they have always admit statute for the punishment of offence and for the redress or prevention of inconveniency and the reception of any law draw after it by a chain which can not be break the unwelcome necessity of submit to taxation that a freeman be govern by himself or by law to which he have consent be a position of mighty sound but every man that utter it with whatever confidence and every man that hear it with whatever acquiescence if consent be suppose to imply the power of refusal feel it to be false we virtually and implicitly allow the institution of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection in wide extended dominion though power have be diffuse with the most even hand yet a very small part of the people be either primarily or secondarily consult in legislation the business of the publick must be do by delegation the choice of delegate be make by a select number and those who be not elector stand idle and helpless spectator of the commonweal wholly unconcerned in the government of themselves of the elector the hap be but little better they be often far from unanimity in they choice and where the number approach to equality almost half must be govern not only without but against they choice how any man can have consent to institution establish in distant age it will be difficult to explain in the most favorite residence of liberty the consent of individual be merely passive a tacit admission in every community of the term which that community grant and require as all be bear the subject of some state or other we may be say to have be all bear consent to some system of government other consent than this the condition of civil life do not allow it be the unmeaning clamor of the pedant of policy the delirious dream of republican fanaticism but hear ye son and daughter of liberty the sound which the wind be waft from the western continent the american be tell one another what if we may judge from they noisy triumph they have but lately discover and what yet be a very important truth : that they be entitle to life liberty and property and that they have never cede to any sovereign power whatever a right to dispose of either without they consent while this resolution stand alone the american be free from singularity of opinion they wit have not yet betray they to heresy while they speak as the naked son of nature they claim but what be claim by other man and have withhold nothing but what all withhold they be here upon firm ground behind entrenchment which never can be force humanity be very uniform the american have this resemblance to european that they do not always know when they be well they soon quit the fortress that could neither have be ruin by sophistry nor batter by declamation they next resolution declare that they ancestor who first settle the colony be at the time of they emigration from the mother-country entitle to all the rights liberty and immunity of free and natural-born subject within the realm of england this likewise be true but when this be grant they boast of original rights be at a end they be no longer in a state of nature these lord of themselves these king of I these demigod of independence sink down to colonist govern by a charter if they ancestor be subject they acknowledge a sovereign if they have a right to english privilege they be accountable to english law and what must grieve the lover of liberty to discover have cede to the king and parliament whether the right or not at least the power of dispose without they consent of they life liberty and property it therefore be require of they to prove that the parliament ever cede to they a dispensation from that obedience which they owe as natural-born subject or any degree of independence or immunity not enjoy by other englishman they say that by such emigration they by no means forfeit surrender or lose any of those rights but that they be and they descendant now be entitle to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of they as they local and other circumstance enable they to exercise and enjoy that they who form a settlement by a lawful charter have commit no crime forfeit no privilege will be readily confess but what they do not forfeit by any judicial sentence they may lose by natural effect as man can be but in one place at once he can not have the advantage of multiply residence he that will enjoy the brightness of sunshine must quit the coolness of the shade he who go voluntarily to america can not complain of lose what he leave in europe he perhaps have a right to vote for a knight or burgess by cross the atlantick he have not nullify he right but he have make its exertion no longer possible -lrb- 32 -rrb- by he own choice he have leave a country where he have a vote and little property for another where he have great property but no vote but as this preference be deliberate and unconstrained he be still concern in the government of himself he have reduce himself from a voter to one of the innumerable multitude that have no vote he have truly cede he right but he still be govern by he own consent because he have consent to throw he atom of interest into the general mass of the community of the consequence of he own act he have no cause to complain he have choose or intend to choose the greater good he be represent as himself desire in the general representation but the privilege of a american scorn the limit of place they be part of himself and can not be lose by departure from he country they float in the air or glide under the ocean : dori amara suam non intermisceat undam a planter wherever he settle be not only a freeman but a legislator : ubus imperator ibus roma as the english colonist be not represent in the british parliament they be entitle to a free and exclusive power of legislation in they several legislature in all case of taxation and internal polity subject only to the negative of the sovereign in such manner as have be heretofore use and accustom we cheerfully consent to the operation of such act of the british parliament as be bona fide restrain to the regulation of we external commerce -- exclude every idea of taxation internal or external for raise a revenue on the subject of america without they consent they reason for this claim be that the foundation of english liberty and of all government be a right in the people to participate in they legislative council they inherit they say from they ancestor the right which they ancestor possess of enjoy all the privilege of englishman that they inherit the right of they ancestor be allow but they can inherit no more they ancestor leave a country where the representative of the people be elect by man particularly qualify and where those who want qualification or who do not use they be bind by the decision of man whom they have not depute the colonist be the descendant of man who either have no vote in election or who voluntarily resign they for something in they opinion of more estimation they have therefore exactly what they ancestor leave they not a vote in make law or in constitute legislator but the happiness of be protect by law and the duty of obey it what they ancestor do not carry with they neither they nor they descendant have since acquire they have not by abandon they part in one legislature obtain the power of constitute another exclusive and independent any more than the multitude who be now debar from vote have a right to erect a separate parliament for themselves man be wrong for want of sense but they be wrong by half for want of spirit since the american have discover that they can make a parliament whence come it that they do not think themselves equally empower to make a king if they be subject whose government be constitute by a charter they can form no body of independent legislature if they rights be inherent and underived they may by they own suffrage encircle with a diadem the brow of mr cush it be further declare by the congress of philadelphium that he majesty 's colony be entitle to all the privilege and immunity grant and confirm to they by royal charter or secure to they by they several code of provincial law the first clause of this resolution be easily understand and will be readily admit to all the privilege which a charter can convey they be by a royal charter evidently entitle the second clause be of greater difficulty for how can a provincial law secure privilege or immunity to a province provincial law may grant to certain individual of the province the enjoyment of gainful or a immunity from onerous office they may operate upon the people to whom they relate but no province can confer provincial privilege on itself they may have a right to all which the king have give they but it be a conceit of the other hemisphere that man have a right to all which they have give to themselves a corporation be consider in law as a individual and can no more extend its own immunity than a man can by he own choice assume dignity or title the legislature of a colony -lrb- let not the comparison be too much disdain -rrb- be only the vestry of a larger parish which may lay a cess on the inhabitant and enforce the payment but can extend no influence beyond its own district must modify its particular regulation by the general law and whatever may be its internal expense be still liable to tax lay by superior authority the charter give to different province be different and no general right can be extract from they the charter of pennsylvanium where this congress of anarchy have be impudently hold contain a clause admit in express term taxation by the parliament if in the other charter no such reserve be make it must have be omit as not necessary because it be imply in the nature of subordinate government they who be subject to law be liable to tax if any such immunity have be grant it be still revocable by the legislature and ought to be revoke as contrary to the publick good which be in every charter ultimately intend suppose it true that any such exemption be contain in the charter of maryland it can be plead only by the marylander it be of no use for any other province and with regard even to they must have be consider as one of the grant in which the king have be deceive and annul as mischievous to the publick by sacrifice to one little settlement the general interest of the empire as infringe the system of dominion and violate the compact of government but dr tucker have show that even this charter promise no exemption from parliamentary tax in the controversy agitate about the beginning of this century whether the english law could bind ireland davenant who defend against molyneux the claim of england consider it as necessary to prove nothing more than that the present irish must be deem a colony the necessary connexion of representative with tax seem to have sink deep into many of those mind that admit sound without they mean we nation be represent in parliament by a assembly as numerous as can well consist with order and despatch choose by person so differently qualify in different place that the mode of choice seem to be for the most part form by chance and settle by custom of individual far the greater part have no vote and of the voter few have any personal knowledge of he to whom they intrust they liberty and fortune yet this representation have the whole effect expect or desire that of spread so wide the care of general interest and the participation of publick counsel that the advantage or corruption of particular man can seldom operate with much injury to the publick for this reason many populous and opulent town neither enjoy nor desire particular representative : they be include in the general scheme of publick administration and can not suffer but with the rest of the empire it be urge that the american have not the same security and that a british legislator may wanton with they property yet if it be true that they wealth be we wealth and that they ruin will be we ruin the parliament have the same interest in attend to they as to any other part of the nation the reason why we place any confidence in we representative be that they must share in the good or evil which they counsel shall produce they share be indeed commonly consequential and remote but it be not often possible that any immediate advantage can be extend to such number as may prevail against it we be therefore as secure against intentional depravation of government as human wisdom can make we and upon this security the american may venture to repose it be say by the old member who have write a appeal against the tax that as the produce of american labor be spend in british manufacture the balance of trade be greatly against they whatever you take directly in tax be in effect take from you own commerce if the minister seize the money with which the american should pay he debt and come to market the merchant can not expect he as a customer nor can the debt already contract be pay -- suppose we obtain from america a million instead of one hundred thousand pound it would be supply one personal exigence by the future ruin of we commerce part of this be true but the old member seem not to perceive that if he brethren of the legislature know this as well as himself the american be in no danger of oppression since by man commonly provident they must be so tax as that we may not lose one way what we gain another the same old member have discover that the judge formerly think it illegal to tax ireland and declare that no case can be more alike than those of ireland and america yet the judge whom he quote have mention a difference ireland they say have a parliament of its own when any colony have a independent parliament acknowledge by the parliament of britain the case will differ less yet by the sixth of george the first chapter fifth the act of the british parliament bind ireland it be urge that when wale durham and chester be divest of they particular privilege or ancient government and reduce to the state of english county they have representative assign they to those from whom something have be take something in return might properly be give to the american they charter be leave as they be nor have they lose any thing except that of which they sedition have deprive they if they be to be represent in parliament something would be grant though nothing be withdraw the inhabitant of chester durham and wale be invite to exchange they peculiar institution for the power of voting which they want before the american have voluntarily resign the power of vote to live in distant and separate government and what they have voluntarily quit they have no right to claim it must always be remember that they be represent by the same virtual representation as the greater part of englishman and that if by change of place they have less share in the legislature than be proportionate to they opulence they by they removal gain that opulence and have originally and have now they choice of a vote at home or riches at a distance we be tell what appear to the old member and to other a position that must drive we into inextricable absurdity : that we have either no right or the sole right of tax the colony the meaning be that if we can tax they they can not tax themselves and that if they can tax themselves we can not tax they we answer with very little hesitation that for the general use of the empire we have the sole right of tax they if they have contribute any thing in they own assembly what they contribute be not pay but give it be not a tax or tribute but a present yet they have the natural and legal power of levy money on themselves for provincial purpose of provide for they own expense at they own discretion let not this be think new or strange it be the state of every parish in the kingdom the friend of the american be of different opinion some think that be unrepresented they ought to tax themselves and other that they ought to have representative in the british parliament if they be to tax themselves what power be to remain in the supreme legislature that they must settle they own mode of levy they money be suppose may the british parliament tell they how much they shall contribute if the sum may be prescribe they will return few thanks for the power of raise it if they be at liberty to grant or to deny they be no longer subject if they be to be represent what number of these western orator be to be admit this i suppose the parliament must settle yet if man have a natural and unalienable right to be represent who shall determine the number of they delegate let we however suppose they to send twenty-three half as many as the kingdom of scotland what will this representation avail they to pay tax will be still a grievance the love of money will not be lessen nor the power of get it increase whither will this necessity of representation drive we be every petty settlement to be out of the reach of government till it have send a senator to parliament or may two of they or a greater number be force to unite in a single deputation what at last be the difference between he that be tax by compulsion without representation and he that be represent by compulsion in order to be tax for many reign the house of common be in a state of fluctuation : new burgess be add from time to time without any reason now to be discover but the number have be fix for more than a century and a half and the king 's power of increase it have be question it will hardly be think fit to new-model the constitution in favor of the planter who as they grow rich may buy estate in england and without any innovation effectually represent they native colony the friend of the american indeed ask for they what they do not ask for themselves this inestimable right of representation they have never solicit they mean not to exchange solid money for such airy honor they say and say willingly that they can not conveniently be represent because they inference be that they can not be tax they be too remote to share the general government and therefore claim the privilege of govern themselves of the principle contain in the resolution of the congress however wild indefinite and obscure such have be the influence upon american understanding that from new england to south carolina there be form a general combination of all the province against they mother-country the madness of independence have spread from colony to colony till order be lose and government despise and all be fill with misrule uproar violence and confusion to be quiet be disaffection to be loyal be treason the congress of philadelphium a assembly convene by its own authority have promulgate a declaration in compliance with which the communication between britain and the greatest part of north america be now suspend they cease to admit the importation of english goods in December 1774 and determine to permit the exportation of they own no longer than to November 1775 this might seem enough but they have do more : they have declare that they shall treat all as enemy who do not concur with they in disaffection and perverseness and that they will trade with none that shall trade with britain they threaten to stigmatize in they gazette those who shall consume the product or merchandise of they mother-country and be now search suspect house for prohibit goods these hostile declaration they profess themselves ready to maintain by force they have arm the militia of they province and seize the publick store of ammunition they be therefore no longer subject since they refuse the law of they sovereign and in defense of that refusal be make open preparation for war be now in they own opinion free state they be not only raise army but form alliance not only hasten to rebel themselves but seduce they neighbor to rebellion they have publish a address to the inhabitant of quebec in which discontent and resistance be openly incite and with very respectful mention of the sagacity of frenchman invite they to send deputy to the congress of philadelphium to that seat of virtue and veracity whence the people of england be tell that to establish popery a religion fraught with sanguinary and impious tenet even in quebec a country of which the inhabitant be papist be so contrary to the constitution that it can not be lawfully do by the legislature itself where it be make one of the article of they association to deprive the conquered french of they religious establishment and whence the french of quebec be at the same time flatter into sedition by profession of expect from the liberality of sentiment distinguish they nation that difference of religion will not prejudice they against a hearty amity because the transcendant nature of freedom elevate all who unite in the cause above such low-minded infirmity quebec however be at a great distance they have aim a stroke from which they may hope for greater and more speedy mischief they have try to infect the people of england with the contagion of disloyalty they credit be happily not such as give they influence proportionate to they malice when they talk of they pretended immunity guarantee by the plighted faith of government and the most solemn compact with english sovereign we think ourselves at liberty to inquire when the faith be plight and the compact make and when we can only find that king jame and king charle the first promise the settler in massachusett bay now famous by the appellation of bostonian exemption from tax for seven year we infer with mr mauduit that by this solemn compact they be after expiration of the stipulate term liable to taxation when they apply to we compassion by tell we that they be to be carry from they own country to be try for certain offence we be not so ready to pity they as to advise they not to offend while they be innocent they be safe when they tell of law make expressly for they punishment we answer that tumult and sedition be always punishable and that the new law prescribe only the mode of execution when it be say that the whole town of boston be distressed for a misdemeanor of a few we wonder at they shamelessness for we know that the town of boston and all the associated province be now in rebellion to defend or justify the criminal if fraud in the impost of boston be try by commission without a jury they be try here in the same mode and why should the bostonian expect from we more tenderness for they than for ourselves if they be condemn unheard it be because there be no need of a trial the crime be manifest and notorious all trial be the investigation of something doubtful a italian philosopher observe that no man desire to hear what he have already see if they assembly have be suddenly dissolve what be the reason they deliberation be indecent and they intention seditious the power of dissolution be grant and reserve for such time of turbulence they best friend have be lately solicit the king to dissolve he parliament to do what they so loudly complain of suffer that the same vengeance involve the innocent and guilty be a evil to be lament but human caution can not prevent it nor human power always redress it to bring misery on those who have not deserve it be part of the aggregated guilt of rebellion that governor have be sometimes give they only that a great man might get ease from importunity and that they have have judge not always of the deepest learning or the purest integrity we have no great reason to doubt because such misfortune happen to ourselves whoever be govern will sometimes be govern ill even when he be most concern in he own government that improper officer or magistrate be send be the crime or folly of those that send they when incapacity be discover it ought to be remove if corruption be detect it ought to be punish no government could subsist for a day if single error could justify defection one of they complaint be not such as can claim much commiseration from the softest bosom they tell we that we have change we conduct and that a tax be now lay by parliament on those who be never tax by parliament before to this we think it may be easily answer that the longer they have be spare the better they can pay it be certainly not much they interest to represent innovation as criminal or invidious for they have introduce into the history of mankind a new mode of disaffection and have give i believe the first example of a proscription publish by a colony against the mother-country to what be urge of new power grant to the court of admiralty or the extension of authority confer on the judge it may be answer in a few word that they have themselves make such regulation necessary that they be establish for the prevention of greater evil at the same time it must be observe that these power have not be extend since the rebellion in america one mode of persuasion they ingenuity have suggest which it may perhaps be less easy to resist that we may not look with indifference on the american contest or imagine that the struggle be for a claim which however decide be of small importance and remote consequence the philadelphian congress have take care to inform we that they be resist the demand of parliament as well for we sake as they own they keenness of perspicacity have enable they to pursue consequence to a greater distance to see through cloud impervious to the dimness of european sight and to find i know not how that when they be tax we shall be enslave that slavery be a miserable state we have be often tell and doubtless many a briton will tremble to find it so near as in america but how it will be bring hither the congress must inform we the question might distress a common understanding but the statesman of the other hemisphere can easily resolve it we minister they say axe we enemy and if they should carry the point of taxation may with the same army enslave we it may be say we will not pay they but remember say the western sage the tax from america and we may add the man and particularly the roman catholick of this vast continent will then be in the power of you enemy nor have you any reason to expect that after make slave of we many of we will refuse to assist in reduce you to the same abject state these be dreadful menace but suspect that they have not much the sound of probability the congress proceeds : do not treat this as chimerical know that in less than half a century the quitrent reserve to the crown from the numberless grant of this vast continent will pour large stream of wealth into the royal coffer if to this be add the power of tax america at pleasure the crown will possess more treasure than may be necessary to purchase the remains of liberty in you island all this be very dreadful but amidst the terror that shake my frame i can not forbear to wish that some sluice be open for these stream of treasure i should gladly see america return half of what england have expend in she defense and of the stream that will flow so largely in less than half a century i hope a small rill at least may be find to quench the thirst of the present generation which seem to think itself in more danger of want money than of lose liberty it be difficult to judge with what intention such airy burst of malevolence be vent if such writer hope to deceive let we rather repel they with scorn than refute they by disputation in this last terrifick paragraph be two position that if we fear do not overpower we reflection may enable we to support life a little longer we be tell by these croaker of calamity not only that we present minister design to enslave we but that the same malignity of purpose be to descend through all they successor and that the wealth to be pour into england by the pactolus of america will whenever it come be employ to purchase the remains of liberty of those who now conduct the national affair we may without much arrogance presume to know more than themselves and of those who shall succeed they whether minister or king not to know less the other position be that the crown if this laudable opposition should not be successful will have the power of tax america at pleasure surely they think rather too meanly of we apprehension when they suppose we not to know what they well know themselves that they be tax like all other british subject by parliament and that the crown have not by the new impost whether right or wrong obtain any additional power over they possession it be a curious but a idle speculation to inquire what effect these dictator of sedition expect from the dispersion of they letter among we if they believe they own complaint of hardship and really dread the danger which they describe they will naturally hope to communicate the same perception to they fellow-subject but probably in america as in other place the chief be incendiary that hope to rob in the tumult of a conflagration and toss brand among a rabble passively combustible those who write the address though they have show no great extent or profundity of mind be yet probably wiser than to believe it : but they have be teach by some master of mischief how to put in motion the engine of political electricity to attract by the sound of liberty and property to repel by those of popery and slavery and to give the great stroke by the name of boston when subordinate community oppose the decree of the general legislature with defiance thus audacious and malignity thus acrimonious nothing remain but to conquer or to yield to allow they claim of independence or to reduce they by force to submission and allegiance it might be hope that no englishman could be find whom the menace of we own colonist just rescue from the french would not move to indignation like that of the scythian who return from war find themselves exclude from they own house by they slave that corporation constitute by favor and exist by sufferance should dare to prohibit commerce with they native country and threaten individual by infamy and society with at least suspension of amity for daring to be more obedient to government than themselves be a degree of insolence which not only deserve to be punish but of which the punishment be loudly demand by the order of life and the peace of nation yet there have rise up in the face of the publick man who by whatever corruption or whatever infatuation have undertake to defend the american endeavor to shelter they from resentment and propose reconciliation without submission as political disease be naturally contagious let it be suppose for a moment that cornwall seize with the philadelphian phrensy may resolve to separate itself from the general system of the english constitution and judge of its own rights in its own parliament a congress might then meet at truro and address the other county in a style not unlike the language of the american patriot : friend and fellow-subject -- we the delegate of the several town and parish of cornwall assemble to deliberate upon we own state and that of we constituent have after serious debate and calm consideration settle the scheme of we future conduct hold it necessary to declare the resolution which we think ourselves entitle to form by the unalienable rights of reasonable being and into which we have be compel by grievance and oppression long endure by we in patient silence not because we do not feel or could not remove they but because we be unwilling to give disturbance to a settled government and hope that other would in time find like ourselves they true interest and they original power and all cooperate to universal happiness but since have long indulge the please expectation we find general discontent not likely to increase or not likely to end in general defection we resolve to erect alone the standard of liberty know then that you be no longer to consider cornwall as a english county visit by english judge receive law from a english parliament or include in any general taxation of the kingdom but as a state distinct and independent govern by its own institution administer by its own magistrate and exempt from any tax or tribute but such as we shall impose upon ourselves we be the acknowledged descendant of the earliest inhabitant of britain of man who before the time of history take possession of the island desolate and waste and therefore open to the first occupant of this descent we language be a sufficient proof which not quite a century ago be different from yours such be the cornishman but who be you who but the unauthorised and lawless child of intruder invader and oppressor who but the transmitter of wrong the inheritor of robbery in claim independence we claim but little we might require you to depart from a land which you possess by usurpation and to restore all that you have take from we independence be the gift of nature no man be bear the master of another every cornishman be a freeman for we have never resign the rights of humanity : and he only can be think free who be ` not govern but by he own consent you may urge that the present system of government have descend through many age and that we have a larger part in the representation of the kingdom than any other county all this be true but it be neither cogent nor persuasive we look to the original of thing we union with the english county be either compel by force or settle by compact that which be make by violence may by violence be break if we be treat as a conquered people we rights might be obscure but could never be extinguish the sword can give nothing but power which a sharper sword can take away if we union be by compact whom could the compact bind but those that concur in the stipulation we give we ancestor no commission to settle the term of future existence they might be coward that be fright or blockhead that be cheat but whatever they be they could contract only for themselves what they could establish we can annul against we present form of government it shall stand in the place of all argument that we do not like it while we be govern as we do not like where be we liberty we do not like tax we will therefore not be tax : we do not like you law and will not obey they the tax lay by we representative be lay you tell we by we own consent but we will no longer consent to be represent we number of legislator be originally a burden and ought to have be refuse it be now consider as a disproportionate advantage who then will complain if we resign it we shall form a senate of we own under a president whom the king shall nominate but whose authority we will limit by adjust he salary to he merit we will not withhold a proper share of contribution to the necessary expense of lawful government but we will decide for ourselves what share be proper what expense be necessary and what government be lawful till we counsel be proclaimed independent and unaccountable we will after the tenth day of September keep we tin in we own hand : you can be supply from no other place and must therefore comply or be poison with the copper of you own kitchen if any cornishman shall refuse he name to this just and laudable association he shall be tumble from st michael 's mount or bury alive in a tin-mine and if any emissary shall be find seduce cornishman to they former state he shall be smear with tar and roll in feather and chase with dog out of we dominion from the cornish congress at truro of this memorial what could be say but that it be write in jest or write by a madman yet i know not whether the warmest admirer of pennsylvanian eloquence can find any argument in the address of the congress that be not with greater strength urge by the cornishman the argument of the irregular troops of controversy strip of its color and turn out naked to the view be no more than this liberty be the birthright of man and where obedience be compel there be no liberty the answer be equally simple government be necessary to man and where obedience be not compel there be no government if the subject refuse to obey it be the duty of authority to use compulsion society can not subsist but by the power first of make law and then of enforce they to one of the threat hiss out by the congress i have put nothing similar into the cornish proclamation because it be too wild for folly and too foolish for madness if we do not withhold we king and he parliament from tax they they will cross the atlantick and enslave we how they will come they have not tell we perhaps they will take wing and light upon we coast when the crane thus begin to flutter it be time for pygmy to keep they eye about they the great orator observe that they will be very fit after they have be tax to impose chain upon we if they be so fit as they friend describe they and so willing as they describe themselves let we increase we army and double we militia it have be of late a very general practice to talk of slavery among those who be set at defiance every power that keep the world in order if the learn author of the reflection on learning have rightly observe that no man ever could give law to language it will be vain to prohibit the use of the word slavery but i could wish it more discreetly utter : it be drive at one time too hard into we ear by the loud hurricane of pennsylvanian eloquence and at another glide too cold into we heart by the soft conveyance of a female patriot bewail the misery of she friend and fellow-citizen such have be the progress of sedition that those who a few year ago dispute only we right of lay tax now question the validity of every act of legislation they consider themselves as emancipate from obedience and as be no longer the subject of the british crown they leave we no choice but of yield or conquer of resign we dominion or maintain it by force from force many endeavor have be use either to dissuade or to deter we sometimes the merit of the american be exalt and sometimes they suffering be aggravate we be tell of they contribution to the last war a war incite by they outcry and continue for they protection a war by which none but themselves be gainer all that they can boast be that they do something for themselves and do not wholly stand inactive while the son of britain be fight in they cause if we can not admire we be call to pity they to pity those that show no regard to they mother-country have obey no law which they could violate have impart no good which they could withhold have enter into association of fraud to rob they creditor and into combination to distress all who depend on they commerce we be reproach with the cruelty of shut one port where every port be shut against we we be censure as tyrannical for hinder those from fishing who have condemn we merchant to bankruptcy and we manufacturer to hunger other persuade we to give they more liberty to take off restraint and relax authority and tell we what happy consequence will arise from forbearance how they affection will be conciliate and into what diffusion of beneficence they gratitude will luxuriate they will love they friend they will reverence they protector they will throw themselves into we arm and lay they property at we foot they will buy from no other what we can sell they they will sell to no other what we wish to buy that any obligation should overpower they attention to profit we have know they long enough not to expect it be not to be expect from a more liberal people with what kindness they repay benefit they be now show we who as soon as we have deliver they from france be defy and proscribe we but if we will permit they to tax themselves they will give we more than we require if we proclaim they independent they will during pleasure pay we a subsidy the contest be not now for money but for power the question be not how much we shall collect but by what authority the collection shall be make those who find that the american can not be show in any form that may raise love or pity dress they in habiliment of terror and try to make we think they formidable the bostonian can call into the field ninety thousand man while we conquer all before we new enemy will rise up behind and we work will be always to begin if we take possession of the town the colonist will retire into the inland region and the gain of victory will be only empty house and a wide extent of waste and desolation if we subdue they for the present they will universally revolt in the next war and resign we without pity to subjection and destruction to all this it may be answer that between lose america and resign it there be no great difference that it be not very reasonable to jump into the sea because the ship be leaky all those evil may befall we but we need not hasten they the dean of gloucester have propose and seem to propose it seriously that we should at once release we claim declare they master of themselves and whistle they down the wind he opinion be that we gain from they will be the same and we expense less what they can have most cheaply from britain they will still buy what they can sell to we at the highest price they will still sell it be however a little hard that have so lately fight and conquer for they safety we should govern they no longer by let they loose before the war how many million might have be save one wild proposal be best answer by another let we restore to the french what we have take from they we shall see we colonist at we foot when they have a enemy so near they let we give the indian arm and teach they discipline and encourage they now and then to plunder a plantation security and leisure be the parent of sedition while these different opinion be agitate it seem to be determine by the legislature that force shall be try man of the pen have seldom any great skill in conquer kingdom but they have strong inclination to give advice i can not forbear to wish that this commotion may end without bloodshed and that the rebel may be subdue by terror rather than by violence and therefore recommend such a force as may take away not only the power but the hope of resistance and by conquer without a battle save many from the sword if they obstinacy continue without actual hostility it may perhaps be mollify by turn out the soldier to free quarter forbid any personal cruelty or hurt it have be propose that the slave should be set free a act which surely the lover of liberty can not but commend if they be furnish with firearm for defense and utensil for husbandry and settle in some simple form of government within the country they may be more grateful and honest than they master far be it from any englishman to thirst for the blood of he fellow-subject those who most deserve we resentment be unhappily at less distance the american when the stamp act be first propose undoubtedly dislike it as every nation dislike a impost but they have no thought of resist it till they be encouraged and incite by european intelligence from man whom they think they friend but who be friend only to themselves on the original contriver of mischief let a insult nation pour out its vengeance with whatever design they have inflamed this pernicious contest they be themselves equally detestable if they wish success to the colony they be traitor to this country if they wish they defeat they be traitor at once to america and england to they and they only must be imputed the interruption of commerce and the misery of war the sorrow of those that shall be ruin and the blood of those that shall fall since the american have make it necessary to subdue they may they be subdue with the least injury possible to they person and they possession when they be reduce to obedience may that obedience be secure by stricter law and stronger obligation nothing can be more noxious to society than that erroneous clemency which when a rebellion be suppress exact no forfeiture and establish no security but leave the rebel in they former state who would not try the experiment which promise advantage without expense if rebel once obtain a victory they wish be accomplish if they be defeat they suffer little perhaps less than they conqueror however often they play the game the chance be always in they favor in the mean time they be grow rich by victual the troops that we have send against they and perhaps gain more by the residence of the army than they lose by the obstruction of they port they charter be now i suppose legally forfeit may be model as shall appear most commodious to the mother-country thus the privilege which be find by experience liable to misuse will be take away and those who now bellow as patriot bluster as soldier and domineer as legislator will sink into sober merchant and silent planter peaceably diligent and securely rich but there be one writer and perhaps many who do not write to whom the contraction of these pernicious privilege appear very dangerous and who startle at the thought of england free and america in chain child fly from they own shadow and rhetorician be fright by they own voice chain be undoubtedly a dreadful word but perhaps the master of civil wisdom may discover some gradation between chain and anarchy chain need not be put upon those who will be restrain without they this contest may end in the softer phrase of english superiority and american obedience we be tell that the subjection of american may tend to the diminution of we own liberty a event which none but very perspicacious politician be able to foresee if slavery be thus fatally contagious how be it that we hear the loudest yelp for liberty among the driver of negro but let we interrupt awhile this dream of conquest settlement and supremacy let we remember that be to contend accord to one orator with three million of whig and accord to another with ninety thousand patriot of massachusett bay we may possibly be check in we career of reduction we may be reduce to peace upon equal term or drive from the western continent and forbid to violate a second time the happy border of the land of liberty the time be now perhaps at hand which sir thoma browne predict between jest and earnest : when america should no more send out she treasure but spend it at home in american pleasure if we be allow upon we defeat to stipulate condition i hope the treaty of boston will permit we to import into the confederated canton such product as they do not raise and such manufacture as they do not make and can not buy cheaper from other nation pay like other the appoint custom that if a english ship salute a fort with four gun it shall be answer at least with two and that if a englishman be incline to hold a plantation he shall only take a oath of allegiance to the reign power and be suffer while he live inoffensively to retain he own opinion of english rights unmolested in he conscience by a oath of abjuration life of eminent person father paul sarpus -lrb- 33 -rrb- father paul whose name before he enter into the monastick life be peter sarpus be bear at venice August 14 1552 he father follow merchandise but with so little success that at he death he leave he family very ill provide for but under the care of a mother whose piety be likely to bring the blessing of providence upon they and whose wise conduct supply the want of fortune by advantage of greater value happily for young sarpus she have a brother master of a celebrated school under whose direction he be place by she here he lose no time but cultivate he ability naturally of the first rate with unwearied application he be bear for study have a natural aversion to pleasure and gaiety and a memory so tenacious that he could repeat thirty verse upon once hear they proportionable to he capacity be he progress in literature : at thirteen have make himself master of school-learning he turn he study to philosophy and the mathematick and enter upon logick under capellum of cremona who though a celebrated master of that science confess himself in a very little time unable to give he pupil further instruction as capellum be of the order of the servite he scholar be induce by he acquaintance with he to engage in the same profession though he uncle and he mother represent to he the hardship and austerity of that kind of life and advise he with great zeal against it but he be steady in he resolution and in 1566 take the habit of the order be then only in he fourteenth year a time of life in most person very improper for such engagement but in he attend with such maturity of thought and such a settle temper that he never seem to regret the choice he then make and which he confirm by a solemn publick profession in 1572 at a general chapter of the servite hold at mantua paul for so we shall now call he be then only twenty year old distinguish himself so much in a publick disputation by he genius and learn that william duke of mantua a great patron of letter solicit the consent of he superior to retain he at he court and not only make he publick professor of divinity in the cathedral but honor he with many proof of he esteem but father paul find a court life not agreeable to he temper quit it two year afterwards and retire to he beloved privacy be then not only acquaint with the latin greek hebrew and chaldee language but with philosophy the mathematick canon and civil law all part of natural philosophy and chymistry itself for he application be unremitted he head clear he apprehension quick and he memory retentive be make a priest at twenty-two he be distinguish by the illustrious cardinal borromeo with he confidence and employ by he on many occasion not without the envy of person of less merit who be so far exasperate as to lay a charge against he before the inquisition for deny that the trinity could be prove from the first chapter of genesis but the accusation be too ridiculous to be take notice of after this he pass successively through the dignity of he order and in the interval of he employment apply himself to he study with so extensive a capacity as leave no branch of knowledge untouched by he acquapendente the great anatomist confess that he be inform how vision be perform and there be proof that he be not a stranger to the circulation of the blood he frequently converse upon astronomy with mathematician upon anatomy with surgeon upon medicine with physician and with chymist upon the analysis of metal not as a superficial inquirer but as a complete master but the hour of repose that he employ so well be interrupt by a new information in the inquisition where a former acquaintance produce a letter write by he in cipher in which he say that he detest the court of rome and that no preferment be obtain there but by dishonest means this accusation however dangerous be pass over on account of he great reputation but make such impression on that court that he be afterward deny a bishoprick by clement the eighth after these difficulty be surmount father paul again retire to he solitude where he appear by some writings draw up by he at that time to have turn he attention more to improvement in piety than learn such be the care with which he read the scripture that it be he custom to draw a line under any passage which he intend more nicely to consider there be not a single word in he new testament but be underline the same mark of attention appear in he old testament psalter and breviary but the most active scene of he life begin about the year 1615 when pope paul the fifth exasperated by some decree of the senate of venice that interfere with the pretended rights of the church lay the whole state under a interdict the senate fill with indignation at this treatment forbid the bishop to receive or publish the pope 's bull and convene the rector of the church command they to celebrate divine service in the accustomed manner with which most of they readily comply but the jesuit and some other refuse be by a solemn edict expel the state both party have proceed to extremity employ they ablest writer to defend they measure : on the pope 's side among other cardinal bellarmine enter the list and with he confederate author defend the papal claim with great scurrility of expression and very sophistical reasoning which be confute by the venetian apologist in much more decent language and with much greater solidity of argument on this occasion father paul be most eminently distinguish by he defense of the rights of the supreme magistrate he treatise of excommunication translate from gerson with a apology and other writings for which he be cite before the inquisition at rome but it may be easily imagine that he do not obey the summons the venetian writer whatever might be the ability of they adversary be at least superior to they in the justice of they cause the proposition maintain on the side of rome be these : that the pope be invest with all the authority of heaven and earth : that all prince be he vassal and that he may annul they law at pleasure : that king may appeal to he as he be temporal monarch of the whole earth : that he can discharge subject from they oath of allegiance and make it they duty to take up arm against they sovereign : that he may depose king without any fault commit by they if the good of the church require it : that the clergy be exempt from all tribute to king and be not accountable to they even in case of high treason : that the pope can not err that he decision be to be receive and obey on pain of sin though all the world should judge they to be false that the pope be god upon earth that he sentence and that of god be the same and that to call he power in question be to call in question the power of god maxim equally shocking weak pernicious and absurd which do not require the ability or learning of father paul to demonstrate they falsehood and destructive tendency it may be easily imagine that such principle be quickly overthrow and that no court but that of rome think it for its interest to favor they the pope therefore find he author confute and he cause abandon be willing to conclude the affair by treaty which by the mediation of henry the fourth of france be accommodate upon term very much to the honor of the venetian but the defender of the venetian rights be though comprehend in the treaty exclude by the roman from the benefit of it some upon different pretence be imprison some send to the galley and all debar from preferment but they malice be chiefly aim against father paul who soon find the effect of it for as he be go one night to he convent about six month after the accommodation he be attack by five ruffian arm with stiletto who give he no less than fifteen stab three of which wound he in such a manner that he be leave for dead the murderer flee for refuge to the nuncio and be afterwards receive into the pope 's dominion but be pursue by divine justice and all except one man who die in prison perish by violent death this and other attempt upon he life oblige he to confine himself to he convent where he engage in write the history of the council of trent a work unequalled for the judicious disposition of the matter and artful texture of the narration commend by dr burnet as the completest model of historical writing and celebrate by mr wotton as equivalent to any production of antiquity in which the reader find liberty without licentiousness piety without hypocrisy freedom of speech without neglect of decency severity without rigor and extensive learning without ostentation in this and other work of less consequence he spend the remain part of he life to the beginning of the year 1622 when he be seize with a cold and fever which he neglect till it become incurable he languish more than twelve month which he spend almost wholly in a preparation for he passage into eternity and among he prayer and aspiration be often hear to repeat lord now let thy servant depart in peace on Sunday the eighth of January of the next year he rise weak as he be to mass and go to take he repast with the rest but on Monday be seize with a weakness that threaten immediate death and on Thursday prepare for he change by receive the viaticum with such mark of devotion as equally melted and edify the beholder through the whole course of he illness to the last hour of he life he be consult by the senate in publick affair and return answer in he greatest weakness with such presence of mind as could only arise from the consciousness of innocence on Sunday the day of he death he have the passion of we bless savior read to he out of st john 's gospel as on every other day of that week and speak of the mercy of he redeemer and he confidence in he merit as he end evidently approach the brethren of the convent come to pronounce the last prayer with which he could only join in he thought be able to pronounce no more than these word esto perpetua mayst thou last for ever which be understand to be a prayer for the prosperity of he country thus die father paul in the seventy-first year of he age hate by the roman as they most formidable enemy and honor by all the learn for he ability and by the good for he integrity he detestation of the corruption of the roman church appear in all he writings but particularly in this memorable passage of one of he letter : there be nothing more essential than to ruin the reputation of the jesuit by the ruin of the jesuit rome will be ruin and if rome be ruin religion will reform of itself he appear by many passage of he life to have have a high esteem of the church of england and he friend father fulgentio who have adopt all he notion make no scruple of administer to dr duncomb a english gentleman that fall sick at venice the communion in both kind accord to the common prayer which he have with he in italian he be bury with great pomp at the publick charge and a magnificent monument be erect to he memory boerhaave the follow account of the late dr boerhaave so loudly celebrated and so universally lament through the whole learn world will we hope be not unacceptable to we reader : we could have make it much larger by adopt fly report and insert unattested fact : a close adherence to certainty have contract we narrative and hinder it from swell to that bulk at which modern history generally arrive dr herman boerhaave be bear on the last day of December 1668 about one in the morning at voorhout a village two mile distant from leyden : he father jame boerhaave be minister of voorhout of whom he son -lrb- 34 -rrb- in a small account of he own life have give a very amiable character for the simplicity and openness of he behavior for he exact frugality in the management of a narrow fortune and the prudence tenderness and diligence with which he educate a numerous family of nine child : he be eminently skilled in history and genealogy and verse in the latin greek and hebrew language he mother be hagar daelder a tradesman 's daughter of amsterdam from whom he might perhaps derive a hereditary inclination to the study of physick in which she be very inquisitive and have obtain a knowledge of it not common in female student this knowledge however she do not live to communicate to she son for she die in 1673 ten year after she marriage he father finding himself encumber with the care of seven child think it necessary to take a second wife and in July 1674 be marry to eve du bois daughter of a minister of leyden who by she prudent and impartial conduct so endeared herself to she husband 's child that they all regard she as they own mother herman boerhaave be always design by he father for the ministry and with that view instruct by he in grammatical learning and the first element of language in which he make such a proficiency that he be at the age of eleven year not only master of the rule of grammar but capable of translate with tolerable accuracy and not wholly ignorant of critical nicety at interval to recreate he mind and strengthen he constitution it be he father 's custom to send he into the field and employ he in agriculture and such kind of rural occupation which he continue through all he life to love and practice and by this vicissitude of study and exercise preserve himself in a great measure from those distemper and depression which be frequently the consequence of indiscreet diligence and uninterrupted application and from which student not well acquaint with the constitution of the human body sometimes fly for relief to wine instead of exercise and purchase temporary ease by the hazard of the most dreadful consequence the study of young boerhaave be about this time interrupt by a accident which deserve a particular mention as it first incline he to that science to which he be by nature so well adapt and which he afterwards carry to so great perfection in the twelfth year of he age a stubborn painful and malignant ulcer break out upon he left thigh which for near five year defeat all the art of the surgeon and physician and not only afflict he with most excruciating pain but expose he to such sharp and torment application that the disease and remedy be equally insufferable then it be that he own pain teach he to compassionate other and he experience of the inefficacy of the method then in use incite he to attempt the discovery of other more certain he begin to practice at least honestly for he begin upon himself and he first essay be a prelude to he future success for have lay aside all the prescription of he physician and all the application of he surgeon he at last by torment the part with salt and urine effect a cure that he might on this occasion obtain the assistance of surgeon with less inconvenience and expense he be bring by he father at fourteen to leyden and place in the fourth class of the publick school after be examine by the master : here he application and ability be equally conspicuous in six month by gain the first prize in the fourth class he be raise to the fifth and in six month more upon the same proof of the superiority of he genius reward with another prize and translate to the sixth from whence it be usual in six month more to be remove to the university thus do we young student advance in learning and reputation when as he be within view of the university a sudden and unexpected blow threaten to defeat all he expectation on the 12th of November in 1682 he father die and leave behind he a very slender provision for he widow and nine child of which the eldest be not yet seventeen year old this be a most afflicting loss to the young scholar whose fortune be by no means sufficient to bear the expense of a learn education and who therefore seem to be now summon by necessity to some way of life more immediately and certainly lucrative but with a resolution equal to he ability and a spirit not so depressed and shake he determine to break through the obstacle of poverty and supply by diligence the want of fortune he therefore ask and obtain the consent of he guardian to prosecute he study so long as he patrimony would support he and continue he wonted industry gain another prize he be now to quit the school for the university but on account of the weakness yet remain in he thigh be at he own entreaty continue six month longer under the care of he master the learn winschotan where he be once more honor with the prize at he removal to the university the same genius and industry meet with the same encouragement and applause the learn triglandius one of he father 's friend make soon after professor of divinity at leyden distinguish he in a particular manner and recommend he to the friendship of mr van apphen in whom he find a generous and constant patron he become now a diligent hearer of the most celebrated professor and make great advance in all the science still regulate he study with a view principally to divinity for which he be originally intend by he father and for that reason exert he utmost application to attain a exact knowledge of the hebrew tongue be convince of the necessity of mathematical learning he begin to study those science in 1687 but without that intense industry with which the pleasure he find in that kind of knowledge induce he afterwards to cultivate they in 1690 have perform the exercise of the university with uncommon reputation he take he degree in philosophy and on that occasion discuss the important and arduous subject of the distinct nature of the soul and body with such-accuracy perspicuity and subtilty that he entirely confute all the sophistry of epicurus hobbe and spinosa and equally raise the character of he piety and erudition divinity be still he great employment and the chief aim of all he study he read the scripture in they original language and when difficulty occur consult the interpretation of the most ancient father whom he read in order of time begin with clemen romanus in the perusal of those early writer -lrb- 35 -rrb- he be strike with the profoundest veneration of the simplicity and purity of they doctrine the holiness of they life and the sanctity of the discipline practice by they but as he descend to the lower age find the peace of christianity break by useless controversy and its doctrine sophisticated by the subtilty of the school : he find the holy writer interpret accord to the notion of philosopher and the chimera of metaphysician adopt as article of faith : he find difficulty raise by nicety and foment to bitterness and rancor : he see the simplicity of the christian doctrine corrupt by the private fancy of particular party while each adhere to its own philosophy and orthodoxy be confine to the sect in power have now exhaust he fortune in the pursuit of he study he find the necessity of apply to some profession that without engross all he time might enable he to support himself and have obtain a very uncommon knowledge of the mathematick he read lecture in those science to a select number of young gentleman in the university at length he propension to the study of physick grow too violent to be resist and though he still intend to make divinity the great employment of he life he could not deny himself the satisfaction of spend some time upon the medical writer for the perusal of which he be so well qualify by he acquaintance with the mathematick and philosophy but this science correspond so much with he natural genius that he could not forbear make that he business which he intend only as he diversion and still grow more eager as he advance further he at length determine wholly to master that profession and to take he degree in physick before he engage in the duty of the ministry it be i believe a very just observation that man 's ambition be generally proportion to they capacity providence seldom send any into the world with a inclination to attempt great thing who have not ability likewise to perform they to have form the design of gain a complete knowledge of medicine by way of digression from theological study would have be little less than madness in most man and would have only expose they to ridicule and contempt but boerhaave be one of those mighty genius to whom scarce any thing appear impossible and who think nothing worthy of they effort but what appear insurmountable to common understanding he begin this new course of study by a diligent perusal of vesalius bartholine and fallopius and to acquaint himself more fully with the structure of body be a constant attendant upon nuck 's publick dissection in the theater and himself very accurately inspect the body of different animal have furnish himself with this preparatory knowledge he begin to read the ancient physician in the order of time pursue he inquiry downward from hippocrate through all the greek and latin writer find as he tell we himself that hippocrate be the original source of all medical knowledge and that all the later writer be little more than transcriber from he he return to he with more attention and spend much time in make extract from he digest he treatise into method and fix they in he memory he then descend to the modern among whom none engage he longer or improve he more than sydenham to whose merit he have leave this attestation that he frequently peruse he and always with greater eagerness he insatiable curiosity after knowledge engage he now in the practice of chymistry which he prosecute with all the ardor of a philosopher whose industry be not to be wearied and whose love of truth be too strong to suffer he to acquiesce in the report of other yet do he not suffer one branch of science to withdraw he attention from other : anatomy do not withhold he from chymistry nor chymistry enchanting as it be from the study of botany in which he be no less skilled than in other part of physick he be not only a careful examiner of all the plant in the garden of the university but make excursion for he further improvement into the wood and field and leave no place unvisited where any increase of botanical knowledge could be reasonably hope for in conjunction with all these inquiry he still pursue he theological study and still as we be inform by himself propose when he have make himself master of the whole art of physick and obtain the honor of a degree in that science to petition regularly for a license to preach and to engage in the cure of soul and intend in he theological exercise to discuss this question why so many be formerly convert to christianity by illiterate person and so few at present by man of learn in pursuance of this plan he go to hardewich in order to take the degree of doctor in physick which he obtain in July 1693 have perform a publick disputation de utilitate explorandorum excrementorum in aegri ut signorum then return to leyden full of he pious design of undertake the ministry he find to he surprise unexpected obstacle throw in he way and a insinuation disperse through the university that make he suspect not of any slight deviation from receive opinion not of any pertinacious adherence to he own notion in doubtful and disputable matter but of no less than spinosism or in plainer term of atheism itself how so injurious a report come to be raise circulate and credit will be doubtless very eagerly inquire we shall therefore give the relation not only to satisfy the curiosity of mankind but to show that no merit however exalt be exempt from be not only attack but wound by the most contemptible whisper those who can not strike with force can however poison they weapon and weak as they be give mortal wound and bring a hero to the grave so true be that observation that many be able to do hurt but few to do good this detestable calumny owe its rise to a incident from which no consequence of importance could be possibly apprehend as boerhaave be sit in a common boat there arise a conversation among the passenger upon the impious and pernicious doctrine of spinosa which as they all agree tend to the utter overthrow of all religion boerhaave sit and attend silently to this discourse for some time till one of the company willing to distinguish himself by he zeal instead of confute the position of spinosa by argument begin to give a loose to contumelious language and virulent invective which boerhaave be so little pleased with that at last he could not forbear ask he whether he have ever read the author he declaim against the orator not be able to make much answer be check in the midst of he invective but not without feel a secret resentment against the person who have at once interrupted he harangue and expose he ignorance this be observe by a stranger who be in the boat with they he inquire of he neighbor the name of the young man whose question have put a end to the discourse and have learn it set it down in he pocket-book as it appear with a malicious design for in a few day it be the common conversation at leyden that boerhaave have revolt to spinosa it be in vain that he advocate and friend plead he learn and unanswerable confutation of all atheistical opinion and particularly of the system of spinosa in he discourse of the distinction between soul and body such calumny be not easily suppress when they be once become general they be keep alive and support by the malice of bad and sometimes by the zeal of good man who though they do not absolutely believe they think it yet the securest method to keep not only guilty but suspect man out of publick employment upon this principle that the safety of many be to be prefer before the advantage of few boerhaave find this formidable opposition raise against he pretension to ecclesiastical honor or preferment and even against he design of assume the character of a divine thought it neither necessary nor prudent to struggle with the torrent of popular prejudice as he be equally qualify for a profession not indeed of equal dignity or importance but which must undoubtedly claim the second place among those which be of the greatest benefit to mankind he therefore apply himself to he medical study with new ardor and alacrity review all he former observation and inquiry and be continually employ in make new acquisition have now qualify himself for the practice of physick he begin to visit patient but without that encouragement which other not equally deserving have sometimes meet with he business be at first not great and he circumstance by no means easy but still superior to any discouragement he continue he search after knowledge and determine that prosperity if ever he be to enjoy it should be the consequence not of mean art or disingenuous solicitation but of real merit and solid learn he steady adherence to he resolution appear yet more plainly from this circumstance : he be while he yet remain in this unpleasing situation invite by one of the first favorite of king william the third to settle at the hague upon very advantageous condition but decline the offer for have no ambition but after knowledge he be desirous of live at liberty without any restraint upon he look he thought or he tongue and at the utmost distance from all contention and state-party he time be wholly take up in visit the sick study ntaking chymical experiment search into every part of medicine with the utmost diligence teach the mathematick and read the scripture and those author who profess to teach a certain method of loving god -lrb- 36 -rrb- this be he method of live to the year 1701 when he be recommend by van berg to the university as a proper person to succeed drelincurtius in the professorship of physick and elect without any solicitation on he part and almost without he consent on the 18th of may on this occasion have observe with grief that hippocrate whom he regard not only as the father but as the prince of physician be not sufficiently read or esteem by young student he pronounce a oration de commendando studio hippocratico by which he restore that great author to he just and ancient reputation he now begin to read publick lecture with great applause and be prevail upon by he audience to enlarge he original design and instruct they in chymistry this he undertake not only to the great advantage of he pupil but to the great improvement of the art itself which have hitherto be treat only in a confused and irregular manner and be little more than a history of particular experiment not reduce to certain principle nor connected one with another : this vast chaos he reduce to order and make that clear and easy which be before to the last degree difficult and obscure he reputation now begin to bear some proportion to he merit and extend itself to distant university so that in 1703 the professorship of physick be vacant at groningen he be invite thither but he refuse to leave leyden and choose to continue he present course of life this invitation and refusal be relate to the governor of the university of leyden they have so grateful a sense of he regard for they that they immediately vote a honorary increase of he salary and promise he the first professorship that should be vacant on this occasion he pronounce a oration upon the use of mechanick in the science of physick in which he endeavor to recommend a rational and mathematical inquiry into the cause of disease and the structure of body and to show the folly and weakness of the jargon introduce by paracelsus helmont and other chymical enthusiast who have obtrude upon the world the most airy dream and instead of enlighten they reader with explication of nature have darken the plainest appearance and bewildered mankind in error and obscurity boerhaave have now for nine year read physical lecture but without the title or dignity of a professor when by the death of professor hotten the professorship of physick and botany fall to he of course on this occasion he assert the simplicity and facility of the science of physick in opposition to those that think obscurity contribute to the dignity of learning and that to be admire it be necessary not to be understand he profession of botany make it part of he duty to superintend the physical garden which improve so much by the immense number of new plant which he procure that it be enlarged to twice its original extent in 1714 he be deservedly advance to the highest dignity of the university and in the same year make physician of st augustin 's hospital in leyden into which the student be admit twice a week to learn the practice of physick this be of equal advantage to the sick and to the student for the success of he practice be the best demonstration of the soundness of he principle when he lay down he office of governor of the university in 1715 he make a oration upon the subject of attain to certainty in natural philosophy in which he declare in the strongest term in favor of experimental knowledge and reflect with just severity upon those arrogant philosopher who be too easily disgust with the slow method of obtain true notion by frequent experiment and who possess with too high a opinion of they own ability rather choose to consult they own imagination than inquire into nature and be better pleased with the charming amusement of form hypothesis than the toilsome drudgery of make observation the emptiness and uncertainty of all those system whether venerable for they antiquity or agreeable for they novelty he have evidently show and not only declare but prove that we be entirely ignorant of the principle of thing and that all the knowledge we have be of such quality alone as be discoverable by experience or such as may be deduce from they by mathematical demonstration this discourse fill as it be with piety and a true sense of the greatness of the supreme be and the incomprehensibility of he work give such offence to a professor of franeker who profess the utmost esteem for des cartes and consider he principle as the bulwark of orthodoxy that he appear in vindication of he darling author and speak of the injury do he with the utmost vehemence declare little less than that the cartesian system and the christian must inevitably stand and fall together and that to say that we be ignorant of the principle of thing be not only to enlist among the skeptick but to sink into atheism itself so far can prejudice darken the understanding as to make it consider precarious system as the chief support of sacred and invariable truth this treatment of boerhaave be so far resent by the governor of he university that they procure from franeker a recantation of the invective that have be throw out against he : this be not only comply with but offer be make he of more ample satisfaction to which he return a answer not less to he honor than the victory he gain that he should think himself sufficiently compensate if he adversary receive no further molestation on he account so far be this weak and injudicious attack from shake a reputation not casually raise by fashion or caprice but found upon solid merit that the same year he correspondence be desire upon botany and natural philosophy by the academy of science at pari of which he be upon the death of count marsiglus in the year 1728 elect a member nor be the french the only nation by which this great man be court and distinguish for two year after he be elect fellow of we royal society it can not be doubt but thus caress and honor with the highest and most publick mark of esteem by other nation he become more celebrate in the university for boerhaave be not one of those learn man of whom the world have see too many that disgrace they study by they vice and by unaccountable weakness make themselves ridiculous at home while they writings procure they the veneration of distant country where they learning be know but not they folly not that he countryman can be charge with be insensible of he excellency till other nation teach they to admire he for in 1718 he be choose to succeed le mort in the professorship of chymistry on which occasion he pronounce a oration de chemia errores suos expurgante in which he treat that science with a elegance of style not often to be find in chymical writer who seem generally to have affect not only a barbarous but unintelligible phrase and to have like the pythagorean of old wrapt up they secret in symbol and enigmatical expression either because they believe that mankind would reverence most what they least understand or because they write not from benevolence but vanity and be desirous to be praise for they knowledge though they could not prevail upon themselves to communicate it in 1722 he course both of lecture and practice be interrupt by the gout which as he relate it in he speech after he recovery he bring upon himself by a imprudent confidence in the strength of he own constitution and by transgress those rule which he have a thousand time inculcate to he pupil and acquaintance rise in the morning before day he go immediately hot and sweating from he bed into the open air and expose himself to the cold dew the history of he illness can hardly be read without horror : he be for five month confine to he bed where he lay upon he back without daring to attempt the least motion because any effort renew he torment which be so exquisite that he be at length not only deprive of motion but of sense here art be at a stand nothing could be attempt because nothing-could be propose with the least prospect of success at length have in the sixth month of he illness obtain some remission he take simple medicine -lrb- 37 -rrb- in large quantity and at length wonderfully recover he recovery so much desire and so unexpected be celebrate on jan 11 1723 when he open he school again with general joy and publick illuminations it would be a injury to the memory of boerhaave not to mention what be relate by himself to one of he friend that when he lay whole day and night without sleep he find no method of divert he thought so effectual as meditation upon he study and that he often relieved and mitigate the sense of he torment by the recollection of what he have read and by review those store of knowledge which he have reposit in he memory this be perhaps a instance of fortitude and steady composure of mind which would have be for ever the boast of the stoick school and increase the reputation of seneca or cato the patience of boerhaave as it be more rational be more lasting than theirs it be that patientium christiana which lipsius the great master of the stoical philosophy beg of god in he last hour it be found on religion not vanity not on vain reasoning but on confidence in god in 1727 he be seize with a violent burning fever which continue so long that he be once more give up by he friend from this time he be frequently afflict with return of he distemper which yet do not so far subdue he as to make he lay aside he study or he lecture till in 1726 he find himself so wear out that it be improper for he to continue any longer the professorship of botany or chymistry which he therefore resign April 28 and upon he resignation speak a sermo academicus or oration in which he assert the power and wisdom of the creator from the wonderful fabrick of the human body and confute all those idle reasoner who pretend to explain the formation of part or the animal operation to which he prove that art can produce nothing equal nor any thing parallel one instance i shall mention which be produce by he of the vanity of any attempt to rival the work of god nothing be more boast by the admirer of chymistry than that they can by artificial heat and digestion imitate the production of nature let all these hero of science meet together say boerhaave let they take bread and wine the food that form the blood of man and by assimilation contribute to the growth of the body : let they try all they art they shall not be able from these material to produce a single drop of blood so much be the most common act of nature beyond the utmost effort of the most extended science from this time boerhaave live with less publick employment indeed but not a idle or a useless life for besides he hour spend in instruct he scholar a great part of he time be take up by patient which come when the distemper would admit it from all part of europe to consult he or by letter which in more urgent case be continually send to inquire he opinion and ask he advice of he sagacity and the wonderful penetration with which he often discover and describe at first sight of a patient such distemper as betray themselves by no symptom to common eye such wonderful relation have be spread over the world as though attest beyond doubt can scarcely be credit i mention none of they because i have no opportunity of collect testimony or distinguish between those account which be well prove and those which owe they rise to fiction and credulity yet i can not but implore with the greatest earnestness such as have be conversant with this great man that they will not so far neglect the common interest of mankind as to suffer any of these circumstance to be lose to posterity man be generally idle and ready to satisfy themselves and intimidate the industry of other by call that impossible which be only difficult the skill to which boerhaave attain by a long and unwearied observation of nature ought therefore to be transmit in all its particulars to future age that he successor may be ashamed to fall below he and that none may hereafter excuse he ignorance by plead the impossibility of clearer knowledge yet so far be this great master from presumptuous confidence in he ability that in he examination of the sick he be remarkably circumstantial and particular he well know that the original of distemper be often at a distance from they visible effect that to conjecture where certainty may be obtain be either vanity or negligence and that life be not to be sacrifice either to a affectation of quick discernment or of crowded practice but may be require if trifle away at the hand of the physician about the middle of the year 1737 he feel the first approach of that fatal illness that bring he to the grave of which we have insert a account write by himself sept 8 1738 to a friend at london -lrb- 38 -rrb- which deserve not only to be preserve as a historical relation of the disease which deprive we of so great a man but as a proof of he piety and resignation to the divine will in this last illness which be to the last degree linger painful and afflictive he constancy and firmness do not forsake he he neither intermit the necessary care of life nor forget the proper preparation for death though dejection and lowness of spirit be as he himself tell we part of he distemper yet even this in some measure give way to that vigor which the soul receive from a consciousness of innocence about three week before he death he receive a visit at he country house from the reverend mr schulten he intimate friend who find he sit without-door with he wife sister and daughter : after the compliment of form the lady withdraw and leave they to private conversation when boerhaave take occasion to tell he what have be during he illness the chief subject of he thought he have never doubt of the spiritual and immaterial nature of the soul but declare that he have lately have a kind of experimental certainty of the distinction between corporeal and think substance which mere reason and philosophy can not afford and opportunity of contemplate the wonderful and inexplicable union of soul and body which nothing but long sickness can give this he illustrate by a description of the effect which the infirmity of he body have upon he faculty which yet they do not so oppress or vanquish but he soul be always master of itself and always resign to the pleasure of its maker he relate with great concern that once he patience so far give way to extremity of pain that after have lain fifteen hour in exquisite torture he pray to god that he might be set free by death mr schulten by way of consolation answer that he think such wish when force by continue and excessive torment unavoidable in the present state of human nature that the best man even job himself be not able to refrain from such start of impatience this he do not deny but say he that love god ought to think nothing desirable but what be most please to the supreme goodness such be he sentiment and such he conduct in this state of weakness and pain : as death approach nearer he be so far from terror or confusion that he seem even less sensible of pain and more cheerful under he torment which continue till the 23rd day of September 1738 on which he die between four and five in the morning in the 70th year of he age thus die boerhaave a man form by nature for great design and guide by religion in the exertion of he ability he be of a robust and athletick constitution of body so harden by early severity and wholesome fatigue that he be insensible of any sharpness of air or inclemency of weather he be tall and remarkable for extraordinary strength there be in he air and motion something rough and artless but so majestick and great at the same time that no man ever look upon he without veneration and a kind of tacit submission to the superiority of he genius the vigor and activity of he mind sparkle visibly in he eye nor be it ever observe that any change of he fortune or alteration in he affair whether happy or unfortunate affect he countenance he be always cheerful and desirous of promote mirth by a facetious and humorous conversation he be never sour by calumny and detraction nor ever think it necessary to confute they for they be spark say he which if you do not blow they will go out of themselves yet he take care never to provoke enemy by severity of censure for he never dwell on the fault or defect of other and be so far from inflame the envy of he rival by dwelling on he own excellency that he rarely mention himself or he writings he be not to be overawe or depress by the presence frown or insolence of great man but persist on all occasion in the right with a resolution always present and always calm he be modest but not timorous and firm without rudeness he could with uncommon readiness and certainty make a conjecture of man 's inclination and capacity by they aspect he method of life be to study in the morning and evening and to allot the middle of the day to he publick business he usual exercise be ride till in he latter year he distemper make it more proper for he to walk : when he be weary he amuse himself with play on the violin he greatest pleasure be to retire to he house in the country where he have a garden store with all the herb and tree which the climate would bear here he use to enjoy he hour unmolested and prosecute he study without interruption the diligence with which he pursue he study be sufficiently evident from he success statesman and general may grow great by unexpected accident and a fortunate concurrence of circumstance neither procure nor foresee by themselves but reputation in the learn world must be the effect of industry and capacity boerhaave lose none of he hour but when he have attain one science attempt another he add physick to divinity chymistry to the mathematick and anatomy to botany he examine system by experiment and form experiment into system he neither neglect the observation of other nor blindly submit to celebrated name he neither think so highly of himself as to imagine he could receive no light from book nor so meanly as to believe he could discover nothing but what be to be learn from they he examine the observation of other man but trust only to he own nor be he unacquaint with the art of recommend truth by elegance and embellish the philosopher with polite literature : he know that but a small part of mankind will sacrifice they pleasure to they improvement and those author who would find many reader must endeavor to please while they instruct he know the importance of he own writings to mankind and lest he might by a roughness and barbarity of style too frequent among man of great learning disappoint he own intention and make he labor less useful he do not neglect the politer art of eloquence and poetry thus be he learning at once various and exact profound and agreeable but he knowledge however uncommon hold in he character but the second place he virtue be yet much more uncommon than he learn he be a admirable example of temperance fortitude humility and devotion he piety and a religious sense of he dependance on god be the basis of all he virtue and the principle of he whole conduct he be too sensible of he weakness to ascribe any thing to himself or to conceive that he could subdue passion or withstand temptation by he own natural power he attribute every good thought and every laudable action to the father of goodness be once ask by a friend who have often admire he patience under great provocation whether he know what it be to be angry and by what mean he have so entirely suppress that impetuous and ungovernable passion he answer with the utmost frankness and sincerity that he be naturally quick of resentment but that he have by daily prayer and meditation at length attain to this mastery over himself as soon as he arise in the morning it be throughout he whole life he daily practice to retire for a hour to private prayer and meditation this he often tell he friend give he spirit and vigor in the business of the day and this he therefore commend as the best rule of life for nothing he know could support the soul in all distress but a confidence in the supreme be nor can a steady and rational magnanimity flow from any other source than a consciousness of the divine favor he assert on all occasion the divine authority and sacred efficacy of the holy scripture and maintain that they alone teach the way of salvation and that they only could give peace of mind the excellency of the christian religion be the frequent subject of he conversation a strict obedience to the doctrine and a diligent imitation of the example of we bless savior he often declare to be the foundation of true tranquillity he recommend to he friend a careful observation of the precept of mose concern the love of god and man he worship god as he be in himself without attempt to inquire into he nature he desire only to think of god what god know of himself there he stop lest by indulge he own idea he should form a deity from he own imagination and sin by fall down before he to the will of god he pay a absolute submission without endeavor to discover the reason of he determination and this he account the first and most inviolable duty of a christian when he hear of a criminal condemn to die he use to think : who can tell whether this man be not better than i or if i be better it be not to be ascribe to myself but to the goodness of god such be the sentiment of boerhaave whose word we have add in the note -lrb- 39 -rrb- so far be this man from be make impious by philosophy or vain by knowledge or by virtue that he ascribe all he ability to the bounty and all he goodness to the grace of god may he example extend its influence to he admirer and follower may those who study he writings imitate he life and those who endeavor after he knowledge aspire likewise to he piety he marry September 17 1710 mary drolenveaux the only daughter of a burgomaster of leyden by whom he have joanna marium who survive she father and three other child who die in they infancy the work of this great writer be so generally know and so highly esteem that though it may not be improper to enumerate they in the order of time in which they be publish it be wholly unnecessary to give any other account of they he publish in 1707 institutione medica to which he add in 1708 aphorismi de cognoscendis et curandis morbis 1710 index stirpium in horto academico 1719 de materia medica et remediorum formulis liber and in 1727 a second edition 1720 alter index stirpium & c adorn with plate and contain twice the number of plant as the former 1722 epistolum ad cl ruischium qua sententiam malpighianam de glandulis defendit 1724 atroci nee prius descriptus morbi historia illustrissimi baronis wassenariae 1725 opera anatomica et chirurgica andreae vesalii with the life of vesalius 1728 altera atroci rarissimique morbi marchionis de sancto albano historia auctores de lue aphrodisiaca cum tractatu praefixo 1731 aretaeus cappadoci nova editio 1732 elementa chemia 1734 observata de argento vivo ad reg soc et acad scient these be the writings of the great boerhaave which have make all encomium useless and vain since no man can attentively peruse they without admire the ability and reverence the virtue of the author -lrb- 40 -rrb- blake at a time when a nation be engage in a war with a enemy whose insult ravages and barbarity have long call for vengeance a account of such english commander as have merit the acknowledgment of posterity by extend the power and raise the honor of they country seem to be no improper entertainment for we reader -lrb- 41 -rrb- we shall therefore attempt a succinct narration of the life and action of admiral blake in which we have nothing further in view than to do justice to he bravery and conduct without intend any parallel between he achievement and those of we present admiral robert blake be bear at bridgewater in somersetshire in August 1598 he father be a merchant of that place who have acquire a considerable fortune by the spanish trade of he earliest year we have no account and therefore can amuse the reader with none of those prognostick of he future action so often meet with in memoirs in 1615 he enter into the university of oxford where he continue till 1623 though without be much countenance or caress by he superior for he be more than once disappoint in he endeavor after academical preferment it be observable that mr wood in he athen oxonieus ascribe the repulse he meet with at wadham college where he be competitor for a fellowship either to want of learning or of stature with regard to the first objection the same writer have before inform we that he be a early riser and studious though he sometimes relieve he attention by the amusement of fowling and fishing as it be highly probable that he do not want capacity we may therefore conclude upon this confession of he diligence that he could not fail of be learn at least in the degree requisite to the enjoyment of a fellowship and may safely ascribe he disappointment to he want of stature it be the custom of sir henry savil -lrb- 42 -rrb- then warden of that college to pay much regard to the outward appearance of those who solicit preferment in that society so much do the greatest event owe sometimes to accident or folly he afterwards retire to he native place where he live say clarendon without any appearance of ambition to be a greater man than he be but inveigh with great freedom against the license of the time and power of the court in 1640 he be choose burgess for bridgewater by the puritan party to whom he have recommend himself by the disapprobation of bishop laud 's violence and severity and he non-compliance with those new ceremony which he be then endeavor to introduce when the civil war break out blake in conformity with he avowed principle declare for the parliament and think a bare declaration for right not all the duty of a good man raise a troop of dragoon for he party and appear in the field with so much bravery that he be in a short time advance without meet any of those obstruction which he have encounter in the university in 1645 he be governor of tauntou when the lord goring come before it with a army of ten thousand man the town be ill fortify and unsupplied with almost every thing necessary for support a siege the state of this garrison encourage colonel windham who be acquaint with blake to propose a capitulation which be reject by blake with indignation and contempt nor be either menace or persuasion of any effect for he maintain the place under all its disadvantage till the siege be raise by the parliament 's army he continue on many other occasion to give proof of a insuperable courage and a steadiness of resolution not to be shake and as a proof of he firm adherence to the parliament join with the borough of taunton in return thanks for they resolution to make no more address to the king yet be he so far from approve the death of charle the first that he make no scruple of declare that he would venture he life to save he as willingly as he have do to serve the parliament in February 1648-9 he be make a commissioner of the navy and appoint to serve on that element for which he seem by nature to have be design he be soon afterwards send in pursuit of prince rupert whom he shut up in the harbor of kinsale in ireland for several month till want of provision and despair of relief excite the prince to make a daring effort for he escape by force through the parliament 's fleet : this design he execute with he usual intrepidity and succeed in it though with the loss of three ship he be pursue by blake to the coast of portugal where he be receive into the tagus and treat with great distinction by the portuguese blake come to the mouth of that river send to the king a messenger to inform he that the fleet in he port belong to the publick enemy of the commonwealth of england he demand leave to fall upon it this be refuse though the refusal be in very soft term and accompany with declaration of esteem and a present of provision so exasperate the admiral that without any hesitation he fall upon the portuguese fleet then return from brasil of which he take seventeen ship and burnt three it be to no purpose that the king of portugal alarm at so unexpected a destruction order prince rupert to attack he and retake the brasil ship blake carry home he prize without molestation the prince not have force enough to pursue he and well pleased with the opportunity of quit a port where he could no longer be protect blake soon supply he fleet with provision and receive order to make reprisal upon the french who have suffer they privateer to molest the english trade a injury which in those day be always immediately resent and if not repair certainly punish sailing with this commission he take in he way a french man of war value at a million how this ship happen to be so rich we be not inform but as it be a cruiser it be probable the rich lading be the accumulate plunder of many prize then follow the unfortunate rupert whose fleet by storm and battle be now reduce to five ship into carthagena he demand leave of the spanish governor to attack he in the harbor but receive the same answer which have be return before by the portuguese : that they have a right to protect all ship that come into they dominion that if the admiral be force in thither he should find the same security and that he require he not to violate the peace of a neutral port blake withdraw upon this answer into the mediterranean and rupert then leave carthagena enter the port of malaga where he burn and sink several english merchant ship blake judge this to be a infringement of the neutrality profess by the spaniard now make no scruple to fall upon rupert 's fleet in the harbor of malaga and have destroy three of he ship oblige he to quit the sea and take sanctuary at the spanish court in February 1650-1 blake still continue to cruise in the mediterranean meet a french ship of considerable force and command the captain to come on board there be no war declare between the two nation the captain when he come be ask by he whether he be willing to lay down he sword and yield which he gallantly refuse though in he enemy 's power blake scorn to take advantage of a artifice and detest the appearance of treachery tell he that he be at liberty to go back to he ship and defend it as long as he could the captain willingly accept he offer and after a fight of two hour confess himself conquer kiss he sword and surrender it in 1652 break out the memorable war between the two commonwealth of england and holland a war in which the greatest admiral that perhaps any age have produce be engage on each side in which nothing less be contest than the dominion of the sea and which be carry on with vigor animosity and resolution proportion to the importance of the dispute the chief commander of the dutch fleet be van trump de ruyter and de witt the most celebrated name of they own nation and who have be perhaps more renowned have they be oppose by any other enemy the state of holland have carry on they trade without opposition and almost without competition not only during the unactive reign of jame the first but during the commotion of england have arrive to that height of naval power and that affluence of wealth that with the arrogance which a long-continued prosperity naturally produce they begin to invent new claim and to treat other nation with insolence which nothing can defend but superiority of force they have for some time make uncommon preparation at a vast expense and have equip a large fleet without any apparent danger threaten they or any avowed design of attack they neighbor this unusual armament be not behold by the english without some jealousy and care be take to fit out such a fleet as might secure the trade from interruption and the coast from insult of this blake be constitute admiral for nine month in this situation the two nation remain keep a watchful eye upon each other without act hostility on either side till the 18th of may 1652 when van trump appear in the downs with a fleet of forty-five man of war blake who have then but twenty ship upon the approach of the dutch admiral salute he with three single shot to require that he should by strike he flag show that respect to the english which be due to every nation in they own dominion to which the dutchman answer with a broadside and blake perceive that he intend to dispute the point of honor advance with he own ship before the rest of he fleet that if it be possible a general battle might be prevent but the dutch instead of admit he to treat fire upon he from they whole fleet without any regard to the custom of war or the law of nation blake for some time stand alone against they whole force till the rest of he squadron come up the fight be continue from between four and five in the afternoon till nine at night when the dutch retire with the loss of two ship have not destroy a single vessel nor more than fifteen man most of which be on board the admiral who as he write to the parliament be himself engage for four hour with the main body of the dutch fleet be the mark at which they aim and as whitlock relate receive above a thousand shot blake in he letter acknowledge the particular blessing and preservation of god and ascribe he success to the justice of he cause the dutch have first attack he upon the english coast it be indeed little less than miraculous that a thousand great shot should not do more execution and those who will not admit the interposition of providence may draw at least this inference from it that the bravest man be not always in the greatest danger in July he meet the dutch fishery fleet with a convoy of twelve man of war all which he take with one hundred of they herring-bus and in September be station in the downs with about sixty sail he discover the dutch admiral de witt and de ruyter with near the same number and advance towards they but the dutch be oblige by the nature of they coast and shallowness of they river to build they ship in such a manner that they require less depth of water than the english vessel take advantage of the form of they shipping and sheltered themselves behind a flat call kentish knock so that the english find some of they ship aground be oblige to alter they course but perceive early the next morning that the hollander have forsake they station they pursue they with all the speed that the wind which be weak and uncertain allow but find themselves unable to reach they with the bulk of they fleet and therefore detach some of the lightest frigate to chase they these come so near as to fire upon they about three in the afternoon but the dutch instead of tack about hoist they sail steer toward they own coast and finding themselves the next day follow by the whole english fleet retire into goree the sailor be eager to attack they in they own harbor but a council of war be convene it be judge imprudent to hazard the fleet upon the shoal or to engage in any important enterprise without a fresh supply of provision that in this engagement the victory belong to the english be beyond dispute since without the loss of one ship and with no more than forty man kill they drive the enemy into they own port take the rearadmiral and another vessel and so discourage the dutch admiral who have not agree in they measure that de ruyter who have declare against hazard a battle desire to resign he commission and de witt who have insist upon fight fall sick as it be suppose with vexation but how great the loss of the dutch be be not certainly know that two ship be take they be too wise to deny but affirm that those two be all that be destroy the english on the other side affirm that three of they vessel be disabled at the first encounter that they number on the second day be visibly diminish and that on the last day they see three or four ship sink in they flight de witt be now discharge by the hollander as unfortunate and the chief command restore to van trump great preparation be make for retrieve they reputation and repair those loss they endeavor be assist by the english themselves now make factious by success the man who be intrust with the civil administration be jealous of those whose military command have procure so much honor lest they who raise they should be eclipse by they such be the general revolution of affair in every state danger and distress produce unanimity and bravery virtue which be seldom unattended with success but success be the parent of pride and pride of jealousy and faction faction make way for calamity and happy be that nation whose calamity renew they unanimity such be the rotation of interest that equally tend to hinder the total destruction of a people and to obstruct a exorbitant increase of power blake have weaken he fleet by many detachment and lay with no more than forty sail in the downs very ill provide both with man and ammunition and expect new supplies from those whose animosity hinder they from provide they and who choose rather to see the trade of they country distressed than the sea officer exalt by a new acquisition of honor and influence van trump desirous of distinguish himself at the resumption of he command by some remarkable action have assemble eighty ship of war and ten fireship and steer towards the downs where blake with whose condition and strength he be probably acquaint be then station blake not able to restrain he natural ardor or perhaps not fully inform of the superiority of he enemy put out to encounter they though he fleet be so weakly man that half of he ship be oblige to lie idle without engage for want of sailor the force of the whole dutch fleet be therefore sustain by about twenty-two ship two of the english frigate name the vanguard and the victory after have for a long time stand engage amidst the whole dutch fleet break through without much injury nor do the english lose any ship till the evening when the garland carry forty gun be board at once by two great ship which be oppose by the english till they have scarcely any man leave to defend the deck then retire into the lower part of the vessel they blow up they deck which be now possess by the enemy and at length be overpower and take the bonaventure a stout well-built merchant ship go to relieve the garland be attack by a man of war and after a stout resistance in which the captain who defend she with the utmost bravery be kill be likewise carry off by the dutch blake in the triumph see the garland in distress press forward to relieve she but in he way have he foremast shatter and be himself board but beat off the enemy he disengage himself and retire into the thame with the loss only of two ship of force and four small frigate but with he whole fleet much shatter nor be the victory gain at a cheap rate notwithstanding the unusual disproportion of strength for of the dutch flagship one be blow up and the other two disabled a proof of the english bravery which should have induce van trump to have spare the insolence of carry a broom at he top-mast in he triumphant passage through the channel which he intend as a declaration that he would sweep the sea of the english shipping this which he have little reason to think of accomplish he soon after perish in attempt there be sometimes observation and inquiry which all historian seem to decline by agreement of which this action may afford we a example : nothing appear at the first view more to demand we curiosity or afford matter for examination than this wild encounter of twenty-two ship with a force accord to they account who favor the dutch three time superior nothing can justify a commander in fight under such disadvantage but the impossibility of retreat but what hinder blake from retire as well before the fight as after it to say he be ignorant of the strength of the dutch fleet be to impute to he a very criminal degree of negligence and at least it must be confess that from the time he see they he could not but know that they be too powerful to be oppose by he and even then there be time for retreat to urge the ardor of he sailor be to divest he of the authority of a commander and to charge he with the most reproachful weakness that can enter into the character of a general to mention the impetuosity of he own courage be to make the blame of he temerity equal to the praise of he valor which seem indeed to be the most gentle censure that the truth of history will allow we must then admit amidst we eulogy and applause that the great the wise and the valiant blake be once betray to a inconsiderate and desperate enterprise by the resistless ardor of he own spirit and a noble jealousy of the honor of he country it be not long before he have a opportunity of reveng he loss and restrain the insolence of the dutch on the 18th of February 1652-3 blake be at the head of eighty sail and assist at he own request by colonel monk and dean espy van trump with a fleet of above one hundred man of war as clarendon relate of seventy by they own publick account and three hundred merchant ship under he convoy the english with they usual intrepidity advance towards they and blake in the triumph in which he always lead he fleet with twelve ship more come to a engagement with the main body of the dutch fleet and by the disparity of they force be reduce to the last extremity have receive in he hull no fewer than seven hundred shot when lawson in the fairfax come to he assistance the rest of the english fleet now come in and the fight be continue with the utmost degree of vigor and resolution till the night give the dutch a opportunity of retire with the loss of one flagship and six other man of war the english have many vessel damage but none lose on board lawson 's ship be kill one hundred man and as many on board blake 's who lose he captain and secretary and himself receive a wound in the thigh blake have set ashore he wounded man sail in pursuit of van trump who send he convoy before and himself retire fight towards bulloign blake order he light frigate to follow the merchant still continue to harass van trump and on the third day the 20th of February the two fleet come to another battle in which van trump once more retire before the english and make use of the peculiar form of he shipping secure himself in the shoal the account of this fight as of all the other be various but the dutch writer themselves confess that they lose eight man of war and more than twenty merchant ship and it be probable that they suffer much more than they be willing to allow for these repeat defeat provoke the common people to riot and insurrection and oblige the state to ask though ineffectually for peace in April follow the form of government in england be change and the supreme authority assume by cromwell upon which occasion blake with he associate declare that notwithstanding the change in the administration they should still be ready to discharge they trust and to defend the nation from insult injury and encroachment it be not say blake the business of a sea-man to mind state affair but to hinder foreigner from fool we this be the principle from which he never deviate and which he always endeavor to inculcate in the fleet as the surest foundation of unanimity and steadiness disturb not one another with domestick dispute but remember that we be english and we enemy be foreigner enemy which let what party soever prevail it be equally the interest of we country to humble and restrain after the 30th of April 1653 blake monk and dean sail out of the english harbor with one hundred man of war and find the dutch with seventy sail on they own coast drive they to the texel and take fifty dogger then they sail northward in pursuit of van trump who have a fleet of merchant under he convoy durst not enter the channel but steer towards the sound and by great dexterity and address escape the three english admiral and bring all he ship into they harbor then know that blake be still in the north come before dover and fire upon that town but be drive off by the castle monk and dean station themselves again at the mouth of the texel and block up the dutch in they own port with eighty sail but hear that van trump be at goree with one hundred and twenty man of war they order all ship of force in the river and port to repair to they on June the 3rd the two fleet come to a engagement in the beginning of which dean be carry off by a cannon-ball yet the fight continue from about twelve to six in the afternoon when the dutch give way and retreat fight on the 4th in the afternoon blake come up with eighteen fresh ship and procure the english a complete victory nor could the dutch any otherwise preserve they ship than by retire once more into the flat and shallows where the largest of the english vessel could not approach in this battle van trump board viceadmiral penn but be beat off and himself board and reduce to blow up he deck of which the english have get possession he be then enter at once by penn and another nor could possibly have escape have not de ruyter and de witt arrive at that instant and rescue he however the dutch may endeavor to extenuate they loss in this battle by admit no more than eight ship to have be take or destroy it be evident that they must have receive much greater damages not only by the account of more impartial historian but by the remonstrance and exclamation of they admiral themselves van trump declare before the state that without a numerous reinforcement of large man of war he could serve they no more and de witt cry out before they with the natural warmth of he character : why should i be silent before my lord and master the english be we master and by consequence master of the sea in November 1654 blake be send by cromwell into the mediterranean with a powerful fleet and may be say to have receive the homage of all that part of the world be equally court by the haughty spaniard the surly dutch and the lawless algerine in march 1656 have force algier to submission he enter the harbor of tuni and demand reparation for the robbery practice upon the english by the pirate of that place and insist that the captive of he nation should be set at liberty the governor have plant battery along the shore and draw up he ship under the castle send blake a haughty and insolent answer : there be we castle of goletta and porto ferino say he upon which you may do you worst add other menace and insult and mention in term of ridicule the inequality of a fight between ship and castle blake have likewise demand leave to take in water which be refuse he fire with this inhuman and insolent treatment he curl he whisker as be he custom when he be angry and enter porto ferino with he great ship discharge he shot so fast upon the battery and castle that in two hour the gun be dismount and the work forsake though he be at first expose to the fire of sixty cannon he then order he officer to send out they long boat well man to seize nine of the piratical ship lie in the road himself continue to fire upon the castle this be so bravely execute that with the loss of only twenty-five man kill and forty-eight wound all the ship be fire in the sight of tuni thence sailing to tripolus he conclude a peace with that nation then return to tunis he find nothing but submission and such indeed be he reputation that he meet with no further opposition but collect a kind of tribute from the prince of those country he business be to demand reparation for all the injury offer to the english during the civil war he exact from the duke of tuscany 60000_l _ and as it be say send home sixteen ship laden with the effect which he have receive from several state the respect with which he oblige all foreigner to treat he countryman appear from a story relate by bishop burnet when he lay before malaga in a time of peace with spain some of he sailor go ashore and meet a procession of the host not only refuse to pay any respect to it but laugh at those that do the people be put by one of the priest upon resent this indignity fall upon they and beat they severely when they return to they ship they complain of they ill treatment upon which blake send to demand the priest who have procure it the viceroy answer that have no authority over the priest he could not send he : to which blake reply that he do not inquire into the extent of the viceroy 's authority but that if the priest be not send within three hour he would burn the town the viceroy then send the priest to he who plead the provocation give by the seaman blake bravely and rationally answer that if he have complain to he he would have punish they severely for he would not have he man affront the established religion of any place but that he be angry that the spaniard should assume that power for he would have all the world know that a englishman be only to be punish by a englishman so have use the priest civilly he send he back be satisfy that he be in he power this conduct so much pleased cromwell that he read the letter in council with great satisfaction and say he hope to make the name of a englishman as great as ever that of a roman have be in 1650 the protector have declare war against spain despatch blake with twenty-five man of war to infest they coast and intercept they shipping in pursuance of these order he cruise all winter about the strait and then lay at the mouth of the harbor of cale where he receive intelligence that the spanish plata fleet lay at anchor in the bay of santa cruz in the isle of teneriffe on the 13th of April 1657 he depart from cale and on the 20th arrive at santa cruz where he find sixteen spanish vessel the bay be defend on the north side by a castle well mount with cannon and in other part with seven fort with cannon proportion to the bigness all unite by a line of communication man with musketeer the spanish admiral draw up he small ship under the cannon of the castle and station six great galleon with they broadside to the sea : a advantageous and prudent disposition but of little effect against the english commander who determine to attack they order stayner to enter the bay with he squadron : then post some of he larger ship to play upon the fortification himself attack the galleon which after a gallant resistance be at length abandon by the spaniard though the least of they be bigger than the biggest of blake 's ship the fort and smaller vessel be now shatter and forsake the whole fleet be set on fire the galleon by blake and the smaller vessel by stayner the english vessel be too much shatter in the fight to bring they away thus be the whole pla fleet destroy and the spaniard accord to rapin 's remark sustain a great loss of ship money man and merchandise while the english gain nothing but glory as if he that increase the military reputation of a people do not increase they power and he that weaken he enemy in effect strengthen himself the whole action say clarendon be so incredible that all man who know the place wonder that any sober man with what courage soever endowed would ever have undertake it and they could hardly persuade themselves to believe what they have do while the spaniard comfort themselves with the belief that they be devil and not man who have destroy they in such a manner so much a strong resolution of bold and courageous man can bring to pass that no resistance or advantage of ground can disappoint they and it can hardly be imagine bow small a loss the english sustained in this unparalleled action not one ship be leave behind and the kill and wound not exceed two hundred man when the slaughter on board the spanish ship and on shore be incredible the general cruise for some time afterwards with he victorious fleet at the mouth of cale to intercept the spanish shipping but find he constitution break by the fatigue of the last three year determine to return home and die before he come to land he body be embalmed and have lie some time in state at greenwich house be bury in henry the seventh 's chapel with all the funeral solemnity due to the remains of a man so famed for he bravery and so spotless in he integrity nor be it without regret that i be oblige to relate the treatment he body meet a year after the restoration when it be take up by express command and bury in a pit in st margaret 's church-yard have he be guilty of the murder of charle the first to insult he body have be a mean revenge but as he be innocent it be at least inhumanity and perhaps ingratitude let no man say the oriental proverb pull a dead lion by the beard but that regard which be deny he body have be pay to he better remain he name and he memory nor have any writer dare to deny he the praise of intrepidity honesty contempt of wealth and love of he country he be the first man say clarendon that decline the old track and make it apparent that the science might be attain in less time than be imagine he be the first man that bring ship to contemn castle on shore which have ever be think very formidable but be discover by he to make a noise only and to fright those who could rarely be hurt by they he be the first that infuse that proportion of courage into seaman by make they see by experience what mighty thing they could do if they be resolve and teach they to fight in fire as well as upon the water and though he have be very well imitate and follow be the first that give the example of that kind of naval courage and bold and resolute achievement to this attestation of he military excellence it may be proper to subjoin a account of he moral character from the author of life english and foreign he be jealous say that writer of the liberty of the subject and the glory of he nation and as he make use of no mean artifice to raise himself to the highest command at sea so he need no interest but he merit to support he in it he scorn nothing more than money which as fast as it come in be lay out by he in the service of the state and to show that he be animated by that brave publick spirit which have since be reckon rather romantick than heroick and he be so disinterested that though no man have more opportunity to enrich himself than he who have take so many million from the enemy of england yet he throw it all into the publick treasury and do not die five hundred pound richer than he father leave he which the author aver from he personal knowledge of he family and they circumstance have be breed up in it and often hear he brother give this account of he he be religious accord to the pretended purity of these time but would frequently allow himself to be merry with he officer and by he tenderness and generosity to the seaman have so endeared himself to they that when he die they lament he loss as that of a common father instead of more testimony he character may be properly conclude with one incident of he life by which it appear how much the spirit of blake be superior to all private view he brother in the last action with the spaniard have not do he duty be at blake 's desire discard and the ship be give to another yet be he not less regardful of he as a brother for when he die he leave he he estate know he well qualify to adorn or enjoy a private fortune though he have find he unfit to serve he country in a publick character and have therefore not suffer he to rob it \* \* \* \* \* the follow brief synopsis of blake 's life differ in some slight particulars from johnson 's memoir be take from aubrey 's letter ii p 241 admirall blake be bear at in com somerset be of albon hall in oxford he be there a young man of strong body and good part he be a early riser and studye well but also take he robust pleasure of fishing and fowling & c he would steale swanne -lrb- 43 -rrb- -- he serve in the house of comon for a  dnus he be make admiral he do the greatest action at sea that ever be do he die a  dnus and be bury in kh 7th 's chapell but upon the returne of the kinge he body be take up again and remove by mr well ' occasion and where it be now i know not qu mr well of bridgewater -- ed sir franci drake -lrb- 44 -rrb- franci drake be the son of a clergyman in devonshire who be incline to the doctrine of the protestant at that time much oppose by henry the eighth be oblige to fly from he place of residence into kent for refuge from the persecution raise against he and those of the same opinion by the law of the six article how long he live there or how he be support be not know nor have we any account of the first year of sir franci drake 's life of any disposition to hazard and adventure which might have be discover in he childhood or of the education which qualify he for such wonderful attempt we be only inform that he be put apprentice by he father to the master of a small vessel that trade to france and the low country under whom he probably learn the rudiment of navigation and familiarize himself to the danger and hardship of the sea but how few opportunity soever he might have in this part of he life for the exercise of he courage he give so many proof of diligence and fidelity that he master die unmarried leave he he little vessel in reward of he service a circumstance that deserve to be remember not only as it may illustrate the private character of this brave man but as it may hint to all those who may hereafter propose he conduct for they imitation that virtue be the surest foundation both of reputation and fortune and that the first step to greatness be to be honest if it be not improper to dwell longer on a incident at the first view so inconsiderable it might be add that it deserve the reflection of those who when they be engage in affair not adequate to they ability pass they over with a contemptuous neglect and while they amuse themselves with chimerical scheme and plan of future undertaking suffer every opportunity of smaller advantage to slip away as unworthy they regard they may learn from the example of drake that diligence in employment of less consequence be the most successful introduction to greater enterprise after have follow for some time he master 's profession he grow weary of so narrow a province and have sell he little vessel venture he effect in the new trade to the west indy which have not be long discover and very little frequented by the english till that time be conceive so much to abound in wealth that no voyage thither could fail of be recompense by great advantage nothing be talk of among the mercantile or adventurous part of mankind but the beauty and riches of the new world fresh discovery be frequently make new country and nation never hear of before be daily describe and it may easily be conclude that the relater do not diminish the merit of they attempt by suppress or diminish any circumstance that might produce wonder or excite curiosity nor be they vanity only engage in raise admirer but they interest likewise in procure adventurer who be indeed easily gain by the hope which naturally arise from new prospects though through ignorance of the american sea and by the malice of the spaniard who from the first discovery of those country consider every other nation that attempt to follow they as invader of they rights the best concerted design often miscarry among those who suffer most from the spanish injustice be captain john hawkin who have be admit by the viceroy to traffick in the bay of mexico be contrary to the stipulation then make between they and in violation of the peace between spain and england attack without any declaration of hostility and oblige after a obstinate resistance to retire with the loss of four ship and a great number of he man who be either destroy or carry into slavery in this voyage drake have adventure almost all he fortune which he in vain endeavor to recover both by he own private interest and by obtain letter from queen elizabeth for the spaniard deaf to all remonstrance either vindicate the injustice of the viceroy or at least forbore to redress it drake thus oppressed and impoverished retain at least he courage and he industry that ardent spirit that prompt he to adventure and that indefatigable patience that enable he to surmount difficulty he do not sit down idly to lament misfortune which heaven have put it in he power to remedy or to repine at poverty while the wealth of he enemy be to be gain but have make two voyage to america for the sake of gain intelligence of the state of the spanish settlement and acquaint himself with the sea and coast he determine on a third expedition of more importance by which the spaniard should find how imprudently they always act who injure and insult a brave man on the 24th of may 1572 franci drake set sail from plymouth in the pascha of seventy ton accompany by the swan of twenty-five ton command by he brother john drake have in both the vessel seventy-three man and boy with a year 's provision and such artillery and ammunition as be necessary for he undertaking which however incredible it may appear to such as consider rather he force than he fortitude be no less than to make reprisal upon the most powerful nation in the world the wind continue favourable they enter June 29th between guadaloupe and dominica and on July 6th see the highland of santa martha then continue they course after have be becalm for some time they arrive at port pheasant so name by drake in a former voyage to the east of nombre de dios here he propose to build he pinnace which he have bring in piece ready frame from plymouth and be go ashore with a few man unarmed but discover a smoke at a distance order the other boat to follow he with a greater force then march towards the fire which be in the top of a high tree he find a plate of lead nail to another tree with a inscription engrave upon it by one garret a englishman who have leave that place but five day before and have take this method of inform he that the spaniard have be advertise of he intention to anchor at that place and that it therefore would be prudent to make a very short stay there but drake know how convenient this place be for he design and consider that the hazard and waste of time which could not be avoid in seek another station be equivalent to any other danger which be to be apprehend from the spaniard determine to follow he first resolution only for he greater security he order a kind of palisade or fortification to be make by fell large tree and lay the trunk and branch one upon another by the side of the river on July 20th have build they pinnace and be join by one captain rause who happen to touch at the same place with a bark of fifty man they set sail towards nombre de dios and take two frigate at the island of pine be inform by the negro which they find in they that the inhabitant of that place be in expectation of some soldier which the governor of panama have promise to defend they from the symeron or fugitive negro who have escape from the tyranny of they master in great number have settle themselves under two king or leader on each side of the way between nombre de dios and panama and not only assert they natural right to liberty and independence but endeavor to revenge the cruelty they have suffer and have lately put the inhabitant of nombre de dios into the utmost consternation these negro the captain set on shore on the mainland so that they might by join the symeron recover they liberty or at least might not have it in they power to give the people of nombre de dios any speedy information of he intention to invade they then select fifty-three man from he own company and twenty from the crew of he new associate captain rause he embark with they in he pinnace and set sail for nombre de dios on July the 28th at night he approach the town undiscovered and dropt he anchor under the shore intend after he man be refresh to begin the attack but find that they be terrifying each other with formidable account of the strength of the place and the multitude of the inhabitant he determine to hinder the panick from spread further by lead they immediately to action and therefore order they to they par he land without any opposition there be only one gunner upon the bay though it be secure with six brass cannon of the largest size ready mount but the gunner while they be throw the cannon from they carriage alarm the town as they soon discover by the bell the drum and the noise of the people drake leave twelve man to guard the pinnace march round the town with no great opposition the man be more hurt by tread on the weapon leave on the ground by the fly enemy than by the resistance which they encounter at length have take some of the spaniard drake command they to show he the governor 's house where the mule that bring the silver from panama be unloaded there they find the door open and enter the room where the silver be reposited find it heap up in bar in such quantity as almost exceed belief the pile be they conjecture seventy foot in length ten in breadth and twelve in height each bar weigh between thirty and forty-five pound it be easy to imagine that at the sight of this treasure nothing be think on by the english but by what mean they might best convey it to they boat and doubtless it be not easy for drake who consider they distance from the shore and the number of they enemy be afraid of be intercept in he retreat to hinder he man from encumber themselves with so much silver as might have retard they march and obstruct the use of they weapon however by promise to lead they to the king 's treasurehouse where there be gold and jewel to a far greater value and where the treasure be not only more portable but nearer the coast he persuade they to follow he and rejoin the main body of he man then draw up under the command of he brother in the market-place here he find he little troop much discourage by the imagination that if they stay any longer the enemy would gain possession of they pinnace and that they should then without any means of safety be leave to stand alone against the whole power of that country drake not indeed easily terrify but sufficiently cautious send to the coast to inquire the truth and see if the same terror have take possession of the man whom he have leave to guard he boat but find no foundation for these dreadful apprehension he persist in he first design and lead the troop forward to the treasurehouse in they way there fall a violent shower of rain which wet some of they bowstring and extinguish many of they match a misfortune which might soon have be repair and which perhaps the enemy might suffer in common with they but which however on this occasion very much embarrassed they as the delay produce by it repress that ardor which sometimes be only to be keep up by continue action and give time to the timorous and slothful to spread they insinuation and propagate they cowardice some whose fear be they predominant passion be continually magnify the number and courage of they enemy and represent whole nation as ready to rush upon they other whose avarice mingle with they concern for they own safety be more solicitous to preserve what they have already gain than to acquire more and other brave in themselves and resolute begin to doubt of success in a undertaking in which they be associate with such cowardly companion so that scarcely any man appear to proceed in they enterprise with that spirit and alacrity which could give drake a prospect of success this he perceive and with some emotion tell they that if after have have the chief treasure of the world within they reach they should go home and languish in poverty they could blame nothing but they own cowardice that he have perform he part and be still desirous to lead they on to riches and to honor then find that either shame or conviction make they willing to follow he he order the treasurehouse to be force and command he brother and oxenham of plymouth a man know afterwards for he bold adventure in the same part to take charge of the treasure he command the other body to follow he to the market-place that he might be ready to oppose any scattered troops of the spaniard and hinder they from unite into one body but as he step forward he strength fail he on a sudden and he fall down speechless then it be that he companion perceive a wound in he leg which he have receive in the first encounter but hitherto conceal lest he man easily discourage should make they concern for he life a pretence for return to they boat such have be he loss of blood as be discover upon nearer observation that it have fill the print of he footstep and it appear scarce credible that after such effusion of blood life should remain the bravest be now willing to retire : neither the desire of honor nor of riches be think enough to prevail in any man over he regard for he leader drake whom cordial have now restore to he speech be the only man who could not be prevail on to leave the enterprise unfinished it be to no purpose that they advise he to submit to go on board to have he wound dress and promise to return with he and complete they design he well know how impracticable it be to regain the opportunity when it be once lose and could easily foresee that a respite but of a few hour would enable the spaniard to recover from they consternation to assemble they force refit they battery and remove they treasure what he have undergo so much danger to obtain be now in he hand and the thought of leave it untouch be too mortifying to be patiently bear however as there be little time for consultation and the same danger attend they stay in that perplexity and confusion as they return they bind up he wound with he scarf and partly by force partly by entreaty carry he to the boat in which they all embark by break of day then take with they out of the harbor a ship load with wine they go to the bastimente a island about a league from the town where they stay two day to repose the wound man and to regale themselves with the fruit which grow in great plenty in the garden of that island during they stay here there come over from the mainland a spanish gentleman send by the governor with instruction to inquire whether the captain be that drake who have be before on they coast whether the arrow with which many of they man be wound be not poison and whether they want provision or other necessaries the messenger likewise extol they courage with the highest encomium and express he admiration of they daring undertaking drake though he know the civility of a enemy be always to be suspect and that the messenger amidst all he profession of regard be no other than a spy yet know that he have nothing to apprehend treated he with the highest honor that he condition admit of in answer to he inquiry he assure he that he be the same drake with whose character they be before acquaint that he be a rigid observer of the law of war and never permit he arrow to be poison : he then dismiss he with considerable present and tell he that though he have unfortunately fail in this attempt he would never desist from he design till he have share with spain the treasure of america they then resolve to return to the isle of pine where they have leave they ship and consult about the measure they be now to take and have arrive August 1st at they former station they dismiss captain rause who judge it unsafe to stay any longer on the coast desire to be no longer engage in they design but drake not to be discourage from he purpose by a single disappointment after have inquire of a negro whom he take on board at nombre de dios the most wealthy settlement and weakest part of the coast resolve to attack carthagena and set sail without loss of time come to anchor August 13th between charesha and st barnard two island at a little distance from the harbor of carthagena then pass with he boat round the island he enter the harbor and in the mouth of it find a frigate with only a old man in it who voluntarily inform they that about a hour before a pinnace have pass by with sail and oar and all the appearance of expedition and importance that as she pass the crew on board she bid they take care of themselves and that as soon as she touch the shore they hear the noise of cannon fire as a warning and see the shipping in the port draw up under the gun of the castle the captain who have himself hear the discharge of the artillery be soon convince that he be discover and that therefore nothing could be attempt with any probability of success he therefore contented himself with take a ship of seville of two hundred and forty ton which the relater of this voyage mention as a very large ship and two small frigate in which he find letter of advice from nombre de dios intend to alarm that part of the coast drake now find he pinnace of great use and not have a sufficient number of sailor for all he vessel be desirous of destroy one of he ship that he pinnace might be better man : this necessary as it be could not easily be do without disgust he company who have make several prosperous voyage in that vessel would be unwilling to have it destroy drake well know that nothing but the love of they leader could animate he follower to encounter such hardship as he be about to expose they to and therefore rather choose to bring he design to pass by artifice than authority he send for the carpenter of the swan take he into he cabin and have first engage he to secrecy order he in the middle of the night to go down into the well of the ship and bear three hole through the bottom lay something against they that might hinder the bubbling of the water from be hear to this the carpenter after some expostulation consent and the next night perform he promise in the morning August 15 drake go out with he pinnace a fishing row up to the swan and have invite he brother to partake of he diversion inquire with a negligent air why they bark be so deep in the water upon which the steward go down return immediately with a account that the ship be leaky and in danger of sink in a little time they have recourse immediately to the pump but have labor till three in the afternoon and gain very little upon the water they willingly accord to drake 's advice set the vessel on fire and go on board the pinnace find it now necessary to lie conceal for some time till the spaniard should forget they danger and remit they vigilance they set sail for the sound of darien and without approach the coast that they course might not be observe they arrive there in six day this be a convenient place for they reception both on account of privacy as it be out of the road of all trade and as it be well supply with wood water wild fowl hog deer and all kind of provision he stay here fifteen day to clean he vessel and refresh he man who work interchangeably on one day the one half and on the next the other on the 5th day of September drake leave he brother with the ship at darien and set out with two pinnace towards the rio grande which they reach in three day and on the 9th be discover by a spaniard from the bank who believe they to be he countryman make a signal to they to come on shore with which they very readily comply but he soon find he mistake abandon he plantation where they find great plenty of provision with which have laden they vessel they depart so great be the quantity of provision which they amass here and in other place that in different part of the coast they build four magazine or storehouse which they fill with necessaries for the prosecution of they voyage these they place at such a distance from each other that the enemy if he should surprise one might yet not discover the rest in the mean time he brother captain john drake go accord to the instruction that have be leave he in search of the symeron or fugitive negro from whose assistance alone they have now any prospect of a successful voyage and touch upon the mainland by means of the negro whom they have take from nombre de dios engage two of they to come on board he pinnace leave two of they own man as hostage for they return these man have assure drake of the affection of they nation appoint a interview between he and they leader so leave port plenty in the isle of pine so name by the english from the great store of provision which they have amass at that place they come by the direction of the symeron into a secret bay among beautiful island cover with tree which conceal they ship from observation and where the channel be so narrow and rocky that it be impossible to enter it by night so that there be no danger of a sudden attack here they meet and enter into engagement which common enemy and common danger preserve from violation but the first conversation inform the english that they expectation be not immediately to be gratify for upon they inquiry after the most probable means of gain gold and silver the symeron tell they that have they known sooner the chief end of they expedition they could easily have gratify they but that during the rainy season which be now begin and which continue six month they could not recover the treasure which they have take from the spaniard out of the river in which they have conceal it drake therefore propose to wait in this place till the rain be past build with the assistance of the symeron a fort of earth and timber and leave part of he company with the symeron set out with three pinnace towards carthagena being of a spirit too active to lie still patiently even in a state of plenty and security and with the most probable expectation of immense riches on the 16th of October he anchor within sight of carthagena without landing and on the 17th go out to sea take a spanish bark with which they enter the harbor where they be accost by a spanish gentleman whom they have some time before take and set at liberty who come to they in a boat as he pretend without the knowledge of the governor make they great promise of refreshment and profession of esteem but drake have wait till the next morning without receive the provision he have be prevail upon to expect find that all this pretend kindness be no more than a stratagem to amuse he while the governor be raise force for he destruction October 20 they take two frigate come out of carthagena without lade why the spaniard know drake to lie at the mouth of the harbor send out they vessel on purpose to be take do not appear perhaps they think that in order to keep possession of he prize he would divide he company and by that division be more easily destroy in a few hour afterwards they send out two frigate well man which drake soon force to retire and have sink one of he prize and burn the other in they sight leap afterwards ashore single in defiance of they troops which hover at a distance in the wood and on the hill without ever venture to approach within reach of the shot from the pinnace to leap upon a enemy 's coast in sight of a superior force only to show how little they be fear be a act that would in these time meet with little applause nor can the general be seriously commend or rationally vindicate who expose he person to destruction and by consequence he expedition to miscarriage only for the pleasure of a idle insult a insignificant bravado all that can be urge in he defense be that perhaps it might contribute to heighten the esteem of he follower as few man especially of that class be philosophical enough to state the exact limit of prudence and bravery or not to be dazzle with a intrepidity how improperly soever exert it may be add that perhaps the spaniard whose notion of courage be sufficiently romantick might look upon he as a more formidable enemy and yield more easily to a hero of whose fortitude they have so high a idea however find the whole country advertise of he attempt and in arm to oppose he he think it not proper to stay longer where there be no probability of success and where he might in time be overpower by multitude and therefore determine to go forward to rio de heha this resolution when it be know by he follower throw they into astonishment and the company of one of he pinnace remonstrate to he that though they place the highest confidence in he conduct they could not think of undertake such a voyage without provision have only a gammon of bacon and a small quantity of bread for seventeen man drake answer they that there be on board he vessel even a greater scarcity but yet if they would adventure to share he fortune he do not doubt of extricate they from all they difficulty such be the heroick spirit of drake that he never suffer himself to be divert from he design by any difficulty nor ever think of relieve he exigency but at the expense of he enemy resolution and success reciprocally produce each other he have not sail more than three league before they discover a large ship which they attack with all the intrepidity that necessity inspire and happily find it laden with excellent provision but find he crew grow faint and sickly with they manner of living in the pinnace which be less commodious than on board the ship he determine to go back to the symeron with whom he leave he brother and part of he force and attempt by they conduct to make he way over and invade the spaniard in the inland part where they would probably never dream of a enemy when they arrive at port diego so name from the negro who have procure they they intercourse with the symeron they find captain john drake and one of he company dead be kill in attempt almost unarmed to board a frigate well provide with all thing necessary for its defense the captain be unwilling to attack it and represent to they the madness of they proposal but be overborne by they clamor and importunity to avoid the imputation of cowardice comply to he destruction so dangerous be it for the chief commander to be absent nor be this they only misfortune for in a very short time many of they be attack by the calenture a malignant fever very frequent in the hot climate which carry away among several other joseph drake another brother of the commander while drake be employ in take care of the sick man the symeron who range the country for intelligence bring he a account that the spanish fleet be arrive at nombre de dios the truth of which be confirm by a pinnace which he send out to make observation this therefore be the time for they journey when the treasure of the american mine be to be transport from panama over land to nombre de dios he therefore by the direction of the symeron furnish himself with all thing necessary and on February 3 set out from port diego have lose already twenty-eight of he company and be under the necessity of leave some to guard he ship he take with he only eighteen english and thirty symeron who not only serve as guide to show the way but as purveyor to procure provision they carry not only arrow for war but for hunting and fowl the head of which be proportion in size to the game which they be pursue : for oxen stag or wild boar they have arrow or javelin with head weigh a pound and half which they discharge near hand and which scarcely ever fail of be mortal the second sort be about half as heavy as the other and be generally shoot from they bow these be intend for smaller beast with the third sort of which the head be a ounce in weight they kill bird as this nation be in a state that do not set they above continual care for the immediate necessaries of life he that can temper iron best be among they most esteemed and perhaps it would be happy for every nation if honor and applause be as justly distribute and he be most distinguished whose ability be most useful to society how many chimerical title to precedence how many false pretence to respect would this rule bring to the ground every day by sunrise they begin to march and have travel till ten rest near some river till twelve then travel again till four they repose all night in house which the symeron have either leave standing in they former march or very readily erect for they by set up three or four post in the ground and lay pole from one to another in form of a roof which they thatch with palmetto bough and plantain leave in the valley where they be sheltered from the wind they leave three or four foot below open but on the hill where they be more expose to the chill blast of the night they thatch they close to the ground leave only a door for entrance and a vent in the middle of the room for the smoke of three fire which they make in every house in they march they meet not only with plenty of fruit upon the bank of the river but with wild swine in great abundance of which the symeron without difficulty kill for the most part as much as be want one day however they find a otter and be about to dress it at which drake express he wonder be ask by pedro the chief symeron : be you a man of war and in want and yet doubt whether this be meat that have blood in it for which drake in private rebuke he say the relater whether justly or not it be not very important to determine there seem to be in drake 's scruple somewhat of superstition perhaps not easily to be justified and the negro 's answer be at least martial and will i believe be generally acknowledge to be rational on the third day of they march feb 6 they come to a town of the symeron situate on the side of a hill and encompass with a ditch and a mudwall to secure it from a sudden surprise : here they live with great neatness and plenty and some observation of religion pay great reverence to the cross a practice which drake prevail upon they to change for the use of the lord 's prayer here they importune drake to stay for a few day promise to double he strength but he either think greater number unnecessary or fear that if any difference should arise he should be overborne by the number of symeron or that they would demand to share the plunder that should be take in common or for some other reason that might easily occur refuse any addition to he troop endeavor to express he refusal in such term as might heighten they opinion of he bravery he then proceed on he journey through cool shades and lofty wood which sheltered they so effectually from the sun that they march be less toilsome than if they have travel in england during the heat of the summer four of the symeron that be acquaint with the way go about a mile before the troop and scatter branch to direct they then follow twelve symeron after whom come the english with the two leader and the other symeron close the rear on February 11 they arrive at the top of a very high hill on the summit of which grow a tree of wonderful greatness in which they have cut step for the more easy ascent to the top where there be a kind of tower to which they invite drake and from thence show he not only the north sea from whence they come but the great south sea on which no english vessel have ever sail this prospect exciting he natural curiosity and ardor for adventure and discovery he lift up he hand to god and implore he blessing upon the resolution which he then form of sailing in a english ship on that sea then continue they march they come after two day into a open level country where they passage be somewhat incommoded with the grass which be of a peculiar kind consist of a stalk like that of wheat and a blade on which the ox and other cattle feed till it grow too high for they to reach then the inhabitant set it on fire and in three day it spring up again this they be oblige to do thrice a year so great be the fertility of the soil at length be within view of panama they leave all frequented road for fear of be discover and post themselves in a grove near the way between panama and nombre de dios then they send a symeron in the habit of a negro of panama to inquire on what night the reco or driver of mule by which the treasure be carry be to set forth the messenger be so well qualify for he undertaking and so industrious in the prosecution of it that he soon return with a account that the treasurer of lima intend to return to europe would pass that night with eight mule laden with gold and one with jewel have receive this information they immediately march towards venta cruz the first town on the way to nombre de dios send for security two symeron before who as they go perceive by the scent of a match that some spaniard be before they and go silently forward surprise a soldier asleep upon the ground they immediately bind he and bring he to drake who upon inquiry find that they spy have not deceive they in he intelligence the soldier have inform himself of the captain 's name conceive such a confidence in he well known clemency that after have make a ample discovery of the treasure that be now at hand he petition not only that he would command the symeron to spare he life but that when the treasure should fall into he hand he would allow he as much as might maintain he and he mistress since they be about to gain more than they whole company could carry drake then order he man to lie down in the long grass about fifty pace from the road half on one side with himself and half on the other with oxenham and the captain of the symeron so much behind that one company might seize the foremost recoe and the other the hindermost for the mule of these reco or driver be tie together travel on a line and be all guide by lead the first when they have lie about a hour in this place they begin to hear the bell of the mule on each hand upon which order be give that the drive which come from venta cruz should pass unmolested because they carry nothing of great value and those only be intercept which be travel thither and that none of the man should rise up till the signal should be give but one robert pike heat with strong liquor leave he company and prevail upon one of the symeron to creep with he to the wayside that they might signalize themselves by seize the first mule and hear the trampling of a horse as he lay could not be restrain by the symeron from rise up to observe who be pass by this he do so imprudently that he be discover by the passenger for by drake 's order the english have put they shirt on over they coat that the night and tumult might not hinder they from know one another the gentleman be immediately observe by drake to change he trot into a gallop but the reason of it not appear it be imputed to he fear of the robber that usually infest that road and the english still continue to expect the treasure in a short time one of the reco that be pass towards venta cruz come up and be eagerly seize by the english who expect nothing less than half the revenue of the indy nor be it easy to imagine they mortification and perplexity when they find only two mule laden with silver the rest have no other burden than provision the driver be bring immediately to the captain and inform he that the horseman whom he have observe pass by with so much precipitation have inform the treasurer of what he have observe and advise he to send back the mule that carry he gold and jewel and suffer only the rest to proceed that he might by that cheap experiment discover whether there be any ambush on the way that drake be not less disgusted than he follower at the disappointment can not be doubt but there be now no time to be spend in complaint the whole country be alarm and all the force of the spaniard be summon to overwhelm he he have no fortress to retire to every man be he enemy and every retreat better know to the spaniard than to himself this be a occasion that demand all the quality of a hero a intrepidity never to be shake and a judgment never to be perplexed he immediately consider all the circumstance of he present situation and find that it afford he only the choice of march back the same way through which he come or of force he passage to venta cruz to march back be to confess the superiority of he enemy and to animate they to the pursuit the wood would afford opportunity of ambush and he follower must often disperse themselves in search of provision who would become a easy prey dispirit by they disappointment and fatigue by they march on the way to venta cruz he should have nothing to fear but from open attack and expect enemy determine therefore to pass forward to venta cruz he ask pedro the leader of the symeron whether he be resolve to follow he and have receive from he the strongest assurance that nothing should separate they command he man to refresh themselves and prepare to set forward when they come within a mile of the town they dismiss the mule which they have make use of for they more easy and speedy passage and continue they march along a road cut through thick wood in which a company of soldier who be quarter in the place to defend it against the symeron have post themselves together with a convent of friar head by one of they brethren whose zeal against the northern heresy have incite he to hazard he person and assume the province of a general drake who be advertise by two symeron whom he send before of the approach of the spaniard command he follower to receive the first volley without firing in a short time he hear himself summon by the spanish captain to yield with a promise of protection and kind treatment to which he answer with defiance contempt and the discharge of he pistol immediately the spaniard pour in they shoot by which only one man be kill and drake with some other slightly wound upon which the signal be give by drake 's whistle to fall upon they the english after discharge they arrow and shoot press furiously forward and drive the spaniard before they which the symeron whom the terror of the shot have drive to some distance observe and recall they courage animated each other with song in they own language and rush forward with such impetuosity that they overtake they near the town and support by the english disperse they with the loss of only one man who after he have receive he wound have strength and resolution leave to kill he assailant they pursue the enemy into the town in which they meet with some plunder which be give to the symeron and treat the inhabitant with great clemency drake himself go to the spanish lady to assure they that no injury should be offer they so inseparable be humanity from true courage have thus break the spirit and scatter the force of the spaniard he pursue he march to he ship without any apprehension of danger yet with great speed be very solicitous about the state of the crew so that he allow he man harass as they be but little time for sleep or refreshment but by kind exhortation gentle authority and a cheerful participation of all they hardship prevail upon they to bear without murmur not only the toil of travel but on some day the pain of hunger in this march he owe much of he expedition to the assistance of the symeron who be accustom to the climate and naturally robust not only bring he intelligence and show the way but carry necessaries provide victuals and build lodgings and when any of the english faint in the way two of they would carry he between they for two mile together nor be they valor less than they industry after they have learn from they english companion to despise the firearm of the spaniard when they be within five league of the ship they find a town build in they absence by the symeron at which drake consent to halt send a symeron to the ship with he gold toothpick as a token which though the master know it be not sufficient to gain the messenger credit till upon examination he find that the captain have order he to regard no messenger without he handwriting have engraven he name upon it with the point of he knife he then send the pinnace up the river which they meet and afterwards send to the town for those whose weariness have make they unable to march further on February 23 the whole company be reunite and drake whose good or ill success never prevail over he piety celebrate they meeting with thanks to god drake not yet discourage now turn he thought to new prospects and without languish in melancholy reflection upon he past miscarriage employ himself in form scheme for repair they eager of action and acquaint with man 's nature he never suffer idleness to infect he follower with cowardice but keep they from sink under any disappointment by divert they attention to some new enterprise upon consultation with he own man and the symeron he find they divide in they opinion some declare that before they engage in any new attempt it be necessary to increase they store of provision and other urge that the ship in which the treasure be convey should be immediately attack the symeron propose a third plan and advise he to undertake another march over land to the house of one pezoro near veragua whose slave bring he every day more than two hundred pound sterling from the mine which he heap together in a strong stone house which might by the help of the english be easily force drake be unwilling to fatigue he follower with another journey determine to comply with both the other opinion and man he two pinnace the bear and the minion he send john oxenham in the bear towards tolu to seize upon provision and go himself in the minion to the cabeza to intercept the treasure that be to be transport from veragua and that coast to the fleet at nombre de dios first dismiss with present those symeron that desire to return to they wife and order those that choose to remain to be entertain in the ship drake take at the cabeza a frigate of nicaragua the pilot of which inform he that there be in the harbor of veragua a ship freight with more than a million of gold to which he offer to conduct he be well acquaint with the sounding if he might be allow he share of the prize so much be he avarice superior to he honesty drake after some deliberation comply with the pilot 's importunity sail towards the harbor but have no sooner enter the mouth of it than he hear the report of artillery which be answer by other at a greater distance upon which the pilot tell he that they wero discover this be the signal appoint by the governor to alarm the coast drake now think it convenient to return to the ship that he might inquire the success of the other pinnace which he find with a frigate that she have take with twenty-eight fat hog two hundred hen and great store of maize or indian corn the vessel itself be so strong and well build that he fit it out for war determine to attack the fleet at nombre de dios on march the 21st he set sail with the new frigate and the bear towards the cabeza at which he arrive in about two day and find there ttu a frenchman with a ship of war who after have receive from he a supply of water and other necessaries entreat that he might join with he in he attempt which drake consent to admit he to accompany he with twenty of he man stipulate to allow they a equal share of whatever booty they should gain yet be they not without some suspicion of danger from this new ally he have eighty man and they be now reduce to thirty-one then man the frigate and two pinnace they set sail for the cabeza where they leave the frigate which be too large for the shallows over which they be to pass and proceed to rio francisco here they land and have order the pinnace to return to the same place on the fourth day follow travel through the wood towards nombre de dios with such silence and regularity as surprised the french who do not imagine the symeron so discreet or obedient as they appear and be therefore in perpetual anxiety about the fidelity of they guide and the probability of they return nor do the symeron treat they with that submission and regard which they pay to the english whose bravery and conduct they have already try at length after a laborious march of more than seven league they begin to hear the hammer of the carpenter in the bay it be the custom in that hot season to work in the night and in a short time they perceive the approach of the reco or drove of mule from panama they now no longer doubt that they labor would be reward and every man imagine himself secure from poverty and labor for the remain part of he life they therefore when the mule come up rush out and seize they with a alacrity proportion to they expectation the three drove consist of one hundred and nine mule each of which carry three hundred pound ' weight of silver it be to little purpose that the soldier order to guard the treasure attempt resistance after a short combat in which the french captain and one of the symeron be wound it appear with how much greater ardor man be animated by interest than fidelity as it be possible for they to carry away but a small part of this treasure after have weary themselves with hide it in hole and shallow water they determine to return by the same way and without be pursue enter the wood where the french captain be disable by he wound be oblige to stay two of he company continue with he when they have go forward about two league the frenchman miss another of they company who upon inquiry be know to be intoxicate with wine and suppose to have lose himself in the wood by neglect to observe the guide but common prudence not allow they to hazard the whole company by too much solicitude for a single life they travel on towards rio francisco at which they arrive April the 3rd but look out for they pinnace be surprise with the sight of seven spanish shallop and immediately conclude that some intelligence of they motion have be carry to nombre de dios and that these vessel have be fit out to pursue they which might undoubtedly have overpower the pinnace and they feeble crew nor do they suspicion stop here but immediately it occur to they that they man have be compel by torture to discover where they frigate and ship be station which be weakly man and without the presence of the chief commander would fall into they hand almost without resistance and all possibility of escape be entirely cut off these reflection sink the whole company into despair and every one instead of endeavor to break through the difficulty that surround he resign up himself to he ill fortune when drake whose intrepidity be never to be shake and whose reason be never to be surprised or embarrassed represent to they that though the spaniard should have make themselves master of they pinnace they might yet be hinder from discover the ship he put they in mind that the pinnace could not be take the man examine they examination compare the resolution form they vessel send out and the ship take in a instant some time must necessarily be spend before the last blow could be strike and if that time be not negligently lose it might be possible for some of they to reach the ship before the enemy and direct they to change they station they be animated with this discourse by which they discover that they leader be not without hope but when they come to look more nearly into they situation they be unable to conceive upon what it be found to pass by land be impossible as the way lay over high mountain through thick wood and deep river and they have not a single boat in they power so that a passage by water seem equally impracticable but drake whose penetration immediately discover all the circumstance and inconveniency of every scheme soon determine upon the only means of success which they condition afford they and order he man to make a raft out of the tree that be then float on the river offer himself to put off to sea upon it and cheerfully ask who would accompany he john owen john smith and two frenchman who be willing to share he fortune embark with he on the raft which be fit out with a sail make of a biscuit-sack and a oar to direct its course instead of a rudder then have comfort the rest with assurance of he regard for they and resolution to leave nothing unattempted for they deliverance he put off and after have with much difficulty sail three league descry two pinnace hast towards he which upon a nearer approach he discover to be he own and perceive that they anchor behind a point that jut out into the sea he put to shore and cross the land on foot be receive by he company with that satisfaction which be only know to those that have be acquaint with danger and distress the same night they row to rio francisco where they take in the rest with what treasure they have be able to carry with they through the wood then sail back with the utmost expedition they return to they frigate and soon after to they ship where drake divide the gold and silver equally between the french and the english here they spend about fourteen day in fitting out they frigate more completely and then dismiss the spaniard with they ship lay a few day among the cabeza while twelve english and sixteen symeron travel once more into the country as well to recover the french captain whom they have leave wound as to bring away the treasure which they have hide in the sand drake whom he company would not suffer to hazard he person in another land expedition go with they to rio francisco where he find one of the frenchman who have stay to attend they captain and be inform by he upon he inquiry after he fortune that half a hour after they separation the spaniards come upon they and easily seize upon the wound captain but that he companion might have escape with he have he not prefer money to life for see he throw down a box of jewel that retard he he could not forbear take it up and with that and the gold which he have already be so loaded that he could not escape with regard to the bar of gold and silver which they have conceal in the ground he inform they that two thousand man have be employ in digging for they the man however either mistrust the informer 's veracity or confident that what they have hide could not be find pursue they journey but upon they arrival at the place find the ground turn up for two mile round and be able to recover no more than thirteen bar ' of silver and a small quantity of gold they discover afterwards that the frenchman who be leave in the wood fall afterwards into the hand of the spaniard be tortured by they till he confess where drake have conceal he plunder so fatal to drake 's expedition be the drunkenness of he follower then dismiss the french they pass by carthagena with they color fly and soon after take a frigate laden with provision and honey which they value as a great restorative and then sail away to the cabeza here they stay about a week to clean they vessel and fit they for a long voyage determine to set sail for england and that the faithful symeron might not go away unrewarded break up they pinnace and give they the iron the most valuable present in the world to a nation whose only employment be war and hunting and amongst whom show and luxury have no place pedro they captain be desire by drake to go through the ship and to choose what he most desire fix he eye upon a cimetar set with diamond which the french captain have present to drake and be unwilling to ask for so valuable a present offer for it four large quoit or thick plate of gold which he have hitherto conceal but drake desirous to show he that fidelity be seldom without a recompense give it he with the highest profession of satisfaction and esteem pedro receive it with the utmost gratitude inform he that by bestow it he have confer greatness and honor upon he for by present it to he king he doubt not of obtain the highest rank amongst the symeron he then persist in he resolution of leave the gold which be generously throw by drake into the common stock for he say that those at whose expense he have be send out ought to share in all the gain of the expedition whatever pretence cavil and chicanery might supply for the appropriation of any part of it thus be drake 's character consistent with itself he be equally superior to avarice and fear and through whatever danger he might go in quest of gold he think it not valuable enough to be obtain by artifice or dishonesty they now forsake the coast of america which for many month they have keep in perpetual alarm have take more than two hundred ship of all size between carthagena and nombre de dios of which they never destroy any unless they be fit out against they nor ever detain the prisoner longer than be necessary for they own security or concealment provide for they in the same manner as for themselves and protect they from the malice of the symerous a behavior which humanity dictate and which perhaps even policy can not disapprove he must certainly meet with obstinate opposition who make it equally dangerous to yield as to resist and who leave he enemy no hope but from victory what riches they acquire be not particularly related but it be not to be doubt that the plunder of so many vessel together with the silver which they seize at nombre de dios must amount to a very large sum though the part that be allot to drake be not sufficient to lull he in effeminacy or to repress he natural inclination to adventure they arrive at plymouth on the 9th of August 1573 on Sunday in the afternoon and so much be the people delighted with the news of they arrival that they leave the preacher and run in crowd to the quay with shout and congratulation drake have in he former expedition have a view of the south sea and form a resolution to sail upon it do not suffer himself to be divert from he design by the prospect of any difficulty that might obstruct the attempt nor any danger that might attend the execution obstacle which brave man often find it much more easy to overcome than secret envy and domestick treachery drake 's reputation be now sufficiently advance to incite detraction and opposition and it be easy to imagine that a man by nature superior to mean artifice and breed from he earliest year to the labor and hardship of a sea-life be very little acquaint with policy and intrigue very little verse in the method of application to the powerful and great and unable to obviate the practice of those whom he merit have make he enemy nor be such the only opponent of great enterprise : there be some man of narrow view and grovel conception who without the instigation of personal malice treat every new attempt as wild and chimerical and look upon every endeavor to depart from the beaten track as the rash effort of a warm imagination or the glitter speculation of a exalted mind that may please and dazzle for a time but can produce no real or lasting advantage these man value themselves upon a perpetual skepticism upon believe nothing but they own sens upon call for demonstration where it can not possibly be obtain and sometimes upon hold out against it when it be lay before they upon invent argument against the success of any new undertaking and where argument can not be find upon treat it with contempt and ridicule such have be the most formidable enemy of the great benefactor to mankind and to these we can hardly doubt but that much of the opposition which drake meet with be to be attribute for they notion and discourse be so agreeable to the lazy the envious and the timorous that they seldom fail of become popular and direct the opinion of mankind whatsoever be he obstacle and whatsoever the motive that produce they it be not till the year 1577 that he be able to assemble a force proportion to he design and to obtain a commission from the queen by which he be constitute captain-general of a fleet consist of five vessel of which the pelican admiral of a hundred ton be command by himself the elizabeth viceadmiral of eighty ton by john winter the marigold of thirty ton by john thoma the swan fifty ton by john chester the christopher of fifteen ton by thoma moche the same as it seem who be carpenter in the former voyage and destroy one of the ship by drake 's direction these ship equip partly by himself and partly by other private adventurer he man with one hundred and sixty-four stout sailor and furnish with such provision as he judge necessary for the long voyage in which he be engage nor do he confine he concern to naval store or military preparation but carry with he whatever he think might contribute to raise in those nation with which he should have any intercourse the highest idea of the politeness and magnificence of he native country he therefore not only procure a complete service of silver for he own table and furnish the cook-room with many vessel of the same metal but engage several musician to accompany he rightly judge that nothing would more excite the admiration of any savage and uncivilized people have be drive back by a tempest in they first attempt and oblige to return to plymouth to repair the damages which they have suffer they set sail again from thence on the 13th of December 1577 and on the 25th have sight of cape cantin in barbary from whence they coast on southward to the island of mogador which drake have appoint for the first place of rendezvous and on the 27th bring the whole fleet to anchor in a harbor on the mainland they be soon after they arrival discover by the moor that inhabit those coast who send two of the principal man amongst they on board drake 's ship receive at the same time two of he company as hostage these man he not only treat in the most splendid manner but present with such thing as they appear most to admire it be with he a established maxim to endeavor to secure in every country a kind reception to such englishman as might come after he by treat the inhabitant with kindness and generosity a conduct at once just and politick to the neglect of which may be attribute many of the injury suffer by we sailor in distant country which be generally ascribe rather to the effect of wickedness and folly of we own commander than the barbarity of the native who seldom fall upon any unless they have be first plunder or insult and in reveng the ravages of one crew upon another of the same nation be guilty of nothing but what be countenance by the example of the european themselves but this friendly intercourse be in appearance soon break for on the next day observe the moor make signal from the land they send out they boat as before to fetch they to the ship and one john fry leap ashore intend to become a hostage as on the former day when immediately he be seize by the moor and the crew observe great number to start up from behind the rock with weapon in they hand find it madness to attempt he rescue and therefore provide for they own security by return to the ship fry be immediately carry to the king who be then in continual expectation of a invasion from portugal suspect that these ship be send only to observe the coast and discover a proper harbor for the main fleet but be inform who they be and whither they be bind not only dismiss he captive but make large offer of friendship and assistance which drake however do not stay to receive but be disgust at this breach of the law of commerce and afraid of further violence after have spend some day in search for he man in which he meet with no resistance leave the coast on December 31 some time before fry 's return who be oblige by this accident to somewhat a longer residence among the moor be afterwards send home in a merchant 's ship on January 16 they arrive at cape blanc have in they passage take several spanish vessel here while drake be employ he man in catch fish of which this coast afford great plenty and various kind the inhabitant come down to the seaside with they alisorge or leather bottle to traffick for water which they be willing to purchase with ambergris and other gum but drake compassionate the misery of they condition give they water whenever they ask for it and leave they they commodity to traffick with when they should be again reduce to the same distress without find the same generosity to relieve they here have discharge some spanish ship which they have take they set sail towards the isle of cape verd and on January 28 come to anchor before mayo hope to furnish themselves with fresh water but have land they find the town by the waterside entirely desert and march further up the country see the valley extremely fruitful and abound with ripe fig cocoa and plantain but could by no means prevail upon the inhabitant to converse or traffick with they however they be suffer by they to range the country without molestation but find no water except at such a distance from the sea that the labor of convey it to the ship be greater than it be at that time necessary for they to undergo salt have they want it might have be obtain with less trouble be leave by the sea upon the sand and harden by the sun during the ebb in such quantity that the chief traffick of they island be carry on with it January 31 they pass by st jago a island at that time divide between the native and the portuguese who first enter these island under the show of traffick by degree establish themselves -- claim a superiority over the original inhabitant and harass they with such cruelty that they oblige they either to fly to the wood and mountain and perish with hunger or to take up arm against they oppressor and under the insuperable disadvantage with which they contend to die almost without a battle in defense of they natural rights and ancient possession such treatment have the native of st jago receive which have drive they into the rocky part of the island from whence they make incursion into the plantation of the portuguese sometimes with loss but generally with that success which desperation naturally procure so that the portuguese be in continual alarm and live with the natural consequence of guilt terror and anxiety they be wealthy but not happy and possess the island but not enjoy it they then sail on within sight of fuego a island so call from a mountain about the middle of it continually burn and like the rest inhabit by the portuguese two league to the south of which lie brava which have receive its name from its fertility abound though uninhabited with all kind of fruit and water with great number of spring and brook which would easily invite the possessor of the adjacent island to settle in it but that it afford neither harbor nor anchorage drake after have send out he boat with plummet be not able to find any ground about it and it be report that many experiment have be make with the same success however he take in water sufficient and on the 2nd of February set sail for the strait of magellan on February 17 they pass the equator and continue they voyage with sometimes calm and sometimes contrary wind but without any memorable accident to march 28 when one of they vessel with twenty-eight man and the greatest part of they fresh water on board be to they great discouragement separate from they but they perplexity last not long for on the next day they discover and rejoin they associate in they long course which give they opportunity of observe several animal both in the air and water at that time very little known nothing entertain or surprise they more than the fly fish which be near of the same size with a herr and have fin of the length of he whole body by the help of which when he be pursue by the bonito or great mackerel as soon as he find himself upon the point of be take he spring up into the air and fly forward as long as he wing continue wet moisture be as it seem necessary to make they pliant and moveable and when they become dry and stiff he fall down into the water unless some bark or ship intercept he and dip they again for a second flight this unhappy animal be not only pursue by fish in he natural element but attack in the air where he hope for security by the don or sparkite a great bird that prey upon fish and they species must surely be destroy be not they increase so great that the young fry in one part of the year cover the sea there be another fish name the cuttle of which whole shoal will sometimes rise at once out of the water and of which a great multitude fall into they ship at length have sail without sight of land for sixty-three day they arrive April 5 at the coast of brasil where on the 7th the christopher be separate again from they by a storm after which they sail near the land to the southward and on the 14th anchor under a cape which they afterwards call cape joy because in two day the vessel which they have lose return to they have spend a fortnight in the river of pla to refresh he man after they long voyage and then stand out to sea he be again surprise by a sudden storm in which they lose sight of the swan this accident determine drake to contract the number of he fleet that he might not only avoid the inconvenience of such frequent separation but ease the labor of he man by have more hand in each vessel for this purpose he sail along the coast in quest of a commodious harbor and on may 13 discover a bay which seem not improper for they purpose but which they dare not enter till it be examine a employment in which drake never trust any whatever might be he confidence in he follower on other occasion he well know how fatal one moment 's inattention might be and how easily almost every man suffer himself to be surprise by indolence and security he know the same credulity that might prevail upon he to trust another might induce another to commit the same office to a third and it must be at length that some of they would be deceive he therefore as at other time order the boat to be hoist out and take the line into he hand go on sound the passage till he be three league from he ship when on a sudden the weather change the sky blacken the wind whistle and all the usual forerunner of a storm begin to threaten they nothing be now desire but to return to the ship but the thickness of the fog intercept it from they sight make the attempt little other than desperate by so many unforeseen accident be prudence itself liable to be embarrass so difficult be it sometimes for the quickest sagacity and most enlighten experience to judge what measure ought to be take to trust another to sound a unknown coast appear to drake folly and presumption to be absent from he fleet though but for a hour prove nothing less than to hazard the success of all they labor hardship and danger in this perplexity which drake be not more sensible of than those whom he have leave in the ship nothing be to be omit however dangerous that might contribute to extricate they from it as they could venture nothing of equal value with the life of they general captain thoma therefore have the lightest vessel steer boldly into the bay and take the general aboard drop anchor and lay out of danger while the rest that be in the open sea suffer much from the tempest and the mary a portuguese prize be drive away before the wind the other as soon as the tempest be over discover by the fire which be make on shore where drake be repair to he here go on shore they meet with no inhabitant though there be several house or hut stand in which they find a good quantity of dry fowl and among they a great number of ostrich of which the thigh be as large as those of a sheep these bird be too heavy and unwieldy to rise from the ground but with the help of they wing run so swiftly that the english could never come near enough to shoot at they the indian commonly by hold a large plume of feather before they and walk gently forward drive the ostrich into some narrow neck or point of land then spread a strong net from one side to the other to hinder they from return back to the open field set they dog upon they thus confine between the net and the water and when they be throw on they back rush in and take they not find this harbor convenient or well store with wood and water they leave it on the 15th of may and on the 18th enter another much safer and more commodious which they no sooner arrive at than drake whose restless application never remit send winter to the southward in quest of those ship which be absent and immediately after sail himself to the northward and happily meeting with the swan conduct it to the rest of the fleet after which in pursuance of he former resolution he order it to be break up reserve the iron-work for a future supply the other vessel which they lose in the late storm could not be discover while they be thus employ upon a island about a mile from the mainland to which at low water there be a passage on foot they be discover by the native who appear upon a hill at a distance dancing and hold up they hand as beckon the english to they which drake observe send out a boat with knife bell and bugle and such thing as by they usefulness or novelty he imagine would be agreeable as soon as the english land they observe two man run towards they as depute by the company who come within a little distance and then stand still could not be prevail upon to come nearer the english therefore tie they present to a pole which they fix in the ground and then retire see the indian advance who take what they find upon the pole leave in return such feather as they wear upon they head with a small bone about six inch in length carve round the top and burnished drake observe they inclination to friendship and traffick advance with some of he company towards the hill upon sight of whom the indian range themselves in a line from east to west and one of they run from one end of the rank to the other backwards and forwards bow himself towards the rise and set of the sun hold he hand over he head and frequently stop in the middle of the rank leap up towards the moon which then shine directly over they head thus call the sun and moon the deity they worship to witness the sincerity of they profession of peace and friendship while this ceremony be perform drake and he company ascend the hill to the apparent terror of the indian whose apprehension when the english perceive they peaceably retire which give the native so much encouragement that they come forward immediately and exchange they arrow feather and bone for such trifle as be offer they thus they trade for some time but by frequent intercourse finding that no violence be intend they become familiar and mingled with the english without the least distrust they go quite naked except a skin of some animal which they throw over they shoulder when they lie in the open air they knit up they hair which be very long with a roll of ostrich feather and usually carry they arrow wrap up brit that they may not encumber they they be make with reed head with flint and therefore not heavy they bow be about a ell long they chief ornament be paint which they use of several kind delineate generally upon they body the figure of the sun and moon in honor of they deity it be observable that most nation amongst whom the use of clothes be unknown paint they body such be the practice of the first inhabitant of we own country from this custom do we earliest enemy the pict owe they denomination as it be not probable that caprice or fancy should be uniform there must be doubtless some reason for a practice so general and prevail in distant part of the world which have no communication with each other the original end of paint they body be probably to exclude the cold a end which if we believe some relation be so effectually produce by it that the man thus paint never shiver at the most piercing blast but doubtless any people so harden by continual severity would even without paint be less sensible of the cold than the civilized inhabitant of the same climate however this practice may contribute in some degree to defend they from the injury of winter and in those climate where little evaporate by the pore may be use with no great inconvenience but in hot country where perspiration in greater degree be necessary the native only use unction to preserve they from the other extreme of weather : so well do either reason or experience supply the place of science in savage country they have no canoe like the other indian nor any method of cross the water which be probably the reason why the bird in the adjacent island be so tame that they might be take with the hand have never be before fright or molest the great plenty of fowl and seal which crowd the shallows in such number that they kill at they first arrival two hundred of they in a hour contribute much to the refreshment of the english who name the place seal bay from that animal these seal seem to be the chief food of the native for the english often find raw piece of they flesh half eat and leave as they suppose after a full meal by the indian whom they never know to make use of fire or any art in dress or prepare they victuals nor be they other custom less wild or uncouth than they way of feed one of they have receive a cap off the general 's head and be extremely pleased as well with the honor as the gift to express he gratitude and confirm the alliance between they retire to a little distance and thrust a arrow into he leg let the blood run upon the ground testify as it be probable that he value drake 's friendship above life have stay fifteen day among these friendly savage in 47 deg 30 min s lat on June 3 they set sail towards the south sea and six day afterwards stop at another little bay to break up the christopher then pass on they cast anchor in another bay not more than twenty league distant from the strait of magellan it be now time seriously to deliberate in what manner they should act with regard to the portuguese prize which have be separate from they by the storm have not yet rejoin they to return in search of it be sufficiently mortifying to proceed without it be not only to deprive themselves of a considerable part of they force but to expose they friend and companion whom common hardship and danger have endear to they to certain death or captivity this consideration prevail and therefore on the 18th after prayer to god with which drake never forget to begin a enterprise he put to sea and the next day near port julian discover they associate whose ship be now grow leaky have suffer much both in the first storm by which they be disperse and afterwards in fruitless attempt to regain the fleet drake therefore be desirous to relieve they fatigue enter port julian and as it be he custom always to attend in person when any important business be in hand go ashore with some of the chief of he company to seek for water where he be immediately accost by two native of whom magellan leave a very terrible account have describe they as a nation of giant and monster nor be he narrative entirely without foundation for they be of the largest size though not taller than some englishman they strength be proportion to they bulk and they voice loud boisterous and terrible what be they manners before the arrival of the spaniard it be not possible to discover but the slaughter make of they countryman perhaps without provocation by these cruel intruder and the general massacre with which that part of the world have be depopulate might have raise in they a suspicion of all stranger and by consequence make they inhospitable treacherous and bloody the two who associate themselves with the english appear much pleased with they new guest receive willingly what be give they and very exactly observe every thing that pass seem more particularly delighted with see oliver the master-gunner shoot a english arrow they shoot themselves likewise in emulation but they arrow always fall to the ground far short of he soon after this friendly contest come another who observe the familiarity of he countryman with the stranger appear much displeased and as the englishman perceive endeavor to dissuade they from such a intercourse what effect he argument have be soon after apparent for another of drake 's companion be desirous to show the third indian a specimen of the english valor and dexterity attempt likewise to shoot a arrow but draw it with he full force burst the bowstr upon which the indian who be unacquainted with they other weapon imagine he disarm follow the company as they be walk negligently down towards they boat and let fly they arrow aim particularly at winter who have the bow in he hand he find himself wound in the shoulder endeavor to refit he bow and turn about be pierce with a second arrow in the breast oliver the gunner immediately present he piece at the insidious assailant which fail to take fire give they time to level another flight of arrow by which he be kill nor perhaps have any of they escape surprised and perplexed as they be have not drake with he usual presence of mind animated they courage and direct they motion order they by perpetually change they place to elude as much as they could the aim of they enemy and to defend they body with they target and instruct they by he own example to pick up and break the arrow as they fall which they do with so much diligence that the indian be soon in danger of be disarm then drake himself take the gun which oliver have so unsuccessfully attempt to make use of discharge it at the indian that first begin the fray and have kill the gunner aim it so happily that the hailshot with which it be load tear open he belly and force he to such terrible outcry that the indian though they number increase and many of they countryman show themselves from different part of the adjoining wood be too much terrify to renew the assault and suffer drake without molestation to withdraw he wounded friend who be hurt in he lung languish two day and then die be inter with he companion with the usual ceremony of a military funeral they stay here two month afterwards without receive any other injury from the native who find the danger to which they expose themselves by open hostility and not be able any more to surprise the vigilance of drake prefer they safety to revenge but drake have other enemy to conquer or escape far more formidable than these barbarian and insidious practice to obviate more artful and dangerous than the ambush of the indian for in this place be lay open a design form by one of the gentleman of the fleet not only to defeat the voyage but to murder the general this transaction be relate in so obscure and confuse a manner that it be difficult to form any judgment upon it the writer who give the largest account of it have suppress the name of the criminal which we learn from a more succinct narrative publish in a collection of travels near that time to have be thoma doughtie what be he inducement to attempt the destruction of he leader and the ruin of the expedition or what be he view if he design have succeed what measure he have hitherto take whom he have endeavor to corjupt with what art or what success we be nowhere tell the plot as the narrative assure we be lay before they departure from england and discover in its whole extent to drake himself in he garden at plymouth who nevertheless not only entertain the person so accuse as one of he company but this writer very particularly relate treated he with remarkable kindness and regard set he always at he own table and lodge he in the same cabin with himself nor do ever he discover the least suspicion of he intention till they arrive at this place but appear by the authority with which he invest he to consider he as one to whom in he absence he could most securely intrust the direction of he affair at length in this remote corner of the world he find out a design form against he life call together all he officer lay before they the evidence on which he ground the accusation and summon the criminal who full of all the horror of guilt and confound at so clear a detection of he whole scheme immediately confess he crime and acknowledge himself unworthy of longer life upon which the whole assembly consist of thirty person after have consider the affair with the attention which it require and hear all that could be urge in extenuation of he offence unanimously sign the sentence by which he be condemn to suffer death drake however unwilling as it seem to proceed to extreme severity offer he he choice either of be execute on the island or set ashore on the mainland or be send to england to be try before the council of which after a day 's consideration he choose the first allege the improbability of persuade any to leave the expedition for the sake of transport a criminal to england and the danger of he future state among savage and infidel he choice i believe few will approve : to be set ashore on the mainland be indeed only to be execute in a different manner for what mercy could be expect from the native so incensed but the most cruel and linger death but why he should not rather have request to be send to england it be not so easy to conceive in so long a voyage he might have find a thousand opportunity of escape perhaps with the connivance of he keeper whose resentment must probably in time have give way to compassion or at least by they negligence as it be easy to believe they would in time of ease and refreshment have remit they vigilance at least he would have gain longer life and to make death desirable seem not one of the effect of guilt however he be as it be related obstinately deaf to all persuasion and adhering to he first choice after have receive the communion and dine cheerfully with the general be execute in the afternoon with many proof of remorse but none of fear how far it be probable that drake after have be acquaint with this man 's design should admit he into he fleet and afterwards caress respect and trust he or that doughtie who be represent as a man of eminent ability should engage in so long and hazardous a voyage with no other view than that of defeat it be leave to the determination of the reader what design he could have form with any hope of success or to what action worthy of death he could have proceed without accomplice for none be mention be equally difficult to imagine nor on the other hand though the obscurity of the account and the remote place choose for the discovery of this wicked project seem to give some reason for suspicion do there appear any temptation from either hope fear or interest that might induce drake or any commander in he state to put to death a innocent man upon false pretence after the execution of this man the whole company either convinced of the justice of the proceeding or awed by the severity apply themselves without any murmur or appearance of discontent to the prosecution of the voyage and have break up another vessel and reduce the number of they ship to three they leave the port and on August the 20th enter the strait of magellan in which they struggle with contrary wind and the various danger to which the intricacy of that wind passage expose they till night and then enter a more open sea in which they discover a island with a burning mountain on the 24th they fall in with three more island to which drake give name and landing to take possession of they in the name of he sovereign find in the largest so prodigious a number of bird that they kill three thousand of they in one day this bird of which they know not the name be somewhat less than a wild goose without feather and cover with a kind of down unable to fly or rise from the ground but capable of run and swim with amazing celerity they feed on the sea and come to land only to rest at night or lay they egg which they deposit in hole like those of cony from these island to the south sea the strait become very crooked and narrow so that sometimes by the interposition of headland the passage seem shut up and the voyage entirely stop to double these cape be very difficult on account of the frequent alteration to be make in the course there be indeed as magellan observe many harbor but in most of they no bottom be to be find the land on both side rise into innumerable mountain the top of they be encircle with cloud and vapor which be congeal fall down in snow and increase they height by harden into ice which be never dissolve but the valley be nevertheless green fruitful and pleasant here drake find the strait in appearance shut up go in he boat to make further discovery and have find a passage towards the north be return to he ship but curiosity soon prevail upon he to stop for the sake of observe a canoe or boat with several native of the country in it he could not at a distance forbear admire the form of this little vessel which seem incline to a semicircle the stern and prow standing up and the body sink inward but much greater be he wonder when upon a nearer inspection he find it make only of the bark of tree sew together with thong of sealskin so artificially that scarcely any water enter the seam the people be well shape and paint like those which have be already describe on the land they have a hut build with pole and cover with skin in which they have water-vessel and other utensil make likewise of the bark of tree among these people they have a opportunity of remark what be frequently observable in savage country how natural sagacity and unwearied industry may supply the want of such manufacture or natural production as appear to we absolutely necessary for the support of life the inhabitant of these island be wholly stranger to iron and its use but instead of it make use of the shell of a muscle of prodigious size find upon they coast this they grind upon a stone to a edge which be so firm and solid that neither wood nor stone be able to resist it September 6 they enter the great south sea on which no english vessel have ever be navigate before and propose to have direct they course towards the line that they man who have suffer by the severity of the climate might recover they strength in a warmer latitude but they design be scarce form before they be frustrate for on sept 7 after a eclipse of the moon a storm arise so violent that it leave they little hope of survive it nor be its fury so dreadful as its continuance for it last with little intermission till October 28 fifty-two day during which time they be toss incessantly from one part of the ocean to another without any power of spread they sail or lie upon they anchor amidst shelve shore scatter rock and unknown island the tempest continually roar and the wave dash over they in this storm on the 30th of September the marigold command by captain thoma be separate from they on the 7th of October have enter a harbor where they hope for some intermission of they fatigue they be in a few hour force out to sea by a violent gust which break the cable at which time they lose sight of the elizabeth the viceadmiral whose crew as be afterwards discover wearied with labor and discourage by the prospect of future danger recover the strait on the next day and return by the same passage through which they come sail along the coast of brasil and on the 2nd of June in the year follow arrive at england from this bay they be drive southward to fifty-five degree where among some island they stay two day to the great refreshment of the crew but be again force into the main sea they be toss about with perpetual expectation of perish till soon after they again come to anchor near the same place where they find the native whom the continuance of the storm have probably reduce to equal distress rowing from one island to another and provide the necessaries of life it be perhaps a just observation that with regard to outward circumstance happiness and misery be equally diffuse through all state of human life in civilized country where regular policy have secure the necessaries of life ambition avarice and luxury find the mind at leisure for they reception and soon engage it in new pursuit pursuit that be to be carry on by incessant labor and whether vain or successful produce anxiety and contention among savage nation imaginary want find indeed no place but they strength be exhaust by necessary toil and they passion agitate not by contest about superiority affluence or precedence but by perpetual care for the present day and by fear of perish for want of food but for such reflection as these they have no time for have spend three day in supply themselves with wood and water they be by a new storm drive to the latitude of fifty-six degree where they behold the extremity of the american coast and the confluence of the atlantick and southern ocean here they arrive on the 28th of October and at last be bless with the sight of a calm sea have for almost two month endure such a storm as no traveller have give a account of and such as in that part of the world though accustom to hurricane they be before unacquainted with on the 30th of October they steer away towards the place appoint for the rendezvous of the fleet which be in thirty degree and on the next day discover two island so well stock with fowl that they victual they ship with they and then sail forward along the coast of peru till they come to thirty-seven degree where find neither of they ship nor any convenient port they come to anchor November the 25th at mucho a island inhabit by such indian as the cruelty of the spanish conqueror have drive from the continent to whom they apply for water and provision offer they in return such thing as they imagine most likely to please they the indian seem willing to traffick and have present they with fruit and two fat sheep would have show they a place whither they should come for water the next morning accord to agreement the english land with they water-vessel and send two man forward towards the place appoint who about the middle of the way be suddenly attack by the indian and immediately slay nor be the rest of the company out of danger for behind the rock be lodge a ambush of five hundred man who start up from they retreat discharge they arrow into the boat with such dexterity that every one of the crew be wound by they the sea be then high and hinder they from either retire or make use of they weapon drake himself receive a arrow under he eye which pierce he almost to the brain and another in he head the danger of these wound be much increase by the absence of they surgeon who be in the viceadmiral so that they have none to assist they but a boy whose age do not admit of much experience or skill yet so much be they favor by providence that they all recover no reason could be assign for which the indian should attack they with so furious a spirit of malignity but that they mistake they for spaniard whose cruelty might very reasonably incite they to revenge whom they have drive by incessant persecution from they country waste immense tract of land by massacre and devastation on the afternoon of the same day they set sail and on the 30th of November drop anchor in philip bay where they boat have be send out to discover the country return with a indian in he canoe whom they have intercept he be of a graceful stature dress in a white coat or gown reach almost to he knee very mild humble and docile such as perhaps be all the indian till the spaniard teach they revenge treachery and cruelty this indian have be kindly treat be dismiss with present and inform as far as the english could make he understand what they chiefly want and what they be willing to give in return drake order he boat to attend he in he canoe and to set he safe on the land when he be ashore he direct they to wait till he return and meet some of he countryman give they such a account of he reception that within a few hour several of they repair with he to the boat with fowl egg and a hog and with they one of they captain who willingly come into the boat and desire to be convey by the english to the ship by this man drake be inform that no supplies be to be expect here but that southward in a place to which he offer to be he pilot there be great plenty this proposal be accept and on the 5th of December under the direction of the good-natured indian they come to anchor in the harbor call by the spaniard valparaiso near the town of st jame of chiulus where they meet not only with sufficient store of provision and with storehouse full of the wine of chili but with a ship call the captain of morial richly laden have together with large quantity of the same wine some of the fine gold of baldivium and a great cross of gold set with emerald have spend three day in store they ship with all kind of provision in the utmost plenty they depart and land they indian pilot where they first receive he after have reward he much above he expectation or desire they have now little other anxiety than for they friend who have be separate from they and whom they now determine to seek but consider that by enter every creek and harbor with they ship they expose themselves to unnecessary danger and that they boat would not contain such a number as might defend themselves against the spaniard they determine to station they ship at some place where they might commodiously build a pinnace which be of light burden might easily sail where the ship be in danger of be strand and at the same time might carry a sufficient force to resist the enemy and afford better accommodation than could be expect in the boat to this end on the 19th of December they enter a bay near cippo a town inhabit by spaniard who discover they immediately issue out to the number of a hundred horseman with about two hundred naked indian run by they side the english observe they approach retire to they boat without any loss except of one man whom no persuasion or entreaty could move to retire with the rest and who therefore be shoot by the spaniard who exult at the victory command the indian to draw the dead carcass from the rock on which he fall and in the sight of the english behead it then cut off the right hand and tear out the heart which they carry away have first command the indian to shoot they arrow all over the body the arrow of the indian be make of green wood for the immediate service of the day the spaniard with the fear that always harass oppressor forbid they to have any weapon when they do not want they present assistance leave this place they soon find a harbor more secure and convenient where they build they pinnace in which drake go to seek he companion but find the wind contrary he be oblige to return in two day leave this place soon after they sail along the coast in search of fresh water and landing at turapaca they find a spaniard asleep with silver bar lie by he to the value of three thousand ducat : not all the insult which they have receive from he countryman could provoke they to offer any violence to he person and therefore they carry away he treasure without do he any further harm landing in another place they find a spaniard drive eight peruvian sheep which be the beast of burden in that country each laden with a hundred pound weight of silver which they seize likewise and drive to they boat further along the coast lay some indian town from which the inhabitant repair to the ship on float make of sealskin blow full of wind two of which they fasten together and sit between they row with great swiftness and carry considerable burden they very readily trade for glass and such trifle with which the old and the young seem equally delighted arrive at mormorena on the 26th of January drake invite the spaniard to traffick with he which they agree to and supply he with necessaries sell to he among other provision some of those sheep which have be mention whose bulk be equal to that of a cow and whose strength be such that one of they can carry three tall man upon he back they neck be like a camel 's and they head like those of we sheep they be the most useful animal of this country not only afford excellent fleece and wholesome flesh but serve as carriage over rock and mountain where no other beast can travel for they foot be of a peculiar form which enable they to tread firm in the most steep and slippery place on all this coast the whole soil be so impregnate with silver that five ounce may be separate from a hundred pound weight of common earth still coast in hope of meet they friend they anchor on the 7th of February before aria where they take two bark with about eight hundred pound weight of silver and pursue they course seize another vessel laden with linen on the 15th of February 1578 they arrive at lima and enter the harbor without resistance though thirty ship be station there of which seventeen be equip for they voyage and many of they be represent in the narrative as vessel of considerable force so that they security seem to have consist not in they strength but in they reputation which have so intimidate the spaniard that the sight of they own superiority could not rouse they to opposition instance of such panick terror be to be meet with in other relation but as they be for the most part quickly dissipate by reason and reflection a wise commander will rarely find he hope of success on they and perhaps on this occasion the spaniard scarcely deserve a severer censure for they cowardice than drake for he temerity in one of these ship they find fifteen hundred bar of silver in another a chest of money and very rich lading in many of the rest of which the spaniard tamely suffer they to carry the most valuable part away and would have permit they no less peaceably to burn they ship but drake never make war with a spirit of cruelty or revenge or carry hostility further than be necessary for he own advantage or defense they set sail the next morning towards panama in quest of the caca fuego a very rich ship which have sail fourteen day before bind thither from lima which they overtake on the 1st of march near cape francisco and board it find not only a quantity of jewel and twelve chest of ryal of plate but eighty pound weight of gold and twenty-six ton of uncoined silver with piece of work plate to a great value in unlade this prize they spend six day and then dismiss the spaniard stand off to sea be now sufficiently enriched and have lose all hope of find they associate and perhaps begin to be infect with that desire of ease and pleasure which be the natural consequence of wealth obtain by danger and fatigue they begin to consult about they return home and in pursuance of drake 's advice resolve first to find out some convenient harbor where they might supply themselves with wood and water and then endeavor to discover a passage from the south sea into the atlantick ocean a discovery which would not only enable they to return home with less danger and in a shorter time but would much facilitate the navigation in those part of the world for this purpose they have recourse to a port in the island of caine where they meet with fish wood and fresh water and in they course take a ship laden with silk and linen which be the last that they meet with on the coast of america but be desirous of store themselves for a long course they touch April the 15th at guatulco a spanish island where they supply themselves with provision and seize a bushel of ryal of silver from guatulco which lie in 15 deg 40 min they stand out to sea and without approach any land sail forward till on the night follow the 3rd of June be then in the latitude of thirty-eight degree they be suddenly benumb with such cold blast that they be scarcely able to handle the rope this cold increase upon they as they proceed to such a degree that the sailor be discourage from mount upon the deck nor be the effect of the climate to be imputed to the warmth of the region to which they have be lately accustom for the rope be stiff with frost and the meat could scarcely be convey warm to the table on June 17th they come to anchor in 38 deg 30 min when they see the land naked and the tree without leaf and in a short time have opportunity of observe that the native of that country be not less sensible of the cold than themselves for the next day come a man rowing in he canoe towards the ship and at a distance from it make a long oration with very extraordinary gesticulation and great appearance of vehemence and a little time afterwards make a second visit in the same manner and then return a third time he present they after he harangue be finish with a kind of crown of black feather such as they king wear upon they head and a basket of rush fill with a particular herb both which he fasten to a short stick and throw into the boat nor could he be prevail upon to receive any thing in return though push towards he upon a board only he take up a hat which be fling into the water three day afterwards they ship have receive some damage at sea be bring nearer to land that the lading might be take out in order to which the english who have now learn not too negligently to commit they life to the mercy of savage nation raise a kind of fortification with stone and build they tent within it all this be not behold by the inhabitant without the utmost astonishment which incite they to come down in crowd to the coast with no other view as it appear than to worship the new divinity that have condescend to touch upon they country drake be far from countenance they error or take advantage of they weakness to injure or molest they and therefore have direct they to lay aside they bow and arrow he present they with linen and other necessaries of which he show they the use they then return to they habitation about three quarter of a mile from the english camp where they make such loud and violent outcry that they be hear by the english who find that they still persist in they first notion and be pay they they kind of melancholy adoration two day afterwards they perceive the approach of a far more numerous company who stop at the top of a hill which overlook the english settlement while one of they make a long oration at the end of which all the assembly bow they body and pronounce the syllable _ oh _ with a solemn tone as by way of confirmation of what have be say by the orator then the man lay down they bow and leave the woman and child on the top of the hill come down towards the tent and seem transport in the highest degree at the kindness of the general who receive they gift and admit they to he presence the woman at a distance appear seize with a kind of phrensy such as that of old among the pagan in some of they religious ceremony and in honor as it seem of they guest tear they cheek and bosom with they nail and throw themselves upon the stone with they naked body till they be cover with blood these cruel rite and mistaken honor be by no means agreeable to drake whose predominant sentiment be notion of piety and therefore not to make that criminal in himself by he concurrence which perhaps ignorance might make guiltless in they he order he whole company to fall upon they knee and with they eye lift up to heaven that the savage might observe that they worship be address to a be reside there they all join in pray that this harmless and deluded people might be bring to the knowledge of the true religion and the doctrine of we bless savior after which they sing psalm a performance so please to they wild audience that in all they visit they generally first accost they with a request that they would sing they then return all the present which they have receive and retire three day after this on June 25 1579 we general receive two ambassador from the hioh or king of the country who intend to visit the camp require that some token might be send he of friendship and peace this request be readily comply with and soon after come the king attend by a guard of about a hundred tall man and precede by a officer of state who carry a sceptre make of black wood adorn with chain of a kind of bone or horn which be mark of the highest honor among they and have two crown make as before with feather fasten to it with a bag of the same herb which be present to drake at he first arrival behind he be the king himself dress in a coat of cony-skin with a caul weave with feather upon he head a ornament so much in estimation there that none but the domestick of the king be allow to wear it he attendant follow he adorn nearly in the same manner and after they come the common people with basket plait so artificially that they hold water in which by way of sacrifice they bring root and fish drake not lull into security range he man in order of battle and wait they approach who come nearer stand still while the sceptre-bearer make a oration at the conclusion of which they again come forward to the foot of the hill and then the sceptre-bearer begin a song which he accompany with a dance in both which the man join but the woman dance without singing drake now distrust they no longer admit they into he fortification where they continue they song and dance a short time and then both the king and some other of the company make long harangue in which it appear by the rest of they behavior that they entreat he to accept of they country and to take the government of it into he own hand for the king with the apparent concurrence of the rest place the crown upon he head grace he with the chain and other sign of authority and salute he with the title of hioh the kingdom thus offer though of no further value to he than as it furnish he with present necessaries drake think it not prudent to refuse and therefore take possession of it in the name of queen elizabeth not without ardent wish that this acquisition might have be of use to he native country and that so mild and innocent a people might have be unite to the church of christ the kingdom be thus consign and the grand affair at a end the common people leave they king and he domestick with drake and disperse themselves over the camp and when they see any one that please they by he appearance more than the rest they tear they flesh and vent they outcry as before in token of reverence and admiration they then proceed to show they they wound and disease in hope of a miraculous and instantaneous cure to which the english to benefit and undeceive they at the same time apply such remedy as they use on the like occasion they be now grow confident and familiar and come down to the camp every day repeat they ceremony and sacrifice till they be more fully inform how disagreeable they be to those whose favor they be so studious of obtain : they then visit they without adoration indeed but with a curiosity so ardent that it leave they no leisure to provide the necessaries of life with which the english be therefore oblige to supply they they have then sufficient opportunity to remark the custom and disposition of these new ally whom they find tractable and benevolent strong of body far beyond the english yet unfurnished with weapon either for assault or defense they bow be too weak for any thing but sport they dexterity in take fish be such that if they see they so near the shore that they could come to they without swim they never miss they the same curiosity that have bring they in such crowd to the shore now induce drake and some of he company to travel up into the country which they find at some distance from the coast very fruitful fill with large deer and abound with a peculiar kind of cony smaller than ours with tail like that of a rat and paw such as those of a mole they have bag under they chin in which they carry provision to they young the house of the inhabitant be round hole dig in the ground from the brink of which they raise rafter or pile shelve towards the middle where they all meet and be cram together they lie upon rush with the fire in the midst and let the smoke fly out at the door the man be generally naked but the woman make a kind of petticoat of bulrush which they comb like hemp and throw the skin of a deer over they shoulder they be very modest tractable and obedient to they husband such be the condition of this people and not very different be perhaps the state of the greatest part of mankind whether more enlighten nation ought to look upon they with pity as less happy than themselves some skeptick have make very unnecessarily a difficulty of determine more they say be lose by the perplexity than gain by the instruction of science we enlarge we vice with we knowledge and multiply we want with we attainment and the happiness of life be better secure by the ignorance of vice than by the knowledge of virtue the fallacy by which such reasoner have impose upon themselves seem to arise from the comparison which they make not between two man equally incline to apply the means of happiness in they power to the end for which providence confer they but furnish in unequal proportion with the means of happiness which be the true state of savage and polished nation but between two man of which he to whom providence have be most bountiful destroy the blessing by negligence or obstinate misuse while the other steady diligent and virtuous employ he ability and convenience to they proper end the question be not whether a good indian or bad englishman be most happy but which state be most desirable suppose virtue and reason the same in both nor be this the only mistake which be generally admit in this controversy for these reasoner frequently confound innocence with the mere incapacity of guilt he that never see or hear or think of strong liquor can not be propose as a pattern of sobriety this land be name by drake albion from its white cliff in which it bear some resemblance to he native country and the whole history of the resignation of it to the english be engraven on a piece of brass then nail on a post and fix up before they departure which be now discover by the people to be near at hand they could not forbear perpetual lamentation when the english on the 23rd of July weigh anchor they see they climb to the top of hill that they might keep they in sight and observe fire light up in many part of the country on which as they suppose sacrifice be offer near this harbor they touch at some island where they find great number of seal and despair now to find any passage through the northern part he after a general consultation determine to steer away to the molucca and set sail July 25th he sail for sixty-eight day without sight of land and on September 30th arrive within view of some island situate about eight degree northward from the line from whence the inhabitant resort to they in canoe hollow out of the solid trunk of a tree and raise at both end so high above the water that they seem almost a semicircle they be burnish in such a manner that they shine like ebony and be keep steady by a piece of timber fix on each side of they with strong cane that be fasten at one end to the boat and at the other to the end of the timber the first company that come bring fruit potato and other thing of no great value with a appearance of traffick and exchange they lading for other commodity with great show of honesty and friendship but have as they imagine lay all suspicion asleep they soon send another fleet of canoe of which the crew behave with all the insolence of tyrant and all the rapacity of thief for whatever be suffer to come into they hand they seem to consider as they own and would neither pay for it nor restore it and at length find the english resolve to admit they no longer they discharge a shower of stone from they boat which insult drake prudently and generously return by order a piece of ordnance to be fire without hurt they at which they be so terrify that they leap into the water and hide themselves under the canoe have for some time but little wind they do not arrive at the molucca till the 3rd of November and then design to touch at tidore they be visit as they sail by a little island belong to the king of ternate by the viceroy of the place who inform they that it would be more advantageous for they to have recourse to he master for supplies and assistance than to the king of ternate who be in some degree dependent on the portuguese and that he would himself carry the news of they arrival and prepare for they reception drake be by the argument of the viceroy prevail upon to alter he resolution and on November 5 cast anchor before ternate and scarce be he arrive before the viceroy with other of the chief noble come out in three large boat row by forty man on each side to conduct the ship into a safe harbor and soon after the king himself have receive a velvet cloak by a messenger from drake as a token of peace come with such a retinue and dignity of appearance as be not expect in those remote part of the world he be receive with discharge of cannon and every kind of musick with which he be so much delighted that desire the musician to come down into the boat he be tow along in it at the stern of the ship the king be of a graceful stature and regal carriage of a mild aspect and low voice he attendant be dress in white cotton or calico of whom some whose age give they a venerable appearance seem he counsellor and the rest officer or noble he guard be not ignorant of firearm but have not many among they be equip for the most part with bow and dart the king have spend some time in admire the multitude of new object that present themselves retire as soon as the ship be bring to anchor and promise to return on the day follow and in the mean time the inhabitant have leave to traffick bring down provision in great abundance at the time when the king be expect he brother come on board to request of drake that he would come to the castle propose to stay himself as a hostage for he return drake refuse to go but send some gentleman detain the king 's brother in the mean time these gentleman be receive by another of the king 's brother who conduct they to the council-house near the castle in which they be direct to walk : there they find threescore old man privy counsellor to the king and on each side of the door without stand four old man of foreign country who serve as interpreter in commerce in a short time the king come from the castle dress in cloth of gold with he hair weave into gold ring a chain of gold upon he neck and on he hand ring very artificially set with diamond and jewel of great value over he head be bear a rich canopy and by he chair of state on which he sit down when he have enter the house stand a page with a fan set with sapphire to moderate the excess of the heat here he receive the compliment of the english and then honourably dismiss they the castle which they have some opportunity of observe seem of no great force it be build by the portuguese who attempt to reduce this kingdom into a absolute subjection murder the king and intend to pursue they scheme by the destruction of all he son but the general abhorrence which cruelty and perfidy naturally excite arm all the nation against they and procure they total expulsion from all the dominion of ternate which from that time increase in power continue to make new conquest and to deprive they of other acquisition while they lay before ternate a gentleman come on board attend by he interpreter he be dress somewhat in the european manner and soon distinguish himself from the native of ternate or any other country that they have see by he civility and apprehension such a visitant may easily be imagine to excite they curiosity which he gratify by inform they that he be a native of china of the family of the king then reign and that be accuse of a capital crime of which though he be innocent he have not evidence to clear himself he have petition the king that he might not be expose to a trial but that he cause might be refer to divine providence and that he might be allow to leave he country with a prohibition against return unless heaven in attestation of he innocence should enable he to bring back to the king some intelligence that might be to the honor and advantage of the empire of china in search of such information he have now spend three year and have leave tidore for the sake of converse with the english general from whom he hope to receive such account as would enable he to return with honor and safety drake willingly recount all he adventure and observation to which the chinese exile listen with the utmost attention and delight and have fix they in he mind thank god for the knowledge he have gain he then propose to the english general to conduct he to china recount by way of invitation the wealth extent and felicity of that empire but drake could not be induce to prolong he voyage he therefore set sail on the 9th of November in quest of some convenient harbor in a desert island to refit he ship not be willing as it seem to trust to the generosity of the king of ternate five day afterwards he find a very commodious harbor in a island overgrow with wood where he repair he vessel and refresh he man without danger or interruption leave this place the 12th of December they sail towards the celebe but have a wind not very favourable they be detain among a multitude of island mingle with dangerous shallows till January 9 1580 when they think themselves clear and be sail forward with a strong gale they be at the beginning of the night surprise in they course by a sudden shock of which the cause be easily discover for they be throw upon a shoal and by the speed of they course fix too fast for any hope of escape here even the intrepidity of drake be shake and he dexterity baffle but he piety however remain still the same and what he could not now promise himself from he own ability he hope from the assistance of providence the pump be ply and the ship find free from new leak the next attempt be to discover towards the sea some place where they might fix they boat and from thence drag the ship into deep water but upon examination it appear that the rock on which they have strike rise perpendicularly from the water and that there be no anchorage nor any bottom to be find a boat 's length from the ship but this discovery with its consequence be by drake wisely conceal from the common sailor lest they should abandon themselves to despair for which there be indeed cause there be no prospect leave but that they must there sink with the ship which must undoubtedly be soon dash to piece or perish in attempt to reach the shore in they boat or be cut in piece by barbarian if they should arrive at land in the midst of this perplexity and distress drake direct that the sacrament should be administer and he man fortify with all the consolation which religion afford then persuade they to lighten the vessel by throw into the sea part of they lading which be cheerfully comply with but without effect at length when they hope have forsake they and no new struggle could be make they be on a sudden relieve by a remission of the wind which have hitherto blow strongly against the side of the ship which lay towards the sea hold it upright against the rock but when the blast slacken be then low water the ship lie higher with that part which rest on the rock than with the other and be bear up no longer by the wind reel into the deep water to the surprise and joy of drake and he companion this be the greatest and most inextricable distress which they have ever suffer and make such a impression upon they mind that for some time afterwards they dare not adventure to spread they sail but go slowly forward with the utmost circumspection they thus continue they course without any observable occurrence till on the 11th of march they come to a anchor before the island of java and send to the king a present of cloth and silk receive from he in return a large quantity of provision and the day follow drake go himself on shore and entertain the king with he musick and obtain leave to store he ship with provision the island be govern by a great number of petty king or raia subordinate to one chief of these prince three come on board together a few day after they arrival and have upon they return recount the wonder which they have see and the civility with which they have be treat incite other to satisfy they curiosity in the same manner and raium donan the chief king come himself to view the ship with the warlike armament and instrument of navigation this intercourse of civility somewhat retard the business for which they come but at length they not only victual they ship but cleanse the bottom which in the long course be overgrow with a kind of shellfish that impede she passage leave java on march 26 they sail homewards by the cape of good hope which they see on June the 5th on the 15th of August pass the tropick and on the 26th of September arrive at plymouth where they find that by pass through so many different climate they have lose a day in they account of time it be Sunday by they journal but Monday by the general computation in this hazardous voyage they have spend two year ten month and some odd day but be recompense for they toil by great riches and the universal applause of they countryman drake afterwards bring he ship up to deptford where queen elizabeth visit he on board he ship and confer the honor of knighthood upon he a honor in that illustrious reign not make cheap by prostitution nor even bestow without uncommon merit it be not necessary to give a account equally particular of the remain part of he life as he be no longer a private man but engage in publick affair and associate in he expedition with other general whose attempt and the success of they be relate in the history of those time in 1585 on the 12th of September sir franci drake set sail from plymouth with a fleet of five-and-twenty ship and pinnace of which himself be admiral captain martiu forbisher viceadmiral and captain franci knolli rearadmiral they be fit out to cruise upon the spaniard and have touch at the isle of bayonne and plunder vigo put to sea again and on the 16th of November arrive before st jago which they enter without resistance and rest there fourteen day visit in the mean time san domingo a town within the land which they find likewise desert and carry off what they please of the produce of the island they at they departure destroy the town and village in revenge of the murder of one of they boy whose body they find mangled in a most inhuman manner from this island they pursue they voyage to the west indy determine to attack st domingo in hispaniolum as the richest place in that part of the world they therefore land a thousand man and with small loss enter the town of which they keep possession for a month without interruption or alarm during which time a remarkable accident happen which deserve to be related drake have some intention of treat with the spaniard send to they a negro boy with a flag of truce which one of the spaniard so little regarded that he stab he through the body with a lance the boy notwithstanding he wound come back to the general related the treatment which he have find and die in he sight drake be so incensed at this outrage that he order two friar then he prisoner to be convey with a guard to the place where the crime be commit and hang up in the sight of the spaniard declare that two spanish prisoner should undergo the same death every day till the offender should be deliver up by they : they be too well acquaint with the character of drake not to bring he on the day follow when to impress the shame of such action more effectually upon they he compel they to execute he with they own hand of this town at they departure they demolish part and admit the rest to be ransom for five and twenty thousand ducat from thence they sail to carthagena where the enemy have receive intelligence of the fate of st domingo have strengthen they fortification and prepare to defend themselves with great obstinacy but the english landing in the night come upon they by a way which they do not suspect and be better armed partly by surprise and partly by superiority of order and valor become master of the place where they stay without fear or danger six week and at they departure receive a hundred and ten thousand ducat for the ransome of the town they afterwards take st augustin and touch at virginia take on board the governor mr lane with the english that have be leave there the year before by sir walter raleigh and arrive at portsmouth on July 28 1586 have lose in the voyage seven hundred and fifty man the gain of this expedition amount to sixty thousand pound of which forty be the share of the adventurer who fit out the ship and the rest distribute among the several crew amount to six pound each man so cheaply be life sometimes hazard the transaction against the armada 1588 be in themselves far more memorable but less necessary to be recite in this succinct narrative only let it be remember that the post of viceadmiral of england to which sir francis drake be then raise be a sufficient proof that no obscurity of birth or meanness of fortune be unsurmountable to bravery and diligence in 1595 sir franci drake and sir john hawkin be send with a fleet to the west indy which expedition be only memorable for the destruction of nombre de dios and the death of the two commander of whom sir francis drake die January 9 1597 and be throw into the sea in a leaden coffin with all the pomp of naval obsequy it be report by some that the ill success of this voyage hasten he death upon what this conjecture be ground do not appear and we may be allow to hope for the honor of so great a man that it be without foundation and that he whom no series of success could ever betray to vanity or negligence could have support a change of fortune without impatience or dejection barretier -lrb- 45 -rrb- have not be able to procure material for a complete life of mr barretier and be nevertheless willing to gratify the curiosity justly raise in the publick by he uncommon attainment we think the following extract of letter write by he father proper to be insert in we collection as they contain many remarkable passage and exhibit a general view of he genius and learn john philip barretier be bear at schwabach January 19 1720-21 he father be a calvinist minister of that place who take upon himself the care of he education what art of instruction he use or by what method he regulate the study of he son we be not able to inform the publick but take this opportunity of intreat those who have receive more complete intelligence not to deny mankind so great a benefit as the improvement of education if mr le fvre think the method in which he teach he child worthy to be communicate to the learn world how justly may mr barretier claim the universal attention of mankind to a scheme of education that have produce such a stupendous progress the author who have endeavor to teach certain and unfailing rule for obtain a long life however they have fail in they attempt be universally confess to have at least the merit of a great and noble design and to have deserve gratitude and honor how much more then be due to mr barretier who have succeed in what they have only attempt for to prolong life and improve it be nearly the same if to have all that riches can purchase be to be rich if to do all that can be do in a long time be to live long he be equally a benefactor to mankind who teach they to protract the duration or shorten the business of life that there be few thing more worthy we curiosity than this method by which the father assist the genius of the son every man will be convince that consider the early proficiency at which it enable he to arrive such a proficiency as no one have yet reach at the same age and to which it be therefore probable that every advantageous circumstance concur _ at the age of nine year he not only be master of five language _ a attainment in itself almost incredible but understood say he father the holy writer better in they original tongue than in he own if he mean by this assertion that he know the sense of many passage in the original which be obscure in the translation the account however wonderful may be admit but if he intend to tell he correspondent that he son be better acquaint with the two language of the bible than with he own he must be allow to speak hyperbolically or to admit that he son have somewhat neglect the study of he native language or we must own that the fondness of a parent have transport he into some natural exaggeration part of this letter i be tempt to suppress be unwilling to demand the belief of other to that which appear incredible to myself but as my incredulity may perhaps be the product rather of prejudice than reason as envy may beget a disinclination to admit so immense a superiority and as a account be not to be immediately censure as false merely because it be wonderful i shall proceed to give the rest of he father 's relation from he letter of the 3rd of march 1729-30 he speak continue he german latin and french equally well he can by lay before he a translation read any of the book of the old or new testament in its original language without hesitation or perplexity _ he be no stranger to biblical criticism _ or philosophy nor unacquainted with ancient and modern geography and be qualify to support a conversation with learn man who frequently visit and correspond with he in he eleventh year he not only publish a learn letter in latin but translate the travels of rabbi benjamin from the hebrew into french which he illustrate with note and accompany with dissertation a work in which he father as he himself declare could give he little assistance as he do not understand the rabbinical dialect the reason for which he father engage he in this work be only to prevail upon he to write a fairer hand than he have hitherto accustomed himself to do by give he hope that if he should translate some little author and offer a fair copy of he version to some bookseller he might in return for it have other book which he want and could not afford to purchase incite by this expectation he fix upon the travels of rabbi benjamin as most proper for he purpose be a book neither bulky nor common and in one month complete he translation apply only one or two hour a day to that particular task in another month he draw up the principal note and in the third write some dissertation upon particular passage which seem to require a larger examination these note contain so many curious remark and inquiry out of the common road of learning and afford so many instance of penetration judgment and accuracy that the reader find in every page some reason to persuade he that they can not possibly be the work of a child but of a man long accustom to these study enlighten by reflection and dextrous by long practice in the use of book yet that it be the performance of a boy thus young be not only prove by the testimony of he father but by the concurrent evidence of mr le matre he associate in the church of schwabach who not only assert he claim to this work but affirm that he hear he at six year of age explain the hebrew text as if it have be he native language so that the fact be not to be doubt without a degree of incredulity which it will not be very easy to defend this copy be however far from be write with the neatness which he father desire nor do the bookseller to whom it be offer make proposal very agreeable to the expectation of the young translator but after have examine the performance in they manner and determine to print it upon condition not very advantageous return it to be transcribe that the printer might not be embarrass with a copy so difficult to read barretier be now advance to the latter end of he twelfth year and have make great advance in he study notwithstanding a obstinate tumor in he left hand which give he great pain and oblige he to a tedious and troublesome method of cure and reading over he performance be so far from content himself with barely transcribe it that he alter the greatest part of the note new-model the dissertation and augment the book to twice its former bulk the few touch which he father bestow upon the revisal of the book though they be minutely set down by he in the preface be so inconsiderable that it be not necessary to mention they and it may be much more agreeable as well as useful to exhibit the short account which he there give of the method by which he enable he son to show so early how easy a attainment be the knowledge of the language a knowledge which some man spend they life in cultivate to the neglect of more valuable study and which they seem to regard as the highest perfection of human nature what applause be due to a old age waste in a scrupulous attention to particular accent and etymology may appear say he father by see how little time be require to arrive at such a eminence in these study as many even of these venerable doctor have not attain for want of rational method and regular application this censure be doubtless just upon those who spend too much of they life upon useless nicety or who appear to labor without make any progress but as the knowledge of language be necessary and a minute accuracy sometimes requisite they be by no means to be blame who in compliance with the particular bent of they own mind make the difficulty of dead language they chief study and arrive at excellence proportionate to they application since it be to the labor of such man that he son be indebted for he own learn the first language which barretier learn be the french german and latin which he be teach not in the common way by a multitude of definition rule and exception which fatigue the attention and burden the memory without any use proportionate to the time which they require and the disgust which they create the method by which he be instruct be easy and expeditious and therefore please he learn they all in the same manner and almost at the same time by converse in they indifferently with he father the other language of which he be master he learn by a method yet more uncommon the only book which he make use of be the bible which he father lay before he in the language that he then propose to learn accompany with a translation be teach by degree the inflection of noun and verb this method say he father make the latin more familiar to he in he fourth year than any other language when he be near the end of he sixth year he enter upon the study of the old testament in its original language begin with the book of genesis to which he father confine he for six month after which he read cursorily over the rest of the historical book in which he find very little difficulty and then apply himself to the study of the poetical writer and the prophet which he read over so often with so close a attention and so happy a memory that he could not only translate they without a moment 's hesitation into latin or french but turn with the same facility the translation into the original language in he tenth year grow at length weary of be confine to a book which he could almost entirely repeat he deviate by stealth into other study and as he translation of benjamin be a sufficient evidence he read a multitude of writer of various kind _ in he twelfth year he apply more particularly to the study of the father _ and council of the six first century and begin to make a regular collection of they canon he read every author in the original have discover so much negligence or ignorance in most translation that he pay no regard to they authority thus he continue he study neither draw aside by pleasure nor discourage by difficulty the greatest obstacle to he improvement be want of book with which he narrow fortune could not liberally supply he so that he be oblige to borrow the greatest part of those which he study require and to return they when he have read they without be able to consult they occasionally or to recur to they when he memory should fail he it be observable that neither he diligence unintermitted as it be nor he want of book a want of which he be in the highest degree sensible ever produce in he that asperity which a long and recluse life without any circumstance of disquiet frequently create he be always gay lively and facetious a temper which contribute much to recommend he learning and which some student much superior in age would consult they ease they reputation and they interest by copying from he in the year 1735 he publish anti-artemonius sive initium evangelius s joanni adversus artemonium vindicatum and attain such a degree of reputation that not only the publick but _ prince who be commonly the last _ by whom merit be distinguish begin to interest themselves in he success for the same year the king of prussium who have hear of he early advance in literature on account of a scheme for discover the longitude which have be send to the royal society of berlin and which be transmit afterwards by he to paris and london engage to take care of he fortune have receive further proof of he ability at he own court mr barretier be promote to the cure of the church of stetin be oblige to travel with he son thither from schwabach through leipsic and berlin a journey very agreeable to he son as it would furnish he with new opportunity of improve he knowledge and extend he acquaintance among man of letter for this purpose they stay some time at leipsic and then travel to halle where young barretier so distinguished himself in he conversation with the professor of the university that they offer he he degree of doctor in philosophy a dignity correspondent to that of master of art among we barretier draw up that night some position in philosophy and the mathematick which he send immediately to the press and defend the next day in a crowded auditory with so much wit spirit presence of thought and strength of reason that the whole university be delighted and amaze he be then admit to he degree and attend by the whole concourse to he lodgings with compliment and acclamation he theses or philosophical position which he print in compliance with the practice of that university run through several edition in a few week and no testimony of regard be want that could contribute to animate he in he progress when they arrive at berlin the king order he to be bring into he presence and be so much pleased with he conversation that he send for he almost every day during he stay at berlin and divert himself with engage he in conversation upon a multitude of subject and in dispute with learn man on all which occasion he acquit himself so happily that the king form the highest idea of he capacity and future eminence and think perhaps with reason that active life be the noblest sphere of a great genius he recommend to he the study of modern history the custom of nation and those part of learn that be of use in publick transaction and civil employment declare that such ability properly cultivate might exalt he in ten year to be the greatest minister of state in europe barretier whether we attribute it to he moderation or inexperience be not dazzle by the prospect of such high promotion but answer that _ he be too much pleased with science and quiet _ to leave they for such inextricable study or such harass fatigue a resolution so unpleasing to the king that he father attribute to it the delay of those favor which they have hope of receive the king have as he observe determine to employ he in the ministry it be not impossible that paternal affection might suggest to mr barretier some false conception of the king 's design for he infer from the introduction of he son to the young prince and the caress which he receive from they that the king intend he for they preceptor a scheme say he which some other resolution happily destroy whatever be originally intend and by whatever mean these intention be frustrated barretier after have be treat with the highest regard by the whole royal family be dismiss with a present of two hundred crown and he father instead of be fix at stetin be make pastor of the french church at halle a place more commodious for study to which they retire barretier be first admit into the royal society at berlin and recommend by the king to the university at halle _ at halle he continue he study _ with he usual application and success and either by he own reflection or the persuasion of he father be prevail upon to give up he own inclination to those of the king and direct he inquiry to those subject that have be recommend by he he continue to add new acquisition to he learning and to increase he reputation by new performance till in the beginning of he nineteenth year he health begin to decline and he indisposition which be not alarming or violent be perhaps not at first sufficiently regard increase by slow degree for eighteen month during which he spend day among he book and neither neglect he study nor leave he gaiety till he distemper ten day before he death deprive he of the use of he limb : he then prepare himself for he end without fear or emotion and on the 5th of October 1740 resign he soul into the hand of he savior with _ confidence and tranquillity _ in the magazine for 1742 appear the follow additional account of the life of john philip barretier -lrb- 46 -rrb- as the nature of we collection require that we account of remarkable person and transaction should be early we reader must necessarily pardon we if they be often not complete and allow we to be sufficiently studious of they satisfaction if we correct we error and supply we defect from subsequent intelligence where the importance of the subject merit a extraordinary attention or when we have any peculiar opportunity of procure information the particulars here insert we think proper to annex by way of note to the follow passage quote from the magazine for December 1740 and for February 1741 p 377 _ at the age of nine year he not only be master of five language _ french which be the native language of he mother be that which he learn first mix by live in germany with some word of the language of the country after some time he father take care to introduce in he conversation with he some word of latin in such a manner that he might discover the meaning of they by the connexion of the sentence or the occasion on which they be use without discover that he have any intention of instruct he or that any new attainment be propose by this method of conversation in which new word be every day introduce he ear have be somewhat accustomed to the inflection and variation of the latin tongue he begin to attempt to speak like he father and be in a short time draw on by imperceptible degree to speak latin intermix with other language thus when he be but four year old he speak every day french to he mother latin to he father and high dutch to the maid without any perplexity to himself or any confusion of one language with another p 377 _ he be no stranger to biblical criticism _ have now gain such a degree of skill in the hebrew language as to be able to compose in it both in prose and verse he be extremely desirous of read the rabbin and have borrow of the neighbouring clergy and the jew of schwabach all the book which they could supply he he prevail on he father to buy he the great rabbinical bible publish at amsterdam in four tome folio 1728 and read it with that accuracy and attention which appear by the account of it write by he to he favorite m le maitre insert in the beginning of the twenty-sixth volume of the bibliothque germanique these writer be read by he as other young person peruse romance or novel only from a puerile desire of amusement for he have so little veneration for they even while he study they with most eagerness that he often divert he parent with recount they fable and chimera p 381 _ in he twelfth year he apply more particularly to the study of the father _ he father be somewhat uneasy to observe so much time spend by he on rabbinical trifle think it necessary now to recall he to the study of the greek language which he have of late neglect but to which he return with so much ardor that in a short time he be able to read greek with the same facility as french or latin he then engage in the perusal of the greek father and council of the first three or four century and undertake at he father 's desire to confute a treatise of samuel crellius in which under the name of artemonius he have endeavor to substitute in the beginning of st john 's gospel a read different from that which be at present receive and less favourable to the orthodox doctrine of the divinity of we savior this task be undertake by barretier with great ardor and prosecute by he with suitable application for he not only draw up a formal confutation of artemonius but make large collection from the earliest writer relate to the history of heresy which he propose at first to have publish as preliminary to he book but find the introduction grow at last to a greater bulk than the book itself he determine to publish it apart while he be engross by these inquiry accident throw a pair of globe into he hand in October 1734 by which he curiosity be so much exalt that he lay aside he artemonius and apply himself to geography and astronomy in ten day he be able to solve all the problem in the doctrine of the globe and have attain idea so clear and strong of all the system as well ancient as modern that he begin to think of make new discovery and for that purpose lay aside for a time all search into antiquity he employ he utmost interest to procure book of astronomy and of mathematick and make such a progress in three or four month that he seem to have spend he whole life upon that study for he not only make a astrolabe and draw up astronomical table but invent new method of calculation or such at least as appear new to he because they be not mention in the book which he have then a opportunity of reading and it be a sufficient proof both of the rapidity of he progress and the extent of he view that in three month after he first sight of a pair of globe he form scheme for find the longitude which he send in January 1735 to the royal society at london he scheme be recommend to the society by the queen be consider by they with a degree of attention which perhaps would not have be bestow upon the attempt of a mathematician so young have he not be dignified with so illustrious a patronage but it be soon find that for want of book he have imagine himself the inventor of method already in common use and that he propose no means of discover the longitude but such as have be already try and find insufficient such will be very frequently the fate of those whose fortune either condemn they to study without the necessary assistance from library or who in too much haste publish they discovery this attempt exhibit however such a specimen of he capacity for mathematical learning and such a proof of a early proficiency that the royal society of berlin admit he as one of they member in 1735 p 381 _ prince who be commonly the last _ barretier have be distinguish much more early by the margravin of anspach who in 1726 send for he father and mother to the court where they son whom they carry with they present she with a letter in french and address another in latin to the young prince who afterwards in 1734 grant he the privilege of borrow book from the library of anspach together with a annual pension of fifty florin which he enjoy for four year in this place it may not be improper to recount some honor confer upon he which if distinction be to be rate by the knowledge of those who bestow they may be consider as more valuable than those which he receive from prince in June 1731 he be initiate in the university of altdorft and at the end of the year 1732 the synod of the reform church hold at christian erlang admit he to be present at they consultation and to preserve the memory of so extraordinary a transaction as the reception of a boy of eleven year into a ecclesiastical council record it in a particular article of the act of the synod p 383 _ he be too much pleased with science and quiet _ astronomy be always barretier 's favorite study and so much engross he thought that he do not willingly converse on any other subject nor be he so well pleased with the civility of the greatest person as with the conversation of the mathematician a astronomical observation be sufficient to withhold he from court or to call he away abruptly from the most illustrious assembly nor be there any hope of enjoy he company without invite some professor to keep he in temper and engage he in discourse nor be it possible without this expedient to prevail upon he to sit for he picture ibid _ at halle he continue he study _ mr barretier return on the 28th of April 1735 to halle where he continue the remain part of he life of which it may not be improper to give a more particular account at he settlement in the university he determine to exert he privilege as master of art and to read publick lecture to the student a design from which he father could not dissuade he though he do not approve it so certainly do honor or preferment too soon confer infatuate the greatest capacity he publish a invitation to three lecture one critical on the book of job another on astronomy and a third upon ancient ecclesiastical history but of this employment he be soon make weary by the petulance of he auditor the fatigue which it occasion and the interruption of he study which it produce and therefore in a fortnight he desist wholly from he lecture and never afterwards resume they he then apply himself to the study of the law almost against he own inclination which however he conquer so far as to become a regular attendant on the lecture on that science but spend all he other time upon different study the first year of he residence at halle be spend upon natural philosophy and mathematick and scarcely any author ancient or modern that have treat on those part of learning be neglect by he nor be he satisfy with the knowledge of what have be discover by other but make new observation and draw up immense calculation for he own use he then return to ecclesiastical history and begin to retouch he account of heresy which he have begin at schwabach : on this occasion he read the primitive writer with great accuracy and form a project of regulate the chronology of those age which produce a chrono-logical dissertation on the succession of the bishop of rome from st peter to victor print in latin at utrecht 1740 he afterwards be wholly absorb in application to polite literature and read not only a multitude of writer in the greek and latin but in the german dutch french italian english and arabick language and in the last year of he life he be engross by the study of inscription medal and antiquity of all nation in 1737 he resume he design of find a certain method of discover the longitude which he imagine himself to have attain by exact observation of the declination and inclination of the needle and send to the academy of science and to the royal society of london at the same time a account of he scheme to which it be first answer by the royal society that it appear the same with one which mr whiston have lay before they and afterwards by the academy of science that he method be but very little different from one that have be propose by m de la croix and which be ingenious but ineffectual mr barretier find he invention already in the possession of two man eminent for mathematical knowledge desist from all inquiry after the longitude and engage in a examination of the egyptian antiquity which he propose to free from they present obscurity by decipher the hieroglyphick and explain they astronomy but this design be interrupt by he death p 384 _ confidence and tranquillity _ thus die barretier in the 20th year of he age have give a proof how much may be perform in so short a time by indefatigable diligence he be not only master of many language but skilled almost in every science and capable of distinguish himself in every profession except that of physick from which he have be discourage by remark the diversity of opinion among those who have be consult concern he own disorder he learning however vast have not depressed or overburdened he natural faculty for he genius always appear predominant and when he inquire into the various opinion of the writer of all age he reason and determine for himself have a mind at once comprehensive and delicate active and attentive he be able to reason with the metaphysician on the most abstruse question or to enliven the most unpleasing subject by the gaiety of he fancy he write with great elegance and dignity of style and have the peculiar felicity of readiness and facility in every thing that he undertake be able without premeditation to translate one language into another he be no imitator but strike out new track and form original system he have a quickness of apprehension and firmness of memory which enable he to read with incredible rapidity and at the same time to retain what he read so as to be able to recollect and apply it he turn over volume in a instant and select what be useful for he purpose he seldom make extract except of book which he could not procure when he might want they a second time be always able to find in any author with great expedition what he have once read he read over in one winter twenty vast folio and the catalogue of book which he have borrow comprise forty-one page in quarto the write close and the title abridge he be a constant reader of literary journal with regard to common life he have some peculiarity he could not bear musick and if he be ever engage at play could not attend to it he neither loved wine nor entertainment nor dancing nor the sport of the field nor relieved he study with any other diversion than that of walk and conversation he eat little flesh and live almost wholly upon milk tea bread fruit and sweetmeat he have great vivacity in he imagination and ardor in he desire which the easy method of he education have never repress he therefore converse among those who have gain he confidence with great freedom but he favorite be not numerous and to other he be always reserve and silent without the least inclination to discover he sentiment or display he learn he never fix he choice upon any employment nor confine he view to any profession be desirous of nothing but knowledge and entirely untainted with avarice or ambition he preserve himself always independent and be never know to be guilty of a lie he constant application to learn suppress those passion which betray other of he age to irregularity and exclude all those temptation to which man be expose by idleness or common amusement morin -lrb- 47 -rrb- lewi morin be bear at man on the 11th of July 1635 of parent eminent for they piety he be the eldest of sixteen child a family to which they estate bear no proportion and which in person less resign to providence would have cause great uneasiness and anxiety he parent omit nothing in he education which religion require and which they fortune could supply botany be the study that appear to have take possession of he inclination as soon as the bent of he genius could be discover a countryman who supply the apothecary of the place be he first master and be pay by he for he instruction with the little money that he could procure or that which be give he to buy something to eat after dinner thus abstinence and generosity discover themselves with he passion for botany and the gratification of a desire indifferent in itself be procure by the exercise of two virtue he be soon master of all he instructer 's knowledge and be oblige to enlarge he acquaintance with plant by observe they himself in the neighborhood of man have finish he grammatical study he be send to learn philosophy at pari whither he travel on foot like a student in botany and be careful not to lose such a opportunity of improvement when he course of philosophy be complete he be determine by he love of botany to the profession of physick and from that time engage in a course of life which be never exceed either by the ostentation of a philosopher or the severity of a anchoret for he confine himself to bread and water and at most allow himself no indulgence beyond fruit by this method he preserve a constant freedom and serenity of spirit always equally proper for study for he soul have no pretence to complain of be overwhelm with matter this regimen extraordinary as it be have many advantage for it preserve he health a advantage which very few sufficiently regard it give he a authority to preach diet and abstinence to he patient and it make he rich without the assistance of fortune rich not for himself but for the poor who be the only person benefit by that artificial affluence which of all other be most difficult to acquire it be easy to imagine that while he practice in the midst of paris the severe temperance of a hermit pari differ no otherwise with regard to he from a hermitage than as it supply he with book and the conversation of learn man in 1662 he be admit doctor of physick about that time dr fagon dr longuet and dr galoi all eminent for they skill in botany be employ in draw up a catalogue of the plant in the royal garden which be publish in 1665 under the name of dr vallot then first physician : during the prosecution of this work dr morin be often consult and from those conversation it be that dr fagon conceive a particular esteem of he which he always continue to retain after have practice physick some year he be admit _ expectant _ at the htel-dieu where he be regularly to have be make pensionary physician upon the first vacancy but mere unassisted merit advance slowly if what be not very common it advance at all morin have no acquaintance with the art necessary to carry on scheme of preferment the moderation of he desire preserve he from the necessity of study they and the privacy of he life debar he from any opportunity at last however justice be do he in spite of artifice and partiality but he advancement add nothing to he condition except the power of more extensive charity for all the money which he receive as a salary he put into the chest of the hospital always as he imagine without be observe not content with serve the poor for nothing he pay they for be serve he reputation rise so high in pari that mademoiselle de guise be desirous to make he she physician but it be not without difficulty that he be prevail upon by he friend dr dodart to accept the place he be by this new advancement lay under the necessity of keep a chariot a equipage very unsuitable to he temper but while he comply with those exterior appearance which the publick have a right to demand from he he remit nothing of he former austerity in the more private and essential part of he life which he have always the power of regulate accord to he own disposition in two year and a half the princess fall sick and be despair of by morin who be a great master of prognostick at the time when she think herself in no danger he pronounce she death inevitable a declaration to the highest degree disagreeable but which be make more easy to he than to any other by he piety and artless simplicity nor do he sincerity produce any ill consequence to himself for the princess affect by he zeal take a ring from she finger give it he as the last pledge of she affection and reward he still more to he satisfaction by prepare for death with a true christian piety she leave he by will a yearly pension of two thousand livre which be always regularly pay he no sooner be the princess dead but he free himself from the encumbrance of he chariot and retire to st victor without a servant have however augment he daily allowance with a little rice boil in water dodart who have undertake the charge of be ambitious on he account procure he at the restoration of the academy in 1699 to be nominate associate botanist not know what he would doubtless have be please with the knowledge of that he introduce into that assembly the man that be to succeed he in he place of _ pensionary _ dr morin be not one who have upon he hand the labor of adapt himself to the duty of he condition but always find himself naturally adapt to they he have therefore no difficulty in be constant at the assembly of the academy notwithstanding the distance of place while he have strength enough to support the journey but he regimen be not equally effectual to produce vigor as to prevent distemper and be sixty-four year old at he admission he could not continue he assiduity more than a year after the death of dodart whom he succeed in 1707 when mr tournefort go to pursue he botanical inquiry in the levant he desire dr morin to supply he place of demonstrator of the plant in the royal garden and reward he for the trouble by inscribe to he a new plant which he bring from the east by the name of morina orientalis as he name other the do-darto the fagonne the bignonne the phelipe these be compliment proper to be make by the botanist not only to those of they own rank but to the greatest person for a plant be a monument of a more durable nature than a medal or a obelisk and yet as a proof that even these vehicle be not always sufficient to transmit to futurity the name conjoin with they the nicotiana be now scarcely know by any other name than that of tobacco dr morin advance far in age be now force to take a servant and what be yet a more essential alteration prevail upon himself to take a ounce of wine a day which he measure with the same exactness as a medicine border upon poison he quit at the same time all he practice in the city and confine it to the poor of he neighborhood and he visit to the htel-dieu but he weakness increase he be force to increase he quantity of wine which yet he always continue to adjust by weight -lrb- 48 -rrb- at seventy-eight he leg could carry he no longer and he scarcely leave he bed but he intellect continue unimpaired except in the last six month of he life he expire or to use a more proper term go out on the 1st of march 1714 at the age of eighty year without any distemper and merely for want of strength have enjoy by the benefit of he regimen a long and healthy life and a gentle and easy death this extraordinary regimen be but part of the daily regulation of he life of which all the office be carry on with a regularity and exactness nearly approach to that of the planetary motion he go to bed at seven and rise at two throughout the year he spend in the morning three hour at he devotions and go to the htel-dieu in the summer between five and six and in the winter between six and seven hear mass for the most part at notre dame after he return he read the holy scripture dine at eleven and when it be fair weather walk till two in the royal garden where he examine the new plant and gratify he earliest and strongest passion for the remain part of the day if he have no poor to visit he shut himself up and read book of literature or physick but chiefly physick as the duty of he profession require this likewise be the time he receive visit if any be pay he he often use this expression : those that come to see I do I honor those that stay away do I a favor it be easy to conceive that a man of this temper be not crowd with salutation : there be only now and then a antony that would pay paul a visit among he papers be find a greek and latin index to hippocrate more copious and exact than that of pinus which he have finish only a year before he death such a work require the assiduity and patience of a hermit -lrb- 49 -rrb- there be likewise a journal of the weather keep without interruption for more than forty year in which he have accurately set down the state of the barometer and thermometer the dryness and moisture of the air the variation of the wind in the course of the day the rain the thunder and even the sudden storm in a very commodious and concise method which exhibit in a little room a great train of different observation what number of such remark have escape a man less uniform in he life and whose attention have be extend to common object all the estate which he leave be a collection of medal another of herb and a library rate at two thousand crown which make it evident that he spend much more upon he mind than upon he body burman -lrb- 50 -rrb- peter burman be bear at utrecht on the 26th day of June 1668 the family from which he descend have for several generation produce man of great eminence for piety and learning and he father who be professor of divinity in the university and pastor of the city of utrech ' t be equally celebrate for the strictness of he life the efficacy and orthodoxy of he sermon and the learning and perspicuity of he academical lecture from the assistance and instruction which such a father would doubtless have be encourage by the genius of this son not to have omit he be unhappily cut off at eleven year of age be at that time by he father 's death throw entirely under the care of he mother by whose diligence piety and prudence he education be so regulate that he have scarcely any reason but filial tenderness to regret the loss of he father he be about this time send to the publick school of utrecht to be instruct in the learn language and it will convey no common idea of he capacity and industry to relate that he have pass through the class and be admit into the university in he thirteenth year this account of the rapidity of he progress in the first part of he study be so stupendous that though it be attest by he friend dr osterdyke of whom it can not be reasonably suspect that he be himself deceive or that he can desire to deceive other it must be allow far to exceed the limit of probability if it be consider with regard to the method of education practice in we country where it be not uncommon for the highest genius and most comprehensive capacity to be entangled for ten year in those thorny path of literature which burman be represent to have pass in less than two and we must doubtless confess the most skilful of we master much excel by the address of the dutch teacher or the ability of we greatest scholar far surpass by those of burinan but to reduce this narrative to credibility it be necessary that admiration should give place to inquiry and that it be discover what proficiency in literature be expect from a student request to be admit into a dutch university it be to be observe that in the university of foreign country they have professor of philology or humanity whose employment be to instruct the younger class in grammar rhetorick and language nor do they engage in the study of philosophy till they have pass through a course of philological lecture and exercise to which in some place two year be commonly allot the english scheme of education which with regard to academical study be more rigorous and set literary honor at a higher price than that of any other country exact from the youth who be initiate in we college a degree of philological knowledge sufficient to qualify they for lecture in philosophy which be read to they in latin and to enable they to proceed in other study without assistance so that it may be conjecture that burman at he entrance into the university have no such skill in language nor such ability of composition as be frequently to be meet with in the higher class of a english school nor be perhaps more than moderately skilled in latin and teach the first rudiment of greek in the university he be commit to the care of the learn grvius whose regard for he father incline he to superintend he study with more than common attention which be soon confirm and increase by he discovery of the genius of he pupil and he observation of he diligence one of the quality which contribute eminently to qualify grvius for a instructor of youth be the sagacity by which he readily discover the predominant faculty of each pupil and the peculiar designation by which nature have allot he to any species of literature and by which he be soon able to determine that burman be remarkably adapt to classical study and predict the great advance that he would make by industriously pursue the direction of he genius animated by the encouragement of a tutor so celebrate he continue the vigor of he application and for several year not only attend the lecture of grvius but make use of every other opportunity of improvement with such diligence as might justly be expect to produce a uncommon proficiency have thus attain a sufficient degree of classical knowledge to qualify he for inquiry into other science he apply himself to the study of the law and publish a dissertation de vicesima hreditatum which he publickly defend under the professor van muyden with such learning and eloquence as procured he great applause imagine then that the conversation of other man of learn might be of use towards he further improvement and rightly judge that notion form in any single seminary be for the greatest part contract and partial he go to leyden where he study philosophy for a year under m de volder whose celebrity be so great that the school assign to the science which it be he province to teach be not sufficient though very spacious to contain the audience that crowd he lecture from all part of europe yet he do not suffer himself to be engross by philosophical disquisition to the neglect of those study in which he be more early engage and to which he be perhaps by nature better adapt for he attend at the same time ryckius 's explanation of tacitus and jame gronovius 's lecture on the greek writer and have often be hear to acknowledge at a advanced age the assistance which he receive from they have thus pass a year at leyden with great advantage he return to utrecht and once more apply himself to philological study by the assistance of grvius whose early hope of he genius be now raise to a full confidence of that excellence at which he afterwards arrive at utrecht in march 1688 in the twentieth year of he age he be advance to the degree of doctor of law on which occasion he publish a learn dissertation de transactionibus and defend it with he usual eloquence learning and success the attainment of this honor be far from have upon burman that effect which have be too often observe to be produce in other who have in they own opinion no higher object of ambition have relapse into idleness and security and spend the rest of they life in a lazy enjoyment of they academical dignity burman aspire to further improvement and not satisfy with the opportunity of literary conversation which utrecht afford travel into switzerland and germany where he gain a increase both of fame and learning at he return from this excursion he engage in the practice of the law and plead several cause with such reputation as might be hope by a man who have join to he knowledge of the law the embellishment of polite literature and the strict ratiocination of true philosophy and who be able to employ on every occasion the grace of eloquence and the power of argumentation while burman be hasten to high reputation in the court of justice and to those riches and honor which always follow it he be summon in 1691 by the magistrate of utrecht to undertake the charge of collector of the tenth a office in that place of great honor and which he accept therefore as a proof of they confidence and esteem while he be engage in this employment he marry eve clotterboke a young lady of a good family and uncommon genius and beauty by whom he have ten child of which eight die young and only two son franci and caspar live to console they mother for they father 's death neither publick business nor domestick care detain burman from the prosecution of he literary inquiry by which he so much endear himself to grvius that he be recommend by he to the regard of the university of utrecht and accordingly in 1696 be choose professor of eloquence and history to which be add after some time the professorship of the greek language and afterwards that of politick so various do they conceive he ability and so extensive he knowledge at he entrance upon this new province he pronounce a oration upon eloquence and poetry have now more frequent opportunity of display he learning he arise in a short time to a high reputation of which the great number of he auditor be a sufficient proof and which the proficiency of he pupil show not to be accidental or undeserved in 1714 he form a resolution of visit paris not only for the sake of confer in person upon question of literature with the learn man of that place and of gratify he curiosity with a more familiar knowledge of those writer whose work he admire but with a view more important of visit the library and make those inquiry which might be of advantage to he darling study the vacation of the university allow he to stay at pari but six week which he employ with so much dexterity and industry that he have search the principal library collate a great number of manuscript and print copy and bring back a great treasure of curious observation in this visit to pari he contract a acquaintance among other learn man with the celebrated father montfaucon with whom he converse at he first interview with no other character but that of a traveller but they discourse turn upon ancient learn the stranger soon give such proof of he attainment that montfaucon declare he a very uncommon traveller and confess he curiosity to know he name which he no sooner hear than he rise from he seat and embrace he with the utmost ardor express he satisfaction at have see the man whose production of various kind he have so often praise and as a real proof of he regard offer not only to procure he a immediate admission to all the library of pari but to those in remoter province which be not generally open to stranger and undertake to ease the expense of he journey by procure he entertainment in all the monastery of he order this favor burman be hinder from accept by the necessity of return to utrecht at the usual time of begin a new course of lecture to which there be always so great a concourse of student as much increase the dignity and fame of the university in which he teach he have already extend to distant part he reputation for knowledge of ancient history by a treatise de vectigalibus populi romani on the revenue of the roman and for he skill in greek learning and in ancient coin by a tract call jupiter fulgurator and after he return from paris he publish pldrus first with the note of various commentator and afterwards with he own he print many poem make many oration upon different subject and procure a impression of the epistle of gudius and sanavius while he be thus employ the professorship of history eloquence and the greek language become vacant at leyden by the death of perizonius which burman 's reputation incite the curator of the university to offer he upon very generous term and which after some struggle with he fondness for he native place he friend and he colleague he be prevail on to accept find the solicitation from leyden warm and urgent and he friend at utrecht though unwilling to be deprive of he yet not zealous enough for the honor and advantage of they university to endeavor to detain he by great liberality at he entrance upon this new professorship which be confer upon he in 1715 he pronounce a oration upon the duty and office of a professor of polite literature de publicus humaniori disciplin professori proprio officio et munere and show by the usefulness and perspicuity of he lecture that he be not confine to speculative notion on that subject have a very happy method of accommodate he instruction to the different ability and attainment of he pupil nor do he suffer the publick duty of this station to hinder he from promote learning by labor of a different kind for besides many poem and oration which he recite on different occasion he write several preface to the work of other and publish many useful edition of the best latin writer with large collection of note from various commentator he be twice rector or chief governor of the university and discharge that important office with equal equity and ability and gain by he conduct in every station so much esteem that when the professorship of history of the united province become vacant it be confer on he as a addition to he honor and revenue which he might justly claim and afterwards as a proof of the continuance of they regard and a testimony that he reputation be still increase they make he chief librarian a office which be the more acceptable to he as it unite he business with he pleasure and give he a opportunity at the same time of superintend the library and carry on he study such be the course of he life till in he old age leave off he practice of walk and other exercise he begin to be afflict with the scurvy which discover itself by very torment symptom of various kind sometimes disturb he head with vertigo sometimes cause faintness in he limb and sometimes attack he leg with anguish so excruciate that all he vigor be destroy and the power of walk entirely take away till at length he left foot become motionless the violence of he pain produce irregular fever deprive he of rest and entirely debilitate he whole frame this torment disease he bear though not without some degree of impatience yet without any unbecoming or irrational despondency and apply himself in the intermission of he pain to seek for comfort in the duty of religion while he lay in this state of misery he receive a account of the promotion of two of he grandson and a catalogue of the king of france 's library present to he by the command of the king himself and express some satisfaction on all these occasion but soon divert he thought to the more important consideration of he eternal state into which he pass on the 31st of march 1741 in the seventy-third year of he age he be a man of moderate stature of great strength and activity which he preserve by temperate diet without medical exactness and by allot proportion of he time to relaxation and amusement not suffer he study to exhaust he strength but relieve they by frequent intermission a practice consistent with the most exemplary diligence and which he that omit will find at last that time may be lose like money by unseasonable avarice in he hour of relaxation he be gay and sometimes give way so far to he temper naturally satirical that he draw upon himself the ill-will of those who have be unfortunately the subject of he mirth but enemy so provoke he think it beneath he to regard or to pacify for he be fiery but not malicious disdain dissimulation and in he gay or serious hour preserve a settle detestation of falsehood so that he be a open and undisguised friend or enemy entirely unacquainted with the artifice of flatterer but so judicious in the choice of friend and so constant in he affection to they that those with whom he have contract familiarity in he youth have for the greatest part he confidence in he old age he ability which would probably have enable he to have excel in any kind of learning be chiefly employ as he station require on polite literature in which he arrive at very uncommon knowledge which however appear rather from judicious compilation than original production he style be lively and masculine but not without harshness and constraint nor perhaps always polish to that purity which some writer have attain he be at least instrumental to the instruction of mankind by the publication of many valuable performance which lay neglect by the greatest part of the learn world and if reputation be estimate by usefulness he may claim a higher degree in the rank of learning than some other of happier elocution or more vigorous imagination the malice or suspicion of those who either do not know or do not love he have give rise to some doubt about he religion which he take a opportunity of remove on he death-bed by a voluntary declaration of he faith he hope of everlasting salvation from the reveal promise of god and he confidence in the merit of we redeemer of the sincerity of which declaration he whole behavior in he long illness be a incontestable proof and he conclude he life which have be illustrious for many virtue by exhibit a example of true piety of he work we have not be able to procure a complete catalogue : he publish quintilianus 2 vol 4to valerius flaccus ovidius 4 vol 4to poet latinus minore 2 vol 4to cum noti variorum buchananus opera 2 vol 4to -lrb- 51 -rrb- sydenham -lrb- 52 -rrb- thoma sydenham be bear in the year 1624 at windford eagle in dorsetshire where he father william sydenham esq have a large fortune under whose care he be educate or in what manner he pass he childhood whether he make any early discovery of a genius peculiarly adapt to the study of nature or give any presage of he future eminence in medicine no information be to be obtain we must therefore repress that curiosity which would naturally incline we to watch the first attempt of so vigorous a mind to pursue it in its childish inquiry and see it struggle with rustick prejudice break on trifling occasion the shackle of credulity and give proof in its casual excursion that it be form to shake off the yoke of prescription and dispel the phantom of hypothesis that the strength of sydenham 's understand the accuracy of he discernment and ardor of he curiosity might have be remark from he infancy by a diligent observer there be no reason to doubt for there be no instance of any man whose history have be minutely related that do not in every part of life discover the same proportion of intellectual vigor but it have be the lot of the greatest part of those who have excel in science to be know only by they own writings and to have leave behind they no remembrance of they domestick life or private transaction or only such memorial of particular passage as be on certain occasion necessarily record in publick register from these it be discover that at the age of eighteen in 1642 he commence a commoner of magdalen hall in oxford where it be not probable that he continue long for he inform we himself that he be withhold from the university by the commencement of the war nor be it know in what state of life he engage or where he reside during that long series of publick commotion it be indeed report that he have a commission in the king 's army but no particular account be give of he military conduct nor be we tell what rank he obtain when he enter into the army or when or on what occasion he retire from it it be however certain that if ever he take upon he the profession of arm he spend but few year in the camp for in 1648 he obtain at oxford the degree of bachelor of physick for which as some medicinal knowledge be necessary it may be imagine that he spend some time in qualify himself he application to the study of physick be as he himself relate produce by a accidental acquaintance with dr cox a physician eminent at that time in london who in some sickness prescribe to he brother and attend he frequently on that occasion inquire of he what profession he design to follow the young man answer that he be undetermined the doctor recommend physick to he on what account or with what argument it be not related but he persuasion be so effectual that sydenham determine to follow he advice and retire to oxford for leisure and opportunity to pursue he study it be evident that this conversation must have happen before he promotion to any degree in physick because he himself fix it in the interval of he absence from the university a circumstance which will enable we to confute many false report relate to dr sydenham which have be confidently inculcate and implicitly believe it be the general opinion that he be make a physician by accident and necessity and sir richard blackmore report in plain term -lrb- preface to he treatise on the small pox -rrb- that he engage in practice without any preparatory study or previous knowledge of the medicinal science and affirm that when he be consult by he what book he should read to qualify he for the same profession he recommend don quixote that he recommend don quixote to blackmore we be not allow to doubt but the relater be hinder by that self-love which dazzle all mankind from discover that he might intend a satire very different from a general censure of all the ancient and modern writer on medicine since he might perhaps mean either seriously or in jest to insinuate that blackmore be not adapt by nature to the study of physick and that whether he should read cervante or hippocrate he would be equally unqualified for practice and equally unsuccessful in it whatsoever be he meaning nothing be more evident than that it be a transient sally of a imagination warm with gaiety or the negligent effusion of a mind intent upon some other employment and in haste to dismiss a troublesome intruder for it be certain that sydenham do not think it impossible to write usefully on medicine because he have himself write upon it and it be not probable that he carry he vanity so far as to imagine that no man have ever acquire the same qualification besides himself he could not but know that he rather restore than invent most of he principle and therefore could not but acknowledge the value of those writer whose doctrine he adopt and enforce that he engage in the practice of physick without any acquaintance with the theory or knowledge of the opinion or precept of former writer be undoubtedly false for he declare that after he have in pursuance of he conversation with dr cox determine upon the profession of physick he apply himself in earnest to it and spend several year in the university -lrb- aliquot anno in academica palstra -rrb- before he begin to practice in london nor be he satisfy with the opportunity of knowledge which oxford afford but travel to montpellier as dsault relate -lrb- dissertation on consumption -rrb- in quest of further information montpellier be at that time the most celebrated school of physick : so far be sydenham from any contempt of academical institution and so far from think it reasonable to learn physick by experiment alone which must necessarily be make at the hazard of life what can be demand beyond this by the most zealous advocate for regular education what can be expect from the most cautious and most industrious student than that he should dedicate several year to the rudiment of he art and travel for further instruction from one university to another it be likewise a common opinion that sydenham be thirty year old before he form he resolution of study physick for which i can discover no other foundation than one expression in he dedication to dr mapletoft which seem to have give rise to it by a gross misinterpretation for he only observe that from he conversation with dr cox to the publication of that treatise thirty year have intervene whatever may have produce this notion or how long soever it may have prevail it be now prove beyond controversy to be false since it appear that sydenham have be for some time absent from the university return to it in order to pursue he physical inquiry before he be twenty-four year old for in 1648 he be admit to the degree of bachelor of physick that such report should be confidently spread even among the contemporary of the author to whom they relate and obtain in a few year such credit as to require a regular confutation that it should be imagine that the greatest physician of the age arrive at so high a degree of skill without any assistance from he predecessor and that a man eminent for integrity practice medicine by chance and grow wise only by murder be not to be consider without astonishment but if it be on the other part remember how much this opinion favor the laziness of some and the pride of other how readily some man confide in natural sagacity and how willingly most would spare themselves the labor of accurate reading and tedious inquiry it will be easily discover how much the interest of multitude be engage in the production and continuance of this opinion and how cheaply those of whom it be know that they practice physick before they study it might satisfy themselves and other with the example of the illustrious sydenham it be therefore in a uncommon degree useful to publish a true account of this memorable man that pride temerity and idleness may be deprive of that patronage which they have enjoy too long that life may be secure from the dangerous experiment of the ignorant and presumptuous and that those who shall hereafter assume the important province of superintend the health of other may learn from this great master of the art that the only means of arrive at eminence and success be labor and study from these false report it be probable that another arise to which though it can not be with equal certainty confute it do not appear that entire credit ought to be give the acquisition of a latin style do not seem consistent with the manner of life imputed to he nor be it probable that he who have so diligently cultivate the ornamental part of general literature would have neglect the essential study of he own profession those therefore who be determine at whatever price to retain he in they own party and represent he equally ignorant and daring with themselves deny he the credit of write he own work in the language in which they be publish and assert but without proof that they be compose by he in english and translate into latin by dr mapletoft whether dr mapletoft live and be familiar with he during the whole time in which these several treatise be print treatise write on particular occasion and print at period considerably distant from each other we have have no opportunity of inquire and therefore can not demonstrate the falsehood of this report but if it be consider how unlikely it be that any man should engage in a work so laborious and so little necessary only to advance the reputation of another or that he should have leisure to continue the same office upon all follow occasion if it be remember how seldom such literary combination be form and how soon they be for the greatest part dissolve there will appear no reason for not allow dr sydenham the laurel of eloquence as well as physick -lrb- 53 -rrb- it be observable that he processus integrus publish after he death discover alone more skill in the latin language than be commonly ascribe to he and it surely will not be suspect that the officiousness of he friend be continue after he death or that he procure the book to be translate only that by leave it behind he he might secure he claim to he other writings it be assert by sir han sloane that dr sydenham with whom he be familiarly acquaint be particularly verse in the writings of the great roman orator and philosopher and there be evidently such a luxuriance in he style as may discover the author which give he most pleasure and most engage he imitation about the same time that he become bachelor of physick he obtain by the interest of a relation a fellowship of all soul ' college have submit by the subscription require to the authority of the visitor appoint by the parliament upon what principle or how consistently with he former conduct it be now impossible to discover when he think himself qualify for practice he fix he residence in westminster become doctor of physick at cambridge receive a license from the college of physician and live in the first degree of reputation and the greatest affluence of practice for many year without any other enemy than those which he raise by the superior merit of he conduct the brighter lustre of he ability or he improvement of he science and he contempt of pernicious method support only by authority in opposition to sound reason and indubitable experience these man be indebted to he for conceal they name when he record they malice since they have thereby escape the contempt and detestation of posterity it be a melancholy reflection that they who have obtain the highest reputation by preserve or restore the health of other have often be hurry away before the natural decline of life or have pass many of they year under the torment of those distemper which they profess to relieve in this number be sydenham whose health begin to fail in the fifty-second year of he age by the frequent attack of the gout to which he be subject for a great part of he life and which be afterwards accompany with the stone in the kidney and its natural consequence bloody urine these be distemper which even the art of sydenham could only palliate without hope of a perfect cure but which if he have not be able by he precept to instruct we to remove he have at least by he example teach we to bear for he never betray any indecent impatience or unmanly dejection under he torment but support himself by the reflection of philosophy and the consolation of religion and in every interval of ease apply himself to the assistance of other with he usual assiduity after a life thus usefully employ he die at he house in pall-mall on the 29th of December 1689 and be bury in the aisle near the south door of the church of st jame in westminster what be he character as a physician appear from the treatise which he have leave which it be not necessary to epitomise or transcribe and from they it may likewise be collect that he skill in physick be not he highest excellence that he whole character be amiable that he chief view be the benefit of mankind and the chief motive of he action the will of god whom he mention with reverence well become the most enlighten and most penetrate mind he be benevolent candid and communicative sincere and religious quality which it be happy if they could copy from he who emulate he knowledge and imitate he method cheynel -lrb- 54 -rrb- there be always this advantage in contend with illustrious adversary that the combatant be equally immortalize by conquest or defeat he that die by the sword of a hero will always be mention when the act of he enemy be mention the man of whose life the follow account be offer to the publick be indeed eminent among he own party and have quality which employ in a good cause would have give he some claim to distinction but no one be now so much blind with bigotry as to imagine he equal either to hammond or chillingworth nor would he memory perhaps have be preserve have he not by be conjoin with illustrious name become the object of publick curiosity franci cheynel be bear in 1608 at oxford -lrb- 55 -rrb- where he father dr john cheynel who have be fellow of corpus christus college practice physick with great reputation he be educate in one of the grammar school of he native city and in the beginning of the year 1623 become a member of the university it be probable that he lose he father when he be very young for it appear that before 1629 he mother have marry dr abbot bishop of salisbury whom she have likewise bury from this marriage he receive great advantage for he mother be now ally to dr brent then warden of merton college exert she interest so vigorously that he be admit there a probationer and afterwards obtain a fellowship -lrb- 56 -rrb- have take the degree of master of art he be admit to order accord to the rite of the church of england and hold a curacy near oxford together with he fellowship he continue in he college till he be qualify by he year of residence for the degree of bachelor of divinity which he attempt to take in 1641 but be deny he grace -lrb- 57 -rrb- for dispute concern predestination contrary to the king 's injunction this refusal of he degree he mention in he dedication to he account of mr chillingworth : do not conceive that i snatch up my pen in a angry mood that i might vent my dangerous wit and ease my overburdened spleen no no i have almost forget the visitation of merton college and the denial of my grace the plundering of my house and little library : i know when and where and of whom to demand satisfaction for all these injury and indignity i have learn ` centum plagas spartana nobilitate concoquere ' i have not learn how to plunder other of goods or living and make myself amends by force of arm i will not take a living which belong to any civil studious learn delinquent unless it be the much-neglected _ commendam _ of some lordly prelate condemn by the known law of the land and the highest court of the kingdom for some offence of the first magnitude it be observable that he declare himself to have almost forget he injury and indignity though he recount they with a appearance of acrimony which be no proof that the impression be much weakened and insinuate he design of demand at a proper time satisfaction for they these vexation be the consequence rather of the abuse of learning than the want of it no one that read he work can doubt that he be turbulent obstinate and petulant and ready to instruct he superior when he most need instruction from they whatever he believe -lrb- and the warmth of he imagination naturally make he precipitate in form he opinion -rrb- he think himself oblige to profess and what he profess he be ready to defend without that modesty which be always prudent and generally necessary and which though it be not agreeable to mr cheynel 's temper and therefore readily condemn by he be a very useful associate to truth and often introduce she by degree where she never could have force she way by argument or declamation a temper of this kind be generally inconvenient and offensive in any society but in a place of education be least to be tolerate for as authority be necessary to instruction whoever endeavor to destroy subordination by weaken that reverence which be claim by those to whom the guardianship of youth be commit by they country defeat at once the institution and may be justly drive from a society by which he think himself too wise to be govern and in which he be too young to teach and too opinionative to learn this may be readily suppose to have be the case of cheynel and i know not how those can be blame for censure he conduct or punish he disobedience who have a right to govern he and who might certainly act with equal sincerity and with greater knowledge with regard to the visitation of merton college the account be equally obscure visitor be well know to be generally call to regulate the affair of college when the member disagree with they head or with one another and the temper that dr cheynel discover will easily incline he reader to suspect that he could not long live in any place without find some occasion for debate nor debate any question without carry opposition to such a length as might make a moderator necessary whether this be he conduct at merton or whether a appeal to the visiter 's authority be make by he or he adversary or any other member of the college be not to be know it appear only that there be a visitation that he suffer by it and resent he punishment he be afterwards present to a living of great value near banbury where he have some dispute with archbishop laud of this dispute i have find no particular account calamy only say he have a ruffle with bishop laud while at he height have cheynel be equal to he adversary in greatness and learn it have not be easy to have find either a more proper opposite for they be both to the last degree zealous active and pertinacious and would have afford mankind a spectacle of resolution and boldness not often to be see but the amusement of behold the struggle would hardly have be without danger as they be too fiery not to have communicate they heat though it should have produce a conflagration of they country about the year 1641 when the whole nation be engage in the controversy about the rights of the church and necessity of episcopacy he declare himself a presbyterian and a enemy to bishop liturgy ceremony and be consider as one of the most learn and acute of he party for have spend much of he life in a college it can not be doubt that he have a considerable knowledge of book which the vehemence of he temper enable he often to display when a more timorous man would have be silent though in learn not he inferior when the war break out mr cheynel in consequence of he principle declare himself for the parliament and as he appear to have hold it as a first principle that all great and noble spirit abhor neutrality there be no doubt but that he exert himself to gain proselyte and to promote the interest of that party which he have think it he duty to espouse these endeavor be so much regard by the parliament that have take the covenant he be nominate one of the assembly of divine who be to meet at westminster for the settlement of the new discipline this distinction draw necessarily upon he the hatred of the cavalier and he living be not far distant from the king 's head-quarter he receive a visit from some of the troops who as he affirm plunder he house and drive he from it he living which be i suppose consider as forfeit by he absence though he be not suffer to continue upon it be give to a clergyman of whom he say that he would become a stage better than a pulpit a censure which i can neither confute nor admit because i have not discover who be he successor he then retire into sussex to exercise he ministry among he friend in a place where as he observe there have be little of the power of religion either know or practice as no reason can be give why the inhabitant of sussex should have less knowledge or virtue than those of other place it may be suspect that he mean nothing more than a place where the presbyterian discipline or principle have never be receive we now observe that the methodist where they scatter they opinion represent themselves as preach the gospel to unconverted nation and enthusiast of all kind have be incline to disguise they particular tenet with pompous appellation and to imagine themselves the great instrument of salvation yet it must be confess that all place be not equally enlighten that in the most civilized nation there be many corner which may be call barbarous where neither politeness nor religion nor the common art of life have yet be cultivate and it be likewise certain that the inhabitant of sussex huve be sometimes mention as remarkable for brutality from sussex he go often to london where in 1643 he preach three time before the parliament and return in November to colchester to keep the monthly fast there as be he custom he obtain a convoy of sixteen soldier whose bravery or good fortune be such that they face and put to flight more than two hundred of the king 's force in this journey he find mr chillingworth in the hand of the parliament 's troops of whose sickness and death he give the account which have be sufficiently make know to the learn world by mr maizeaux in he life of chillingworth with regard to this relation it may be observe that it be write with a air of fearless veracity and with the spirit of a man who think he cause just and he behavior without reproach nor do there appear any reason for doubt that cheynel speak and act as he relate for he do not publish a apology but a challenge and write not so much to obviate calumny as to gain from other that applause which he seem to have bestow very liberally upon himself for he behavior on that occasion since therefore this relation be credible a great part of it be support by evidence which can not be refute mr maizeaux seem very justly in he life of mr chillingworth to oppose the common report that he life be shorten by the inhumanity of those to whom he be a prisoner for cheynel appear to have preserve amidst all he detestation of the opinion which he imputed to he a great kindness to he person and veneration for he capacity nor do he appear to have be cruel to he otherwise than by that incessant importunity of disputation to which he be doubtless incite by a sincere belief of the danger of he soul if he should die without renounce some of he opinion the same kindness which make he desirous to convert he before he death would incline he to preserve he from die before he be convert and accordingly we find that when the castle be yield he take care to procure he a commodious lodging when he be to have be unseasonably remove he attempt to shorten he journey which he know would be dangerous when the physician be disgust by chillingworth 's distrust he prevail upon he as the symptom grow more dangerous to renew he visit and when death leave no other act of kindness to be practice procure he the rite of burial which some would have deny he have do thus far justice to the humanity of cheynel it be proper to inquire how far he deserve blame he appear to have extend none of that kindness to the opinion of chillingworth which he show to he person for he interpret every word in the worst sense and seem industrious to discover in every line heresy which might have escape for ever any other apprehension : he appear always suspicious of some latent malignity and ready to persecute what he only suspect with the same violence as if it have be openly avow : in all he procedure he show himself sincere but without candor about this time cheynel in pursuance of he natural ardor attend the army under the command of the earl of essex and add the praise of valor to that of learn for he distinguish himself so much by he personal bravery and obtain so much skill in the science of war that he command be obey by the colonel with as much respect as those of the general he seem indeed to have be bear a soldier for he have a intrepidity which be never to be shake by any danger and a spirit of enterprise not to be discourage by difficulty which be support by a unusual degree of bodily strength he service of all kind be think of so much importance ty the parliament that they bestow upon he the living of petworth in sussex this living be of the value of seven hundred pound per annum from which they have eject a man remarkable for he loyalty and therefore in they opinion not worthy of such revenue and it may be inquire whether in accept this preferment cheynel do not violate the protestation which he make in the passage already recite and whether he do not suffer he resolution to be overborne by the temptation of wealth in 1646 when oxford be take by the force of the parliament and the reformation of the university be resolve mr cheynel be send with six other to prepare the way for a visitation be authorize by the parliament to preach in any of the church without regard to the right of the member of the university that they doctrine might prepare they hearer for the change which be intend when they arrive at oxford they begin to execute they commission by possess themselves of the pulpit but if the relation of wood -lrb- 58 -rrb- be to be regard be hear with very little veneration those who have be accustom to the preacher of oxford and the liturgy of the church of england be offend at the emptiness of they discourse which be noisy and unmeaning at the unusual gesture the wild distortion and the uncouth tone with which they be deliver at the coldness of they prayer for the king and the vehemence and exuberance of those which they do not fail to utter for _ the bless council _ and action of the parliament and army and at what be surely not to be remark without indignation they omission of the lord 's prayer but power easily supply the want of reverence and they proceed in they plan of reformation and think sermon not so efficacious to conversion as private interrogatory and exhortation they establish a weekly meeting for _ free tender conscience from scruple _ at a house that from the business to which it be appropriate be call the _ scruple-shop _ with this project they be so well pleased that they send to the parliament a account of it which be afterwards print and be ascribe by wood to mr cheynel they continue for some week to hold they meeting regularly and to admit great number whom curiosity or a desire of conviction or a compliance with the prevail party bring thither but they tranquillity be quickly disturb by the turbulence of the independent whose opinion then prevail among the soldier and be very industriously propagate by the discourse of william earbury a preacher of great reputation among they who one day gather a considerable number of he most zealous follower go to the house appoint for the resolution of scruple on a day which be set apart for the disquisition of the dignity and office of a minister and begin to dispute with great vehemence against the presbyterian whom he deny to have any true minister among they and whose assembly he affirm not to be the true church he be oppose with equal heat by the presbyterian and at length they agree to examine the point another day in a regular disputation accordingly they appoint the 12th of November for a inquiry : whether in the christian church the office of minister be commit to any particular person on the day fix the antagonist appear each attend by great number but when the question be propose they begin to wrangle not about the doctrine which they have engage to examine but about the term of the proposition which the independent allege to be change since they agreement and at length the soldier insist that the question should be whether those who call themselves minister have more right or power to preach the gospel than any other man that be a christian this question be debate for some time with great vehemence and confusion but without any prospect of a conclusion at length one of the soldier who think they have a equal right with the rest to engage in the controversy demand of the presbyterian whence they themselves receive they order whether from bishop or any other person this unexpected interrogatory put they to great difficulty for it happen that they be all ordain by the bishop which they dare not acknowledge for fear of expose themselves to a general censure and be convict from they own declaration in which they have frequently condemn episcopacy as contrary to christianity nor durst they deny it because they might have be confute and must at once have sink into contempt the soldier see they perplexity insult they and go away boast of they victory nor do the presbyterian for some time recover spirit enough to renew they meeting or to proceed in the work of ease conscience earbury exult at the victory which not he own ability but the subtlety of the soldier have procure he begin to vent he notion of every kind without scruple and at length assert that the saint have a equal measure of the divine nature with we savior though not equally manifest at the same time he take upon he the dignity of a prophet and begin to utter prediction relate to the affair of england and ireland he prophecy be not much regard but he doctrine be censure by the presbyterian in they pulpit and mr cheynel challenge he to a disputation to which he agree and at he first appearance in st mary 's church address he audience in the follow manner : christian friend kind fellow-soldier and worthy student i the humble servant of all mankind be this day draw against my will out of my cell into this publick assembly by the double chain of accusation and a challenge from the pulpit i have be charge with heresy i have be challenge to come hither in a letter write by mr franci cheynel here then i stand in defense of myself and my doctrine which i shall introduce with only this declaration that i claim not the office of a minister on account of any outward call though i formerly receive ordination nor do i boast of illumination or the knowledge of we savior though i have be hold in esteem by other and formerly by myself for i now declare that i know nothing and be nothing nor would i be think of otherwise than as a inquirer and seeker he then advance he former position in stronger term and with addition equally detestable which cheynel attack with the vehemence which in so warm a temper such horrid assertion might naturally excite the dispute frequently interrupt by the clamor of the audience and tumult raise to disconcert cheynel who be very unpopular continue about four hour and then both the controvertist grow weary and retire the presbyterian afterwards think they should more speedily put a end to the heresy of earbury by power than by argument and by solicit general fairfax procure he removal mr cheynel publish a account of this dispute under the title of faith triumphing over error and heresy in a revelation & c nor can it be doubt but he have the victory where he cause give he so great superiority somewhat before this he captious and petulant disposition engage he in a controversy from which he could not expect to gain equal reputation dr hammond have not long before publish he practical catechism in which mr cheynel accord to he custom find many error imply if not assert and therefore as it be much read think it convenient to censure it in the pulpit of this dr hammond be inform desire he in a letter to communicate he objection to which mr cheynel return a answer write with he usual temper and therefore somewhat perverse the controversy be draw out to a considerable length and the papers on both side be afterwards make publick by dr hammond in 1647 it be determine by parliament that the reformation of oxford should be more vigorously carry on and mr cheynel be nominate one of the visiter the general process of the visitation the firmness and fidelity of the student the address by which the inquiry be delay and the steadiness with which it be oppose which be very particularly relate by wood and after he by walker it be not necessary to mention here as they relate not more to mr cheynel 's life than to those of he associate there be indeed some reason to believe that he be more active and virulent than the rest because he appear to have be charge in a particular manner with some of they most unjustifiable measure he be accuse of propose that the member of the university should be deny the assistance of counsel and be lampoon by name as a madman in a satire write on the visitation one action which show the violence of he temper and he disregard both of humanity and decency when they come in competition with he passion must not be forget the visiter be offend at the obstinacy of dr fall dean of christchurch and vicechancellor of the university have first deprive he of he vicechancellorship determine afterwards to dispossess he of he deanery and in the course of they proceedings think it proper to seize upon he chamber in the college this be a act which most man would willingly have refer to the officer to whom the law assign it but cheynel 's fury prompt he to a different conduct he and three more of the visiter go and demand admission which be steadily refuse they they obtain by the assistance of a file of soldier who force the door with pick-axis then enter they see mr fall in the lodgings dr fall be in prison at london and order she to quit they but find she not more obsequious than she husband they repeat they order with menace but be not able to prevail upon she to remove they then retire and leave she expose to the brutality of the soldier whom they command to keep possession which mr fall however do not leave about nine day afterwards she receive another visit of the same kind from the new chancellor the earl of pembroke who have like the other order she to depart without effect treat she with reproachful language and at last command the soldier to take she up in she chair and carry she out of door she daughter and some other gentlewoman that be with she be afterwards treat in the same manner one of whom predict without dejection that she should enter the house again with less difficulty at some other time nor be she mistaken in she conjecture for dr fall live to be restore to he deanery at the reception of the chancellor cheynel as the most accomplished of the visiter have the province of present he with the ensign of he office some of which be counterfeit and address he with a proper oration of this speech which wood have preserve i shall give some passage by which a judgment may be make of he oratory of the stave of the beadle he observe that some be stain with double guilt that some be pale with fear and that other have be make use of as crutch for the support of bad cause and desperate fortune and he remark of the book of statute which he deliver that the ignorant may perhaps admire the splendor of the cover but the learn know that the real treasure be within of these two sentence it be easily discover that the first be force and unnatural and the second trivial and low soon afterwards mr cheynel be admit to the degree of bachelor of divinity for which he grace have be deny he in 1641 and as he then suffer for a ill-timed assertion of the presbyterian doctrine he obtain that he degree should be date from the time at which he be refuse it a honor which however do not secure he from be soon after publickly reproach as a madman but the vigor of cheynel be think by he companion to deserve profit as well as honor and dr bailey the president of st john 's college be not more obedient to the authority of the parliament than the rest be deprive of he revenue and authority with which mr cheynel be immediately invest who with he usual coolness and modesty take possession of the lodgings soon after by break open the door this preferment be not think adequate to the desert or ability of mr cheynel it be therefore desire by the committee of parliament that the visiter would recommend he to the lectureship of divinity found by the lady margaret to recommend he and to choose be at that time the same and he have now the pleasure of propagate he darling doctrine of predestination without interruption and without danger be thus flush with power and success there be little reason for doubt that he give way to he natural vehemence and indulge himself in the utmost excess of rage zeal by which he be indeed so much distinguish that in a satire mention by wood he be dignified by the title of archvisiter a appellation which he seem to have be industrious to deserve by severity and inflexibility for not contented with the commission which he and he colleague have already receive he procure six or seven of the member of parliament to meet privately in mr rouse 's lodgings and assume the style and authority of a committee and from they obtain a more extensive and tyrannical power by which the visitor be enable to force the _ solemn league and covenant _ and the _ negative oath _ upon all the member of the university and to prosecute those for a contempt who do not appear to a citation at whatever distance they might be and whatever reason they might assign for they absence by this method he easily drive great number from the university whose place he supply with man of he own opinion whom he be very industrious to draw from other part with promise of make a liberal provision for they out of the spoil of heretick and malignant have in time almost extirpate those opinion which he find so prevalent at he arrival or at least oblige those who would not recant to a appearance of conformity he be at leisure for employment which deserve to be record with greater commendation about this time many socinian writer begin to publish they notion with great boldness which the presbyterian consider as heretical and impious think it necessary to confute and therefore cheynel who have now obtain he doctor 's degree be desire in 1649 to write a vindication of the doctrine of the trinity which he perform and publish the next year he draw up likewise a confutation of some socinian tenet advance by john fry a man who spend great part of he life in range from one religion to another and who sit as one of the judge on the king but be expel afterwards from the house of common and disabled from sit in parliament dr cheynel be say to have show himself evidently superior to he in the controversy and be answer by he only with a opprobrious book against the presbyterian clergy of the remain part of he life there be find only a obscure and confused account he quit the presidentship of st john 's and the professorship in 1650 as calamy relate because he would not take the engagement and give a proof that he could suffer as well as act in a cause which he believe just we have indeed no reason to question he resolution whatever occasion might be give to exert it nor be it probable that he fear affliction more than danger or that he would not have bear persecution himself for those opinion which incline he to persecute other he do not suffer much upon this occasion for he retain the living of petworth to which he thenceforward confine he labor and where he be very assiduous and as calamy affirm very successful in the exercise of he ministry it be he peculiar character to be warm and zealous in all he undertaking this heat of he disposition increase by the uncommon turbulence of the time in which he live and by the opposition to which the unpopular nature of some of he employment expose he be at last heighten to distraction so that he be for some year disorder in he understanding as both wood and calamy relate but with such difference as might be expect from they opposite principle wood appear to think that a tendency to madness be discoverable in a great part of he life calamy that it be only transient and accidental though in he addition to he first narrative he plead it as a extenuation of that fury with which he kindest friend confess he to have act on some occasion wood declare that he die little better than distract calamy that he be perfectly recover to a sound mind before the restoration at which time he retire to preston a small village in sussex be turn out of he living at petworth it do not appear that he keep he living till the general ejection of the nonconformist and it be not unlikely that the asperity of he carriage and the known virulence of he temper might have raise he enemy who be willing to make he feel the effect of persecution which he have so furiously incite against other but of this incident of he life there be no particular account after he deprivation he live till he death which happen in 1665 at a small village near chichester upon a paternal estate not augment by the large preferment waste upon he in the triumph of he party have be remarkable throughout he life for hospitality and contempt of money cave -lrb- 59 -rrb- the curiosity of the publick seem to demand the history of every man who have by whatever mean rise to eminence and few life would have more reader than that of the compiler of the gentleman 's magazine if all those who receive improvement or entertainment from he should retain so much kindness for they benefactor as to inquire after he conduct and character edward cave be bear at newton in warwickshire feb 29 1691 he father -lrb- joseph -rrb- be the younger son of mr edward cave of cave 's - in-the-hole a lone house on the street road in the same county which take its name from the occupier but have concur with he elder brother in cut off the entail of a small hereditary estate by which act it be lose from the family he be reduce to follow in rugby the trade of a shoemaker he be a man of good reputation in he narrow circle and remarkable for strength and rustick intrepidity he live to a great age and be in he latter year support by he son it be fortunate for edward cave that have a disposition to literary attainment he be not cut off by the poverty of he parent from opportunity of cultivate he faculty the school of rugby in which he have by the rule of its foundation a right to be instruct be then in high reputation under the reverend mr holyock to whose care most of the neighbouring family even of the highest rank intrust they son he have judgment to discover and for some time generosity to encourage the genius of young cave and be so well pleased with he quick progress in the school that he declare he resolution to breed he for the university and recommend he as a servitor to some of he scholar of high rank but prosperity which depend upon the caprice of other be of short duration cave 's superiority in literature exalt he to a invidious familiarity with boy who be far above he in rank and expectation and as in unequal association it always happen whatever unlucky prank be play be imputed to cave when any mischief great or small be do though perhaps other boast of the stratagem when it be successful yet upon detection or miscarriage the fault be sure to fall upon poor cave at last he mistress by some invisible means lose a favorite cock cave be with little examination stigmatise as the thief and murderer not because he be more apparently criminal than other but because he be more easily reach by vindictive justice from that time mr holyock withdraw he kindness visibly from he and treat he with harshness which the crime in its utmost aggravation could scarcely deserve and which surely he would have forborne have he consider how hardly the habitual influence of birth and fortune be resist and how frequently man not wholly without sense of virtue be betray to act more atrocious than the robbery of a hen-roost by a desire of please they superior those reflection he master never make or make without effect for under pretence that cave obstruct the discipline of the school by sell clandestine assistance and supply exercise to idler he be oppress with unreasonable task that there might be a opportunity of quarrel with he failure and when he diligence have surmount they no regard be pay to the performance cave bear this persecution awhile and then leave the school and the hope of a literary education to seek some other means of gain a livelihood he be first place with a collector of the excise he use to recount with some pleasure a journey or two which he ride with he as he clerk and relate the victory that he gain over the exciseman in grammatical disputation but the insolence of he mistress who employ he in servile drudgery quickly disgust he and he go up to london in quest of more suitable employment he be recommend to a timber-merchant at the bankside and while he be there on liking be say to have give hope of great mercantile ability but this place he soon leave i know not for what reason and be bind apprentice to mr collin a printer of some reputation and deputy alderman this be a trade for which man be formerly qualify by a literary education and which be please to cave because it furnish some employment for he scholastick attainment here therefore he resolve to settle though he master and mistress live in perpetual discord and they house be therefore no comfortable habitation from the inconveniency of these domestick tumult he be soon release have in only two year attain so much skill in he art and gain so much the confidence of he master that he be send without any superintendant to conduct a printing-office at norwich and publish a weekly paper in this undertaking he meet with some opposition which produce a publick controversy and procure young cave the reputation of a writer he master die before he apprenticeship be expire and he be not able to bear the perverseness of he mistress he therefore quit she house upon a stipulate allowance and marry a young widow with whom he live at bow when he apprenticeship be over he work as a journeyman at the printing-house of mr barber a man much distinguish and employ by the tory whose principle have at that time so much prevalence with cave that he be for some year a writer in mist 's journal which though he afterwards obtain by he wife 's interest a small place in the post-office he for some time continue but as interest be powerful and conversation however mean in time persuasive he by degree incline to another party in which however he be always moderate though steady and determine when he be admit into the post-office he still continue at he interval of attendance to exercise he trade or to employ himself with some typographical business he correct the gradus ad parnassum and be liberally reward by the company of stationer he write a account of the criminal which have for some time a considerable sale and publish many little pamphlet that accident bring into he hand of which it would be very difficult to recover the memory by the correspondence which he place in the post-office facilitate he procure country newspaper and sell they intelligence to a journalist in london for a guinea a week he be afterwards raise to the office of clerk of the frank in which he act with great spirit and firmness and often stop frank which be give by member of parliament to they friend because he think such extension of a peculiar right illegal this raise many complaint and have stop among other a frank give to the old dutchess of marlborough by mr walter plummer he be cite before the house as for a breach of privilege and accuse i suppose very unjustly of open letter to detect they he be treat with great harshness and severity but decline they question by plead he oath of secrecy be at last dismiss and it must be record to he honor that when he be eject from he office he do not think himself discharge from he trust but continue to refuse to he nearest friend any information about the management of the office by this constancy of diligence and diversification of employment he in time collect a sum sufficient for the purchase of a small printing-office and begin the gentleman 's magazine a periodical pamphlet of which the scheme be know wherever the english language be speak to this undertaking he owe the affluence in which he pass the last twenty year of he life and the fortune which he leave behind he which though large have be yet larger have he not rashly and wantonly impair it by innumerable project of which i know not that ever one succeed the gentleman 's magazine which have now subsist fifty year and still continue to enjoy the favor of the world -lrb- 60 -rrb- be one of the most successful and lucrative pamphlet which literary history have upon record and therefore deserve in this narrative particular notice mr cave when he form the project be far from expect the success which he find and other have so little prospect of its consequence that though he have for several year talk of he plan among printer and bookseller none of they think it worth the trial that they be not restrain by virtue from the execution of another man 's design be sufficiently apparent as soon as that design begin to be gainful for in a few year a multitude of magazine arise and perish : only the london magazine support by a powerful association of bookseller and circulate with all the art and all the cunning of trade exempt itself from the general fate of cave 's invader and obtain though not a equal yet a considerable sale -lrb- 61 -rrb- cave now begin to aspire to popularity and be a greater lover of poetry than any other art he sometimes offer subject for poem and propose prize for the best performer the first prize be fifty pound for which be but newly acquaint with wealth and think the influence of fifty pound extremely great he expect the first author of the kingdom to appear as competitor and offer the allotment of the prize to the university but when the time come no name be see among the writer that have ever be see before the university and several private man reject the province of assign the prize at all this mr cave wonder for awhile but he natural judgment and a wider acquaintance with the world soon cure he of he astonishment as of many other prejudice and error nor have many man be see raise by accident or industry to sudden riches that retain less of the meanness of they former state he continue to improve he magazine and have the satisfaction of see its success proportionate to he diligence till in 1751 he wife die of a asthma he seem not at first much affect by she death but in a few day lose he sleep and he appetite which he never recover but after have linger about two year with many vicissitude of amendment and relapse fall by drinking acid liquor into a diarrhoea and afterwards into a kind of lethargick insensibility in which one of the last act of reason which he exert be fondly to press the hand that be now write this little narrative he die on the 10th of January 1754 have just conclude the twenty-third annual collection -lrb- 62 -rrb- he be a man of a large stature not only tall but bulky and be when young of remarkable strength and activity he be generally healthful and capable of much labor and long application but in the latter year of he life be afflict with the gout which he endeavor to cure or alleviate by a total abstinence both from strong liquor and animal food from animal food he abstain about four year and from strong liquor much longer but the gout continue unconquered perhaps unabated he resolution and perseverance be very uncommon in whatever he undertake neither expense nor fatigue be able to repress he but he constancy be calm and to those who do not know he appear faint and languid but he always go forward though he move slowly the same chilness of mind be observable in he conversation he be watch the minutest accent of those assist only by a classical education which he receive at the grammar school of this town plan execute and establish a literary work call the gentleman 's magazine whereby he acquire a ample fortune the whole of which devolve to he family here also lie the body of william cave second son of the say joseph cave who die may 2 1757 aged 62 year and who have survive he elder brother edward cave inherit from he a competent estate and in gratitude to he benefactor order this monument to perpetuate he memory he liv would a patriarch in he numerous race and show would in charity a christian 's grace : whate'er a friend or parent feel he know he hand be open and he heart be true in what he gain would and give he teach mankind a grateful always be a generous mind here rest he clay he soul must ever rest who bless would when live die must be blest whom he disgust by seem inattention and he visitant be surprise when he come a second time by preparation to execute the scheme which he suppose never to have be hear he be consistently with this general tranquillity of mind a tenacious maintainer though not a clamorous demander of he right in he youth have summon he fellow-journeymen to concert measure against the oppression of they master he mount a kind of rostrum and harangue they so efficaciously that they determine to resist all future invasion and when the stamp-office demand to stamp the last half-sheet of the magazine mr cave alone defeat they claim to which the proprietor of the rival magazine would meanly have submit he be a friend rather easy and constant than zealous a would active yet many instance might be give where both he money and he diligence be employ liberally for other he enmity be in like manner cool and deliberate but though cool it be not insidious and though deliberate not pertinacious he mental faculty be slow he see little at a time but that little he see with great exactness he be long in find the right but seldom fail to find it at last he affection be not easily gain and he opinion not quickly discover he reserve as it might hide he fault conceal he virtue but such he be as they who best know he have most lament king of prussium -lrb- 63 -rrb- charle frederick the present king of prussium whose action and design now keep europe in attention be the eldest son of frederick william by sophium dorothea daughter of george the first king of england he be bear January 24 1711-12 of he early year nothing remarkable have be transmit to we as he advance towards manhood he become remarkable by he disagreement with he father the late king of prussium be of a disposition violent and arbitrary of narrow view and vehement passion earnestly engage in little pursuit or in scheme terminate in some speedy consequence without any plan of lasting advantage to himself or he subject or any prospect of distant event he be therefore always busy though no effect of he activity ever appear and always eager though he have nothing to gain he behavior be to the last degree rough and savage the least provocation whether design or accidental be return by blow which he do not always forbear to the queen and princess from such a king and such a father it be not any enormous violation of duty in the immediate heir of a kingdom sometimes to differ in opinion and to maintain that difference with decent pertinacity a prince of a quick sagacity and comprehensive knowledge must find many practice in the conduct of affair which he could not approve and some which he could scarcely forbear to oppose the chief pride of the old king be to be master of the tallest regiment in europe he therefore bring together from all part man above the common military standard to exceed the height of six foot be a certain recommendation to notice and to approach that of seven a claim to distinction man will readily go where they be sure to be caress and he have therefore such a collection of giant as perhaps be never see in the world before to review this towering regiment be he daily pleasure and to perpetuate it be so much he care that when he meet a tall woman he immediately command one of he titanian retinue to marry she that they might propagate procerity and produce heir to the father 's habiliment in all this there be apparent folly but there be no crime the tall regiment make a fine show at a expense not much greater when once it be collect than would have be bestow upon common man but the king 's military pastime be sometimes more pernicious he maintain a numerous army of which he make no other use than to review and to talk of it and when he or perhaps he emissary see a boy whose form and sprightliness promise a future soldier he order a kind of badge to be put about he neck by which he be mark out for the service like the son of christian captive in turkey and he parent be forbid to destine he to any other mode of life this be sufficiently oppressive but this be not the utmost of he tyranny he have learn though otherwise perhaps no very great politician that to be rich be to be powerful but that the riches of a king ought to be see in the opulence of he subject he want either ability or benevolence to understand he therefore raise exorbitant tax from every kind of commodity and possession and pile up the money in he treasury from which it issue no more how the land which have pay tax once be to pay they a second time how impost could be levy without commerce or commerce continue without money it be not he custom to inquire eager to snatch at money and delighted to count it he feel new joy at every receipt and think himself enrich by the impoverishment of he dominion by which of these freak of royalty the prince be offend or whether as perhaps more frequently happen the offence of which he complain be of a domestick and personal kind it be not easy to discover but he resentment whatever be its cause rise so high that he resolve not only to leave he father 's court but he territory and to seek a refuge among the neighbouring or kindred prince it be generally believe that he intention be to come to england and live under the protection of he uncle till he father 's death or change of conduct should give he liberty to return he design whatever it be he concerted with a officer in the army whose name be kat a man in whom he place great confidence and whom have choose he for the companion of he flight he necessarily trust with the preparatory measure a prince can not leave he country with the speed of a meaner fugitive something be to be provide and something to be adjust and whether kat find the agency of other necessary and therefore be constrain to admit some partner of the secret whether levity or vanity incite he to disburden himself of a trust that swell in he bosom or to show to a friend or mistress he own importance or whether it be in itself difficult for prince to transact any thing in secret so it be that the king be inform of the intended flight and the prince and he favorite a little before the time settle for they departure be arrest and confine in different place the life of prince be seldom in danger the hazard of they irregularity fall only on those whom ambition or affection combine with they the king after a imprisonment of some time set he son at liberty but poor kat be order to be try for a capital crime the court examine the cause and acquit he : the king remand he to a second trial and oblige he judge to condemn he in consequence of the sentence thus tyrannically extort he be publickly behead leave behind he some papers of reflection make in the prison which be afterwards print and among other a admonition to the prince for whose sake he suffer not to foster in himself the opinion of destiny for that a providence be discoverable in every thing round we this cruel prosecution of a man who have commit no crime but by compliance with influence not easily to be resist be not the only act by which the old king irritated he son a lady with whom the prince be suspect of intimacy perhaps more than virtue allow be seize i know not upon what accusation and by the king 's order notwithstanding all the reason of decency and tenderness that operate in other country and other judicature be publickly whip in the street of berlin at last that the prince might feel the power of a king and a father in its utmost rigor he be in 1733 marry against he will to the princess elizabetha christina of brunswick luneburg beveren he marry she indeed at he father 's command but without profess for she either esteem or affection and consider the claim of parental authority fully satisfy by the external ceremony obstinately and perpetually during the life of he father refrain from she bed the poor princess live about seven year in the court of berlin in a state which the world have not often see a wife without a husband marry so far as to engage she person to a man who do not desire she affection and of whom it be doubtful whether he think himself restrain from the power of repudiation by a act perform under evident compulsion thus he live secluded from publick business in contention with he father in alienation from he wife this state of uneasiness he find the only means of soften he divert he mind from the scene about he by study and liberal amusement the study of prince seldom produce great effect for prince draw with meaner mortal the lot of understanding and since of many student not more than one can be hope to advance far towards perfection it be scarcely to be expect that we should find that one a prince that the desire of science should overpower in any mind the love of pleasure when it be always present or always within call that laborious meditation should be prefer in the day of youth to amusement and festivity or that perseverance should press forward in contempt of flattery and that he in whom moderate acquisition would be extol as prodigy should exact from himself that excellence of which the whole world conspire to spare he the necessity in every great performance perhaps in every great character part be the gift of nature part the contribution of accident and part very often not the greatest part the effect of voluntary election and regular design the king of prussium be undoubtedly bear with more than common ability but that he have cultivate they with more than common diligence be probably the effect of he peculiar condition of that which he then consider as cruelty and misfortune in this long interval of unhappiness and obscurity he acquire skill in the mathematical science such as be say to have put he on the level with those who have make they the business of they life this be probably to say too much : the acquisition of king be always magnify he skill in poetry and in the french language have be loudly praise by voltaire a judge without exception if he honesty be equal to he knowledge musick he not only understand but practise on the german flute in the highest perfection so that accord to the regal censure of philip of macedon he may be ashamed to play so well he may be say to owe to the difficulty of he youth a advantage less frequently obtain by prince than literature and mathematick the necessity of pass he time without pomp and of partaking of the pleasure and labor of a lower station make he acquaint with the various form of life and with the genuine passion interest desire and distress of mankind king without this help from temporary infelicity see the world in a mist which magnify every thing near they and bound they view to a narrow compass which few be able to extend by the mere force of curiosity i have always think that what cromwell have more than we lawful king he owe to the private condition in which he first enter the world and in which he long continue : in that state he learn he art of secret transaction and the knowledge by which he be able to oppose zeal to zeal and make one enthusiast destroy another the king of prussium gain the same art and be bear to fairer opportunity of use they bring to the throne the knowledge of a private man without the guilt of usurpation of this general acquaintance with the world there may be find some trace in he whole life he conversation be like that of other man upon common topick he letter have a air of familiar elegance and he whole conduct be that of a man who have to do with man and who be not ignorant what motive will prevail over friend or enemy in 1740 the old king fall sick and speak and act in he illness with he usual turbulence and roughness reproach he physician in the grossest term with they unskilfulness and impotence and impute to they ignorance or wickedness the pain which they prescription fail to relieve these insult they bear with the submission which be commonly pay to despotick monarch till at last the celebrated hoffman be consult who fail like the rest to give ease to he majesty be like the rest treat with injurious language hoffman conscious of he own merit reply that he could not bear reproach which he do not deserve that he have try all the remedy that art could supply or nature could admit that he be indeed a professor by he majesty 's bounty but that if he ability or integrity be doubt he be willing to leave not only the university but the kingdom and that he could not be drive into any place where the name of hoffman would want respect the king however unaccustomed to such return be strike with conviction of he own indecency tell hoffman that he have speak well and request he to continue he attendance the king find he distemper gain upon he strength grow at last sensible that he end be approach and order the prince to be call to he bed lay several injunction upon he of which one be to perpetuate the tall regiment by continual recruit and another to receive he espoused wife the prince give he a respectful answer but wisely avoid to diminish he own right or power by a absolute promise and the king die uncertain of the fate of the tall regiment the young king begin he reign with great expectation which he have yet surpass he father 's fault produce many advantage to the first year of he reign he have a army of seventy thousand man well discipline without any imputation of severity to himself and be master of a vast treasure without the crime or reproach of raise it it be publickly say in we house of common that he have eight million sterling of we money but i believe he that say it have not consider how difficultly eight million would be find in all the prussian dominion man judge of what they do not see by that which they see we be use to talk in england of million with great familiarity and imagine that there be the same affluence of money in other country in country whose manufacture be few and commerce little every man 's first care be necessarily domestick the king be now no longer under influence or its appearance determine how to act towards the unhappy lady who have possess for seven year the empty title of the princess of prussium the papers of those time exhibit the conversation of they first interview as if the king who plan campaign in silence would not accommodate a difference with he wife but with writer of news admit as witness it be certain that he receive she as queen but whether he treat she as a wife be yet in dispute in a few day he resolution be know with regard to the tall regiment for some recruit be offer he he reject they and this body of giant by continue disregard moulder away he treat he mother with great respect order that she should bear the title of _ queen mother _ and that instead of address he as _ he majesty _ she should only call he _ son _ as he be pass soon after between berlin and potsdam a thousand boy who have be mark out for military service surround he coach and cry out : merciful king deliver we from we slavery he promise they they liberty and order the next day that the badge should be take off he still continue that correspondence with learn man which he begin when he be prince and the eye of all scholar a race of mortal form for dependence be upon he as a man likely to renew the time of patronage and to emulate the bounty of lewi the fourteenth it soon appear that he be resolve to govern with very little ministerial assistance : he take cognizance of every thing with he own eye declare that in all contrariety of interest between he and he subject the publick good should have the preference and in one of the first exertion of regal power banish the prime minister and favorite of he father as one that have betray he master and abuse he trust he then declare he resolution to grant a general toleration of religion and among other liberality of concession allow the profession of free-masonry it be the great taint of he character that he have give reason to doubt whether this toleration be the effect of charity or indifference whether he mean to support good man of every religion or consider all religion as equally good there have subsist for some time in prussium a order call the order for favor which accord to its denomination have be confer with very little distinction the king institute the order for merit with which he honor those whom he consider as deserving there be some who think they merit not sufficiently recompense by this new title but he be not very ready to grant pecuniary reward those who be most in he favor he sometimes present with snuffbox on which be inscribed amiti augmente le prix he be however charitable if not liberal for he order the magistrate of the several district to be very attentive to the relief of the poor and if the fund establish for that use be not sufficient permit that the deficiency should be supply out of the revenue of the town one of he first care be the advancement of learn immediately upon he accession he write to rollin and voltaire that he desire the continuance of they friendship and send for mr maupertui the principal of the french academician who pass a winter in lapland to verify by the mensuration of a degree near the pole the newtonian doctrine of the form of the earth he request of maupertui to come to berlin to settle a academy in term of great ardor and great condescension at the same time he show the world that literary amusement be not likely as have more than once happen to royal student to withdraw he from the care of the kingdom or make he forget he interest he begin by revive a claim to herstal and hermal two district in the possession of the bishop of liege when he send he commissary to demand the homage of the inhabitant they refuse he admission declare that they acknowledge no sovereign but the bishop the king then write a letter to the bishop in which he complain of the violation of he right and the contempt of he authority charge the prelate with countenance the late act of disobedience and require a answer in two day in three day the answer be send in which the bishop found he claim to the two lordship upon a grant of charle the fifth guarantee by france and spain allege that he predecessor have enjoy this grant above a century and that he never intend to infringe the rights of prussium but as the house of brandenburgh have always make some pretension to that territory he be willing to do what other bishop have offer to purchase that claim for a hundred thousand crown to every man that know the state of the feudal country the intricacy of they pedigree the confusion of they alliance and the different rule of inheritance that prevail in different place it will appear evident that of revive antiquated claim there can be no end and that the possession of a century be a better title than can commonly be produce so long a prescription suppose a acquiescence in the other claimant and that acquiescence suppose also some reason perhaps now unknown for which the claim be forborne whether this rule could be consider as valid in the controversy between these sovereign may however be doubt for the bishop 's answer seem to imply that the title of the house of brandenburg have be keep alive by repeat claim though the seizure of the territory have be hitherto forbear the king do not suffer he claim to be subject to any altercation but have publish a declaration in which he charge the bishop with violence and injustice and remark that the feudal law allow every man whose possession be withhold from he to enter it with a armed force he immediately despatch two thousand soldier into the controverted country where they live without control exercise every kind of military tyranny till the cry of the inhabitant force the bishop to relinquish they to the quiet government of prussium this be but a petty acquisition the time be now come when the king of prussium be to form and execute greater design on the 9th of October 1740 half europe be throw into confusion by the death of charle the sixth emperor of germany by whose death all the hereditary dominion of the house of austrium descend accord to the pragmatick sanction to he eldest daughter who be marry to the duke of lorrain at the time of the emperor 's death duke of tuscany by how many security the pragmatick sanction be fortify and how little it be regard when those security become necessary how many claimant start up at once to the several dominion of the house of austrium how vehemently they pretension be enforce and how many invasion be threaten or attempt the distress of the emperor 's daughter know for several year by the title only of the queen of hungary because hungary be the only country to which she claim have not be dispute : the firmness with which she struggle with she difficulty and the good fortune by which she surmount they the narrow plan of this essay will not suffer I to relate let they be tell by some other writer of more leisure and wider intelligence upon the emperor 's death many of the german prince fall upon the austrian territory as upon a dead carcass to be dismember among they without resistance among these with whatever justice certainly with very little generosity be the king of prussium who have assemble he troops as be imagine to support the pragmatick sanction on a sudden enter silesium with thirty thousand man publish a declaration in which he disclaim any design of injure the rights of the house of austrium but urge he claim to silesium as rise from ancient convention of family and confraternity between the house of brandenburg and the prince of silesium and other honorable title he say the fear of be defeat by other pretender to the austrian dominion oblige he to enter silesium without any previous expostulation with the queen and that he shall strenuously espouse the interest of the house of austrium such a declaration be i believe in the opinion of all europe nothing less than the aggravation of hostility by insult and be receive by the austrian with suitable indignation the king pursue he purpose march forward and in the frontier of silesium make a speech to he follower in which he tell they that he consider they rather as friend than subject that the troops of brandenburg have be always eminent for they bravery that they would always fight in he presence and that he would recompense those who should distinguish themselves in he service rather as a father than as a king the civility of the great be never throw away the soldier would naturally follow such a leader with alacrity especially because they expect no opposition : but human expectation be frequently deceive enter thus suddenly into a country which he be suppose rather likely to protect than to invade he act for some time with absolute authority but suppose that this submission would not always last he endeavor to persuade the queen to a cession of silesium imagine that she would easily be persuade to yield what be already lose he therefore order he minister to declare at vienna that he be ready to guarantee all the german dominion of the house of austrium that he would conclude a treaty with austrium russium and the maritime power that he would endeavor that the duke of lorrain should be elect emperor and believe that he could accomplish it that he would immediately advance to the queen two million of florin that in recompense for all this he require silesium to be yield to he these seem not to be the offer of a prince very much convinced of he own right he afterwards moderate he claim and order he minister to hint at vienna that half of silesium would content he the queen answer that though the king allege as he reason for enter silesium the danger of the austrian territory from other pretender and endeavor to persuade she to give up part of she possession for the preservation of the rest it be evident that he be the first and only invader and that till he enter in a hostile manner all she estate be unmolested to he promise of assistance she reply that she set a high value on the king of prussium 's friendship but that he be already oblige to assist she against she invader both by the golden bull and the pragmatick sanction of which he be a guarantee and that if these tie be of no force she know not what to hope from other engagement of he offer of alliance with russium and the maritime power she observe that it could be never fit to alienate she dominion for the consolidation of a alliance form only to keep they entire with regard to he interest in the election of a emperor she express she gratitude in strong term but add that the election ought to be free and that it must be necessarily embarrass by contention thus raise in the heart of the empire of the pecuniary assistance propose she remark that no prince ever make war to oblige another to take money and that the contribution already levy in silesium exceed the two million offer as its purchase she conclude that as she value the king 's friendship she be willing to purchase it by any compliance but the diminution of she dominion and exhort he to perform he part in support of the pragmatick sanction the king finding negotiation thus ineffectual push forward he inroad and now begin to show how secretly he could take he measure when he call a council of war he propose the question in a few word : all he general write they opinion in he presence upon separate papers which he carry away and examine they in private form he resolution without impart it otherwise than by he order he begin not without policy to seize first upon the estate of the clergy a order every where necessary and every where envy he plunder the convent of they store of provision and tell they that he never have hear of any magazine erect by the apostle this insult be mean because it be unjust but those who could not resist be oblige to bear it he proceed in he expedition and a detachment of he troops take jablunca one of the strong place of silesium which be soon after abandon for want of provision which the austrian hussar who be now in motion be busy to interrupt one of the most remarkable event of the silesium war be the conquest of great glogau which be take by a assault in the dark head by prince leopold of anhalt dessau they arrive at the foot of the fortification about twelve at night and in two hour be master of the place in attempt of this kind many accident happen which can not be hear without surprise four prussian grenadier who have climb the rampart miss they own company meet a austrian captain with fifty-two man : they be at first frighted and be about to retreat but gather courage command the austrian to lay down they arm and in the terror of darkness and confusion be unexpectedly obey at the same time a conspiracy to kill or carry away the king of prussium be say to be discover the prussian publish a memorial in which the austrian court be accuse of employ emissary and assassin against the king and it be allege in direct term that one of they have confess himself oblige by oath to destroy he which oath have be give he in a aulick council in the presence of the duke of lorrain to this the austrian answer that the character of the queen and duke be too well know not to destroy the force of such a accusation that the tale of the confession be a imposture and that no such attempt be ever make each party be now inflamed and order be give to the austrian general to hazard a battle the two army meet at molwitz and part without a complete victory on either side the austrian quit the field in good order and the king of prussium ride away upon the first disorder of he troops without wait for the last event this attention to he personal safety have not yet be forget after this there be no action of much importance but the king of prussium irritated by opposition transfer he interest in the election to the duke of bavarium and the queen of hungary now attack by france spain and bavarium be oblige to make peace with he at the expense of half silesium without procure those advantage which be once offer she to enlarge dominion have be the boast of many prince to diffuse happiness and security through wide region have be grant to few the king of prussium have aspire to both these honor and endeavor to join the praise of legislator to that of conqueror to settle property to suppress false claim and to regulate the administration of civil and criminal justice be attempt so difficult and so useful that i shall willingly suspend or contract the history of battle and siege to give a larger account of this pacifick enterprise that the king of prussium have consider the nature and the reason of law with more attention than be common to prince appear from he dissertation on the reason for enact and repeal law : a piece which yet deserve notice rather as a proof of good inclination than of great ability for there be nothing to be find in it more than the most obvious book may supply or the weakest intellect discover some of he observation be just and useful but upon such a subject who can think without often think right it be however not to be omit that he appear always propense towards the side of mercy if a poor man say he steal in he want a watch or a few piece from one to whom the loss be inconsiderable be this a reason for condemn he to death he regret that the law against duel have be ineffectual and be of opinion that they can never attain they end unless the prince of europe shall agree not to afford a asylum to duellist and to punish all who shall insult they equal either by word deed or write he seem to suspect this scheme of be chimerical yet why say he should not personal quarrel be submit to judge as well as question of possession and why should not a congress be appoint for the general good of mankind as well as for so many purpose of less importance he declare himself with great ardor against the use of torture and by some misinformation charge the english that they still retain it it be perhaps impossible to review the law of any country without discover many defect and many superfluity law often continue when they reason have cease law make for the first state of the society continue unabolished when the general form of life be change part of the judicial procedure which be at first only accidental become in time essential and formality be accumulate on each other till the art of litigation require more study than the discovery of right the king of prussium examine the institution of he own country think they such as could only be amend by a general abrogation and the establishment of a new body of law to which he give the name of the code frdrique which be comprise in one volume of no great bulk and must therefore unavoidably contain general position to be accommodate to particular case by the wisdom and integrity of the court to embarrass justice by multiplicity of law or to hazard it by confidence in judge seem to be the opposite rock on which all civil institution have be wreck and between which legislative wisdom have never yet find a open passage of this new system of law contract as it be a full account can not be expect in these memoirs but that curiosity may not be dismiss without some gratification it have be think proper to epitomise the king 's plan for the reformation of he court the difference which arise between member of the same society may be terminate by a voluntary agreement between the party by arbitration or by a judicial process the two first method produce more frequently a temporary suspension of dispute than a final termination court of justice be therefore necessary with a settle method of procedure of which the most simple be to cite the party to hear they plea and dismiss they with immediate decision this however be in many case impracticable and in other be so seldom practice that it be frequent rather to incur loss than to seek for legal reparation by enter a labyrinth of which there be no end this tediousness of suit keep the party in disquiet and perturbation rous and perpetuate animosity exhaust the litigant by expense retard the progress of they fortune and discourage stranger from settle these inconveniency with which the best-regulated polity of europe be embarrassed must be remove not by the total prohibition of suit which be impossible but by contraction of process by open a easy way for the appearance of truth and remove all obstruction by which it be conceal the ordonnance of 1667 by which lewi the fourteenth establish a uniformity of procedure through all he court have be consider as one of the greatest benefit of he reign the king of prussium observe that each of he province have a different method of judicial procedure propose to reduce they all to one form which be try with success in pomeranium a province remarkable for contention he afterwards extend to all he dominion order the judge to inform he of any difficulty which arise from it some settle method be necessary in judicial procedure small and simple cause might be decide upon the oral plea of the two party appear before the judge but many case be so entangled and perplexed as to require all the skill and ability of those who devote they life to the study of the law advocate or man who can understand and explain the question to be discuss be therefore necessary but these man instead of endeavor to promote justice and discover truth have exert they wit in the defense of bad cause by forgery of fact and fallacy of argument to remedy this evil the king have order a inquiry into the qualification of the advocate all those who practice without a regular admission or who can be convict of disingenuous practice be discard and the judge be command to examine which of the cause now depend have be protracted by the crime and ignorance of the advocate and to dismiss those who shall appear culpable when advocate be too numerous to live by honest practice they busy themselves in exciting dispute and disturb the community : the number of these to be employ in each court be therefore fix the reward of the advocate be fix with due regard to the nature of the cause and the labor require but not a penny be receive by they till the suit be end that it may be they interest as well as that of the client to shorten the process no advocate be admit in petty court small town or village where the poverty of the people and for the most part the low value of the matter contest make despatch absolutely necessary in those place the party shall appear in person and the judge make a summary decision there must likewise be allow a subordination of tribunal and a power of appeal no judge be so skilful and attentive as not sometimes to err few be so honest as not sometimes to be partial petty judge would become insupportably tyrannical if they be not restrain by the fear of a superior judicature and they decision would be negligent or arbitrary if they be not in danger of see they examine and cancel the right of appeal must be restrain that cause may not be transfer without end from court to court and a peremptory decision must at last be make when a appeal be make to a higher court the appellant be allow only four week to frame he bill the judge of the lower court be to transmit to the higher all the evidence and information if upon the first view of the cause thus open it shall appear that the appeal be make without just cause the first sentence shall be confirm without citation of the defendant if any new evidence shall appear or any doubt arise both the party shall be hear in the discussion of cause altercation must be allow yet to altercation some limit must be put there be therefore allow a bill a answer a reply and a rejoinder to be deliver in write no cause be allow to be hear in more than three different court to further the first decision every advocate be enjoin under severe penalty not to begin a suit till he have collect all the necessary evidence if the first court have decide in a unsatisfactory manner a appeal may be make to the second and from the second to the third the process in each appeal be limit to six month the third court may indeed pass a erroneous judgment and then the injury be without redress but this objection be without end and therefore without force no method can be find of preserve humanity from error but of contest there must sometime be a end and he who think himself injure for want of a appeal to a fourth court must consider himself as suffer for the publick there be a special advocate appoint for the poor the attorney who have formerly the care of collect evidence and of adjust all the preliminary of a suit be now totally dismiss the whole affair be put into the hand of the advocate and the office of a attorney be annul for ever if any man be hinder by some lawful impediment from attend he suit time will be grant he upon the representation of he case such be the order accord to which civil justice be administer through the extensive dominion of the king of prussium which if it exhibit nothing very subtle or profound afford one proof more that the right be easily discover and that man do not so often want ability to find as willingness to practice it we now return to the war the time at which the queen of hungary be willing to purchase peace by the resignation of silesium though it come at last be not come yet she have all the spirit though not all the power of she ancestor and could not bear the thought of lose any part of she patrimonial dominion to the enemy which the opinion of she weakness raise every where against she in the beginning of the year 1742 the elector of bavarium be invest with the imperial dignity support by the arm of france master of the kingdom of bohemia and confederate with the elector palatine and the elector of saxony who claim moravium and with the king of prussium who be in possession of silesium such be the state of the queen of hungary press on every side and on every side prepare for resistance : she yet refuse all offer of accommodation for every prince set peace at a price which she be not yet so far humble as to pay the king of prussium be among the most zealous and forward in the confederacy against she he promise to secure bohemia to the emperor and moravium to the elector of saxony and finding no enemy in the field able to resist he he return to berlin and leave schwerin he general to prosecute the conquest the prussian in the midst of winter take olmutz the capital of moravium and lay the whole country under contribution the cold then hinder they from action and they only block up the fortress of brinn and spielberg in the spring the king of prussium come again into the field and undertake the siege of brinn but upon the approach of prince charle of lorrain retire from before it and quit moravium leave only a garrison in the capital the condition of the queen of hungary be now change she be a few month before without money without troops encircle with enemy the bavarian have enter austrium vienna be threaten with a siege and the queen leave it to the fate of war and retire into hungary where she be receive with zeal and affection not unmingled however with that neglect which must always be bear by greatness in distress she bear the disrespect of she subject with the same firmness as the outrage of she enemy and at last persuade the english not to despair of she preservation by not despair herself voltaire in he late history have assert that a large sum be raise for she succor by voluntary subscription of the english lady it be the great fail of a strong imagination to catch greedily at wonder he be misinform and be perhaps unwilling to learn by a second inquiry a truth less splendid and amusing a contribution be by news-writer upon they own authority fruitlessly and i think illegally propose it end in nothing the parliament vote a supply and five hundred thousand pound be remit to she it have be always the weakness of the austrian family to spend in the magnificence of empire those revenue which should be keep for its defense the court be splendid but the treasury be empty and at the beginning of every war advantage be gain against they before they army can be assemble and equip the english money be to the austrian as a shower to a field where all the vegetative power be keep unactive by a long continuance of drought the army which have hitherto be hide in mountain and forest start out of they retreat and wherever the queen 's standard be erect nation scarcely know by they name swarm immediately about it a army especially a defensive army multiply itself the contagion of enterprise spread from one heart to another zeal for a native or detestation of a foreign sovereign hope of sudden greatness or riches friendship or emulation between particular man or what be perhaps more general and powerful desire of novelty and impatience of inactivity fill a camp with adventurer add rank to rank and squadron to squadron the queen have still enemy on every part but she now on every part have army ready to oppose they austrium be immediately recover the plain of bohemia be fill with she troops though the fortress be garrison by the french the bavarian be recall to the defense of they own country now waste by the incursion of troops that be call barbarian greedy enough of plunder and daring perhaps beyond the rule of war but otherwise not more cruel than those whom they attack prince lobkowitz with one army observe the motion of broglio the french general in bohemia and prince charle with another put a stop to the advance of the king of prussium it be now the turn of the prussian to retire they abandon olmutz and leave behind they part of they cannon and they magazine and the king finding that broglio could not long oppose prince lobkowitz hasten into bohemia to he assistance and have receive a reinforcement of twenty-three thousand man and take the castle of glatz which be build upon a rock scarcely accessible would have defy all he power have the garrison be furnish with provision he purpose to join he ally and prosecute he conquest prince charle see moravium thus evacuate by the prussian determine to garrison the town which he have just recover and pursue the enemy who by the assistance of the french would have be too powerful for prince lobkowitz success have now give confidence to the austrian and have proportionably abate the spirit of they enemy the saxon who have cooperate with the king of prussium in the conquest of moravium of which they expect the perpetual possession see all hope of sudden acquisition defeat and the province leave again to its former master grow weary of follow a prince whom they consider as no longer act the part of they confederate and when they approach the confines of bohemia take a different road and leave the prussian to they own fortune the king continue he march and charle he pursuit at czaslau the two army come in sight of one another and the austrian resolve on a decisive day on the 6th of may about seven in the morning the austrian begin the attack : they impetuosity be match by the firmness of the prussian the animosity of the two army be much inflamed : the austrian be fight for they country and the prussian be in a place where defeat must inevitably end in death or captivity the fury of the battle continue four hour : the prussian horse be at length broken and the austrian force they way to the camp where the wild troops who have fight with so much vigor and constancy at the sight of plunder forget they obedience nor have any man the least thought but how to load himself with the richest spoil while the right wing of the austrian be thus employ the main body be leave naked : the prussian recover from they confusion and regain the day charle be at last force to retire and carry with he the standard of he enemy the proof of a victory which though so nearly gain he have not be able to keep the victory however be dearly buy the prussian army be much weakened and the cavalry almost totally destroy peace be easily make when it be necessary to both party and the king of prussium have now reason to believe that the austrian be not he only enemy when he find charle advance he send to broglio for assistance and be answer that he must have order from versaille such a desertion of he most powerful ally disconcert he but the battle be unavoidable when the prussian be return to the camp the king hearing that a austrian officer be bring in mortally wound have the condescension to visit he the officer strike with this act of humanity say after a short conversation : i should die sir contentedly after this honor if i might first show my gratitude to you majesty by inform you with what ally you be now unite ally that have no intention but to deceive you the king appear to suspect this intelligence sir say the austrian if you will permit I to send a messenger to vienna i believe the queen will not refuse to transmit a intercept letter now in she hand which will put my report beyond all doubt the messenger be send and the letter transmit which contain the order send to broglio who be first forbid to mix he troops on any occasion with the prussian secondly he be order to act always at a distance from the king thirdly to keep always a body of twenty thousand man to observe the prussian army fourthly to observe very closely the motion of the king for important reason fifthly to hazard nothing but to pretend want of reinforcement or the absence of bellisle the king now with great reason consider himself as disengage from the confederacy be desert by the saxon and betray by the french he therefore accept the mediation of king george and in three week after the battle of czaslaw make peace with the queen of hungary who grant to he the whole province of silesium a country of such extent and opulence that he be say to receive from it one third part of he revenue by one of the article of this treaty it be stipulate that neither should assist the enemy of the other the queen of hungary thus disentangle on one side and set free from the most formidable of she enemy soon persuade the saxon to peace take possession of bavarium drive the emperor after all he imaginary conquest to the shelter of a neutral town where he be treat as a fugitive and besiege the french in prague in the city which they have take from she have thus obtain silesium the king of prussium return to he own capital where he reform he law forbid the torture of criminal conclude a defensive alliance with england and apply himself to the augmentation of he army this treaty of peace with the queen of hungary be one of the first proof give by the king of prussium of the secrecy of he counsel bellisle the french general be with he in the camp as a friend and coadjutor in appearance but in truth a spy and a writer of intelligence man who have great confidence in they own penetration be often by that confidence deceive they imagine that they can pierce through all the involution of intrigue without the diligence necessary to weaker mind and therefore sit idle and secure they believe that none can hope to deceive they and therefore that none will try bellisle with all he reputation of sagacity though he be in the prussian camp give every day fresh assurance of the king 's adherence to he ally while broglio who command the army at a distance discover sufficient reason to suspect he desertion broglio be slight and bellisle believe till on the 11th of June the treaty be sign and the king declare he resolution to keep a neutrality this be one of the great performance of polity which mankind seem agree to celebrate and admire yet to all this nothing be necessary but the determination of a very few man to be silent from this time the queen of hungary proceed with a uninterrupted torrent of success the french drive from station to station and deprive of fortress after fortress be at last enclosed with they two general bellisle and broglio in the wall of prague which they have store with all provision necessary to a town besiege and where they defend themselves three month before any prospect appear of relief the austrian have be engage chiefly in the field and in sudden and tumultuary excursion rather than a regular war have no great degree of skill in attack or defend town they likewise would naturally consider all the mischief do to the city as fall ultimately upon themselves and therefore be willing to gain it by time rather than by force it be apparent that how long soever prague might be defend it must be yield at last and therefore all art be try to obtain a honorable capitulation the messenger from the city be send back sometimes unheard but always with this answer : that no term would be allow but that they should yield themselves prisoner of war the condition of the garrison be in the eye of all europe desperate but the french to whom the praise of spirit and activity can not be deny resolve to make a effort for the honor of they arm mailleboi be at that time encamp with he army in westphalium order be send he to relieve prague the enterprise be consider as romantick mailleboi be a march of forty day distant from bohemia the pass be narrow and the way foul and it be likely that prague would be take before he could reach it the march be however begin : the army be join by that of count saxe consist of fifty thousand man who notwithstanding all the difficulty which two austrian army could put in they way at last enter bohemia the siege of prague though not raise be remit and a communication be now open to it with the country but the austrian by perpetual intervention hinder the garrison from join they friend the officer of mailleboi incite he to a battle because the army be hourly lessen by the want of provision but instead of press on to prague he retire into bavarium and complete the ruin of the emperor 's territory the court of france disappointed and offended confer the chief command upon broglio who escape from the besieger with very little difficulty and keep the austrian employ till bellisle by a sudden sally quit prague and without any great loss join the main army broglio then retire over the rhine into the french dominion waste in he retreat the country which he have undertake to protect and burn town and destroy magazine of corn with such wantonness as give reason to believe that he expect commendation from he court for any mischief do by whatever mean the austrian pursue they advantage recover all they strong place in some of which french garrison have be leave and make themselves master of bavarium by take not only munich the capital but ingolstadt the strongest fortification in the elector 's dominion where they find a great number of cannon and a quantity of ammunition intend in the dream of project greatness for the siege of vienna all the archive of the state the plate and ornament of the electoral palace and what have be consider as most worthy of preservation nothing but the warlike store be take away a oath of allegiance to the queen be require of the bavarian but without any explanation whether temporary or perpetual the emperor live at frankfort in the security that be allow to neutral place but without much respect from the german prince except that upon some objection make by the queen to the validity of he election the king of prussium declare himself determine to support he in the imperial dignity with all he power this may be consider as a token of no great affection to the queen of hungary but it seem not to have raise much alarm the german prince be afraid of new broil to contest the election of a emperor once invest and acknowledge would be to overthrow the whole germanick constitution perhaps no election by plurality of suffrage be ever make among human being to which it might not be object that voice be procure by illicit influence some suspicion however be raise by the king 's declaration which he endeavor to obviate by order he minister to declare at london and at vienna that he be resolve not to violate the treaty of breslaw this declaration be sufficiently ambiguous and could not satisfy those whom it might silence but this be not a time for nice disquisition to distrust the king of prussium might have provoke he and it be most convenient to consider he as a friend till he appear openly as a enemy about the middle of the year 1744 he raise new alarm by collect he troops and put they in motion the earl of hindford about this time demand the troops stipulate for the protection of hanover not perhaps because they be think necessary but that the king 's design might be guess from he answer which be that troops be not grant for the defense of any country till that country be in danger and that he could not believe the elector of hanover to be in much dread of a invasion since he have withdraw the native troops and put they into the pay of england he have undoubtedly now form design which make it necessary that he troops should be keep together and the time soon come when the scene be to be open prince charle of lorrain have chase the french out of bavarium lay for some month encamp on the rhine endeavor to gain a passage into alsace he attempt have long be evade by the skill and vigilance of the french general till at last June 21 1744 he execute he design and lodge he army in the french dominion to the surprise and joy of a great part of europe it be now expect that the territory of france would in they turn feel the misery of war and the nation which so long keep the world in alarm be teach at last the value of peace the king of prussium now see the austrian troops at a great distance from he engage in a foreign country against the most powerful of all they enemy now therefore be the time to discover that he have lately make a treaty at frankfort with the emperor by which he have engage that as the court of vienna and its ally appear backward to reestablish the tranquillity of the empire and more cogent method appear necessary he be animated with a desire of cooperate towards the pacification of germany should make a expedition for the conquest of bohemia and to put it into the possession of the emperor he heir and successor for ever in gratitude for which the emperor should resign to he and he successor a certain number of lordship which be now part of the kingdom of bohemia he imperial majesty likewise guaranty to the king of prussium the perpetual possession of upper silesium and the king guaranty to the emperor the perpetual possession of upper austrium as soon as he shall have occupy it by conquest it be easy to discover that the king begin the war upon other motive than zeal for peace and that whatever respect he be willing to show to the emperor he do not purpose to assist he without reward in prosecution of this treaty he put he troops in motion and accord to he promise while the austrian be invade france he invade bohemia prince have this remain of humanity that they think themselves oblige not to make war without a reason they reason be indeed not always very satisfactory lewi the fourteenth seem to think he own glory a sufficient motive for the invasion of holland the czar attack charle of sweden because he have not be treat with sufficient respect when he make a journey in disguise the king of prussium have a opportunity of attack he neighbor be not long without he reason on July 30th he publish he declaration in which he declare : that he can no longer stand a idle spectator of the trouble in germany but find himself oblige to make use of force to restore the power of the law and the authority of the emperor that the queen of hungary have treat the emperor 's hereditary dominion with inexpressible cruelty that germany have be overrun with foreign troops which have march through neutral country without the customary requisition that the emperor 's troops have be attack under neutral fortress and oblige to abandon the empire of which they master be the head that the imperial dignity have be treat with indecency by the hungarian troops the queen declare the election of the emperor void and the diet of frankfort illegal have not only violate the imperial dignity but injure all the prince who have the right of election that he have no particular quarrel with the queen of hungary and that he desire nothing for himself and only enter as a auxiliary into a war for the liberty of germany that the emperor have offer to quit he pretension to the dominion of austrium on condition that he hereditary country be restore to he that this proposal have be make to the king of england at hanau and reject in such a manner as show that the king of england have no intention to restore peace but rather to make he advantage of the trouble that the mediation of the dutch have be desire but that they decline to interpose know the inflexibility of the english and austrian court that the same term be again offer at vienna and again reject that therefore the queen must impute it to she own council that she enemy find new ally that he be not fight for any interest of he own that he demand nothing for himself but be determine to exert all he power in defense of the emperor in vindication of the right of election and in support of the liberty of germany which the queen of hungary would enslave when this declaration be send to the prussian minister in england it be accompany with a remonstrance to the king in which many of the foregoing position be repeat the emperor 's candor and disinterestedness be magnify the dangerous design of the austrian be display it be imputed to they as the most flagrant violation of the germanick constitution that they have drive the emperor 's troops out of the empire the publick spirit and generosity of he prussian majesty be again heartily declare and it be say that this quarrel have no connexion with english interest the english ought not to interpose austrium and all she ally be put into amazement by this declaration which at once dismount they from the summit of success and oblige they to fight through the war a second time what succor or what promise prussium receive from france be never publickly know but it be not to be doubt that a prince so watchful of opportunity sell assistance when it be so much want at the highest rate nor can it be suppose that he expose himself to so much hazard only for the freedom of germany and a few petty district in bohemia the french who from ravage the empire at discretion and waste whatever they find either among enemy or friend be now drive into they own dominion and in they own dominion be insult and pursue be on a sudden by this new auxiliary restore to they former superiority at least be disburden of they invader and deliver from they terror and all the enemy of the house of bourbon see with indignation and amazement the recovery of that power which they have with so much cost and bloodshed bring low and which they animosity and elation have dispose they to imagine yet lower than it be the queen of hungary still retain she firmness the prussian declaration be not long without a answer which be transmit to the european prince with some observation on the prussian minister 's remonstrance to the court of vienna which he be order by he master to read to the austrian council but not to deliver the same caution be practice before when the prussian after the emperor 's death invade silesium this artifice of political debate may perhaps be number by the admirer of greatness among the refinement of conduct but as it be a method of proceed not very difficult to be contrived or practice as it can be of very rare use to honesty or wisdom and as it have be long know to that class of man whose safety depend upon secrecy though hitherto apply chiefly in petty cheat and slight transaction i do not see that it can much advance the reputation of regal understanding or indeed that it can add more to the safety than it take away from the honor of he that shall adopt it the queen in she answer after charge the king of prussium with breach of the treaty of breslaw and observe how much she enemy will exult to see the peace now the third time break by he declare : that she have no intention to injure the rights of the elector and that she call in question not the event but the manner of the election that she have spare the emperor 's troops with great tenderness and that they be drive out of the empire only because they be in the service of france that she be so far from disturb the peace of the empire that the only commotion now raise in it be the effect of the armament of the king of prussium nothing be more tedious than publick record when they relate to affair which by distance of time or place lose they power to interest the reader every thing grow little as it grow remote and of thing thus diminish it be sufficient to survey the aggregate without a minute examination of the part it be easy to perceive that if the king of prussium 's reason be sufficient ambition or animosity can never want a plea for violence and invasion what he charge upon the queen of hungary the waste of country the expulsion of the bavarian and the employment of foreign troops be the unavoidable consequence of a war inflamed on either side to the utmost violence all these grievance subsist when he make the peace and therefore they could very little justify its breach it be true that every prince of the empire be oblige to support the imperial dignity and assist the emperor when he rights be violate and every subsequent contract must be understand in a sense consistent with former obligation nor have the king power to make a peace on term contrary to that constitution by which he hold a place among the germanick elector but he could have easily discover that not the emperor but the duke of bavarium be the queen 's enemy not the administrator of the imperial power but the claimant of the austrian dominion nor do he allegiance to the emperor suppose the emperor injure oblige he to more than a succor of ten thousand man but ten thousand man could not conquer bohemia and without the conquest of bohemia he could receive no reward for the zeal and fidelity which he so loudly profess the success of this enterprise he have take all possible precaution to secure he be to invade a country guard only by the faith of treaty and therefore leave unarmed and unprovided of all defense he have engage the french to attack prince charle before he should repass the rhine by which the austrian would at least have be hinder from a speedy march into bohemia : they be likewise to yield he such other assistance as he might want rely therefore upon the promise of the french he resolve to attempt the ruin of the house of austrium and in August 1744 break into bohemia at the head of a hundred and four thousand man when he enter the country he publish a proclamation promise that he army should observe the strictest discipline and that those who make no resistance should be suffer to remain in quiet in they habitation he require that all arm in the custody of whomsoever they might be place should be give up and put into the hand of publick officer he still declare himself to act only as a auxiliary to the emperor and with no other design than to establish peace and tranquillity throughout germany he dear country in this proclamation there be one paragraph of which i do not remember any precedent he threaten that if any peasant should be find with arm he shall be hang without further inquiry and that if any lord shall connive at he vassal keep arm in they custody he village shall be reduce to ash it be hard to find upon what pretence the king of prussium could treat the bohemian as criminal for prepare to defend they native country or maintain they allegiance to they lawful sovereign against a invader whether he appear principal or auxiliary whether he profess to intend tranquillity or confusion he progress be such as give great hope to the enemy of austrium : like caesar he conquer as he advance and meet with no opposition till he reach the wall of prague the indignation and resentment of the queen of hungary may be easily conceive the alliance of frankfort be now lay open to all europe and the partition of the austrian dominion be again publickly project they be to be share among the emperor the king of prussium the elector palatine and the landgrave of hesse all the power of europe who have dream of control france be awaken to they former terror all that have be do be now to be do again and every court from the strait of gibraltar to the frozen sea be fill with exultation or terror with scheme of conquest or precaution for defense the king delighted with he progress and expect like other mortal elate with success that he prosperity could not be interrupted continue he march and begin in the latter end of September the siege of prague he have gain several of the outer post when he be inform that the convoy which attend he artillery be attack by a unexpected party of the austrian the king go immediately to they assistance with the third part of he army and find he troops put to flight and the austrian hast away with he cannon : such a loss would have disabled he at once he fall upon the austrian whose number would not enable they to withstand he recover he artillery and have also defeat bathianus raise he battery and there be no artillery to be place against he he destroy a great part of the city he then order four attack to be make at once and reduce the besiege to such extremity that in fourteen day the governor be oblige to yield the place at the attack command by schwerin a grenadier be report to have mount the bastion alone and to have defend himself for some time with he sword till he follower mount after he for this act of bravery the king make he a lieutenant and give he a patent of nobility nothing now remain but that the austrian should lay aside all thought of invade france and apply they whole power to they own defense prince charle at the first news of the prussian invasion prepare to repass the rhine this the french accord to they contract with the king of prussium should have attempt to hinder but they know by experience the austrian would not be beat without resistance and that resistance always incommode a assailant as the king of prussium rejoice in the distance of the austrian whom he consider as entangled in the french territory the french rejoice in the necessity of they return and pleased themselves with the prospect of easy conquest while power whom they consider with equal malevolence should be employ in massacre each other prince charle take the opportunity of bright moonshine to repass the rhine and noaille who have early intelligence of he motion give he very little disturbance but contented himself with attack the rearguard and when they retire to the main body cease he pursuit the king upon the reduction of prague strike a medal which have on one side a plan of the town with this inscription : prague take by the king of prussium September 16 1744 for the third time in three year on the other side be two verse in which he pray that he conquest might produce peace he then march forward with the rapidity which constitute he military character take possession of almost all bohemia and begin to talk of enter austrium and besiege vienna the queen be not yet wholly without resource the elector of saxony whether invite or not be not comprise in the union of frankfort and as every sovereign be grow less as he next neighbor be grow greater he could not heartily wish success to a confederacy which be to aggrandize the other power of germany the prussian give he likewise a particular and immediate provocation to oppose they for when they depart to the conquest of bohemia with all the elation of imaginary success they pass through he dominion with unlicensed and contemptuous disdain of he authority as the approach of prince charle give a new prospect of event he be easily persuade to enter into a alliance with the queen whom he furnish with a very large body of troops the king of prussium have leave a garrison in prague which he command to put the burgher to death if they leave they house in the night go forward to take the other town and fortress expect perhaps that prince charle would be interrupt in he march but the french though they appear to follow he either could not or would not overtake he in a short time by march press on with the utmost eagerness charle reach bohemia leave the bavarian to regain the possession of the waste plain of they country which they enemy who still keep the strong place might again seize at will at the approach of the austrian army the courage of the king of prussium seem to have fail he he retire from post to post and evacuate town after town and fortress after fortress without resistance or appearance of resistance as if he be resign they to the rightful owner it might have be expect that he should have make some effort to rescue prague but after a faint attempt to dispute the passage of the elbe he order he garrison of eleven thousand man to quit the place they leave behind they they magazine and heavy artillery among which be seven piece of remarkable excellence call the seven elector but they take with they they field cannon and a great number of carriage laden with store and plunder which they be force to leave in they way to the saxon and austrian that harass they march they at last enter silesium with the loss of about a third part the king of prussium suffer much in he retreat for besides the military store which he leave every where behind he even to the clothes of he troops there be a want of provision in he army and consequently frequent desertion and many disease and a soldier sick or kill be equally lose to a fly army at last he reenter he own territory and have station he troops in place of security return for a time to berlin where he forbid all to speak either ill or well of the campaign to what end such a prohibition could conduce it be difficult to discover : there be no country in which man can be forbid to know what they know and what be universally know may as well be speak it be true that in popular government seditious discourse may inflame the vulgar but in such government they can not be restrain and in absolute monarchy they be of little effect when the prussian invade bohemia and this whole nation be fire with resentment the king of england give order in he palace that none should mention he nephew with disrespect by this command he maintain the decency necessary between prince without enforce and probably without expect obedience but in he own presence the king of prussium 's edict regard only himself and therefore it be difficult to tell what be he motive unless he intend to spare himself the mortification of absurd and illiberal flattery which to a mind sting with disgrace must have be in the highest degree painful and disgusting moderation in prosperity be a virtue very difficult to all mortal forbearance of revenge when revenge be within reach be scarcely ever to be find among prince now be the time when the queen of hungary might perhaps have make peace on she own term but keenness of resentment and arrogance of success withhold she from the due use of the present opportunity it be say that the king of prussium in he retreat send letter to prince charle which be suppose to contain ample concession but be send back unopened the king of england offer likewise to mediate between they but he proposition be reject at vienna where a resolution be take not only to revenge the interruption of they success on the rhine by the recovery of silesium but to reward the saxon for they seasonable help by give they part of the prussian dominion in the beginning of the year 1745 die the emperor charle of bavarium the treaty of frankfort be consequently at a end and the king of prussium be no longer able to maintain the character of auxiliary to the emperor and have avow no other reason for the war might have honourably withdraw he force and on he own principle have comply with term of peace but no term be offer he the queen pursue he with the utmost ardor of hostility and the french leave he to he own conduct and he own destiny he bohemian conquest be already lose and he be now chase back into silesium where at the beginning of the year the war continue in a equilibration by alternate loss and advantage in April the elector of bavarium see he dominion overrun by the austrian and receive very little succor from the french make a peace with the queen of hungary upon easy condition and the austrian have more troops to employ against prussium but the revolution of war will not suffer human presumption to remain long unchecked the peace with bavarium be scarcely conclude when the battle of fontenoy be lose and all the ally of austrium call upon she to exert she utmost power for the preservation of the low country and a few day after the loss at fontenoy the first battle between the prussian and the combined army of austrian and saxon be fight at niedburg in silesium the particulars of this battle be variously report by the different party and publish in the journal of that time to transcribe they would be tedious and useless because account of battle be not easily understand and because there be no means of determine to which of the relation credit should be give it be sufficient that they all end in claim or allow a complete victory to the king of prussium who gain all the austrian artillery kill four thousand take seven thousand prisoner with the loss accord to the prussian narrative of only sixteen hundred man he now advance again into bohemia where however he make no great progress the queen of hungary though defeat be not subdue she pour in she troops from all part to the reinforcement of prince charle and determine to continue the struggle with all she power the king see that bohemia be a unpleasing and inconvenient theater of war in which he should be ruin by a miscarriage and should get little by a victory saxony be leave defenceless and if it be conquer might be plunder he therefore publish a declaration against the elector of saxony and without wait for reply invade he dominion this invasion produce another battle at standentz which end as the former to the advantage of the prussian the austrian have some advantage in the beginning and they irregular troops who be always daring and be always ravenous break into the prussian camp and carry away the military chest but this be easily repair by the spoil of saxony the queen of hungary be still inflexible and hope that fortune would at last change she recruit once more she army and prepare to invade the territory of brandenburg but the king of prussium 's activity prevent all she design one part of he force seize leipsic and the other once more defeat the saxon the king of poland flee from he dominion prince charle retire into bohemia the king of prussium enter dresden as a conqueror exact very severe contribution from the whole country and the austrian and saxon be at last compel to receive from he such a peace as he would grant he impose no severe condition except the payment of the contribution make no new claim of dominion and with the elector palatine acknowledge the duke of tuscany for emperor the life of prince like the history of nation have they period we shall here suspend we narrative of the king of prussium who be now at the height of human greatness give law to he enemy and court by all the power of europe browne though the writer of the follow essay -lrb- 64 -rrb- seem to have have the fortune common among man of letter of raise little curiosity after he private life and have therefore few memorial preserve of he felicity and misfortune yet because a edition of a posthumous work appear imperfect and neglect without some account of the author it be think necessary to attempt the gratification of that curiosity which naturally inquire by what peculiarity of nature or fortune eminent man have be distinguish how uncommon attainment have be gain and what influence learning have on its possessor or virtue on its teacher sir thoma browne be bear at london in the parish of st michael in cheapside on the 19th of October 1605 -lrb- 65 -rrb- he father be a merchant of a ancient family at upton in cheshire of the name or family of he mother i find no account of he childhood or youth there be little known except that he lose he father very early that he be accord to the common fate of orphan -lrb- 66 -rrb- defraud by one of he guardian and that he be place for he education at the school of winchester he mother have take three thousand pound -lrb- 67 -rrb- as the third part of she husband 's property leave she son by consequence six thousand a large fortune for a man destine to learn at that time when commerce have not yet fill the nation with nominal riches but it happen to he as to many other to be make poorer by opulence for he mother soon married sir thoma dutton probably by the inducement of she fortune and he be leave to the rapacity of he guardian deprive now of both he parent and therefore helpless and unprotected he be remove in the beginning of the year 1623 from winchester to oxford -lrb- 68 -rrb- and enter a gentleman-commoner of broadgate hall which be soon afterwards endowed and take the name of pembroke college from the earl of pembroke then chancellor of the university he be admit to the degree of bachelor of art January 31 1626-7 be as wood remark the first man of eminence graduate from the new college to which the zeal or gratitude of those that love it most can wish little better than that it may long proceed as it begin have afterwards take he degree of master of art he turn he study to physick -lrb- 69 -rrb- and practice it for some time in oxfordshire but soon afterwards either induce by curiosity or invite by promise he quit he settlement and accompany he father-in-law -lrb- 70 -rrb- who have some employment in ireland in a visitation of the fort and castle which the state of ireland then make necessary he that have once prevail on himself to break he connexion of acquaintance and begin a wander life very easily continue it ireland have at that time very little to offer to the observation of a man of letter he therefore pass into france and italy -lrb- 71 -rrb- make some stay at montpellier and padua which be then the celebrated school of physick and return home through holland procure himself to be create doctor of physick at leyden when he begin he travels or when be conclude they there be no certain account nor do there remain any observation make by he in he passage through those country which he visit to consider therefore what pleasure or instruction might have be receive from the remark of a man so curious and diligent would be voluntarily to indulge a painful reflection and load the imagination with a wish which while it be form be know to be vain it be however to be lament that those who be most capable of improve mankind very frequently neglect to communicate they knowledge either because it be more please to gather idea than to impart they or because to mind naturally great few thing appear of so much importance as to deserve the notice of the publick about the year 1634 -lrb- 72 -rrb- he be suppose to have return to london and the next year to have write he celebrated treatise call religio medicus the religion of a physician -lrb- 73 -rrb- which he declare himself never to have intend for the press have compose it only for he own exercise and entertainment it indeed contain many passage which relate merely to he own person can be of no great importance to the publick but when it be write it happen to he as to other he be too much pleased with he performance not to think that it might please other as much he therefore communicate it to he friend and receive i suppose that exuberant applause with which every man repay the grant of peruse a manuscript he be not very diligent to obstruct he own praise by recall he papers but suffer they to wander from hand to hand till at last without he own consent they be in 1642 give to a printer this have perhaps sometimes befall other and this i be willing to believe do really happen to dr browne : but there be surely some reason to doubt the truth of the complaint so frequently make of surreptitious edition a song or a epigram may be easily print without the author 's knowledge because it may be learn when it be repeat or may be write out with very little trouble but a long treatise however elegant be not often copy by mere zeal or curiosity but may be wear out in pass from hand to hand before it be multiply by a transcript it be easy to convey a imperfect book by a distant hand to the press and plead the circulation of a false copy as a excuse for publish the true or to correct what be find faulty or offensive and charge the error on the transcriber 's depravation this be a stratagem by which a author panting for fame and yet afraid of seem to challenge it may at once gratify he vanity and preserve the appearance of modesty may enter the list and secure a retreat and this candor might suffer to pass undetected as a innocent fraud but that indeed no fraud be innocent for the confidence which make the happiness of society be in some degree diminish by every man whose practice be at variance with he word the religio medicus be no sooner publish than it excite the attention of the publick by the novelty of paradox the dignity of sentiment the quick succession of image the multitude of abstruse allusion the subtilty of disquisition and the strength of language what be much read will be much criticise the earl of dorset recommend this book to the perusal of sir kenelm digby who return he judgment upon it not in a letter but a book in which though mingle with some position fabulous and uncertain there be acute remark just censure and profound speculation yet its principal claim to admiration be that it be write in twenty-four hour -lrb- 74 -rrb- of which part be spend in procure browne 's book and part in read it of these animadversion when they be yet not all print either officiousness or malice informed dr browne who write to sir kenelm with much softness and ceremony declare the unworthiness of he work to engage such notice the intended privacy of the composition and the corruption of the impression and receive a answer equally genteel and respectful contain high commendation of the piece pompous profession of reverence meek acknowledgment of inability and anxious apology for the hastiness of he remark the reciprocal civility of author be one of the most risible scene in the farce of life who would not have think that these two luminary of they age have cease to endeavor to grow bright by the obscuration of each other yet the animadversion thus weak thus precipitate upon a book thus injure in the transcription quickly pass the press and religio medicus be more accurately publish with a admonition prefix to those who have or shall peruse the observation upon a former corrupt copy in which there be a severe censure not upon digby who be to be use with ceremony but upon the observator who have usurp he name nor be this invective write by dr browne who be suppose to be satisfy with he opponent 's apology but by some officious friend zealous for he honor without he consent browne have indeed in he own preface endeavor to secure himself from rigorous examination by allege that many thing be deliver rhetorically many expression merely tropical and therefore many thing to be take in a soft and flexible sense and not to be call unto the rigid test of reason the first glance upon he book will indeed discover example of this liberty of thought and expression : i could be content say he to be nothing almost to eternity if i might enjoy my savior at the last he have little acquaintance with the acuteness of browne who suspect he of a serious opinion that any thing can be almost eternal or that any time begin and end be not infinitely less than infinite duration in this book he speak much and in the opinion of digby too much of himself but with such generality and conciseness as afford very little light to he biographer : he declare that besides the dialect of different province he understand six language that he be no stranger to astronomy and that he have see several country but what most awaken curiosity be he solemn assertion that he life have be a miracle of thirty year which to relate be not history but a piece of poetry and would sound like a fable there be undoubtedly a sense in which all life be miraculous as it be a union of power of which we can image no connexion a succession of motion of which the first cause must be supernatural but life thus explain whatever it may have of miracle will have nothing of fable and therefore the author undoubtedly have regard to something by which he imagine himself distinguish from the rest of mankind of these wonder however the view that can be now take of he life offer no appearance the course of he education be like that of other such as put he little in the way of extraordinary casualty a scholastick and academical life be very uniform and have indeed more safety than pleasure a traveller have greater opportunity of adventure but browne traverse no unknown sea or arabian desert and surely a man may visit france and italy reside at montpellier and padua and at last take he degree at leyden without any thing miraculous what it be that would if it be related sound so poetical and fabulous we be leave to guess i believe without hope of guess rightly the wonder probably be transact in he own mind self-love cooperate with a imagination vigorous and fertile as that of browne will find or make object of astonishment in every man 's life and perhaps there be no human be however bid in the crowd from the observation of he fellow-mortal who if he have leisure and disposition to recollect he own thought and action will not conclude he life in some sort a miracle and imagine himself distinguish from all the rest of he species by many discrimination of nature or of fortune the success of this performance be such as might naturally encourage the author to new undertaking a gentleman of cambridge -lrb- 75 -rrb- whose name be merryweather turn it not inelegantly into latin and from he version it be again translate into italian german dutch and french and at strasburg the latin translation be publish with large note by levinus nicolaus moltkenius of the english annotation which in all the edition from 1644 accompany the book the author be unknown of merryweather to whose zeal browne be so much indebted for the sudden extension of he renown i know nothing but that he publish a small treatise for the instruction of young-person in the attainment of a latin style he print he translation in holland with some difficulty -lrb- 76 -rrb- the first printer to whom he offer it carry it to salmasius who lay it by say he in state for three month and then discourage its publication : it be afterwards reject by two other printer and at last be receive by hackius the peculiarity of this book raise the author as be usual many admirer and many enemy but we know not of more than one profess answer write under the title of medicus medicatus -lrb- 77 -rrb- by alexander ross which be universally neglect by the world at the time when this book be publish dr browne reside at norwich where he have settle in 1636 by the persuasion of dr lushington -lrb- 78 -rrb- he tutor who be then rector of barnham westgate in the neighborhood it be record by wood that he practice be very extensive and that many patient resort to he in 1637 he be incorporate doctor of physick in oxfordf -lrb- 79 -rrb- he marry in 1641 mr mileham -lrb- 80 -rrb- of a good family in norfolk a lady say whitefoot of such symmetrical proportion to she worthy husband both in the grace of she body and mind that they seem to come together by a kind of natural magnetism this marriage could not but draw the raillery of contemporary wit -lrb- 81 -rrb- upon a man who have just be wish in he new book that we might procreate like tree without conjunction and have lately declare -lrb- 82 -rrb- that the whole world be make for man but only the twelfth part of man for woman and that man be the whole world but woman only the rib or crooked part of man whether the lady have be yet inform of these contemptuous position or whether she be please with the conquest of so formidable a rebel and consider it as a double triumph to attract so much merit and overcome so powerful prejudice or whether like most other she marry upon mingled motive between convenience and inclination she have however no reason to repent for she live happily with he one-and-forty year and bear he ten child of whom one son and three daughter outlive they parent : she survive he two year and pass she widowhood in plenty if not in opulence browne have now enter the world as a author and experience the delight of praise and molestation of censure probably find he dread of the publick eye diminish and therefore be not long before he trust he name to the critick a second time for in 1646 -lrb- 83 -rrb- he print inquiry into vulgar and common error a work which as it arise not from fancy and invention but from observation and book and contain not a single discourse of one continue tenor of which the latter part arise from the former but a enumeration of many unconnected particulars must have be the collection of year and the effect of a design early form and long pursue to which he remark have be continually refer and which arise gradually to its present bulk by the daily aggregation of new particle of knowledge it be indeed to be wish that he have longer delay the publication and add what the remain part of he life might have furnish : the thirty-six year which he spend afterwards in study and experience would doubtless have make large addition to a inquiry into vulgar error he publish in 1673 the sixth edition with some improvement but i think rather with explication of what he have already write than any new head of disquisition but with the work such as the author whether hinder from continue it by eagerness of praise or weariness of labor think fit to give we must be content and remember that in all sublunary thing there be something to be wish which we must wish in vain this book like he former be receive with great applause be answer by alexander ross and translate into dutch and german and not many year ago into french it might now be proper have not the favor with which it be at first receive fill the kingdom with copy to reprint it with note partly supplemental and partly emendatory to subjoin those discovery which the industry of the last age have make and correct those mistake which the author have commit not by idleness or negligence but for want of boyle 's and newton 's philosophy he appear indeed to have be willing to pay labor for truth have hear a fly rumor of sympathetick needle by which suspend over a circular alphabet distant friend or lover might correspond he procure two such alphabet to be make touch he needle with the same magnet and place they upon proper spindle : the result be that when he move one of he needle the other instead of take by sympathy the same direction stand like the pillar of hercule that it continue motionless will be easily believe and most man would have be content to believe it without the labor of so hopeless a experiment browne might himself have obtain the same conviction by a method less operose if he have thrust he needle through cork and set they afloat in two basin of water notwithstanding he zeal to detect old error he seem not very easy to admit new position for he never mention the motion of the earth but with contempt and ridicule though the opinion which admit it be then grow popular and be surely plausible even before it be confirm by later observation the reputation of browne encourage some low writer to publish under he name a book call -lrb- 84 -rrb- nature 's cabinet unlock -- translate accord to wood from the physick of magirus of which browne take care to clear himself by modestly advertise that if any man have be benefit by it he be not so ambitious as to challenge the honor thereof as have no hand in that work -lrb- 85 -rrb- in 1658 the discovery of some ancient urn in norfolk give he occasion to write hydriotaphium urn-burial or a discourse of sepulchral urn in which he treat with he usual learning on the funeral rite of the ancient nation exhibit they various treatment of the dead and examine the substance find in he norfolcian urn there be perhaps none of he work which better exemplify he reading or memory it be scarcely to be imagine how many particulars he have amass together in a treatise which seem to have be occasionally write and for which therefore no material could have be previously collect it be indeed like other treatise of antiquity rather for curiosity than use for it be of small importance to know which nation bury they dead in the ground which throw they into the sea or which give they to bird and beast when the practice of cremation begin or when it be disused whether the bone of different person be mingle in the same urn what oblation be throw into the pyre or how the ash of the body be distinguish from those of other substance of the uselessness of these inquiry browne seem not to have be ignorant and therefore conclude they with a observation which can never be too frequently recollect : all or most apprehension rest in opinion of some future be which ignorantly or coldly believe begat those perverted conception ceremony saying which christian pity or laugh at happy be they which live not in that disadvantage of time when man could say little for futurity but from reason whereby the noblest mind fall often upon doubtful death and melancholy dissolution : with these hope socrate warm he doubtful spirit against the cold potion and cato before he durst give the fatal stroke spend part of the night in read the immortality of plato thereby confirm he waver hand unto the animosity of that attempt it be the heaviest stone that melancholy can throw at a man to tell he he be at the end of he nature or that there be no further state to come unto which this seem progressional and otherwise make in vain : without this accomplishment the natural expectation and desire of such a state be but a fallacy in nature : unsatisfied considerator would quarrel at the justness of the constitution and rest content that adam have fall lower whereby by know no other original and deeper ignorance of themselves they might have enjoy the happiness of inferior creature who in tranquillity possess they constitution as have not the apprehension to deplore they own nature and be frame below the circumference of these hope of cognition of better thing the wisdom of god have necessitate they contentment but the superior ingredient and obscure part of ourselves whereto all present felicity afford no rest contentment will be able at last to tell we we be more than we present self and evacuate such hope in the fruition of they own accomplishment to he treatise on urn-burial be add the garden of cyrus or the quincunxial lozenge or network plantation of the ancient artificially naturally mystically consider this discourse he begin with the sacred garden in which the first man be place and deduce the practice of horticulture from the earliest account of antiquity to the time of the persian cyrus the first man whom we actually know to have plant a quincunx which however we author be incline to believe of longer date and not only discover it in the description of the hang garden of babylon but seem willing to believe and to persuade he reader that it be practice by the feeder on vegetable before the flood some of the most please performance have be produce by learn and genius exercise upon subject of little importance it seem to have be in all age the pride of wit to show how it could exalt the low and amplify the little to speak not inadequately of thing really and naturally great be a task not only diflicult but disagreeable because the writer be degrade in he own eye by stand in comparison with he subject to which he can hope to add nothing from he imagination : but it be a perpetual triumph of fancy to expand a scanty theme to raise glitter idea from obscure property and to produce to the world a object of wonder to which nature have contribute little to this ambition perhaps we owe the frog of homer the gnat and the bee of virgil the butterfly of spenser the shadow of wowerus and the quincunx of browne in the prosecution of this sport of fancy he consider every production of art and nature in which he could find any decussation or approach to the form of a quincunx and as a man once resolve upon ideal discovery seldom search long in vain he find he favorite figure in almost every thing whether natural or invent ancient or modern rude or artificial sacred or civil so that a reader not watchful against the power of he infusion would imagine that decussation be the great business of the world and that nature and art have no other purpose than to exemplify and imitate a quincunx to show the excellence of this figure he enumerate all its property and find it in almost every thing of use or pleasure : and to show how readily he supply what he can not find one instance may be sufficient : though therein say he we meet not with right angle yet every rhombus contain four angle equal unto two right it virtually contain two right in every one the fanciful sport of great mind be never without some advantage to knowledge browne have intersperse many curious observation on the form of plant and the law of vegetation and appear to have be a very accurate observer of the mode of germination and to have watch with great nicety the evolution of the part of plant from they seminal principle he be then naturally lead to treat of the number five and find that by this number many thing be circumscribe that there be five kind of vegetable production five section of a cone five order of architecture and five act of a play and observe that five be the ancient conjugal or wedding number he proceed to a speculation which i shall give in he own word : the ancient numerist make out the conjugal number by two and three the first parity and imparity the active and passive digit the material and formal principle in generative society these be all the tract which he publish but many papers be find in he closet : some of they say whitefoot design for the press be often transcribe and correct by he own hand after the fashion of great and curious writer of these two collection have be publish one by dr tenison the other in 1722 by a nameless editor whether the one or the other select those piece which the author would have prefer can not be know but they have both the merit of give to mankind what be too valuable to be suppress and what might without they interposition have perhaps perish among other innumerable labor of learn man or have be burn in a scarcity of fuel like the papers of pierescius the first of these posthumous treatise contain observation upon several plant mention in scripture : these remark though they do not immediately either rectify the faith or refine the moral of the reader yet be by no means to be censure as superfluous nicety or useless speculation for they often show some propriety of description or elegance of allusion utterly undiscoverable to reader not skilled in oriental botany and be often of more important use as they remove some difficulty from narrative or some obscurity from precept the next be of garland or coronary and garland plant a subject merely of learn curiosity without any other end than the pleasure of reflect on ancient custom or on the industry with which studious man have endeavor to recover they the next be a letter on the fish eat by we savior with he disciple after he resurrection from the dead : which contain no determinate resolution of the question what they be for indeed it can not be determine all the information that diligence or learning could supply consist in a enumeration of the fish produce in the water of judea then follow answer to certain query about fish bird insect and a letter of hawk and falconry ancient and modern in the first of which he give the proper interpretation of some ancient name of animal commonly mistaken and in the other have some curious observation on the art of hawk which he consider as a practice unknown to the ancient i believe all we sport of the field be of gothick original the ancient neither hunt by the scent nor seem much to have practice horsemanship as a exercise and though in they work there be mention of _ aucupium _ and _ piscatio _ they seem no more to have be consider as diversion than agriculture or any other manual labor in two more letter he speak of the cymbal of the hebrew but without any satisfactory determination and of _ rhopalick _ or gradual verse that be of verse begin with a word of one syllable and proceeding by word of which each have a syllable more than the former as o deus aeterne stationis conciliator ausonius and after this manner pursue the hint he mention many other restrained method of versify to which industrious ignorance have sometimes voluntarily subject itself he next attempt be on language and particularly the saxon tongue he discourse with great learning and generally with great justness of the derivation and change of language but like other man of multifarious learning he receive some notion without examination thus he observe accord to the popular opinion that the spaniard have retain so much latin as to be able to compose sentence that shall be at once grammatically latin and castilian : this will appear very unlikely to a man that consider the spanish termination and howell who be eminently skilful in the three provincial language declare that after many essay he never could effect it -lrb- 86 -rrb- the principal design of this letter be to show the affinity between the modern english and the ancient saxon and he observe very rightly that though we have borrow many substantive adjective and some verb from the french yet the great body of numeral auxiliary verb article pronoun adverb conjunction and preposition which be the distinguishing and lasting part of a language remain with we from the saxon to prove this position more evidently he have draw up a short discourse of six paragraph in saxon and english of which every word be the same in both language except the termination and orthography the word be indeed saxon but the phraseology be english and i think would not have be understand by bede or elfric notwithstanding the confidence of we author he have however sufficiently prove he position that the english resemble its paternal language more than any modern european dialect there remain five tract of this collection yet unmentioned one of artificial hill mount or barrow in england in reply to a interrogatory letter of e d whom the writer of the biographium britannica suppose to be if rightly print w d or sir william dugdale one of browne 's correspondent these be declare by browne in concurrence i think with all other antiquary to be for the most part funeral monument he prove that both the dane and saxon bury they man of eminence under pile of earth which admit say he neither ornament epitaph nor inscription may if earthquake spare they outlast other monument : obelisk have they term and pyramid will tumble but these mountainous monument may stand and be like to have the same period with the earth in the next he answer two geographical question one concern troa mention in the act and epistle of st paul which he determine to be the city build near the ancient ilium and the other concern the dead sea of which he give the same account with other writer another letter treat of the answer of the oracle of apollo at delpho to croesus king of lydium in this tract nothing deserve notice more than that browne consider the oracle as evidently and indubitably supernatural and found all he disquisition upon that postulate he wonder why the physiologist of old have such means of instruction do not inquire into the secret of nature : but judiciously conclude that such question would probably have be vain for in matter cognoscible and form for we disquisition we industry must be we oracle and reason we apollo the piece that remain be a prophecy concern the future state of several nation in which browne plainly discover he expectation to be the same with that entertain lately with more confidence by dr berkeley that america will be the seat of the fifth empire and museum clausum sive bibliotheca abscondita : in which the author amuse himself with imagine the existence of book and curiosity either never in be or irrecoverably lose these piece i have recount as they be range in tenison 's collection because the editor have give no account of the time at which any of they be write some of they be of little value more than as they gratify the mind with the picture of a great scholar turn he learning into amusement or show upon how great a variety of inquiry the same mind have be successfully employ the other collection of he posthumous piece publish in octavo london 1722 contain repertorium or some account of the tomb and monument in the cathedral of norwich where as tenison observe there be not matter proportionate to the skill of the antiquary the other piece be answer to sir william dugdale 's inquiry about the fen a letter concern ireland another relate to urn newly discover some short stricture on different subject and a letter to a friend on the death of he intimate friend publish singly by the author 's son in 1690 there be insert in the biographium britannica a letter contain instruction for the study of physick : which with the essay here offer to the publick complete the work of dr browne to the life of this learn man there remain little to be add but that in 1665 he be choose honorary fellow of the college of physician as a man virtute et literis ornatissimus eminently embellish with literature and virtue and in 1671 receive at norwich the honor of knighthood from charle the second a prince who with many frailty and vice have yet skill to discover excellence and virtue to reward it with such honorary distinction at least as cost he nothing yet confer by a king so judicious and so much beloved have the power of give merit new lustre and greater popularity thus he live in high reputation till in he seventy-sixth year he be seize with a colick which after have tortured he about a week put a end to he life at norwich on he birthday October 19 1682 -lrb- 87 -rrb- some of he last word be expression of submission to the will of god and fearlessness of death he lie bury in the church of st peter mancroft in norwich with this inscription on a mural monument place on the south pillar of the altar : m s hic situs est thoma browne md et mile anno 1605 londinus natus generosa familium apud upton in agro

of he age in memory of whom dame dorothy browne who have be he affectionate wife 47 year cause this monument to be erect besides this lady who die in 1685 he leave a son and three daughter of the daughter nothing very remarkable be know but he son edward browne require a particular mention he be bear about the year 1642 and after have pass through the class of the school at norwich become bachelor of physick at cambridge and afterwards remove to merton college in oxford be admit there to the same degree and afterwards make a doctor in 1668 he visit part of germany and in the year follow make a wider excursion into austrium hungary and thessaly where the turkish sultan then keep he court at larissa he afterwards pass through italy he skill in natural history make he particularly attentive to mine and metallurgy upon he return he publish a account of the country through which he have pass which i have hear commend by a learn traveller who have visit many place after he as write with scrupulous and exact veracity such as be scarcely to be find in any other book of the same kind but whatever it may contribute to the instruction of a naturalist i can not recommend it as likely to give much pleasure to common reader for whether it be that the world be very uniform and therefore he who be resolve to adhere to truth will have few novelty to relate or that dr browne be by the train of he study lead to inquire most after those thing by which the greatest part of mankind be little affect a great part of he book seem to contain very unimportant account of he passage from one place where he see little to another where he see no more upon he return he practice physick in london be make physician first to charle the second and afterwards in 1682 to st bartholomew 's hospital about the same time he join he name to those of many other eminent man in a translation of plutarch 's life he be first censor then elect and treasurer of the college of physician of which in 1705 he be choose president and hold he office till in 1708 he die in a degree of estimation suitable to a man so variously accomplish that king charle have honor he with this panegyrick that he be as learn as any of the college and as well breed as any of the court of every great and eminent character part break forth into publick view and part lie hide in domestick privacy those quality which have be exert in any known and lasting performance may at any distance of time be trace and estimate but silent excellency be soon forget and those minute peculiarity which discriminate every man from all other if they be not record by those whom personal knowledge enable to observe they be irrecoverably lose this mutilation of character must have happen among many other to sir thoma browne have it not be delineate by he friend mr whitefoot who esteem it a especial favor of providence to have have a particular acquaintance with he for two-third of he life part of he observation i shall therefore copy for a character of he person he complexion and hair be answerable to he name he stature be moderate and a habit of body neither fat nor lean but -lrb- greek : eusarko -rrb- in he habit of clothing he have a aversion to all finery and affect plainness both in the fashion and ornament he ever wear a cloak or boot when few other do he keep himself always very warm and think it most safe so to do though he never load himself with such a multitude of garment as suetonius report of augustus enough to clothe a good family the horizon of he understanding be much larger than the hemisphere of the world : all that be visible in the heaven he comprehend so well that few that be under they know so much : he could tell the number of the visible star in he horizon and call they all by they name that have any and of the earth he have such a minute and exact geographical knowledge as if he have be by divine providence ordain surveyor-general of the whole terrestrial orb and its product mineral plant and animal he be so curious a botanist that besides the specifical distinction he make nice and elaborate observation equally useful as entertaining he memory though not so eminent as that of seneca or scaliger be capacious and tenacious insomuch as he remember all that be remarkable in any book that he have read and not only know all person 's again that he have ever see at any distance of time but remember the circumstance of they body and they particular discourse and speech in the latin poet he remember every thing that be acute and pungent he have read most of the historian ancient and modern wherein he observation be singular not take notice of by common reader he be excellent company when he be at leisure and express more light than heat in the temper of he brain he have no despotical power over he affection and passion -lrb- that be a privilege of original perfection forfeit by the neglect of the use of it -rrb- but as large a political power over they as any stoick or man of he time whereof he give so great experiment that he have very rarely be know to have be overcome with any of they the strongest that be find in he both of the irascible and concupiscible be under the control of he reason of admiration which be one of they be the only product either of ignorance or uncommon knowledge he have more and less than other man upon the same account of he know more than other so that though he meet with many rarity he admire they not so much as other do he be never see to be transport with mirth or deject with sadness always cheerful but rarely merry at any sensible rate seldom hear to break a jest and when he do he would be apt to blush at the levity of it : he gravity be natural without affectation he modesty be visible in a natural habitual blush which be increase upon the least occasion and oft discover without any observable cause they that know no more of he than by the briskness of he writings find themselves deceive in they expectation when they come in he company note the gravity and sobriety of he aspect and conversation so free from loquacity or much talkativeness that he be sometimes difficult to be engage in any discourse though when he be so it be always singular and never trite or vulgar parsimonious in nothing but he time whereof he make as much improvement with as little loss as any man in it : when he have any to spare from he drudging practice he be scarce patient of any diversion from he study so impatient of sloth and idleness that he would say he could not do nothing sir thoma understand most of the european language viz all that be in hutter 's bible which he make use of the latin and greek he understand critically the oriental language which never be vernacular in this part of the world he think the use of they would not answer the time and pain of learn they yet have so great a veneration for the matrix of they viz the hebrew consecrate to the oracle of god that he be not content to be totally ignorant of it though very little of he science be to be find in any book of that primitive language and though much be say to be write in the derivative idiom of that tongue especially the arabick yet he be satisfy with the translation wherein he find nothing admirable in he religion he continue in the same mind which he have declare in he first book write when he be but thirty year old he religio medicus wherein he fully assent to that of the church of england prefer it before any in the world as do the learn grotius he attend the publick service very constantly when he be not withhold by he practice never miss the sacrament in he parish if he be in town read the best english sermon he could hear of with liberal applause and delighted not in controversy in he last sickness wherein he continue about a week 's time endure great pain of the colick besides a continual fever with as much patience as have be see in any man without any pretence of stoical apathy animosity or vanity of not be concerned thereat or suffer no impeachment of happiness : ` nihil agi dolor ' he patience be found upon the christian philosophy and a sound faith of god 's providence and a meek and holy submission thereunto which he express in few word i visit he near he end when he have not strength to hear or speak much the last word which i hear from he be besides some expression of dearness that he do freely submit to the will of god be without fear he have often triumph over the king of terror in other and give many repuls in the defense of patient but when he own turn come he submit with a meek rational and religious courage he might have make good the old saying of ` dat galenus ope ' have he live in a place that could have afford it but he indulgence and liberality to he child especially in they travels two of he son in diver country and two of he daughter in france spend he more than a little he be liberal in he house entertainment and in he charity : he leave a comfortable but no great estate both to he lady and child gain by he own industry such be he sagacity and knowledge of all history ancient and modern and he observation thereupon so singular that it have be say by they that know he best that if he profession and place of abode would have suit he ability he would have make a extraordinary man for the privy council not much inferior to the famous padre paulo the late oracle of the venetian state though he be no prophet nor son of a prophet yet in that faculty which come nearest it he excel ie the stochastick wherein he be seldom mistake as to future event as well publick as private but not apt to discover any presage or superstition it be observable that he who in he earlier year have read all the book against religion be in the latter part of he life averse from controversy to play with important truth to disturb the repose of established tenet to subtilize objection and elude proof be too often the sport of youthful vanity of which maturer experience commonly repent there be a time when every man be weary of raise difficulty only to task himself with the solution and desire to enjoy truth without the labor or hazard of contest there be perhaps no better method of encounter these troublesome irruption of skepticism with which inquisitive mind be frequently harass than that which browne declare himself to have take : if there arise any doubt in my way i do forget they or at least defer they till my better settled judgment and more manly reason be able to resolve they : for i perceive every man 's reason be he best oedipus and will upon a reasonable truce find a way to loose those bond wherewith the subtilty of error have enchain we more flexible and tender judgment the foregoing character may be confirm and enlarged by many passage in the religio medicus in which it appear from whitefoot 's testimony that the author though no very spare panegyrist of himself have not exceed the truth with respect to he attainment or visible quality there be indeed some interior and secret virtue which a man may sometimes have without the knowledge of other and may sometimes assume to himself without sufficient reason for he opinion it be charge upon browne by dr watt as a instance of arrogant temerity that after a long detail of he attainment he declare himself to have escape the first and father-sin of pride a perusal of the religio medicus will not much contribute to produce a belief of the author 's exemption from this father-sin pride be a vice which pride itself incline every man to find in other and to overlook in himself as easily may we be mistake in estimate we own courage as we own humility and therefore when browne show himself persuade that he could lose a arm without a tear or with a few groan be quarter to piece i be not sure that he feel in himself any uncommon power of endurance or indeed any thing more than a sudden effervescence of imagination which uncertain and involuntary as it be he mistake for settle resolution that there be not many extant that in a noble way fear the face of death less than himself he might likewise believe at a very easy expense while death be yet at a distance but the time will come to every human be when it must be know how well he can bear to die and it have appear that we author 's fortitude do not desert he in the great hour of trial it be observe by some of the remarker on the religio medicus that the author be yet alive and might grow worse as well as better : it be therefore happy that this suspicion can be obviate by a testimony give to the continuance of he virtue at a time when death have set he free from danger of change and he panegyrist from temptation to flattery but it be not on the praise of other but on he own writings that he be to depend for the esteem of posterity of which he will not easily be deprive while learn shall have any reverence among man for there be no science in which he do not discover some skill and scarce any kind of knowledge profane or sacred abstruse or elegant which he do not appear to have cultivate with success he exuberance of knowledge and plenitude of idea sometimes obstruct the tendency of he reasoning and the clearness of he decision : on whatever subject he employ he mind there start up immediately so many image before he that he lose one by grasp another he memory supply he with so many illustration parallel or dependent notion that he be always start into collateral consideration but the spirit and vigor of he pursuit always give delight and the reader follow he without reluctance through he maze in themselves flowery and pleasing and end at the point originally in view to have great excellency and great fault ` magnae virtutes nee minora vitium ' be the poesy say we author of the best nature this poesy may be properly apply to the style of browne it be vigorous but rugged it be learn but pedantick it be deep but obscure it strike but do not please it command but do not allure he trope be harsh and he combination uncouth he fall into a age in which we language begin to lose the stability which it have obtain in the time of elizabeth and be consider by every writer as a subject on which he might try he plastick skill by mould it accord to he own fancy milton in consequence of this encroach license begin to introduce the latin idiom : and browne though he give less disturbance to we structure in phraseology yet pour in a multitude of exotick word many indeed useful and significant which if reject must be supply by circumlocution such as _ commensality _ for the state of many living at the same table but many superfluous as a _ paralogical _ for a unreasonable doubt and some so obscure that they conceal he meaning rather than explain it as _ arthritical analogy _ for part that serve some animal in the place of joint he style be indeed a tissue of many language a mixture of heterogeneous word bring together from distant region with term originally appropriate to one art and draw by violence into the service of another he must however be confess to have augment we philosophical diction and in defense of he uncommon word and expression we must consider that he have uncommon sentiment and be not content to express in many word that idea for which any language could supply a single term but he innovation be sometimes please and he temerity happy : he have many verba ardentium forcible expression which he would never have find but by venture to the utmost verge of propriety and flight which would never have be reach but by one who have very little fear of the shame of fall there remain yet a objection against the writings of browne more formidable than the animadversion of criticism there be passage from which some have take occasion to rank he among deist and other among atheist it would be difficult to guess how any such conclusion should be form have not experience show that there be two sort of man willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidel it have be long observe that a atheist have no just reason for endeavor conversion and yet none harass those mind which they can influence with more importunity of solicitation to adopt they opinion in proportion as they doubt the truth of they own doctrine they be desirous to gain the attestation of another understanding : and industriously labor to win a proselyte and eagerly catch at the slightest pretence to dignify they sect with a celebrated name -lrb- 88 -rrb- the other become friend to infidelity only by unskilful hostility man of rigid orthodoxy cautious conversation and religious asperity among these it be too frequently the practice to make in they heat concession to atheism or deism which they most confident advocate have never dare to claim or to hope a sally of levity a idle paradox a indecent jest a unreasonable objection be sufficient in the opinion of these man to efface a name from the list of christianity to exclude a soul from everlasting life such man be so watchful to censure that they have seldom much care to look for favourable interpretation of ambiguity to set the general tenor of life against single failure or to know how soon any slip of inadvertency have be expiate by sorrow and retraction but let fly they fulmination without mercy or prudence against slight offence or casual temerity against crime never commit or immediately repent the infidel know well what he be do he be endeavor to supply by authority the deficiency of he argument and to make he cause less invidious by show number on he side he will therefore not change he conduct till he reform he principle but the zealot should recollect that he be labor by this frequency of excommunication against he own cause and voluntarily add strength to the enemy of truth it must always be the condition of a great part of mankind to reject and embrace tenet upon the authority of those whom they think wiser than themselves and therefore the addition of every name to infidelity in some degree invalidate that argument upon which the religion of multitude be necessarily found man may differ from each other in many religious opinion and yet all may retain the essential of christianity man may sometimes eagerly dispute and yet not differ much from one another : the rigorous persecutor of error should therefore enlighten they zeal with knowledge and temper they orthodoxy with charity that charity without which orthodoxy be vain charity that thinketh no evil but hopeth all thing and endureth all thing whether browne have be number among the contemner of religion by the fury of its friend or the artifice of its enemy it be no difficult task to replace he among the most zealous professor of christianity he may perhaps in the ardor of he imagination have hazard a expression which a mind intent upon fault may interpret into heresy if consider apart from the rest of he discourse but a phrase be not to be oppose to volume there be scarcely a writer to be find whose profession be not divinity that have so frequently testify he belief of the sacred writings have appeal to they with such unlimited submission or mention they with such unvaried reverence it be indeed somewhat wonderful that he should be place without the pale of christianity who declare that he assume the honorable style of a christian not because it be the religion of he country but because have in he riper year and confirm judgment see and examine all he find himself oblige by the principle of grace and the law of he own reason to embrace no other name but this who to specify he persuasion yet more tell we that he be of the reform religion of the same belief we savior teach the apostle disseminate the father authorize and the martyr confirm who though paradoxical in philosophy love in divinity to keep the beaten road and please himself that he have no taint of heresy schism or error : to whom where the scripture be silent the church be a text where that speak ` tis but a comment and who use not the dictate of he own reason but where there be a joint silence of both : who bless himself that he live not in the day of miracle when faith have be thrust upon he but enjoy that greater blessing pronounce to all that believe and see not he can not surely be charge with a defect of faith who believe that we savior be dead and bury and rise again and desire to see he in he glory : and who affirm that this be not much to believe that we have reason to owe this faith unto history and that they only have the advantage of a bold and noble faith who live before he come and upon obscure prophecy and mystical type could raise a belief nor can contempt of the positive and ritual part of religion be imputed to he who doubt whether a good man would refuse a poison eucharist and who would violate he own arm rather than a church the opinion of every man must be learn from himself : concern he practice it be safest to trust the evidence of other where these testimony concur no higher degree of historical certainty can be obtain and they apparently concur to prove that browne be a zealous adherent to the faith of christ that he live in obedience to he law and die in confidence of he mercy ascham -lrb- 89 -rrb- it often happen to writer that they be know only by they work the incident of a literary life be seldom observe and therefore seldom recount : but ascham have escape the common fate by the friendship of edward grauut the learn master of westminster school who devote a oration to he memory and have mark the various vicissitude of he fortune graunt either avoid the labor of minute inquiry or think domestick occurrence unworthy of he notice or prefer the character of a orator to that of a historian select only such particulars as he could best express or most happily embellish he narrative be therefore scanty and i know not by what material it can now be amplify roger ascham be bear in the year 1515 at kirby wiske -lrb- or kirby wicke -rrb- a village near northallerton in yorkshire of a family above the vulgar he father john ascham be house-steward in the family of scroop and in that age when the different order of man be at a greater distance from each other and the manners of gentleman be regularly form by menial service in great house live with a very conspicuous reputation margaret ascham he wife be say to have be ally to many considerable family but she maiden name be not record she have three son of whom roger be the youngest and some daughter but who can hope that of any progeny more than one shall deserve to be mention they live married sixty-seven year and at last die together almost on the same hour of the same day roger have pass he first year under the care of he parent be adopt into the family of antony wingfield who maintain he and commit he education with that of he own son to the care of one bond a domestick tutor he very early discover a unusual fondness for literature by a eager perusal of english book and have pass happily through the scholastick rudiment be put in 1530 by he patron wingfield to st john 's college in cambridge ascham enter cambridge at a time when the last great revolution of the intellectual world be fill every academical mind with ardor or anxiety the destruction of the constantinopolitan empire have drive the greek with they language into the interior part of europe the art of printing have make the book easily attainable and greek now begin to be teach in england the doctrine of luther have already fill all the nation of the romish communion with controversy and dissension new study of literature and new tenet of religion find employment for all who be desirous of truth or ambitious of fame learning be at that time prosecute with that eagerness and perseverance which in this age of indifference and dissipation it be not easy to conceive to teach or to learn be at once the business and the pleasure of the academical life and a emulation of study be raise by cheke and smith to which even the present age perhaps owe many advantage without remember or know its benefactor ascham soon resolve to unite himself to those who be enlarge the bound of knowledge and immediately upon he admission into the college apply himself to the study of greek those who be zealous for the new learning be often no great friend to the old religion and ascham as he become a grecian become a protestant the reformation be not yet begin disaffection to popery be consider as a crime justly punish by exclusion from favor and preferment and be not yet openly profess though superstition be gradually lose its hold upon the publick the study of greek be reputable enough and ascham pursue it with diligence and success equally conspicuous he think a language might be most easily learn by teach it and when he have obtain some proficiency in greek read lecture while he be yet a boy to other boy who be desirous of instruction he industry be much encourage by pember a man of great eminence at that time though i know not that he have leave any monument behind he but what the gratitude of he friend and scholar have bestow he be one of the great encourager of greek learning and particularly applaud ascham 's lecture assure he in a letter of which graunt have preserve a extract that he would gain more knowledge by explain one of sop 's fable to a boy than by hear one of homer 's poem explain by another ascham take he bachelor 's degree in 1534 February 18 in the eighteenth year of he age a time of life at which it be more common now to enter the university than to take degree but which accord to the mode of education then in use have nothing of remarkable prematurity on the 23rd of march follow he be choose fellow of the college which election he consider as a second birth dr metcalf the master of the college a man as ascham tell we meanly learn himself but no mean encourager of learn in other clandestinely promote he election though he openly seem first to oppose it and afterwards to censure it because ascham be know to favor the new opinion and the master himself be accuse of give a unjust preference to the northern man one of the faction into which this nation be divide before we could find any more important reason of dissension than that some be bear on the northern and some on the southern side of trent any cause be sufficient for a quarrel and the zealot of the north and south live long in such animosity that it be think necessary at oxford to keep they quiet by choose one proctor every year from each he seem to have be hitherto support by the bounty of wingfield which he attainment of a fellowship now free he from the necessity of receive dependance though in those day it be more common and less irksome than in the present state of thing can never have be free from discontent and therefore he that be release from it must always have rejoice the danger be lest the joy of escape from the patron may not leave sufficient memory of the benefactor of this forgetfulness ascham can not be accuse for he be record to have preserve the most grateful and affectionate reverence for wingfield and to have never grow weary of recount he benefit he reputation still increase and many resort to he chamber to hear the greek writer explain he be likewise eminent for other accomplishment by the advice of pember he have learn to play on musical instrument and he be one of the few who excel in the mechanical art of write which then begin to be cultivate among we and in which we now surpass all other nation he not only write he page with neatness but embellish they with elegant draught and illuminations a art at that time so highly value that it contribute much both to he fame and he fortune he become master of art in march 1537 in he twenty-first year and then if not before commence tutor and publickly undertake the education of young man a tutor of one-and-tweuty however accomplish with learn however exalt by genius would now gain little reverence or obedience but in those day of discipline and regularity the authority of the statute easily supply that of the teacher all power that be lawful be reverenced besides young tutor have still younger pupil ascham be say to have court he scholar to study by every incitement to have treat they with great kindness and to have take care at once to instil learning and piety to enlighten they mind and to form they manners many of he scholar rise to great eminence and among they william grindal be so much distinguish that by cheke 's recommendation he be call to court as a proper master of language for the lady elizabeth there be yet no established lecturer of greek the university therefore appoint ascham to read in the open school and pay he out of the publick purse a honorary stipend such as be then reckon sufficiently liberal a lecture be afterwards found by king henry and he then quit the school but continue to explain greek author in he own college he be at first a opponent of the new pronunciation introduce or rather of the ancient restore about this time by cheke and smith and make some cautious struggle for the common practice which the credit and dignity of he antagonist do not permit he to defend very publickly or with much vehemence : nor be they long he antagonist for either he affection for they merit or he conviction of the cogency of they argument soon change he opinion and he practice and he adhere ever after to they method of utterance of this controversy it be not necessary to give a circumstantial account something of it may be find in strype 's life of smith and something in baker 's reflection upon learn it be sufficient to remark here that cheke 's pronunciation be that which now prevail in the school of england disquisition not only verbal but merely literal be too minute for popular narration he be not less eminent as a writer of latin than as a teacher of greek all the publick letter of the university be of he composition and as little qualification must often bring great ability into notice he be recommend to this honorable employment not less by the neatness of he hand than the elegance of he style however great be he learning he be not always immure in he chamber but be valetudinary and weak of body think it necessary to spend many hour in such exercise as might best relieve he after the fatigue of study he favorite amusement be archery in which he spend or in the opinion of other lose so much time that those whom either he fault or virtue make he enemy and perhaps some whose kindness wish he always worthily employ do not scruple to censure he practice as unsuitable to a man profess learning and perhaps of bad example in a place of education to free himself from this censure be one of the reason for which he publish in 1544 he toxophilus or the schole or partition of shooting in which he join the praise with the precept of archery he design not only to teach the art of shooting but to give a example of diction more natural and more truly english than be use by the common writer of that age whom he censure for mingle exotick term with they native language and of whom he complain that they be make author not by skill or education but by arrogance and temerity he have not fail in either of he purpose he have sufficiently vindicate archery as a innocent salutary useful and liberal diversion and if he precept be of no great use he have only show by one example among many how little the hand can derive from the mind how little intelligence can conduce to dexterity in every art practice be much in art manual practice be almost the whole : precept can at most but warn against error it can never bestow excellence the bow have be so long disused that most english reader have forget its importance though it be the weapon by which we gain the battle of agincourt a weapon which when handle by english yeoman no foreign troops be able to resist we be not only abler of body than the french and therefore superior in the use of arm which be forcible only in proportion to the strength with which they be handle but the national practice of shooting for pleasure or for prize by which every man be inure to archery from he infancy give we insuperable advantage the bow require more practice to skilful use than any other instrument of offence firearm be then in they infancy and though battering-piece have be some time in use i know not whether any soldier be arm with hand-gun when the toxophilus be first publish they be soon after use by the spanish troops whom other nation make haste to imitate but how little they could yet effect will be understand from the account give by the ingenious author of the exercise for the norfolk militia the first musket be very heavy and could not be fire without a rest they have matchlock and barrel of a wide bear that carry a large ball and charge of powder and do execution at a greater distance the musketeer on a march carry only they rest and ammunition and have boy to bear they musket after they for which they be allow great additional pay they be very slow in load not only by reason of the unwieldiness of the piece and because they carry the powder and ball separate but from the time it take to prepare and adjust the match so that they fire be not near so brisk as ours be now afterwards a lighter kind of matchlock musket come into use and they carry they ammunition in bandelier which be broad belt that come over the shoulder to which be hung several little case of wood cover with leather each contain a charge of powder the ball they carry loose in a pouch and they have also a priming-horn hanging by they side the old english writer call those large musket caliver the harquebuss be a lighter piece that could be fire without a rest the matchlock be fire by a match fix by a kind of tong in the serpentine or cock which by pull the trigger be bring down with great quickness upon the priming in the pan over which there be a slide cover which be draw back by the hand just at the time of firing there be a great deal of nicety and care require to fit the match properly to the cock so as to come down exactly true on the priming to blow the ash from the coal and to guard the pan from the spark that fall from it a great deal of time be also lose in take it out of the cock and return it between the finger of the left hand every time that the piece be fire and wet weather often render the match useless while this be the state of firearm and this state continue among we to the civil war with very little improvement it be no wonder that the long-bow be prefer by sir thoma smith who write of the choice of weapon in the reign of queen elizabeth when the use of the bow still continue though the musket be gradually prevail sir john haward a writer yet later have in he history of the norman king endeavor to evince the superiority of the archer to the musketeer : however in the long peace of king jame the bow be wholly forget gun have from that time be the weapon of the english as of other nation and as they be now improve be certainly more efficacious ascham have yet another reason if not for write he book at least for present it to king henry england be not then what it may be now justly term the capital of literature and therefore those who aspire to superior degree of excellence think it necessary to travel into other country the purse of ascham be not equal to the expense of peregrination and therefore he hope to have it augment by a pension nor be he wholly disappoint for the king reward he with a yearly payment of ten pound a pension of ten pound grant by a king of england to a man of letter appear to modern reader so contemptible a benefaction that it be not unworthy of inquiry what might be its value at that time and how much ascham might be enrich by it nothing be more uncertain than the estimation of wealth by denominate money the precious metal never retain long the same proportion to real commodity and the same name in different age do not imply the same quantity of metal so that it be equally difficult to know how much money be contain in any nominal sum and to find what any suppose quantity of gold or silver would purchase both which be necessary to the commensuration of money or the adjustment of proportion between the same sum at different period of time a numeral pound in king henry 's time contain as now twenty shilling and therefore it must be inquire what twenty shilling could perform bread-corn be the most certain standard of the necessaries of life wheat be generally sell at that time for one shill the bushel if therefore we take five shilling the bushel for the current price ten pound be equivalent to fifty but here be danger of a fallacy it may be doubt whether wheat be the general bread-corn of that age and if rye barley or oats be the common food and wheat as i suspect only a delicacy the value of wheat will not regulate the price of other thing this doubt however be in favor of ascham for if we raise the worth of wheat we raise that of he pension but the value of money have another variation which we be still less able to ascertain : the rule of custom or the different need of artificial life make that revenue little at one time which be great at another man be rich and poor not only in proportion to what they have but to what they want in some age not only necessaries be cheaper but fewer thing be necessary in the age of ascham most of the elegancy and expense of we present fashion be unknown : commerce have not yet distribute superfluity through the lower class of the people and the character of a student imply frugality and require no splendor to support it he pension therefore reckon together the want which he could supply and the want from which he be exempt may be estimate in my opinion at more than one hundred pound a year which add to the income of he fellowship put he far enough above distress this be a year of good fortune to ascham he be choose orator to the university on the removal of sir john cheke to court where he be make tutor to prince edward a man once distinguish soon gain admirer ascham be now receive to notice by many of the nobility and by great lady among whom it be then the fashion to study the ancient language lee archbishop of york allow he a yearly pension how much we be not tell he be probably about this time employ in teach many illustrious person to write a fine hand and among other henry and charle duke of suffolk the princess elizabeth and prince edward henry the eighth die two year after and a reformation of religion be now openly prosecute by king edward and he council ascham who be know to favor it have a new grant of he pension and continue at cambridge where he live in great familiarity with bucer who have be call from germany to the professorship of divinity but he retirement be soon at a end for in 1548 he pupil grindal the master of the princess elizabeth die and the princess who have already some acquaintance with ascham call he from he college to direct she study he obey the summons as we may easily believe with readiness and for two year instruct she with great diligence but then be disgusted either at she or she domestick perhaps eager for another change of life he leave she without she consent and return to the university of this precipitation he long repent and as those who be not accustom to disrespect can not easily forgive it he probably feel the effect of he imprudence to he death after have visit cambridge he take a journey into yorkshire to see he native place and he old acquaintance and there receive a letter from the court inform he that he be appoint secretary to sir richard morisine who be to be despatch as ambassador into germany in he return to london he pay that memorable visit to lady jane gray in which he find she reading the phasdo in greek as he have relate in he schoolmaster in September 1550 he attend morisine to germany and wander over great part of the country make observation upon all that appear worthy of he curiosity and contracting acquaintance with man of learn to he correspondent sturmius he pay a visit but sturmius be not at home and those two illustrious friend never see each other during the course of this embassy ascham undertake to improve morisine in greek and for four day in the week explain some passage in herodotus every morning and more than two hundred verse of sophocle or euripide every afternoon he read with he likewise some of the oration of demosthene on the other day he compile the letter of business and in the night fill up he diary digest he remark and write private letter to he friend in england and particularly to those of he college whom he continually exhort to perseverance in study amidst all the pleasure of novelty which he travels supply and in the dignity of he publick station he prefer the tranquillity of private study and the quiet of academical retirement the reasonableness of this choice have be always dispute and in the contrariety of human interest and disposition the controversy will not easily be decide he make a short excursion into italy and mention in he schoolmaster with great severity the vice of venice he be desirous of visit trent while the council be sit but the scantiness of he purse defeat he curiosity in this journey he write he report and discourse of the affair in germany in which he describe the disposition and interest of the german prince like a man inquisitive and judicious and recount many particularity which be lose in the mass of general history in a style which to the ear of that age be undoubtedly mellifluous and which be now a very valuable specimen of genuine english by the death of king edward in 1553 the reformation be stop morisine be recall and ascham 's pension and hope be at a end he therefore retire to he fellowship in a state of disappointment and despair which he biographer have endeavor to express in the deepest strain of plaintive declamation he be deprive of all he support say graunt strip of he pension and cut off from the assistance of he friend who have now lose they influence : so that he have nec premia nec praedium neither pension nor estate to support he at cambridge there be no credit due to a rhetorician 's account either of good or evil the truth be that ascham still have in he fellowship all that in the early part of he life have give he plenty and might have live like the other inhabitant of the college with the advantage of more knowledge and higher reputation but notwithstanding he love of academical retirement he have now too long enjoy the pleasure and festivity of publick life to return with a good will to academical poverty he have however better fortune than he expect and if he lament he condition like he historian better than he deserve he have during he absence in germany be appoint latin secretary to king edward and by the interest of gardiner bishop of winchester he be instate in the same office under philip and mary with a salary of twenty pound a year soon after he admission to he new employment he give a extraordinary specimen of he ability and diligence by compose and transcribe with he usual elegance in three day forty-seven letter to prince and personage of whom cardinal be the lowest how ascham who be know to be a protestant could preserve the favor of gardiner and hold a place of honor and profit in queen mary 's court it must be very natural to inquire cheke as be well know be compel to a recantation and why ascham be spare can not now be discover graunt at a time when the transaction of queen mary 's reign must have be well enough remembered declare that ascham always make open profession of the reform religion and that englesfield and other often endeavor to incite gardiner against he but find they accusation reject with contempt : yet he allow that suspicion and charge of temporization and compliance have somewhat sullied he reputation the author of the biographium britannica conjecture that he owe he safety to he innocence and usefulness that it would have be unpopular to attack a man so little liable to censure and that the loss of he pen could not have be easily supply but the truth be that morality be never suffer in the day of persecution to protect heresy : nor be we sure that ascham be more clear from common failing than those who suffer more and whatever might be he ability they be not so necessary but gardiner could have easily fill he place with another secretary nothing be more vain than at a distant time to examine the motive of discrimination and partiality for the inquirer have consider interest and policy be oblige at last to admit more frequent and more active motive of human conduct caprice accident and private affection at that time if some be punish many be forborne and of many why should not ascham happen to be one he seem to have be calm and prudent and content with that peace which he be suffer to enjoy : a mode of behavior that seldom fail to produce security he have be abroad in the last year of king edward and have at least give no recent offence he be certainly accord to he own opinion not much in danger for in the next year he resign he fellowship which by gardiner 's favor he have continue to hold though not resident and married margaret howe a young gentle-woman of a good family he be distinguish in this reign by the notice of cardinal pole a man of great candor learning and gentleness of manners and particularly eminent for he skill in latin who think highly of ascham 's style of which it be no inconsiderable proof that when pole be desirous of communicate a speech make by himself as legate in parliament to the pope he employ ascham to translate it he be say to have be not only protect by the officer of state but favor and countenance by the queen herself so that he have no reason of complaint in that reign of turbulence and persecution : nor be he fortune much mend when in 1558 he pupil elizabeth mount the throne he be continue in he former employment with the same stipend but though he be daily admit to the presence of the queen assist she private study and partook of she diversion sometimes read to she in the learn language and sometimes play with she at draught and chess he add nothing to he twenty pound a year but the prebend of westwang in the church of york which be give he the year follow he fortune be therefore not proportionate to the rank which he office and reputation give he or to the favor in which he seem to stand with he mistress of this parsimonious allotment it be again a hopeless search to inquire the reason the queen be not naturally bountiful and perhaps do not think it necessary to distinguish by any prodigality of kindness a man who have formerly desert she and whom she might still suspect of serve rather for interest than affection graunt exert he rhetorical power in praise of ascham 's disinterestedness and contempt of money and declare that though he be often reproach by he friend with neglect of he own interest he never would ask any thing and inflexibly refuse all present which he office or imagine interest induce any to offer he camden however impute the narrowness of he condition to he love of dice and cockfight : and graunt forget himself allow that ascham be sometimes throw into agony by disappointed expectation it may be easily discover from he schoolmaster that he feel he want though he might neglect to supply they and we be leave to suspect that he show he contempt of money only by lose at play if this be he practice we may excuse elizabeth who know the domestick character of she servant if she do not give much to he who be lavish of a little however he might fail in he economy it be indecent to treat with wanton levity the memory of a man who share he frailty with all but whose learning or virtue few can attain and by whose excellency many may be improve while himself only suffer by he fault in the reign of elizabeth nothing remarkable be know to have befall he except that in 1563 he be invite by sir edward sackville to write the schoolmaster a treatise on education upon a occasion which he relate in the beginning of the book this work though begin with alacrity in hope of a considerable reward be interrupt by the death of the patron and afterwards sorrowfully and slowly finish in the gloom of disappointment under the pressure of distress but of the author 's disinclination or dejection there can be find no token in the work which be conceive with great vigor and finish with great accuracy and perhaps contain the best advice that be ever give for the study of language this treatise he complete but do not publish for that poverty which in we day drive author so hastily in such number to the press in the time of ascham i believe debar they from it the printer give little for a copy and if we may believe the tale of raleigh 's history be not forward to print what be offer they for nothing ascham 's book therefore lay unseen in he study and be at last dedicated to lord cecil by he widow ascham never have a robust or vigorous body and he excuse for so many hour of diversion be he inability to endure a long continuance of sedentary thought in the latter part of he life he find it necessary to forbear any intense application of the mind from dinner to bedtime and rise to read and write early in the morning he be for some year hectically feverish and though he find some alleviation of he distemper never obtain a perfect recovery of he health the immediate cause of he last sickness be too close application to the composition of a poem which he purpose to present to the queen on the day of she accession to finish this he forbear to sleep at he accustomed hour till in December 1568 he fall sick of a kind of linger disease which graunt have not name nor accurately describe the most afflictive symptom be want of sleep which he endeavor to obtain by the motion of a cradle grow every day weaker he find it vain to contend with he distemper and prepare to die with the resignation and piety of a true christian he be attend on he death-bed by gravet vicar of st sepulchre and dr nowel the learn dean of st paul 's who give ample testimony to the decency and devotion of he conclude life he frequently testify he desire of that dissolution which he soon obtain he funeral sermon be preach by dr nowel roger ascham die in the fifty-third year of he age at a time when accord to the general course of life much might yet have be expect from he and when he might have hope for much from other : but he ability and he want be at a end together and who can determine whether he be cut off from advantage or rescue from calamity he appear to have be not much qualify for the improvement of he fortune he disposition be kind and social he delight in the pleasure of conversation and be probably not much inclined to business this may be suspect from the paucity of he writings he have leave little behind he and of that little nothing be publish by himself but the toxophilus and the account of germany the schoolmaster be print by he widow and the epistle be collect by graunt who dedicate they to queen elizabeth that he might have a opportunity of recommend he son gile ascham to she patronage the dedication be not lose : the young man be make by the queen 's mandate fellow of a college in cambridge where he obtain considerable reputation what be the effect of he widow 's dedication to cecil be not know : it may be hope that ascham 's work obtain for he family after he decease that support which he do not in he life very plenteously procure they whether he be poor by he own fault or the fault of other can not now be decide but it be certain that many have be rich with less merit he philological learning would have gain he honor in any country and among we it may justly call for that reverence which all nation owe to those who first rouse they from ignorance and kindle among they the light of literature of he manners nothing can be say but from he own testimony and that of he contemporary those who mention he allow he many virtue he courtesy benevolence and liberality be celebrated and of he piety we have not only the testimony of he friend but the evidence of he writings that he english work have be so long neglect be a proof of the uncertainty of literary fame he be scarcely know as a author in he own language
