punchinello : have skilfully illuminate free trade i now proceed to elucidate protection you see when we reach protection the boot be on the other leg _ you _ make the conundrum then and the other man try to guess they there be many kind of protection there be the kind which a state 's prison-keeper give to one of he bird the kind which a black-and-tan terrier or a freshly-imported chinaman extend to a good fat rat the kind which a pious young man offer to a fair and tender damsel when he place he arm around she dainty waist and gently absorb the dew of innocence from she rosy lip -lrb- that idea be i think plagiarize from tennyson -rrb- and the kind which a delicate mother-in-law bless with nerve pour out upon she son-in-law but i leave the discussion of such thing to weaker bird and soar myself to a higher kind _ ie _ that protection which be diametrically oppose to free trade protection in this sense be -- well let I follow my own admirable example and illustrate : you own a coal mine in pennsylvanium which contain tolerably poor coal with which you mix a proper amount of stone and then sell the mixture for a high price ichabod blue-nose own a coal mine in nova scotium which furnish good coal he put no slate in it and yet sell it at a low figure you reflect that with such opposition you will never manage to dispose of all you stone so you apply to congress and have a high tariff put on coal that be protection metaphysically define protection be the natural right inherent in every american citizen to obtain money in large quantity for goods of small quality protection be not a natural production it be invent about the time tax be though it must be admit that those very annoying article appear very early in the history of the human race i have no doubt that adam levy tax though it be very doubtful if he could put as many thing in a tax levy as a new york politician can certainly there be a very high tariff on apple in he day -- so high that humanity have not yet succeed in pay off the duty on the one adam eat abraham pay tax and as he be he own senate and house doubtless he pass a tariff bill to suit himself and have any quantity of protection i have always regret that noah do not pass a bill protect native industry because he could have enforce it and have no wrangle about it there be one or two point about protection which a wayfaring man even if people labor under the impression that he be a fool can understand if you be john smith and own a coal mine or a iron mill you go to washington see you congressman -lrb- by see i mean look at he of course -rrb- donate large sum of money to certain poor but honest man who adorn the lobby of the house while they be wait for generous patron like unto you then go home and calmly await the result you representative make a speech the exordium of which be patriotism the peroration of which be star-spangled banner and the central plum of which be you coal mine or iron mill you poor and honest friend wear out several pair of shoe the tariff bill be pass you mine or mill be abundantly protect and the country be save if on the other hand you be john brown and raise cabbage and turnip on a farm you be allow to pay high price for smith 's coal or iron but you expect no protection and you have a sure thing of get what you expect of course you do not imagine that i shall explain the detail of this profound subject there be only two man in this country who think they can do that and each one of those say that the other be a idiot as a rule figure can not lie but look out for the exception when you run across the subject of protection the very same figure have a ugly way of prove both side of a question you run down a fact and think you have get it but before you know it it have slip like the little joker over to the other side personally i be a protectionist formerly i indulged in that monstrous absurdity free trade but then i be a importer now be a manufacturer the scale have fall from my eye and i be of the straitest sect a protectionist you can not give I too much of it of course i can not see why pig-iron should be protect and pig not i think every native production should be care for and that there should be a excessively high tariff on foreign food in that case poor reverdy johnson would have be compel to have pass a lenten season at halifax until he have eradicate from he system the rich english dinner before he could have enter this favored land and motley -- bless I he have eat so much that i do not believe he could get it out of he body if he fast for the remainder of he natural life i be inform however that protection do we one injury all the _ world _ say that there be a parsee in we land who be load with rupee but who be unable to spend they here because of we protective system and what all the _ world _ say you know must be true however there be 40000000 of we and if congress will make all american buy my patent door-knob the parsee can go to -- hindostan i do not think any thing more can be say about protection any body who do not understand it now have better go to washington and listen to the debate on scrap-iron that will sharpen he wit pig-iron of course be interesting but then that be a light and airy subject hear the debate on scrap-iron by all means lot \* \* \* \* \* a literary vampire no greater mistake be ever make than the supposition that punchinello be to be assail with impunity by rival publication it be well know that he never court controversy or quarrel and he best friend understand perfectly he love for a peaceable career but when that flippant sheet know as _ ree 's american encyclopedia _ come out with a violent attack upon punchinello 's past life and present course the assault be such as would provoke a retort from any honest man the vile insinuation that punchinello be print and publish for the sole purpose of make money out of its subscriber and the read public in general be too mendacious for refutation and when the reckless editor of the periodical in question gravely announce that he can never read punchinello without laugh at its contents it will be readily see that he go so far as to make use of the truth to serve he wicked purpose but the descent which this shameless conductor of a journal confessedly the organ of we ignorant mass have make into the private life of punchinello be without precedent he state that for the first fourteen year of he life punchinello be to all intent and purpose a person of little or no fortune and that he depend entirely upon he parent for support that until he have reach he fifth birthday he have absolutely no knowledge of english literature and be entirely ignorant of even the rudiment of the classic that he never pay one cent of income tax at that period of he life and that he belief in the fundamental principle of political economy be at that time doubt by all who know he best be such statement as these to be submit to by a man of honor never punchinello dare the recreant editor of the dirty sheet to do he worst of that base man he could tell much which would render he unfit for the association of any person living but he forbear this much however he will say it be well know that the say calumniator do at many period of he life make use of the service of a _ calceolarius _ think of that freeman of america he have often be know to submit to indignity such as nose-pulling from the hand of a common _ tonsor _ and have be frequently in such a condition that he could not appear in public without the assistance of a _ sartor _ be it fitting that a high-toned journalist should engage in petty recrimination with such a one revenge say jame murdock be the sweetest morsel cook in its own gravy with _ sauce moyennaise _ yes say dean swift and let we have some and a little gin say five finger and a trifle of milk thus it be that we regard the editor of the _ encyclopedia _ carlyle remark many a vessel -lrb- for if not a vessel then surely we or we progenitor in count ship and the assumptive floatative mechanism of anterior and past age or as the assyrian -lrb- under-estimate the force of the correlative element -rrb- declare a bridge or a go over -lrb- not of sea merely but of those chaotic gap of the mind -rrb- be all wrong enough indeed -rrb- have never get there we also think of that editor in this way and trust that enough have be say to make it plain that punchinello be not to be attack with impunity by every little journal of the day \* \* \* \* \* encourage for traveller the

joke the _ lancer _ now run at wallack 's -lrb- a proceeding which imply no want of bravery on the part of that distinguished corps -rrb- be however unlike most military drama inasmuch as it be a

chorus from every body _ why do not stoddart swear _ answering echo from the tipperary hill _ because wallack have tell he that the public will not stand it any longer and the public be right mr stoddart be a exceptionally able actor but of late he have grow intolerably coarse and vulgar while on the stage he profanity have disgrace himself and the theater and he gratuitous insult to a estimable lady who have the misfortune to appear in the same scene with he on Monday night should have secure he instant dismissal from the company and he perpetual banishment to _ tammany _ or _ tony
