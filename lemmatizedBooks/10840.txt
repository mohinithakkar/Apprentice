of they long-tried patience and stubborn endurance how they live and do they work and give a short but graphic outline of the work they accomplish in open out and prepare australium as another home for we race on this side of the world the battle that they fight and win be over great natural difficulty and obstacle as fortunately there be no ferocious wild beast in australium while the danger from the hostility of the aborigine -lrb- though a barbarous people -rrb- be with care and judgment with a few exception avoid they triumph have result in peaceful progress and in permanent occupation and settlement of a vast continent of all the australian explorer the fate of leichhardt -- the franklin of australium as the author so justly term he -- be alone shroud in mystery no man knoweth he sepulchre to this day he party of six white man -lrb- include leichhardt -rrb- and two black boy with 12 horse 13 mule 50 bullock and 270 goat have never be hear of since they leave mcpherson 's station on the cogoon on 3rd April 1848 and although there have be several attempt to unravel the mystery there be scarcely a possibility of any discovery in regard to they fate ever be make there can be no doubt that the fascination concern the work of the early explorer of australium will gather strength as it go hitherto we have be too close to they rightly to appreciate what be do this book therefore come at a opportune time and be a valuable record the author have already do a great service to australian exploration by he writings and in the present instance have add to we obligation to he by condense the record into a smaller compass and by that mean have bring it within convenient limit for use in school and for general reader of the explorer of australium eleven have be honor by

undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller return that the australian people will always remember the deed of those who in they day and generation under arduous and difficult condition devote themselves to the exploration of the continent go without say and i who in bygone year have the honor of assist in the task heartily wish that such fruit may be bear of those deed that australia will

part 1 eastern australia chapter 1 origin 11 governor phillip arthur phillip whose claim to be consider the first inland explorer of the south-eastern portion of australium rest upon he discovery of the hawkesbury river and a few short excursion to the northward of port jackson have but scant leisure to spare from he official duty for extended geographical research for all that phillip and a few of he officer be sufficiently imbue with the spirit of discovery to find opportunity to investigate a considerable area of country in the immediate neighborhood of the settlement and consider the fact that all they exploration at the time have to be laboriously conduct on foot they do they work well the first excursion undertake by phillip be on the 2nd of march 1788 when he go to broken bay whence after a slight examination he be force to return by the inclemency of the weather on the 15th of April he make another attempt to ascertain the character and feature of the unknown land that he have take possession of landing on the shore of the harbor a short distance from the north head he start on a tour of examination and in the course of he march penetrate to a distance of fifteen mile from the coast at this point he catch sight of the distant range that be destine to baffle for many year the western progress of the early settler phillip on this he first glimpse of it christen the northern elevation the caermarthen hill and the southern elevation the lansdowne and a remarkable hill destine to become a well-known early landmark he call richmond hill in the brief view he have of this range there be suddenly bear in phillip 's mind the conviction that a large river must have its source therein and that upon the bank of such a river the soil would be find more arable than about the present settlement he at once make up he mind to try and gain the range on a different course a week later he land at the head of the harbor and direct he march straight inland hope to reach either the mountain which he know to be there or the river in whose existence he firmly believe disappointment dog he step on the first day a belt of dense scrub force he party to return and when on the morrow they avoid the scrub by follow up a small creek and get into more thinly timbered country they slow progress enable they to accomplish only thirty mile in five day by that time they be short of provision there be no river visible and the range still look on they from afar what cheer they be the sight of some land that promise richly to reward the labor of cultivation it be not until the 6th of June 1789 that phillip resume he labor in the field of exploration the sirius have then return from the cape of good hope and he could reckon on the assistance of he friend captain hunter to re-investigate broken bay with the vessel 's boat accordingly two boat be send on to broken bay with provision where they be join by the governor and he party who have march overland besides phillip the party consist of captain hunter and two of he officer captain collin captain johnston and surgeon white for two day they be engage in examine the many inlet and opening of the bay and on the third they chance upon a branch that have before escape they notice they proceed to explore it and find the river of which phillip have dream the next day renew examination prove that it be indeed a noble river with steep bank and a depth of water that promise well for navigation after they return to sydney cove preparation be at once make to follow up this important discovery on the 28th of June phillip again accompany by hunter leave the cove have make much the same arrangement as before there be a slight misunderstanding with regard to meet the boat but after this be clear away the party soon float out on to the water of the new-found river they row up the river until they reach the hill that phillip at a distance have christen richmond hill on traverse a reach of the stream the main range that as yet they have only dimly see in the distance suddenly loom ahead of they frown in rugged grandeur close upon they as it seem strike with admiration and astonishment at this unexpected revelation of the deep ravine and stern and gloomy gorge that score its front over which hang a blue haze phillip almost involuntarily name they on the moment the blue mountain next morning the explorer ascend richmond hill from whose crest they look across a deep wooded valley to the mountain still many mile away after a hasty examination of the country on the bank of the river phillip and he band return to the settlement he have now realize he brightest hope and anticipation on the 11th of April 1791 phillip again start on a expedition the object of which be a closer inspection of the blue mountain he be accompany this time by captain tench and lieutenant dawe the latter in December 1789 have be send out with a small party to reach the foot of the range but have succeed in approach only within eleven mile of the mountain whence he be force to retire by the rugged and broken nature of the country on the present occasion they reach the river two day after leave rise hill they follow it for another two day but make no further discovery be greatly delay by the constant detour around the head of small tributary creek too deep to cross in the neighborhood of the river this be the last explore expedition undertake by governor phillip consider that he health be not robust and that the work entail be of a specially arduous nature he personal share in explore the country about the little settlement be noteworthy it prove he to possess both the foresight and the energy necessary in a explorer 12 captain tench in the month of June 1789 captain watkin tench who during he short sojourn in the infant colony show himself as zealous in exploration as he be keen in he observation start from the newly-formed redoubt at rise hill of which he be in command on a short excursion to examine the surrounding country this trip inspire by tench 's ardent love of discovery become a noteworthy one in the annals of new south wale it be make during the month that witness the discovery of the hawkesbury river on the second day after he party leave rise hill they find themselves early in the morning on the bank of a river nearly as broad as the thame at putney and apparently of great depth the current run very slowly in a northerly direction this river at first know as the tench be afterwards name the nepean by phillip when its identity as a tributary of the hawkesbury have be confirm two other slight excursion be make by tench in company with lieutenant dawe who be in charge of the observatory and ex-surgeon worgan in may 1791 tench and dawe start from rise hill and confirm the supposition that the nepean be a affluent of the hawkesbury a matter over which there have be some doubt since its first discovery by tench tench return to england in hm gorgon in December 1791 the name of paterson johnson palmer and laing be also connect with exploration on the upper hawkesbury 13 the blue mountain : barallier the exploration of that portion of australium which be accessible by the scanty means of the early settler be for many year impede by the stern barrier of the mountain and most of they effort in the direction of discovery be aim at surmount the range that defy they attack among the many whose attempt be signalise only by failure be the gallant bass whose name for other reason will never be forget by australian the quarrelsome and pragmatic cayley and the adventurous hack amongst they there be one however whose failure read by the light of modern knowledge be probably a geographical success this be francis barallier ensign in the new south wale corps who be encourage by governor king to indulge he ardent longing for discovery by birth a frenchman barallier have receive he ensigncy by commission on the 13th of February 1801 have do duty as a ensign since July 1800 by virtue of a government general order issue by governor hunter in August 1801 he have be appoint by governor king military engineer in place of captain abbott resign in February 1802 he be succeed by lieutenant george bellasis a artillery officer besides he expedition to the blue mountain he do much survey with lieutenant jame grant in the lady nelson in 1804 he go to england and see service in several regiment distinguish himself greatly in military engineering amongst he work be the erection of the nelson column in trafalgar square the designer of which be mr railton barallier die in 1853 peron the french naturalist tell we that when in sydney in October 1802 he persuade governor king to fit out a party to attempt the passage of the mountain and that a young frenchman aide-de-camp to the governor be intrust with the leadership he return however without have be able to penetrate further than he english predecessor on the follow month however barallier set out from parramatta on he famous embassy to the king of the mountain this fictitious embassy arise from the fact that colonel paterson have refuse barallier the require leave king claim he as he aide-de-camp and send he on this embassy barallier start with four soldier five convict and a waggon-load of provision draw by two bullock he cross the nepean and establish a depot at a place know as nattaus whence the waggon be send back to sydney for provision barallier with the remainder of he man and a native push out westwards after this preliminary examination he return to the depot and make a fresh departure on the 22nd of November and continue mostly directly westwards he reach a point -lrb- accord to he chart -rrb- about one hundred and five mile due west from lake illawarra if this position be even approximately correct he must have be at the very source of the lachlan river i give a few extract from he diary which be not even translate until the historical record of new south wale be collect by mr fm bladen they refer to the cross of the range on the 24th of November i follow the range of elevated mountain where i see several kangaroo this country be cover with meadow and small hill where tree grow a great distance apartus resume my journey follow various direction to avoid obstacle and at 4 o'clock i arrive on the top of a hill where i discover that the direction of the chain of mountain extend itself north-westerly to a distance which i estimate to be about thirty mile and which turn abruptly at right angle it form a barrier nearly north and south which it be necessary to climb overat 7 o'clock i arrive on the summit of another hill from where i notice three opening : the first on the right towards north 50 west the other in front of I and which appear very large be west from I and the third be south 35 west this discovery give I great hope and the whole of the party appear quite pleased think that we have surmount all difficulty and that we be go to enter a plain the apparent immensity of which give every promise of we be able to penetrate far into the interior of the countryat six o'clock i find myself at a distance of about two mile from the western passageus be then only half-a-mile from the passage and i send on two man in order to discover it instruct they to ascend the mountain to the north of this passageus wait till 7 o'clock for my two man who relate to I that after pass the range which be in front of we we would enter a immense plain that from the height where they be on the mountain they have catch sight of only a few hill stand here and there on this plain and that the country in front of they have the appearance of a meadowat daybreak i leave with two man to verify myself the configuration of the ground and to ascertain whether the passage of the blue mountain have really be effect i climb the chain of mountain north of we when i have reach the middle of this height the view of a plain as vast as the eye could reach confirm to I the report of the previous dayus discover towards the west and at a distance which i estimate to be forty mile a range of mountain higher than those we have passedfrom where i be i could not detect any obstacle to the passage right to the foot of those mountainsafter have cut a cross of st andrew on a tree to indicate the terminus of my second journey i return by the same route i have come barallier conclude he diary by mention another project expedition over the mountain from jervi bay but no record of such a journey have ever come

pass and until the year 1813 they be regard as impenetrable the narrative of the cross of these mountain and the chain of event that lead up to the successful attempt be widely known but only in a general way it be for this reason that a longer and more detailed account be give in these page and as the expedition be successful in open up a way to the interior of the continent it be fitting that its leader and originator gregory blaxland should be class amongst the maker of australasium blaxland be bear in kent in 1771 and arrive in the colony in 1806 accompany by he wife and three child he settle down to the congenial occupation of stockbreed on what be then consider to be a large scale finding that he stock do not thrive so well in the immediate neighborhood of the sea coast and want more land for pasture he increase herd he make anxious enquiry in all direction as to the possibility of cross the blue mountain inland nobody would entertain such a suggestion the failure have be too many : every one to whom he broach the subject declare it to be impossible prophesy that the extension of the settlement westward would forever be obstruct by they unscalable height blaxland however be not intimidate by these disheartening prediction and in 1811 he start out on a short journey of investigation in company with three european and two native on this trip he find that by keep on the crowning ridge or divide water-shed between the stream run into the nepean and those that feed what he then take to be a inland river he get along fairly well some time afterwards he accompany the governor in a boat excursion up the warragamba a tributary of the nepean and though there be no noteworthy result it convinced blaxland that could he follow he former tactic of adhering to the lead ridge that form the divide between the tributary of the northern bank of this river and the affluent of the grose a tributary of the hawkesbury he would attain he object and reach the highland it will thus be see that blaxland act with a definite and well-thought-out mode of procedure and that the ridge he select for the attempt be choose with judgment base on considerable knowledge of the locality which he gain from many talk with the man who hunt and frequent the foothill of the range finally when he have arrange he plan of assault he confide he intention to two friend lieutenant william lawson and william charle wentworth whose name be associate with he in the conquest of the mountain they both consent to accompany he and agree to follow he idea of stubbornly follow one lead spur blaxland 's former expedition have convince he that the local knowledge of the native do not extend far enough to be of any service and they therefore do not take any aborigine with they they take pack-horse however which prove that the party start with a well-founded faith in they ultimate success and give no heed to the terrifying description of former traveller the besetting hindrance to they progress be the low scrub of brushwood that greatly delay the pack-horse this obstacle be overcome only by patiently advance before the horse every afternoon and cut a bridle-track for the succeed day 's stage thus literally the way that ultimately lead into the interior be win by foot and the little pioneering band eventually descend into open grazing country at the head of what be now know as the cox river the outward and return trip occupy less than one month 's time which speak volume for the wise choice of route but what say more be the fact that no better natural upward pathway have since be find a synopsis of blaxland 's journal be give here commence with a few quote line of preamble : -- on Tuesday may 11th 1813 mr gregory blaxland mr william wentworth and lieutenant lawson attend by four servant with five dog and four horse laden with provision and other necessaries leave mr blaxland 's farm at south creek for the purpose of endeavor to affect a passage over the blue mountain between the western river \* and the river grosethe distance travel on this and subsequent day be compute by time the rate be estimate at about two mile per hour \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- the warragamba they camp at the foot of the ridge that be to witness the last struggle between man and the mountain on the first day they do three mile and a half in a direction vary from south-west to west-north-west and that night obtain a little grass for the horse and some water in a rocky hole the heavy dew in the morning retard any attempt at early departure as the thick wet brush render it difficult to drive the horse so that as a rule it be nine o'clock before they be able to strike camp the ridge still favor the direction of west and north-west on the third day they arrive at a tract of land hilly but with tolerable grass on it here they find trace of a former white visitant in the shape of a marked-tree line two mile from this point they meet with a belt of brushwood so dense that for the first time they be force to alter they course but the subordinate spur on either side end in rocky precipice they have to return and again confront the scrub in these circumstance they make up they mind to rely upon axe and tomahawk to win a way and so next morning fall to work cut a passage for the horse the ascent be also now become steep and rough and on this day some of the horse fall while struggle up with they load the first day 's work gain for they five mile but at the end of they toil they have to retrace they weary way back to the last night 's camp the next day they clear the track for only two mile further ahead so much time be waste in walk backwards and forwards to the work there be no grass amongst the scrub that encompass they and when on Monday they determine to move the camp equipage forward they pack the horse with as much cut-grass as they could put on they this amount to accord to lawson 's diary about two hundred pound weight for each horse which in addition to they ordinary load must have be a very weighty packload for uphill work however accord to blaxland they stand it well they obtain no water for they animal that night and what they want for they own requirement have to be painfully carry up a cliff about six hundred foot in height on the succeed day they suddenly come on what at first appear to be a impassable barrier the ridge which they have so pertinaciously follow have for the last mile narrow and dwindle down into a sharp razor-backed spur flank with rugged and abrupt gully on either slope across this narrow way now stretch a perpendicularly-sided mass of rock which seem effectually to bar they path the removal of a few large boulder however reveal a aperture which after some labor they widen sufficiently to allow the pack-horse to squeeze through once through they begin to ascend what they estimate to be the second tier of the mountain shortly after they leave camp that morning they come on a pile of stone or cairn evidently the work of some european which they attribute to bass they be much elate at the thought that they have now pass beyond the limit of any previous attempt \* \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- this cairn be afterwards name cayley 's repulse by governor macquarie : but recent research go to show that cayley follow the valley of the grose and be many mile to the north of where the cairn be find accord to flinder bass be not on the high ridge traverse by blaxland and party they could now look round with triumph on the panorama spread beneath they view and from the superior elevation which they have obtain they take the bearing of several noticeable landmark that they have see before only from the flat country the labor of cut a path each day for the horse for the next day 's march have however still to be continue but the crest of the ridge be again wider though the gully on each side be as steep as before that night in camp the dog be uneasy throughout the night and several time give tongue and arouse the sleeper tire with they day 's work from what they find afterwards they have good reason to believe that the black have be lurk around meditate a attack they then pass over the locality know in the present day as blackheath and soon afterwards have they course divert to the northward by what blaxland term a stone wall rise perpendicularly out of the side of the mountain this they try to descend but without success and so keep on along its brow undergrowth still delay they and they still have to spend they energy in hew a passage until on the 28th of the month they camp on the edge of the steep descent that have lately march beside they the decline be however not quite so abrupt and the face no longer compose of solid rock they pause to overlook what lay before they and immediately below and find the view more gratifying than they have anticipate what they have at first take for sandy barren soil prove now on nearer inspection to be forest-land fairly cover with a good growth of grass the horse not have taste fresh grass for some day they cut a slanting trench across the sloping face of the descent in order to afford the horse some sort of foot-hold and manage to get they down to a little feed that evening next morning they be up and away early and reach the foot of the mountain -lrb- mount york -rrb- at 9 be have have to carry the pack-load down most of the way themselves as it be too steep for laden horse to preserve they balance with safety the actual base of the mountain be reach through a gap in the rock some thirty foot in width they now find themselves on what be then term meadow land drain by the upper tributary of the warragamba and this country present no serious obstacle to they further progress they rightly conclude that they have now surmount every difficulty they follow the mountain stream up for some distance and at the furthest point they reach ascend a high sugar-loaf hill which surveyor evan who follow in they footstep call mount blaxland from the summit they have a extensive view all around and blaxland describe the character of the country they see in the follow word : forest and grass land sufficient to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty year just here let we compare this prophecy with a similar one make by evan a few month afterwards on the pasture land of the upper macquarie : the increase of stock for some hundred year can not overrun it the provision of the explorer be now nearly expend they apparel especially they footgear be in rag and tatters on the other hand the work that they have set themselves to do be well do they have vanquish the blue mountain they return be uneventful after breakfast on the 6th of June they cross the nepean they provision with the exception of a little flour be quite consume we thus see how in the end the impenetrable range that have so long overawe the colonist with its frown be overcome with slight difficulty when local experience combine with method be array against it to liken the former expedition to blaxland 's be to compare a few headlong assault with a well-conceived and skilfully worked-out attack the man themselves write slightingly of the feat blaxland say : the passage of the blue mountain might be easily effect lawson 's opinion of the mountain be : that there would be no difficulty in make a good road and wentworth 's verdict be : that the country they reach be easy of access evan who be hot upon they trail give as he opinion : that there be no hill on the ridge that they ascent or descent be in any way difficult the tiding bring back by the party of successful pioneer create the greatest excitement in the little colony no longer would the mountainous barrier stand defiantly in they western path for over thirty year it have laugh at they puny effort to cross its rugged crest but its time have come at last the way to the unknown west be now open and rejoicingly the settler prepare to follow on the explorer ' trail what the mysterious interior might hold they could not imagine but the gate thereto be throw wide at last its secret would be soon know to they blaxland die on the 3rd of January 1853 have live long enough to witness the wonderful advance in settlement due to he energy chapter 2 george william evan -lrb- illustration george w evan discoverer of the macquarie and lachlan river -rrb- 21 first inland exploration george william evans deputy-surveyor of land come forward at this stage as the most prominent figure in australian exploration to he be due the honor without dispute or cavil of be the first discoverer of a australian river flow into the interior for some reason he have never receive adequate recognition of he important exploration and he be well-nigh forget by the people of new south wale the state that have benefit most by he labor after oxley 's second expedition he name appear to have be overshadow by he official superior 's yet he work be invariably successful and he labor in the field unremitting evan be bear in england at warwick in 1778 when a young man he go to the cape of good hope where he obtain a appointment in the dockyard and while there he marry he first wife janet melvill in 1802 he be appoint deputy surveyor-general and come to australia in hm buffalo in order to take up he official duty it be while he hold this post that he carry out he work of exploration when he return from these exploration he resume he duty as deputy surveyor-general only until he be permanently settle in tasmanium where he remain in office until the year 1825 when he resign in disgust at he treatment by he superior evan live at a time when official jealousy be rife and man in position often heedless of the justice or veracity of they statement when influence by party rancor the machination of a cabal lead by governor arthur and a effort make to deprive he of he well-deserved pension necessitate evan 's departure for england to defend he claim in this he be only partially successful for the pension which it be understand be for life be stop in 1832 he return to tasmanium and pass the rest of he day at he residence warwick lodge at the head of newtown bay he die at the age of seventy-four and be bury in the old cemetery hobart he second wife lucy parri rest in the same grave evan be a clever draughtsman and some of he sketch of the country explore be reproduce in oxley 's journal he also publish a book entitle history and description of the present state of van dieman 's land it be on Saturday the 20th of November 1813 that evan in charge of five man one of whom have be with blaxland 's party start from the point of forest land on the nepean know as emu island he lose no time in follow the track of the late expedition leave the measurement until he return on Friday the 26th he reach blaxland 's furthest point and thenceforward pass over new ground it be somewhat amusing to note that he opinion of the country when on he outward way and on he homeward be widely divergent he candidly and ingenuously write after he have be on the table-land : -- what appear to I fine country on my first come to it look miserable now after return from so superior and good a country on Tuesday the 30th of November he gain a ridge that he have have in view for some time though he have be bother by the hill in he effort to reach it from this ridge he catch a tantalising view a glimpse of the outskirts of the vast interior there before he the first white man to look upon the scene lay the open way to two thousand mile of fair pasture-land and brooding desert-waste -- of limitless plain and boundless rolling downs -- of open grassy forest and barren scrub -- of solitary mountain peak and sluggish river and though then hide from even the most brilliant imagination the wondrous potentiality latent in that silent and untrodden region if a vision of the future have be vouchsafe deputy-surveyor evan as he stand and gaze -- a vision of all that would cover the spacious land before and beyond he before one hundred year have pass away -- the entry he make in he diary would surely have reflect in its style he flight of imagination instead we have the prosaic statement : -- i come to a very high mount when i be much pleased with the sight westward i think i can see 40 mile which have the look of open country in a pleasant valley he come upon a large riverlett and on its bank they camp there they shoot duck and catch trout -- as he call the murray cod -- the first of the species to tickle the palate of a white man fine specimen too weigh five and six pound as he proceed further and further he become enchanted with the scenery : the handsomest i have yet see with gently-rising hill and dale well-watered -- and he finally note that language fail he to describe it adequately evan name the river that lead he through this veritable land of promise the fish river and a river which join its water with it from the south he call the campbell river the unite stream he christen as in duty bind the macquarie unimpeded in he course he follow the macquarie until he be 98 1\/2 measure mile -- for they have be chain since pass the limit of the first explorer -- from the termination of blaxland 's journey he then decide to return for he have gain all the information he have be send to seek and though game be plentiful he party be without shoe and the horse be suffer from sore back thus be conclude in a most satisfactory manner the first journey of exploration into the interior evan constantly see during he progress unmistakeable trace of the native but he interview only a small party of five this representative band of the inland aborigine of australium be compose of two lubra and some picaninny both the woman be blind of the right eye the party reach the nepean on they return journey on the 8th of January 1814 mr cox be immediately intrust with the superintendence of the work of make a public road over the range follow closely the same route as that take by blaxland 's party this work be complete in the year 1815 and on the 26th of April of the same year governor macquarie and a large staff set out to visit the newly-found territory the governor arrive at the recently-formed town of bathurst on the 4th of may but before he arrival evan have be again order out on another explore expedition to the south-west 22 the lachlan river evan start from bathurst on the 13th of may 1815 he commence he journey along the fine flat country then know as queen charlotte vale maintain a southerly course for a day or two but find himself still amongst the tributary of the campbell river he retrace he step some twelve or fourteen mile in order to avoid a row of rocky hill he then strike out more to the westward on Thursday the 23rd he come to a chain of pond bear nearly north-west and from a commanding ridge see before he a prospect as gratifying as some of the scene view on he former trip i never see a more pleasing-looking country i can not express the pleasure i feel in go forward the hill we have pass be excellent land well-wooded to the south distant object be obscure by high hill but in the south-west be very distant mountain under they appear a mist as tho ' rise from a river it be the like look round to the west but beyond the loom of high hill be very faintly distinguish this be the first view evan obtain of the lachlan valley the pond he have meet with gradually grow into a connected stream : other pond unite with they from the north-east and he write : they have at the end of the day almost the appearance of a river on the 24th he come to a creek which join the bed of a river rise in a north 30 east direction now dry except in hollow place it be fully 70 foot wide have a pebbly bottom on each side grow large swamp-oak on Thursday the 1st of June this river hold a definite course to the westward and he be clear of the point of the hill which hitherto have hinder he greatly he determine to return as he be run short of provision to-morrow i be necessitate to return and shall ascend a very high hill i leave on my right hand this morning i leave no mark here more than cut tree on one situate in a angle of the river on a wet creek bearing north i have deeply carve evan 1st June 1815

bear a short passage in he diary write during he return be of peculiar interest as it contain the first mention of snow see in australium by white man on Thursday the 8th of June he write : -- the mountain i observe bear north-west be cover with snow i think on my way out that they top look rather white to-day it be distinguish as plain as ever i see snow on the mountain in van dieman 's land i never feel colder weather than it have be some day past we have break ice full two inch thick on the 12th of June the party return to bathurst and evan have by that time accomplished two of the most momentous journey ever make in australium it be not he actual discovery alone that bring he fame but the vast field for settlement these discovery open up the independent exploration of surveyor evan cease after he discovery of the lachlan thenceforward he serve australium as second to lieutenant oxley 23 the unknown west the settler of that day take every advantage of the new outlet for they energy throw open to they by the recent successful exploration cattle and sheep be rapidly drive forward on to the highland and favor by a beautiful site the town of bathurst soon assume a orderly appearance private enterprise have also be at work elsewhere the pioneer settler be make they way south the tide of settlement flow over the intermediate land to the shoalhaven river and in the north they have commence the irresistible march of civilization up the hunter river it be in the shoalhaven district that young hamilton hume the first australian-born explorer to make he mark in the field gain he bushcraft governor macquarie during he term of office do he best to foster exploration and it be fortunate that the first advance into the interior occur when there be a governor in australium who do not look coldly upon geographical enterprise the man who enter first upon the task of solve the geographical problem of the interior of the australian continent be doom to meet with much bitter disappointment the vary nature of the season cause the different traveller to form contrary and perplexing idea often with regard to the same tract of country what appear to one man a land of pleasant gurgle brook flow through rich pasture appear to another as a pitiless desert unfit for human foot to venture upon oxley who traverse what be now the cream of the agricultural portion of the state of new south wale speak of the main part of it in term of the bitterest condemnation he error be of course rather a mistake in judgment than the result of inaccurate observation some of the colonist nurse far fonder hope and the general opinion seem to be that these western flow river would gather in tributary and have swollen to a size worthy of so great a continent seek the sea on the west coast wc wentworth who certainly be capable of form a opinion deserving consideration write thus of the then untraced macquarie river : -- if the sanguine hope to which the discovery of this river -lrb- the macquarie -rrb- have give birth should be realize and it should be find to empty itself into the ocean in the north-west coast which be the only part of this vast island that have not be accurately survey in what mighty conception of the future power and greatness of this colony may we not reasonably indulge the nearest point at which mr oxley leave off to any part of the western coast be very little short of two thousand mile if this river therefore be already of the size of the hawkesbury at windsor which be not less than two hundred and fifty yard in breadth and of sufficient depth to float a seventy-four gun ship it be not difficult to imagine what must be its magnitude at its confluence with the ocean before it can arrive at which it have to traverse a country nearly two thousand mile in extent if it possess the usual sinuosity of river its course to the sea can not be less than from five to six thousand mile and the endless accession of tributary stream which it must receive in its passage through so great a extent of country will without doubt enable it to vie in point of magnitude with any river in the world it be to realize such ambitious hope as these that oxley go forth to penetrate into the interior chapter 3 john oxley -lrb- illustration john oxley from a portrait in the possession of mr oxley of bowral the portrait be present to mr king widow of governor king in 1810 and sign by he -rrb- 31 general biography oxley be bear in england in the early part of 1781 in he youth he enter the navy see active service in many part of the world and rise to the rank of lieutenant he come to australia in January 1812 and be appoint surveyor-general throughout he career in australium oxley would seem to have win the friendship and respect of all he come in contact with captain charle sturt in the journal of he first expedition write of he as follow : -- a reflection arise to my mind on examine these decay vestige of a former expedition whether i should be more fortunate than the leader of it and how far i should be able to penetrate beyond the point which have conquer he perseverance only a week before i leave sydney i have follow mr oxley to the tomb a man of great quickness and of uncommon ability the task of follow up he discovery be no less enviable than arduous these thought be suggest to sturt when stand at one of oxley 's old camp and come from such a man carry great weight the follow obituary notice of oxley appear in the government gazette of may 27th 1828 it would be impossible for he excellency consistently with he feeling to announce the decease of the late surveyor-general without endeavor to express the sense he entertain of mr oxley 's service though he can not do justice to they from the nature of this colony the office of surveyor-general be amongst the most important under government and to perform its duty in a manner mr oxley have do for a long series of year be as honorable to he zeal and ability as it be painful for the government to be deprive of they mr oxley enter the public service at a early period of he life and have fill the important situation of surveyor-general for the last sixteen year he exertion in the public service have be unwearied as have be prove by he several expedition to explore the interior the public have reap the benefit while it be to be apprehend that the event which they can not fail to lament have be accelerate by the privation and fatigue of these arduous service mr oxley eminently assist in unfold the advantage of this highly favored colony from a early stage of its existence and he name will ever be associate with the dawn of its advancement it be always gratify to the government to record its approbation of the service of meritorious public officer and in assign to mr oxley 's name a distinguished place in that class to which he devotion to the interest of the colony have so justly entitle he the government would do honor to he memory in the same degree as it feel the loss it have sustain in he death oxley die at kirkham he private residence near sydney on the 25th of may 1828 though he judgment be at time at fault as will be see later on he be essentially a successful explorer for although he do not in every case achieve the object aim at he always bring back he man without loss and he open up vast tract of new country john oxley 's personality be not very familiar but the portrait present to the reader in this volume be take in the prime of he life before he suffer the scar of doubtful battle with the australian wilderness it have never be publish before and be take from the original miniature that he present to mr king widow of governor king in 1810 32 he first expedition on this oxley 's first journey of exploration evan accompany he as second in command and another man who have leave a immortal name be also with he -- allan cunningham officially know as king 's botanist charle fraser well-known in connection with the early history both of new south wale and of western australium accompany oxley under the title of colonial botanist there be nine other man in the party -- boatmen horse-tender and so forth they have with they two boat and fourteen pack and riding-horse a depot be first form at the junction of the small creek whence evan have turn back and where he have mark a tree with he initial in 1815 there the boat be launch and preparation complete for the final start on the 6th of April 1817 oxley leave sydney and join he party at the depot on the 1st of may thence he soon commence this most momentous journey in australium 's early annals eager to penetrate into the unknown and inspire with hope of solve the mystery of the outlet of this inland river disappointment mark the tone of oxley 's journal from the start the exceed flatness of the country the many ana-branch of the river the low altitude of its bank and the absence of any large tributary stream above all the dismal impression make by the monotony of the surroundings seem to have depress oxley 's spirit he appear to have form the idea that the interior tract he be approach be nothing more than a dead and stagnant marsh -- a huge dreary swamp within whose bound the inland river lose they individuality and merge into a lifeless morass a more melancholy picture could not be imagine and with such a awesome thought constantly haunt he mind there be no wonder that he become morbid and that the dominant tone of he journal whilst on the lachlan be so hopelessly pessimistic these flat he say be certainly not adapt for cattle the grass be too swampy and the bush swamp and lagoon be too thickly intermingle with the better portion to render it a safe or desirable grazing country the timber be universally bad and small a few misshapen gum tree on the immediate bank of the river may be consider a exception the channel of the river now divide and oxley follow the channel on the northern side which they be skirt but before they have progress a mile beyond the point of divergence they reach the spot where the river overflow its bank and its course be lose in the marsh it be on the 12th of may that they receive this check to they as yet uninterrupted progress observe a eminence about half-a-mile from the south side we cross over the horse and baggage at a place where the water be level with the bank and which when within its usual channel do not exceed thirty or forty foot in width we ascend the hill and have the mortification to perceive that the termination of we research be reach at least down this branch of the river the whole country from the west north-west round to the north be either a complete marsh or lay under water the country to the south and south-west appear more elevated oxley determine to return to the place where the branch separate and to try he fortune on the other one this after a while prove as unsatisfactory as the one they have abandon bitterly disappointed oxley alter he plan entirely he resolve to cease try to follow the river through this water-logged country and determine to strike out on a direct course to the south coast in the neighborhood of cape northumberland in this way he hope to cross any river that these dreary marsh and swamp give birth to and that find a outlet into the southern ocean between spencer 's gulf and cape otway this resolve be at once carry out the boat be haul up and secure together all unnecessary article be abandon to suit the reduce means of transit and at nine o'clock on may 18th they say farewell to this weary river and start to encounter fresh trouble under another guise instead of travel in a superfluity of water they now find themselves straiten by drought and the work begin to tell upon the horse scrub too that beset hindrance of so many australian explorer begin to impede they onward path eucalyptus brush overrun with creeper and prickly acacia bush unite to bar the way and when after much toil and suffer they at last reach the point of a range which oxley name the peel range the leader have reluctantly again to change he mind and to abandon the idea of make south-west to the coast sick at heart of this sequence of disastrous happening he confide he feeling of sorrow to he journal June 4th weather as usual fine and clear which be the greatest comfort we enjoy in these desert abandon by every living creature capable of get out of they i be oblige to send back to we former halting-place for water a distance of near eight mile this be terrible for the horse who be in general extremely reduce but two in particular can not i think endure this miserable existence much longer at five o'clock two of the man whom i have send to explore the country to the south-west and see if any water could be find return after proceed six or seven mile they find it impossible to go any farther in that direction or even south from the thick bush that intersect they course on every side and no water -lrb- nor in fact the least sign of any -rrb- be discover either by they or by those who be send in search of it nearer we little camp June 5th from everything i can see of the country to the south-west it appear upon the most mature deliberation highly imprudent to persevere longer in that direction as the consequence to the horse of want of grass and water might be most serious and we be well assure that within forty mile on that point the country be the same as before pass overor horse be unable to go more than eight or ten mile a day but even they must be assure of find food of which in these desert the chance be against the existence on the follow day June 6th oxley have change he course to the west and north-west make another effort to escape from the surroundings that so dishearten he on the 4th of June before leave allan cunningham plant some acorn and peach and apricot stone in honor of the king 's birthday upon this episode oxley remark that they would serve to commemorate the day and situation should these desolate plain be ever again visit by civilised man of which however i think there be very little probability all this only show how the lack of experience of the paradoxical nature of the australian interior induce oxley to form a absurdly erroneous idea of the country in its virgin state he observation read almost like a present-day description of the sandy spinifex desert of the north-west of western australium and in fact the very same remark be make by warburton in 1873 when traverse that awful desert he confess he uncertainty about the longitude of joanna spring and say that it do not matter as no white man would ever come into the desert again in search of the oasis but oxley 's trouble be increase and on June 8th he write : the whole country in these direction as far as the eye can reach be one continue thicket of eucalyptus scrub it be impossible to proceed that way and we situation be too critical to admit of delay : it be therefore resolve to return back to we last station on the 6th under peel 's range if for no other purpose than that of give the horse water force to return once more oxley become thoroughly convince of the inhabitability of the country and it be no wonder that he condemnation be so sweeping and hasty he write on June the 21st : -- the farther we proceed westerly the more convinced i be that for all the practical purpose of civilised man the interior of this country westward of a certain meridian be uninhabitable deprive as it be of wood water and grass unfortunately for he fame he then relinquish all thought and hope of a southward course for have he push on posterity would have hail he memory as the discoverer of the murrumbidgee but fate decide otherwise and deject and baffle he turn to follow the peel range north make for the part he have leave where at least he be sure of a supply of water the expedition suddenly come upon the river again on the 23rd of June and hope to find that it have modify its nature they commence to run it down again the 7th of July they be force to halt once more when oxley give up all idea of trace the lachlan he begin he return journey make this last desponding entry : -- it be with infinite regret and pain that i be force to come to the conclusion that the interior of this vast country be a marsh and uninhabitablethere be a dreary uniformity in the barren desolateness of this country which weary one more than i be able to express one tree one soil one water and one description of bird fish or animal prevail alike for ten mile and for one hundred a variety of wretchedness be at all time preferable to one unvarying cause of pain or distress -lrb- illustration the lachlan river at the point where oxley leave it on the 4th August 1818 and strike north-east to gain the macquarie river and follow that river up to bathurst photo by the reverend jm curran -rrb- on the 4th of August the leader know the repellant nature of the river and its swamp and morass that lay ahead of they return footstep determine to quit the lachlan altogether and steer a northern course to abandon the low country reach the macquarie river and follow it up to the settlement at bathurst the boat have be long since abandon it be necessary to build a raft of pine-log wherewith to transport the baggage over the stream they cross in safety and we can imagine that it be with no feeling of regret that they finally lose sight of the stream that have so persistently baffle they in all they attempt to traverse its bank for some day they have to struggle against the many obstacle of a new and untrodden land but they at last emerge on to the macquarie country which make a pleasant and welcome contrast with the detest lachlan it may be think that too much stress have be lay upon oxley 's opinion of the lachlan but it be this pessimistic report that dominate the public mind for many year in its speculation as to the character of the interior to oxley himself the first glimpse of the macquarie come like a ray of sunshine on he harass feeling be he not to reap some reward for he heroic effort along the lachlan to enjoy the realisation of some of he ambition as geographical discoverer the macquarie seem a favourable subject for the exercise of he talent would it not lead he westward to the conquest of that mysterious inland country which have hitherto guard its secret with a invincible obstinacy poor oxley who can help rejoice with he in he short-lived joy without know it he be the first of a long line of brave spirit who be doom to lose health and life in carve they way into the heart of australium as they return homeward up the bank of the macquarie the river seem to he to glitter with the bright promise of a crown of success for almost the first time the entry in he journal have a cheery ring of hope : -- nothing can afford a stronger contrast than the two river -- lachlan and macquarie -- different in they habit they appearance and the source from which they derive they water but above all differ in the country border on they the one constantly receive great accession of water from four stream and as liberally render fertile a great extent of country whilst the other from its source to its termination be constantly diffuse and diminish the water it originally receive over low and barren desert create only wet flat and uninhabitable morass and during its protracted and sinuous course be never indebted to a single tributary stream 33 the liverpool plain the disappointment occasion by oxley 's return to bathurst and he failure to trace the course of the lachlan be in part atone for by the high opinion he have form of the macquarie a second expedition be plan and the command again offer to the surveyor-general evan be again second and dr harri a very able man accompany the party as a volunteer charle fraser be botanist but allan cunningham do not go the expedition be on a slightly larger scale there be besides those already mention twelve ordinary member with eighteen horse and provision for twenty-four week a depot be form at wellington valley and man send ahead to build two boat on June 6th the start be make from the depot and for the first 125 mile no obstacle nor impediment be meet with elate by this oxley send two man back to bathurst in accordance with instruction bear a favourable despatch to governor macquarie but fate be again deride the unfortunate explorer no sooner have the two party separate one with well-grounded hope of they ultimate success the other bear back tiding of these confident hope than doubt and distrust enter into the mind of the leader twenty-four hour after the departure of the messenger oxley write in he journal : -- for four or five mile there be no material change in the general appearance of the country from what it have be on the precede day but for the last six mile the land be considerably lower intersperse with plain clear of timber and dry on the bank it be still lower and in many place it be evident that the river-flood sweep over they although this do not appear to be universally the casethese unfavourable appearance throw a damp upon we hope and we fear that we anticipation have be too sanguine and still as oxley go on he find the country get flatter and more liable to inundation until at last with a heart nearly as low as the country he find himself almost hem in by water in fact it be necessary to retrace step in order to find a place where they could encamp with safety upon this emergency oxley hold a consultation with evan and harri and it be decide to send the baggage and horse back to a small and safe elevation that stand some fifteen mile higher up the river thus make a subsidiary depot camp oxley himself with four volunteer in the largest of the two boat would take a month 's provision and follow the stream as long as there be enough water to float they craft meanwhile evan during oxley 's absence be to make a excursion to the north-east and return by a more northerly route this be the direction the party intend to take should the river fail they as the lachlan have do on the previous journey it be a wet and stormy day on which oxley start on the river voyage for about twenty mile there be as oxley express it no country the main channel be in a overflow state the flat country which surround they could be recognize only by the timber grow on the bank the clear space whereon no tree grow be now cover with reed which stand at the height of six or seven foot above the surface that night they take refuge on a piece of land which be so nearly submerge that there be scarcely enough space on which to kindle a fire in the morning the violence of the storm have somewhat abate and as soon as the gray light be strong enough for they to recognize they way they resume they dreary journey oxley still contrived to keep to what he take to be the main channel although as it now pursue its course amid a dense thicket of reed it be become more difficult with every succeed mile oxley 's seamanship however stand he in good stead and although fall log now begin to obstruct they passage they keep doggedly on for another twenty mile there be no diminution in the volume of the current that be now bear they onward and oxley feel confident that he be approach that hide lake wherein the inland water mingle they stream and of whose existence he think he have now every reason to rest assure just as he be buoy he spirit up with these hope dream that in future he would be able proudly to say we be the first that ever burst into that silent sea the river elude all further pursuit by spread out in every direction amongst the ocean of reed that surround they wound to the heart at this unlooked-for disappointment oxley after vainly seek for some clue or indication by which he could continue the search have to ` bout ship and return to the camp of the night before he say : -- there be no channel whatever amongst these reed and the depth vary from five to three foot although he be still convince that the long sought-for australian sea exist he recognize the futility of continue this search to the westward in which direction some malignant genius seem ever to persist in thwart he and so he regain the shelter of the depot at mount harri with another tale of frustrated hope evan on he return from he scout expedition to the north and north-east have a more cheerful story to tell the weather have be wet throughout and the impassable nature of the country occasion thereby have hamper he greatly nevertheless he have struggle across the worst of the flat country and in the north-east have come to a new river which he name the castlereagh he be absent ten day and on he return oxley determine to abandon the macquarie which have prove even more deceptive and elusive than the lachlan and to strike out for the higher land which evan report have see he leave mount harri on July 20th first bury a bottle there contain a write scheme of he intended movement and some silver coin ten year afterwards captain sturt make a ineffectual search for this bottle oxley have also bury a bottle at the point of he departure from the lachlan mitchell search for it without success and learn afterwards that it have be break by the black on July 27th the party reach the bank of the castlereagh after fight they way through bog quagmire and all the difficulty common to virgin country during continue wet weather as the direction they be steer be towards a range see by evan and name arbuthnot range they march be again interrupt by find the new-found river this time run bank-high have evidently rise immediately after evan have cross it on he return journey here perforce they have to stay until the water subside and it be not until August 2nd that the river have fall enough to allow they to cross the ground be still soak and boggy and the horse have have to carry increase pack-load since the abandonment of the boat the party suffer great toil and hardship in they effort to gain arbuthnot range the range be reach however and round one end of it by skirt the base of a prominent hill which they name mount exmouth the harass explorer at last emerge upon splendid pastoral country as oxley from a commanding position survey the magnificent scene spread out beneath he -- gentle hill separate smile valley which in they turn merge into undulating plain all ripe for settlement -- he must have feel that fate have at length relent and grant he a measure of reward as the discoverer of this beautiful land he call the locality liverpool plain and the name have long be synonymous with pastoral prosperity they journey to the eastward which carry they through the heart of this rich and highly-favoured country be now less arduous and though the ground be still wet from the late soak rain the sun shine cheerily overhead and the horse revel in the abundant rich grass and succulent herbage begin to recover they strength on September 2nd they come to a river which oxley name the peel and here the expedition narrowly escape the shadow of a fatality one man be nearly drown whilst cross after leave the peel oxley still continue easterly traverse splendid open grazing country he be now approach the divide water-shed of the main range to the northward of that portion of it which be know at the present day as the liverpool range here the deep glen and gully with which the seaward front be serrated begin to interfere seriously with the direct course of travel and at the head of many of they there be cataract and waterfall which compel the wanderer to turn away to the south and on one occasion to revert almost to the west one of these striking natural feature receive the name of becket 's cataract and another be christen bathurst 's fall once again tempest and storm beset they and this wild weather find they wander amongst the steep ravine and dizzy descent of the mountainous range seek a way lead to the lowland it be on September 23rd that oxley and evan while search for a practicable route climb a tall peak and from the summit catch a glimpse of the sea it seem to have greatly impressed oxley and he write in he journal of he emotion on the occasion : -- bilboa 's ecstacy at the first sight of the south sea could not have be greater than ours when on gain the summit of this mountain we behold old ocean at we foot it inspire we with new life every difficulty vanish and in imagination we be already home the descent be attend with many peril : oxley say that at one period he would willingly have compromise for the loss of one-third of the horse to ensure the safety of the remainder but the man with he be try and steady and the thick tuft of grass and the loose soil afford they help in secure a surer footing of every chance of avail themselves of which the man skilfully take advantage so that both man and horse reach the foot of the mountain -- now call mount seaview -- without mishap they have reach the head of a river run into the pacific and proceed to follow its course down with more or less difficulty until they reach the mouth when oxley judge the entrance to be navigable name it port macquarie though one should imagine that he have become tired of that name the river be name the hasting on October 12th a toilsome march commence follow the shore to the southward the wearisome interruption of the many inlet and saltwater creek greatly fatigue and distressed he man but at last they come upon a boat half-buried in the sand which have be lose some time before from a hawkesbury coaster this they clean and patch and carry with they utilise it during the latter stage of this weary journey to facilitate the passage of the many saltwater creek and channel that impede they progress it be owe to the possession of this derelict boat that oxley cross the mouth of the manning without identify it as a river the black now harass they greatly and it be during one of the attack make upon the party that one of the man name william black be dangerously wound be spear through the back and the lower part of the body the care and conveyance of this invalided man be now add to oxley 's other anxiety and it be with feeling of great satisfaction that on November 1st they catch sight of the rude building of port stephen through much hardship and privation he have bring he party back without loss oxley send evan on to newcastle with despatch to the governor in which he allude to he sanguine anticipation at the time he have send in he last report and they almost immediate collapse but the discovery of liverpool plain compensate in some degree for the disappointment cause by the renew failure that have attend oxley 's effort to trace a inland river in the following year 1819 the lady nelson with the surveyor-general on board visit the newly find port macquarie and the hasting river to survey the entrance in which task he be assist by lieutenant pp king in the mermaid on he return to port jackson in the same year he make a short excursion to jarvi bay with surveyor meehan when they be accompany by the explorer who be to win fame as hamilton hume oxley return by boat he companion overland 34 the brisbane river it be in October 1823 that oxley leave sydney on the expedition that result in the finding of the brisbane river and the foundation of the settlement at moreton bay he be despatch on a mission to examine certain opening on the east coast and report on the suitability of they as site for penal establishment moreton bay port curti and port bowen be select and oxley leave in the colonial cutter mermaid with uniacke and stirling as assistant as the cutter go up the coast she call at port macquarie and oxley have the pleasure of note the rapid growth of the settlement that have be build upon he recommendation further along the coast oxley discover and name the tweed river the mermaid reach port curti on the 6th of November and cast anchor for some time during which oxley make a careful examination of the locality he opinion of it as a site for a settlement be decidedly unfavourable he however discover and name the boyne river it be consider too late in the season to proceed and examine port bowen the mermaid go south again and enter moreton bay anchor off the river that appear to flinder to take its source in the glass house peak and which he have call the pumice stone river they have scarcely anchor when several native be see at a distance evidently attract by they arrival and on examine they with the telescope uniacke be strike with the appearance of one of a much lighter color than that of he companion the next day oxley land and discover that the man they have notice be in reality a castaway white man of the name of pamphlet he tell a singular tale he have leave sydney in a open boat with three other intend to go to the five island and bring back cedar a terrible gale arise and they be blow out to sea and quite out of they reckoning pamphlet be under the impression that they have come ashore south of port jackson they have suffer fearful hardship in the open boat be at one time he aver twenty-one day without water during which time one man die of thirst the boat be at last cast up on a island in the bay -lrb- moreton island -rrb- where they have join the black and live amongst they ever since a matter of seven month the other survivor be name finnegan and parson pamphlet inform oxley that not long before the mermaid arrive the three of they have start to try and reach sydney overland but when they have get about fifty mile he have turn back and the next day have be rejoin by finnegan who state that he have quarrel with parson the latter be never hear of again finnegan put in a appearance the next day and oxley naturally take the opportunity to question they as to the knowledge they have gain of the surrounding country during they enforce stay in it on one important point both of they be confident and this be that in the southern portion of the bay a large river be to be find which appear navigable have a strong current take finnegan with they oxley and stirl start in the whaleboat the follow morning to verify this information they find the river and pull up it about fifty mile oxley be greatly please with such a discovery and landing ascend a hill which he name termination hill from the top he obtain a view over a wide extent of country through which he be able to trace the river for a long distance strangely enough the hasty glimpse he thus catch of a new and untrodden part of australium seem to confirm he fixed belief in the final destination of the lachlan and the macquarie as a inland sea the nature of the country and a consideration of all the circumstance connect with the appearance of the river justify I in entertain a strong belief that the source of the river will not be find in mountainous country but rather that it flow from some lake which will prove to be the receptacle of those inland stream cross by I during a expedition of discovery in 1818 oxley name the river the brisbane and take aboard the two rescue man the mermaid set sail for port jackson where she arrive on December 13th this end the chapter of oxley 's discovery in the field of active exploration chapter 4 hamilton hume -lrb- illustration hamilton hume in he later life -rrb- -lrb- map hume and hovell 's route 1824 sturt 's route 1829 and 1830 major mitchell 's route 1836 -rrb- 41 early achievement hamilton hume be the son of the reverend andrew hume who come to the colony with he wife in the transport lady juliana and hold a appointment in the commissariat department hamilton be bear in parramatta in the year 1797 on the 18th of June he seem to have be specially mark out by nature for prominence as a explorer for from he earliest boyhood he be fond of ramble through the bush and he father encourage he in he desire for a free country life and he love of adventure school facility be lack but fortunately he mother attend to he education and see to it that he do not grow up destitute of that instruction common to youth of those time and of he standing at the age of seventeen he make he initial effort at exploration in the country around berrima in company with he brother kennedy and a black boy they be successful in they endeavor and find some good pastoral country in the following year encourage by they success the brother make another excursion in 1816 a mr throsby buy some of the land that young kennedy and hamilton have find and they father send they out with he to show he the country he have purchase john oxley too hold a farm in the illawarra district and the surveyor-general who must have hear of hamilton 's repute for good bushmanship engage he to go out with he overseer and guide the man on to the locality governor macquarie also seem to have have he attention draw to the same conspicuous quality for he send young hume out with meehan a surveyor and throsby to examine the country about the shoalhaven river on the way however throsby disagree with meehan about the course they should adopt and take a black boy with he leave he companion and make the best of he way to port jervi meehan and hume carry out the work as originally decide on and then force they way up the range which have now seemingly be deprive of a great many of its original terror by the hardy pioneer of the coast on the highland they discover and name lake george a freshwater lake and a smaller one which they call lake bathurst both strange to say seemingly isolate here we may remark on the tenacity with which the murrumbidgee river long elude the eye of the white man it be scarcely probable that meehan and hume who on this occasion be within comparatively easy reach of the head water could have see a new inland river at that time without mention the fact but there be no record traceable anywhere as to the date of its discovery or the name of its finder when in 1823 captain currie and major oven be lead along its bank on to the beautiful maneroo country by joseph wild the stream be then familiar to the early settler and call the morumbidgee even in 1821 when hume find the yass plain almost on its bank he make no special mention of the river from all this we may deduce the extremely probable fact that the position of the river be show to some stockrider by a native who also confide the aboriginal name and so it gradually work the knowledge of its identity into general belief this theory be the more feasible as the river have retain its native name if a white man of any known position have make the discovery it would at once have receive the name of some person hold official sway but this be altogether a purely geographical digression it be while on this expedition that hume find the goulburn plain on another occasion he go with alexander berry a note south-coast pioneer up the shoalhaven river and accompany the party when they land and conduct different excursion by the time he reach manhood hume be justly class amongst the finest bushman in the colony in he after career when he lead the famous expedition to the south coast and again when as sturt 's right hand he accompany that explorer on the notable expedition that solve the mystery of the outflow of the inland river and give to settle australia the mighty darling he fully prove he right to the title 42 discovery of the hume or murray it be perhaps by he fame as leader of the party that cross from lake george to the southern ocean that hume 's name be best remember at that time especially it arouse anew the bright hope for the future of the interior that oxley 's gloomy prognostication have do so much to depress the surveyor-general have be unable to determine the question as to whether any large river enter the sea between cape otway and spencer 's gulf a somewhat hazardous idea enter the head of the then governor sir thoma brisbane to land a party of convict near wilson 's promontory and induce they by the offer of a free pardon and a grant of land to find they way back to sydney overland it be further propose that a experienced bushman should be put in charge of they the flattering offer of this responsible if somewhat precarious position be make to young hamilton hume who on mature consideration decline it he offer however to conduct a party from lake george to western port if the government would provide the necessary assistance this offer the authority accept but they forget the essential condition of furnish assistance naturally much delay and vexation be cause by this display of official ineptitude at this juncture a retire coast skipper captain william hilton hovell make a offer to join the party and find half the necessary cattle and horse this offer arouse the government to some sense of its responsibility and it agree to do something in the matter this something amount to six pack-saddle and gear one tent of parramatta cloth two tarpaulin a suit of slop clothes a-piece for the man and a order to hume to select 1200 acre of land for himself in addition the government generously grant the explorer two skeleton chart upon which to trace the route of they journey some bush utensil and promise a cash payment for the hire of the cattle should a important discovery be make this cash payment be refuse on they return although one would have think that the discovery of the hume -lrb- murray -rrb- should surely take rank as a important discovery hume also state that he have much difficulty in obtain tickets-of-leave for the man and the confirmation of he own order to select land for himself each of the leader bring with he three man so that the strength of the party be eight all tell they outfit of animal consist of five bullock and three horse and they have two cart with they hovell be bear at yarmouth on the 26th of April 1786 he arrive in sydney in 1813 but after be engage in the coast trade with occasional trip to new zealand he have relinquish he career as a sailor and have settle at narellan new south wale after he explore expedition with hume he settle down at goulburn and he die at sydney in 1876 on the 14th of October 1824 hume and hovell leave lake george reach the murrumbidgee they find that river flood and after wait three day for the water to fall they cross it bear on the body of one of they cart with the wheel detach and with the aid of the tarpaulin rig like a punt south of the murrumbidgee the country be break and difficult to traverse but it be well grassed and admirably adapt for grazing purpose as it become too rough for the passage of they cart these be abandon and the baggage and ration be pack on the bullock for the remainder of they journey after follow the course of the murrumbidgee for some day the traveller turn from its bank and pursue a south-westerly direction which lead they through hill and valley richly grass and plenteously endowed with run stream on the 8th of November they behold a sight rarely witness before by white man in australium ascend a range in order to obtain a view of the country ahead of they they suddenly find themselves confront with snow-capped mountain there under the brilliant sun of a australian summer 's day rise the white crest of lofty peak that might have find fitting surroundings amidst the chill splendor of some far southern clime robe as they be for nearly one-fourth of they height in glistening snow skirt this range which receive the name of the australian alp the explorer after wander for eight day across its many spur come upon a fine flow river which hume name after he father the hume this river be destine to be re-name the murray when its course be eventually follow to the ocean \* \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- see chapter 6 there be no safe ford a makeshift boat be construct with the aid of the serviceable tarpaulin and the hume be cross close to the site of the present town of albury still pass through good pastoral land water by numerous creek they cross a river which be name the oven and on the 3rd of December they come to another name by they the hovell but now call the goulburn and on the 16th of December they reach they goal the shore of the southern ocean at the spot where geelong now stand this expedition have a great and immediate influence on the extension of australian settlement within a few year after the chief surveyor have characterise the western interior beyond a certain limit as unfitted for human habitation and have express he opinion that the monotonous flat across which he vainly look for any elevation extend to the sea-coast snowy mountain feed the head tributary of perennial river have be discover to the southward of he track hume be exceptionally fit for the work of exploration at this particular juncture in colonial history bear and rear in the land he be well competent to judge justly of its merit and demerit he opinion be not likely to be taint by the prejudice form and nourish in other and different clime the history of australian exploration be then a statement of hasty conclusion form perhaps under certain climatic circumstance to be falsify on a subsequent visit when the condition be radically different in hume 's case there be no ill-founded conclusion of the availability of the freshly-discovered district the journey just record at once add to the british colonial empire million of acre of arable land water by never-failing river with a climate and altitude calculate to foster the growth of almost every species of temperate fruit or grain it be to be regret that the narration of a expedition fraught with so much benefit to the young colony and execute with so much courage endurance and facility of resource should be mar by any discordant note but friendly and genial relation be endanger by the presence of two independent leader divide authority here as it nearly always do cause petty and undignified squabble which be in later day elaborate into unseemly paper conflict it be painful if somewhat amusing to read of the acrid dispute as to the course under the very shadow of the majestic australian alp whose solitude have only then be first disturb by white man and how on agree to separate and divide the outfit it be propose to cut the only tent in two and how the one frying-pan be break by both

good education he father intend he for the law but he prefer gardening and obtain a position under mr aiton at kew in 1814 he go to brazil where he make large collection of dry specimen live plant and seed here he remain two year collect in the vicinity of rio the organ mountain san paolo and other part of brazil sir joseph bank write that he collection especially of orchid bromeliad and bulb do credit to the expedition and honor to the royal garden he be nominate for service in new south wale and land at port jackson on the 21st of December 1816 \* he first start collect about the present suburb of woolloomooloo in sydney which we may infer therefrom present a very different appearance from that which it now present he next go with oxley on he lachlan expedition on he return he commence the first of he five coastal voyage in which he accompany captain pp king around most of the continent of australium in the tiny cutter the mermaid of 84 ton they leave port jackson on the 22nd of December 1817 and sail round the south coast of australium to king george 's sound the west coast the north coast and finally to timor the mermaid return by the same route and anchor in port jackson on the 24th of July 1818 again on the 24th of December the mermaid leave port jackson on a short trip to tasmanium from which they return in February 1819 once more the busy little mermaid sail from sydney on the 8th of may 1819 to make a run survey of the east coast on this voyage many port hitherto unvisited be examine by king and amongst other place cunningham pay he first visit to the endeavor river continue the survey she round cape york cross the mouth of the carpentarium gulf and keep along the north coast where king find cambridge gulf at cassinus island the mermaid leave for timor and eventually return to sydney round the west coast of australium \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- for the accompany note of allan cunningham 's earlier lifework i be indebted to the biographical note concern allan cunningham compile by mr jh maiden director of the sydney botanical garden on the 14th of June 1820 the mermaid be again busy with king and cunningham on board and sailing up the east coast she re-visit the endeavor river during they stay cunningham ascend mount cook where he make a fine collection of seed and plant she coast north again and pick up the survey at cassinus island once more at careen bay where they have occasion to stay for some time cunningham be again very fortunate in he collection return homeward by way of the west and south coast the little cutter be almost wreck off botany bay the mermaid be now overhaul and condemn and in she place hm storeship dromedary re-christen the bathurst be place under the command of lieutenant king this be cunningham 's fifth voyage as collector with the same commander -- a very clear proof of they compatibility of taste and temperament as before the bathurst run round the east coast and resume she work on the north-west of australium while thus engage she be find to be in a dangerous condition and go to port loui to refit they sail from mauritius on the 15th of November and reach king george 's sound on the 24th of December here cunningham find that the garden he have be at great pain to form during he visit in 1818 have disappear altogether the bathurst stay some week on the south-west coast and then shape a course to port jackson where they arrive on the 25th of April 1822 of the botany of these coastal survey cunningham publish a sketch entitle a few general remark on the vegetation of certain coast of terra australi and more especially of its north-western shore 52 pandora 's pass let we now turn to he record as a inland explorer of australium on the 31st of march 1823 allan cunningham leave bathurst with two object in view one be he favorite pursuit of botany and the other the discovery of a available route to oxley 's liverpool plain through the range that bound it on the south a route which lawson and scott have vainly seek for the preceding year on reach the vicinity of the range he search in vain to the eastward for any opening that would enable he to pierce the barrier he then retrace he step and explore more to the eastward he come upon a pass through a low part of the mountain belt which he consider practicable and easy the valley lead to the pass he name hawkesbury vale and the pass itself pandora 's pass inasmuch as in spite of the hardship the party have be put to they have still hope to find it here cunningham leave a parchment document state that the information thereon contain be for the first farmer who may venture to advance as far to the northward as this vale the finding of the bottle which contain this scroll have never be record bathurst be reach on they return journey on June 27th in march 1824 he botanise about the head of the murrumbidgee and the monaro and shoalhaven gully and in September of the same year go north by sea with oxley to moreton bay to investigate that locality and pronounce on its suitability as a settlement site in march 1825 he leave parramatta thread the pandora pass once more and ascend to liverpool plain return to parramatta on the 17th of June in 1826 and the beginning of the following year he visit new zealand 53 the darling downs it be in the year 1827 that cunningham accomplish he most notable journey of exploration one which eventually throw open to settlement a entirely new area of country country destine to mould the destiny of the yet unborn colony of queensland and afford home for thousand of settler it be mainly by he exertion that the young community at moreton bay be able to stretch its grow limb to the westward immediately after its birth instead of wait long weary year and waste its strength against a impassable obstacle as have be the fate of the settlement at farm cove cunningham start from segenhoe a station on one of the head tributary of the hunter river whence he ascend the main range without any difficulty beyond have to unload some of the pack-horse during the steepest part of the ascent he have with he six man eleven horse and provision for fourteen week he leave civilisation or the outskirts of it on the 2nd of may and on the 11th he cross the parallel on which oxley have cross the peel river in 1818 and once beyond that point he be traverse unexplored country the land be suffer under a prolonged drought in that district and most of the stream encounter have but detach pool of water in they bed at one of which however he party catch a good haul of cod which be such ravenous biter and so heavy that several be lose in the attempt to land they travel through open forest land which be suffer more or less from the want of rain cunningham come on the 19th of may to a valley here on the bank of a creek he encamp on the most luxuriant pasture we have meet since we have leave the hunter we be not a little surprised he say to observe at this valley so remote from any farming establishment the trace of horn cattle only two or three day old as also the spot on which about eight to a dozen of these animal have repose from what point of the country these cattle have originally stray appear at first difficult to determine on consideration however it be think by no means impossible that they be straggler from the large wild herd that be well-known to be occupy plain around arbuthnot range this speak volume for the wonderful increase and spread of wild cattle in those day arbuthnot range first sight by evan in 1817 be already a acknowledged resort of wild cattle in seven year or it advertise the negligence of the stockman who guard the comparatively tiny herd of the period the dry weather have put its mark upon the country though the degree of aridity be much less than that afterwards experience in australium by the explorer of its interior nevertheless condition be sufficiently dry to compel the leader to exercise great forethought and cunningham determine to pursue a more easterly course keep nearer the crest of the range where he be more likely to find grass and water the country he pass through be inferior but on the 28th he come to the bank of a river present a handsome reach half-a-mile in length thirty yard wide and evidently very deep this river he name the dumaresque and it lead he to the northward through what he consider poor land until the new-found river take a easterly direction when the party leave it still keep north at the end of the month after pass through much scrubby country they be agreeably surprise to meet with a stream the bank of which present a appearance of great verdure it be a subject of great astonishment to we to meet with so beautiful a sward of grass permanently water by a active stream after traverse that tract of desert forest and penetrate brush the extreme of sterility in its immediate vicinity this be name mcintyre 's brook and cunningham write that they have some difficulty in ford it on account of its extreme rapidity the party continue on now in a north-easterly direction pass again through dense thicket such as they have formerly meet with on the 5th of June cunningham from a small elevation have a view of open country of decidedly favourable appearance : a hollow in the forest ridge immediately before we allow I distinctly to perceive that at a distance of eight or nine mile open plain or downs of great extent appear to extend easterly to the base of a lofty range of mountain lie south and north distant by estimation about thirty mile this be cunningham 's first glimpse of the now world-famous darling downs on reach the commencement of the great plain they come to the bank of a small river about fifteen yard in breadth have a brisk current to the north-west as there be deep water in the pool of this river the man anticipate some good fishing and they be not disappointed cunningham name this river the condamine although they provision be fail they cunningham remain for some time on the site of he new discovery fully impressed with the certainty of its immense importance in the future settlement of australium peel 's plain and canning downs be name by he and to the north-west beyond peel 's plain a immeasurable extent of flat country meet the eye on which not the slightest eminence could be observe to interrupt the common level which in consequence of the very clear state of the atmosphere could be discern to a very distant blue line of horizon cunningham 's far-seeing mind fathom the future requirement of such a vast agricultural and pastoral extent of country and he at once turn he attention to its natural means of communication with its obvious port moreton bay a lofty range of mountain to the east and north-east seem to offer a difficult barrier and he determine upon make a closer inspection as he horse be recruit all the time on the luxuriant herbage he do not so much regret they own scarcity of ration find a beautiful grassy valley which he name logan vale after captain logan the well-known commandant of moreton bay lead to the base of the principal range he proceed to make a nearer inspection after much climbing of successive tier or ridge he gain the loftiest point of a main spur and through some gap in the main range itself he be able to overlook portion of the country in the vicinity of moreton bay and even to recognize the cone of mount warn he take particular notice of one gap and on closer inspection he come to the conclusion that a line of road could be construct without much difficulty have spend a week on the downs and he shortness of provision and the weakness of he horse prevent any excursion to the western interior as he intention have be he set out on he homeward journey on the 18th of June in order to render he chart of the country traverse as complete as possible he keep a course about equidistant between the route of he outward journey and the coastal watershed he reach segenhoe on the 28th of July bring he man and horse back in safety after one of the most successful and important expedition on the east coast -lrb- illustration memorial to allan cunningham botanical garden sydney -rrb- in the following year accompany by he old companion fraser who have be one of oxley 's party on he two inland expedition cunningham proceed by sea to moreton bay with the intention of start from the settlement identify the gap he have take particular notice of and connect with he former camp on the downs in this attempt he be also accompany by captain logan but they be unsuccessful then cunningham again go from the outpost of limestone with three man and two bullock and be completely satisfy a road through this gap on to the darling downs be immediately construct and use until the introduction of railway communication : the opening be know far and wide as cunningham 's gap in may 1830 cunningham go to norfolk island while there he cross to the little islet adjoining know as phillip island have land with three man he send the boat back that night eleven convict escape seize the boat and be launch she when they be challenge by a sentry one of they reply that they be go for mr cunningham and they get away though they be fire upon they do go for mr cunningham and rob he of he chronometer pistol tent and provision then they sail away and be pick up by a whaler which they seize and finally scuttle the government refuse to compensate cunningham for he loss and he have to replace the instrument himself cunningham left sydney on the 25th of February 1831 on a visit to london where he spend nearly two year at kew return to sydney on the 12th of February 1837 he be appoint colonial botanist and superintendent of the botanic garden but do not retain the position very long be disgust to find that supply government official with vegetable be to be a chief part of he duty he resign and after another visit to new zealand whence he return in 1838 so ill be he that he be compel to decline to accompany captain wickham on he survey of the north-west coast he die of consumption on the 24th of

deathb the recommendation be adopt by governor darling and sturt embark on the career of exploration that be to render he name immortal it be ever sturt 's misfortune to be the sport of the season drought and its attendant desolation dog he footstep like a evil genius oxley have follow or attempt to follow the river down when a long period of recurrent wet season have saturate the soil fill the swamp and marsh and swollen the river-course so that they appear to be navigable throughout for boat sturt come at a period when the country lay faint under a prolonged drought and the river have dwindle down into dry channel with here and there a parched and meager water-hole the follow description of he be too often quote as depict the usual state of the australian interior : -- in the creek weed have grow and wither and grow again and young sapling be now rise in they bed nourish by the moisture that still remain but the large forest tree be droop and many be dead the emu with outstretched neck gasp for breath search the channel of the river for water in vain and the native dog so thin that he could hardly walk seem to implore some merciful hand to despatch he -lrb- map sturt 's route hume and hovell 's route 1824 -rrb- to sturt and he companion who be the first white man to face the interior during a season of drought the scene may not have seem too highly-coloured but in common with many of sturt 's graphic word-picture he description apply only to special or rare circumstance in 1828 no rain have fall for two year and even the dweller on the coastal land begin to despair of copious rainfall whenever they glance wander over they own dried-up pasture man 's thought naturally turn to that widespread and boundless swamp wherein the macquarie be lose to oxley 's quest and many see in the drought a favourable opportunity to discover the ultimate destination of these lose river a expedition to the west be accordingly prepare in order to solve the problem under these very different exist circumstance and sturt be select as leader to hamilton hume be offer the position of second in command and as the dry weather have bring all farm operation to a standstill he be able to accept it besides sturt and hume the party consist of two soldier and eight prisoner two of the latter be take to return with despatch as soon as they have reach the limit of the known country they also have with they eight ride and seven pack-horse and two draught and eight pack-bullock a small boat rig up on a wheel carriage be also take but like many other carry into the interior it never serve any useful purpose the country be by this time well-known and partly settle up to and below wellington vale but when sturt reach mount harri oxley 's former depot camp he have come to the verge of the unknown and halt in order to consider as to he immediate movement he consult with hume and as there seem to be no present obstacle to they progress it be determine as sturt write to close with the marsh this they do much sooner than be expect for at the end of the first day 's march they camp be set in the very midst of the reed a halt for a couple of day be make whilst sturt prepare he despatch to the governor on the 26th the two messenger be send off to bathurst and the progress of the party be resume before the day close they find themselves on a dreary expanse of flat and of desolate reed bed the progress of the main body be thus suddenly and completely check and sturt decide to launch the boat and with two man endeavor to trace the course of the river while hume and two other endeavor to find a open to the northward the boat voyage soon terminate for sturt be as completely baffle as oxley have be the channel cease altogether and the boat quietly ground sturt could do nothing but return to camp and await hume 's report all search for the lose river prove vain hume have find a serpentine sheet of water to the north which he be incline to think be the continuation of the elusive macquarie he have push on past it but have be check by another body of reed bed it be decide to shift camp to this lagoon and launch the boat once more but without result for the boat be haul ashore again after have vainly follow the suppose channel in amongst reed and shallows again the leader and he second go forward on a scout trip each take with they two man sturt go to the north-west and hume to the north-east they leave on the last day of December 1828 sturt toil on until after sunset he come to a northward-flowing creek in which there be a fair supply of water next day they course lay through plain intersect with belt of scrub and they discover another creek inferior to the last one both in size and the quality of the water they camp for a few hour on its bank and sturt call it new year 's creek but it be now know as the bogan river they be about to pass that night without water on the edge of a dry plain when one of the man have he attention draw to the flight of a pigeon and search find a puddle of rain water which barely satisfy they a isolate hill with perpendicular side which sturt have notice for some time now attract he attention as be a lofty point of vantage from which to get a extensive view to the west they accordingly make for it over more promising country they reach the hill which sturt call oxley 's tableland but from its summit he see nothing but a stretch of monotonous plain with no sign of the long-sought river that night they camp at a small swamp and the next morning turn back sturt agree with oxley but without as much reason that the space i traverse be unlikely to become the haunt of civilised man hume do not return until the day after sturt 's arrival he report that the castlereagh river must have suddenly turn to the north below where oxley cross it for he have be unable to find it he have go westward but have see nothing except far-stretching plain after a few aimless and unprofitable rambling they make they way again to oxley 's tableland and sturt and hume with two man make a journey to the west with only a negative result on the 31st of January they commence to follow down sturt 's new year 's creek and the next day to they unbounded surprise come upon the bank of a noble river from its size and width they judge they have strike it at a point as far from its source as from its termination but when the man rush tumultuously down the bank to revel in the water and quench they thirst they cry out with disgust and surprise that the water be salt poor sturt whose heart be bound with joy at the realisation of he fondest hope in this important discovery of a river which seem to answer all man 's dream and anticipation feel the sudden revulsion of despair one saving think he have and that be that they be close to its junction with the inland sea meantime although human track be to be see everywhere they see none of the aborigine hume at length find a pool of fresh water which provide they with water for themselves and they stock -lrb- illustration the darling river at sturt 's first view point photo by the reverend j milne curran -rrb- the long-continued absence of rain have lower the fresh water so that the supply from the brine spring on the bank predominate be the explanation of the saltness of the water but sturt do not know this and for six day the party move slowly down the river until the discovery of saline spring in the bank convince the leader that the saltness be of local origin still that do not supply they with the necessary drinking water and on the sixth day leave the man encamp at a small supply of fresh water sturt and hume push on to look for more but in vain and sturt be compel to order a retreat to mount harri this show how the exploration of the continent have ever be condition by the uncertainty of the season have sturt find the darling in a normal season he would probably have follow it down to its junction with the murray and the geographical system of the east would have be at once lay bare but it be not in such a simple manner that the great river basin be to become known toil privation and the sacrifice of human life have first to be suffer to the river which he have find sturt give the name darling in honor of the governor the return journey to mount harri continue without interruption at mount harri they expect to find fresh supplies but as they approach the place they could not restrain fear with regard to they safety the surround reed bed be in flame in all part the few native that be meet with display a guilty timidity and one be observe wear a jacket fortunately however they fear be groundless the relief party have arrive and have be await they return for about three week a attack by the native have be make but it have be easily repulse while sturt rest at mount harri hume strike off to the west beyond the reed he report the country as superior for thirty mile to any they have yet see but beyond that limit lay brushwood and monotonous plain on the 7th of march the party strike camp and depart for the castlereagh river they find that the flood stream impassable by oxley have totally disappear not a drop of water lay in the bed of the river they commence to follow its course down and the old harassing hunt for water have to be conduct anew no wonder that sturt could never free himself from the memory of he fiery baptism as australian explorer and that he mental picture of the country be ever shroud in the haze of drought and heat as they descend the castlereagh into the level lower country they be greatly delay by the many intricate winding of the river and its multiplicity of channel on the 29th of march they again reach the darling ninety mile above the place where they have first come upon it and they observe the same characteristic as before include the saltness this be a blow to sturt who have hope to find it free from salinity fortunately they be not distressed for fresh water at the time and know what to expect if the river be follow down again the party halted and form a camp the next day sturt hume and two man cross the river and make a short journey of investigation to the west to see what fortune hold for they further afield not have pass during the day a drop of water or a blade of grass they find themselves by mid-afternoon on a wide plain that stretch far away to the horizon sturt write that have there be the slightest encouragement afford by any change in the country he would even then have push forward but we have leave all trace of the native behind we and this seem a desert they never enter -- that not even a bird inhabit back to mount harri once more where they arrive on the 7th of April 1829 on they way they have stop to follow a depression first notice by hume and decide that it be the channel of the overflow of the macquarie marsh 63 the passage of the murray the mystery of the macquarie be now to a certain extent clear away but the course and final outlet of the darling now present another riddle which sturt too be destine to solve the discovery of such a large river as the darling augment by the macquarie and castlereagh and -lrb- so people then think -rrb- in all probability the lachlan naturally inflamed public curiosity as to the position of the outlet on the australian coast all the river that have be try as guide to the hidden interior have fail to answer the purpose the murrumbidgee -- the beautiful river of the aboriginal -- be select as the scene of the next attempt there be good reason for the choice : it derive its volume from the highest known mountain snow-capped peak in fact that remind the spectator of far northern latitudes and thus it be to a great extent independent of the variable local rainfall captain sturt be naturally select to be the leader of the murrumbidgee expedition and with he as second go george macleay the son of the then colonial secretary harri who have be sturt 's soldier-servant for nearly eighteen year and two other man of the 39th who have be with they captain on the macquarie expedition also accompany he with a very complete and well-furnished party include the usual boat rig up on a carriage this time however unlike the craft that have accompany previous explore party the whaleboat be destine to be immortalise in australian history settlement have by this time extend well up to and down the bank of the murrumbidgee and sturt take he departure from the border of civilisation about where the town of gundagaus now stand almost at the junction of the tumut river at whaby 's station the course for some time lay along the rich river-flat of the murrumbidgee the black who of course from they position be familiar with the presence of white man maintain a friendly demeanor one slight excursion to the north be make to connect with oxley 's furthest south make when on he lachlan expedition but though they do not actually verify the spot sturt reckon that he go within twenty mile of it show how narrowly that explorer have miss the discovery of the murrumbidgee as they get lower down the river they find themselves travel through the flat desolate country that remind they only too forcibly of late experience on the macquarie owe to some information glean from the native sturt and macleay ride north to try and again come upon the lachlan they strike a dry channel which sturt believe be the drainage from the lachlan into the murrumbidgee this prove to be correct as native afterwards testify that they have see the two white man actually on the lachlan on the 25th which be a intensely hot day macleay who be on ahead find himself suddenly confront with a boundless sea of reed and the river itself have suddenly vanish he send a mount messenger back to sturt with these disastrous tiding sturt thereupon turn the dray which be already in difficulty in the loose soil sharp round to the right and finally come to the river again where they camp to discuss the untoward circumstance at daylight the next morning sturt and macleay ride along its bank whilst clayton the carpenter be set to work fell a tree and digging a sawpit progress along the bank with the whole party be evidently impossible sturt however have faith in the continuity of the river and announce to macleay he intention to send back most of the expedition and with a pick crew to embark in the whaleboat commit they desperate fortune to the stream and trust to make the coast somewhere and leave they return in the hand of providence the more one regard this heroic venture the more sublime do it appear the whole of the interior be then a seal book and the river for aught sturt know might flow throughout the length of the continent but the voyage be commence with cool and calm confidence in a week the whaleboat be put together and a small skiff also build six hand be select for the crew and the remainder after wait one week in case of accident be to return to goulburn plain and there await event it would be as well to embody here the name of this band john harris hopkinson and fraser be the soldier choose and clayton mulholland and macmanee the prisoner the start be make at seven on the morning of January 7th the whale-boat tow the small skiff within about fifteen mile of the point of embarkation they pass the junction of the lachlan and that night camp amongst a thicket of reed the next day the skiff foul a log and sink and though it be raise to the surface and most of the contents recover the bulk of they be much damage fall and sunken log greatly endanger they progress but on the 14th they be hurry into a broad and noble river such be the force with which they be shoot out of the murrumbidgee that they be carry nearly to the opposite bank of the new and ample stream sturt 's feeling at that moment be to be envy and for once in a life chequer with much disappointment he must have feel that a great reward be grant to he in this crowning discovery he name the new river the murray after sir george murray the head of the colonial department as some controversy have of late arise as to the question of sturt 's right to confer the name we here quote he own word write after survey the hume in 1838 when i name the murray i be in a great measure ignorant of the other river with which it be connectedi want not to usurp a inch of ground or of water over which i have not pass on the bosom of the murray they could now make use of they sail which the contract space in the bed of the murrumbidgee have before prevent they from do the aborigine be see nearly every day and once when the voyager have to negotiate a very ticklish rapid some of they approach quite close and seem to take great interest in the proceedings sturt 's thought now turn towards the junction of the darling and at last he sight a desert camp on which the hut resemble those he have see on that river on the 23rd of January they come upon the junction at a very critical moment a line of magnificently-foliaged tree come into view among which be perceive a large gathering of black who apparently be incline to be hostile sturt who be at the helm be steer straight for they and make the customary sign of peace just before it be too late to avoid a collision sturt marked hostility in they quiver limb and battle-lusting eye he instantly put the helm a-starboard and the boat sheer down the reach the baffled native run and yell defiantly along the bank the river however be shoal rapidly and from the opposite side there project a sand-spit on each side of this narrow passage infuriate black have gather and there be no mistake they intention sturt give order to he man as to they behavior and hold himself ready to give the battle-signal by shoot the most active and forward of they adversary mention have be make of a small party of black who have be interested in the shooting of a rapid by the boat 's crew four of these savage have camp with the explorer the precede night leave at daylight in the morning sturt imagine that they have go ahead as peace delegate and he be thus most anxious to avoid a fight but the life of the whole party depend on prompt action be take and sturt 's eye be on the leader and he finger on the trigger when my purpose he say be check by macleay who call to I that another party of black have make they appearance on the left bank of the river turn round i observe four man at the top of they speed these be the dusky delegate and the description give by sturt of the conduct of the man who save the situation be very graphic : -- -lrb- illustration junction of the darling and murray river -rrb- the foremost of they as soon as he get ahead of the boat throw himself from a considerable height into the water he struggle across the channel to the sand-bank and in a incredibly short space of time stand in front of the savage against whom my aim have be direct seize he by the throat he push he backwards and force all who be in the water on the bank he tread its margin with a vehemence and a agitation that be exceedingly striking at one moment point to the boat at another shake he clenched hand in the face of the most forward and stamp with passion on the sand he voice that be at first distinct be lose in hoarse murmur this episode unequalled in the tradition of the australian aborigine remove the imminent danger and sturt 's tact in a few moment change the hundred of demented demon into a pack of laugh curious child a easy and common transition with the savage nature but for the intervention of this noble chief sturt and he follower pen within the boat in shallow water would have be massacre without a chance to defend themselves surround as they be by six hundred stalwart foe they fate save from unreliable native tradition would never have be know to they countryman during the crisis the boat have drift untended and ground on the sand while the man be hastily push she off they catch sight of a new and beautiful stream come apparently from the north a crowd of native be assemble on the bank of the new river and sturt pull across to they thus create a diversion amongst he erstwhile foe who swim after as he say like a parcel of seal after present the friendly native with some acknowledgement and refuse present to the other the pioneer examine the new river the bank be slope and well-grassed crown with fine tree and the man cry out that they have get on to a english river to sturt himself the moment be supreme he be convince that we be now sail on the bosom of that very stream from whose bank i have be twice force to retire they do not pull far up the stream for a native fishing-net be stretch across and sturt forbore to break it the union jack be however run up to the peak and salute with three cheer and then with a favor wind they bid farewell to the darling and the now wonderstruck native as they go on the party land occasionally to inspect the surrounding country but on all side from they low elevation they could see nothing but a boundless flat the skiff be now only a drag upon they it be break up and burnt for the sake of the ironwork on account of the damage to the salt pork cause by the sinking of this boat the strictest economy of diet have to be exercise and though a abundance of fish be catch they have become unattractive to they palate the continuation of the voyage down the course of the murray be henceforth a monotonous repetition of severe daily toil at the oar the native whom they encounter though friendly become a nuisance from the constant handling and embrace that the voyager have from purpose of policy to suffer unchecked the tribe meet with be more than ordinarily filthy and be disfigure by loathsome skin disease after twenty-one day on the water sturt begin to look most anxiously for indication of the sea for he man be fag with the unremitting labor and short ration and they have only the strength of they own arm to rely on for they return against the current soon however a old man amongst the native describe the roaring of the wave and show by other sign that he have be to the sea coast but more welcome than all be some flock of sea-gull that fly over and welcome the tired man on the thirty-third day after leave the starting-point on the murrumbidgee sturt on landing to inspect the country see before he the lake which be indeed the termination of the murray but not the end that he have dream of for the lake be evidently so little influence by tide that i see at once we probable disappointment of practical communication between it and the ocean this foreboding be realize after examination of lake alexandrina as it be now call upon ascertain they exact position on the southern coast nothing be leave but to take up the weary labor of they return the thunder of the surf bring no hopeful message of succor but rather warn the lonely man to hasten back while yet some strength remain to they sturt re-enter the murray on he homeward journey on the 13th of February and the successful accomplishment of this return be sturt 's greatest achievement he crew be indeed pick man but what other australian leader of exploration could have inspire they with such a deep sense of devotion as to carry they through they herculean task without one word of insubordination or reproach i must tell the captain to-morrow that i can pull no more be the utmost that sturt hear once when they think he asleep but when the morrow come the speaker stubbornly pull on three of these man it must be remember be convict yet despite they heroic conduct one only -lrb- clayton -rrb- receive a free pardon on they return though sturt do he utmost to win fuller recognition of they merit in such a work of generalisation as this space will not permit of a detailed account of the return voyage but on the 20th of march they reach the camp on the murrumbidgee from which they have start the relief party be not there and there be nothing left but to toil on though the man be fall asleep at the oar and the river itself rise and rage madly against they when they reach a point within ninety mile of the depot where sturt expect the relief party to be they land and two man -- hopkinson and mulholland -- go forward on foot for succor they be now almost utterly without food and have to wait six drag day before man arrive with dray and store to they aid one little item let I add the boat be no longer serviceable be burnt sturt give as a reason that he be reluctant to leave she like a log on the water what a priceless relic that boat would now have become sturt receive but scant appreciation on he return from this heroic journey he eyesight be impaired and he health be fail but instead of obtain much-needed rest he be send to norfolk island with a detachment of he regiment there the moist climate still further prejudice he health though he be able to quell a mutiny of the convict and to save norfolk island from fall into they hand governor darling too propose that sturt should be send as british resident to new zealand but fill with the love of continental exploration he would not leave australium to the satisfaction of the fossil of the colonial office who do not know of he and promptly appoint busby even sir g murray after whom the river have be name have never hear of the river in 1832 or a little later the temporary loss of the sight of one eye force he to go to england on leave when he also bid adieu to he regiment which be order to indium while in england he publish the first of he map and book but he eyesight totally fail he he retire from the army July 1833 sturt 's eyesight although never the same as before be gradually restore to he and on September the 21st 1834 he be marry at dover to charlotte greene we must now take leave of this distinguished man until he reappear in these page as a explorer of central australium \* \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- see chapter 12 chapter 7 sir thoma mitchell -lrb- illustration sir thoma mitchell -rrb- 71 introductory mitchell whose name both as explorer and surveyor-general loom large in we history be bear at craigend stirlingshire in 1792 he be the son of john mitchell of grangemouth and he mother be a daughter of alexander milne of carron work when he be but sixteen young mitchell join the army of the peninsula as a volunteer three year later he receive a commission in the 95th regiment or rifle brigade he be employ on the quartermaster general 's staff at military sketch and he be present in the field at ciudad rodrigo badajoz salamanca the pyrenee and st sebastian after the close of the war he go to spain and portugal to survey the battlefield he receive promotion to a lieutenancy in 1813 he serve in the 2nd 54th and 97th regiment of foot and be promote to be captain in 1822 and major in 1826 he appointment as surveyor-general of new south wale as successor to john oxley take place in 1827 when he at once assume office and start energetically to lay out and construct road then the urgent need of the new colony he strong personality and the energy and thoroughness he display in all he undertaking combine with he many gift as draughtsman surveyor and organizer prove to be of peculiar service to the colony at that period of its existence there be a vast unknown country surround the settle part await both discovery and development and mitchell 's inclination and talent be strongly direct towards geographical discovery the office of surveyor-general that he hold for so long be the most appropriate and advantageous appointment that could have be give he in the interest of the colony at the same time major mitchell have fault which have always detract from the estimation in which he would otherwise be hold for he undoubted capability he domineering temper lead he into act of injustice and often make it impossible for he to allow the judgment of other to influence he opinion in he view no other explorer but himself ever achieve anything worthy of commendation or propound any credible theory regard the interior of australium he always refer slightingly to sturt cunningham and leichhardt and he perversity on the subject of the junction of the darling and the murray draw even from the gentle sturt a richly-deserved and unanswerable retort on he second expedition which be suppose to establish the identity of the darling with the junction see by sturt mitchell excuse himself from further exploration of the lower darling as he express himself satisfy that sturt 's supposition be justified but later when on he expedition to what be now the state of victorium he again fall into a doubt mood and he be not finally convince until he have re-visit the junction this constant doubt at last rouse sturt who speak in 1848 of mitchell 's work say : in due time he come to the dispute junction which he tell we he recognize from its resemblance to a drawing of it in my first work as i have since be on the spot i be sorry to say that it be not at all like the place because it oblige I to reject the only praise sir thoma mitchell ever give I sturt 's original sketch of the junction have be lose and sturt who be nearly blind at the time of publication obtain the assistance of a friend who draw it from he verbal description 72 the upper darling rumor of a mysterious river call the kindur which be say on no better authority than a runaway convict 's to pursue a north-west course through australium now begin to be noised about this convict whose name be clarke but who be generally know as the barber say that he have take to the bush in the neighborhood of the liverpool plain and have follow down a river which the native call the gnamous he cross it and come next to the kindur this he follow down for four hundred mile before he come upon the junction of the two the union of the two form a broad navigable river which he still follow although he have lose he reckoning and do not know whether he have travel five hundred or five thousand mile one thing however he be convince of and that be that he have never travel south of west he assert that he have a good view of the sea from the mouth of this most desirable river and have see a large island from which so the native report there come copper-coloured man in large canoe to take away scented wood the kindur run through immense plain and past a burning mountain as no one have invite he to stay in this delectable country he have return the story which bear every evidence of have be invent to save he back receive a certain amount of credence and sir patrick lindesay then acting-governor give the surveyor-general instruction to investigate the truth of it it be in this way that mitchell 's first expedition originate on the 21st of November 1831 mitchell leave liverpool plain and reach the namous on the 16th December he cross it and penetrate some distance into a range which he name the nundawar range he then turn back to the namous and set up some canvas boat which he have bring to assist he in follow the river down the boat be of no use for the purpose one of they get snag immediately and it be clear that it would be easier to follow the river on land as the range be not easy of ascent he work he way round the end of it and come on to the lower course of cunningham 's gwydir which he follow down for eighty mile at this point he turn north and suddenly come to the largest river he have yet see mitchell ever on the alert to bestow native name on geographical feature -- a most praiseworthy trait in he character and through the absence of which in most other explorer australian nomenclature lack distinction and often euphony -- enquire of the name from the native and find it to be call the karaulum be this or be this not the nebulous kindur the answer could be supply only by trace its course but its general direction and the discovery and recognition of its junction with the gwydir show that the karaulum be but the upper flow of sturt 's darling much disappointed for mitchell be intent upon the discovery of a new river system have a northerly outflow he prepare to make a bold push into the interior before he start finch he assistant-surveyor arrive hurriedly on the scene with a tale of death finch have be bring up supplies and during he temporary absence he camp have be attack by the native the cattle disperse the supplies carry off and two of the teamster murder all idea of further penetration into the new country have to be abandon mitchell be compel to hasten back bury the body of the victim and after a ineffective quest for the murderer return to the settle district the journey however have not be without good result knowledge of the darling have be considerably extend and it be now show to be the stream receive the outflow of the river whose higher course cunningham have discover the beginning of the great river system of the darling may be say to have be thus place among proven datum mitchell himself afterwards show himself a untiring and zealous worker in solve the identity of the many ramification of this system 73 the passage of the darling he next journey be undertake to confirm the fact of the union of the darling and the murray sturt himself be fully convince that he have see the junction of the two river when on he long boat voyage but he have not convert every one and mitchell with a large party be despatch to settle the question and make a systematic survey early in march 1833 the expedition leave parramatta to proceed by easy stage to the head of the bogan river which have be partly traverse the year before by surveyor dixon it be during this expedition that richard cunningham brother of allan be murder by the native he have not be long in australium and have be appoint botanist to the

country in a different condition from that present by it when sturt and hume first discover the river at nearly the same place the water be now fresh and sweet to drink and the flat and bank luxuriant

darling be now alive with native and though a sort of armed truce be keep up it be at the cost of constant care and watchfulness and the tactful submission to numerous annoyance include much petty pilfer the boat prove to be of no service and after mitchell with a small party have make a short excursion down the river to the farthest limit of sturt and hume in 1829 where he see the tree then mark by hume hh he have the camp dismantle and start with the whole party to follow the river down to its junction with the murray by the 11th of July one month after leave fort bourke they have trace the river for three hundred mile through a country of level monotony unbroken by any tributary river or creek of the least importance mitchell be now certain from the steadfast direction the river maintain and the short distance that now intervene between the lowest point they have reach and sturt 's junction that sturt have really be correct in he surmise and that he have witness the meeting of the river on that memorable occasion he therefore decide that to keep on be but needlessly endanger the life of he man he be constantly keep in a state of anxiety for the safety of any member of the party whose duty compel he to separate from the main body for the native who have become doubly bold through familiarity be now persistently encroach and rapidly assume a defiant manner on the very day that mitchell have make up he mind to retreat the long threaten rupture take place mitchell refer to the black of this region as the most unfavourable specimen of aborigine that he have yet see barbarously and implacably hostile and shamelessly dishonest on the morning of July 11th two of the man be engage at the river and five of the bullock-driver be collect they cattle one of the native nick-named king peter by the man try to snatch a kettle from the hand of the man who be carry it and on this action be resent he strike the man with a nulla-nulla stretch he senseless he companion shot king peter in the groin and he majesty tumble into the river and swam across the swarm of native who be constantly loitering around the camp gather together and advance in a armed crowd threaten the man who fire two shot in self-defence one of which accidentally wound a woman alarm by the shot three man from the camp come to the assistance of they mate and one native be shoot just when he be about to spear a man the black now draw back a little and the man seize the opportunity to warn the bullock-driver whom they find occupy in lift a bullock that have fall into a bog they arrival probably save they life as the bullock driver be unarmed no further attack take place but the strictest watch have to be keep until the party be ready to begin the return journey or to beat a retreat as the native regard it they reach fort bourke without further molestation the aborigine be content with have drive away the whites who retrace they step from fort bourke to bathurst the geographical knowledge gain on this journey consist mainly in the confirmation of tentative theory -- the identity of the karaulum with the darling and the uninterrupted course of the latter river southwards as major mitchell himself have to confess into the murray furthermore it seem now satisfactorily settle that all the inland river as yet discover find the same common embouchure mitchell 's experience too prove that the pastoral country through which the darling run be by no means unfit for habitation nor be the river a salt one true some of he man have notice that the water be brackish in place but this brackishness it be see have a purely local origin mitchell be a keen observer of the habit and custom of the aborigine he be remarkably quick at detect tribal difference and distinction and he record of he intercourse with they -- which occupy so much of he journal -- be most interesting then when little have be write on the subject and be even more valuable now as a first-hand account by a intelligent man and a practice observer of the appearance of the native at the time of earliest contact with the white man 74 australium felix one would have think that the fact of the union of the darling and the murray be now sufficiently well-established but the official mind deem otherwise when the surveyor-general 's next expedition start in march 1836 he be inform that the survey of the darling be to be complete without any delay that have return to the point where he last journey have come to a end he be to trace the river right into the murray -- see the water of the two mingle in fact -- then to cross over the murray and follow up the southern bank recross and regain the settle district at yass plain although the primary object of the expedition be the verification of previous discovery the program be largely depart from and this particular journey of mitchell 's lead to the open up and speedy settlement of what be now the state of victorium a drought long-continued and severe be in full force when mitchell commence he preparation for departure consequently bullock and horse in suitable condition be hard to obtain but as the government spare no expense the necessary animal be at last available though upon reach bathurst mitchell be inform that the lachlan river be dry he start on he third explore expedition in the best of spirit he mind overflow with old memory and association and he write in he journal that this be the anniversary of the day when he march down the glaci of st elva to the tune of st patrick 's day in the morning as the sun rise over the beleaguered tower of badajoz he have hear that the aborigine of the lower murray have be inform of he approach and that they have assure the other tribe that they be gather murry coolah -- very angry -- to meet he but this to one of the major 's temper lend but a add zest to the journey for there be old score to settle on both side it be the 17th of march 1836 before he get free of the cattle station and find himself at the point where oxley have finally leave the river he notice that throughout this route in spite of the dry weather the cattle be all in good condition and he find oxley 's swamp and marsh transmute into grassy flat in fact so change be the face of the land that even the landmark of that explorer could scarcely be recognize again he mind begin to be trouble with doubt as to whether he have not acknowledge the veracity of sturt 's judgment too hastily for we find in he journal that he again waver after profess that the identity admit of little doubt now on the lachlan he revert to he old idea that the darling drain a separate and independent basin of its own he write : -- i consider it necessary to ascertain if possible and before the heavy part of we equipage move further forward whether the lachlan actually join the murrumbidgee near the point where mr oxley see its water cover the face of the country or whether it pursue a course so much more to the westward as to have be mistake for the darling by captain sturt impel by this doubt he undertake a long excursion to the westward with no result but the discomfort of several thirsty night and a unchanging outlook across a level expanse of country bound by a unbroken horizon he reach oxley 's furthest on the 5th of may but do not find that explorer 's marked tree though he find other mark by oxley 's party with the date 1817 on the 12th of may he halt on the bank of the murrumbidgee which in he opinion surpass all the other australian river he have yet see as he order be simply to clear up the last hazy doubt that wrap the murray and darling junction and then to visit the southern bank of the murray he do not take he heavy baggage on to the darling but form a stationary camp on the murrumbidgee and thence go on with a small party when they come to the murray they find they old enemy awatch for they it be afterwards ascertain that many of these aborigine have travel as far as two hundred mile to assist in chase back the white intruder once more from they violate hunting-grounds but these brave of the darling do not yet understand the nature of the man they seek to intimidate at first a nominal peace prevail and for two day the black follow the expedition closely seek to cut off any straggler and render the out-roving work of mind and collect the cattle and horse one of considerable risk mitchell be soon convince that a sharp lesson be necessary to save he man in the event of lose any of he party he would have have to fight he way back with the warrior of what seem a thickly-populated district array against he one morning therefore the party be divide and half of they send back to a ambush in the scrub the native be allow to pass on in close pursuit of the advance party the native dog however scented this ambuscade and after they fashion warn the black of the presence of the hidden whites as they halt and begin handle and poise they spear one of the ambush man fire without order and the other follow he example the native falter and those in advance hear the firing rush back eager to join in the fray the conflict be short and decisive the over-confident fight man of the darling lose seven of they number and be drive ignominiously back into the murray scrub and across that river henceforth the explorer be unmolested these pugnacious aboriginal be the same that have threaten to bring sturt 's boat voyage to a tragical conclusion and soon after mitchell 's exploration they wage a determine war against the early overlander and they stock mitchell 's way to the darling be now clear and on the 31st of may he come upon that river a short distance above the confluence trace the stream upward he again convinced himself that it be the same river that he have be on before and satisfy of this he turn and proceed right down to the junction itself and finally disposed of one of the most interesting problem in australian exploration he naturally feel much anxiety after he late skirmish for the safety of the stationary camp he have leave behind and have lose no time during he return he be relieve to find he camp in quiet and safety the surveyor-general first map the exact junction of the murrumbidgee and murray and then transfer the whole of the expedition in boat to the other side of the murray thus be commence the investigation of the unexplored side of the murray that above its junction with the murrumbidgee in other word the hume proper on the 30th of June the party camp at swan hill have find the country traverse to exceed expectation in every way this please state of affair continue and mitchell journey on without check or hindrance after find the loddon river on the 8th of July and the avoca on the 10th he alter he preconceived plan to follow the main river up and draw by the beauty and pastoral advantage of this new territory he strike off to the south-west in order to examine it in detail and trace its development southwards more and more convinced that he have find the garden of australium -- he afterwards name this region australia felix -- mitchell keep steadily on until he come to the wimmera that deceptive river which afterwards nearly lure eyre to a death of thirst on the last day of July he discover the beautiful glenelg and launch he boat on its water at the outset he be stop by a fall be compel to take to the land once more and proceed along the bank occasionally cross to examine the other side on the 18th the boat be again use the river be much broader and in two day he reach the coast a little to the east of cape northumberland the whole expedition then move homewards and reach portland bay where they find that the henty family from van dieman 's land have be establish on a farm for about two year from they mitchell receive some assistance in the way of necessary supplies and then resume he journey for home on the 19th the party separated mitchell push ahead leave stapylton he second to rest the tired animal for a while and then to follow slowly on he homeward way mitchell ascend mount macedon and from the summit see and identify port phillip he return with he glowing report of the splendid country he have discover -- country fit for the immediate occupation of the grazier and the farmer -- at once stimulate its settlement and as the man whose exploration be of immediate benefit to the community in general -- mitchell 's name stand first on the roll of explorer 75 discovery of the barcoo some year elapse before mitchell -- now sir thoma -- again take to the field of active exploration the settlement of the upper darling and the darling downs have cause numerous speculation as to the nature of the unknown territory comprise the northern half of australium in 1841 communication have pass between the governor and captain sturt and in December of the same year eyre not long return from he march round the great bight write offer he service provide that no prior claim have be advance by sturt governor gipp ask for a estimate of the expense but consider eyre 's estimate of five thousand pound too high and nothing further be do in 1843 sir thoma mitchell submit a plan of exploration to the governor who consult the legislative council the council approve it and vote one thousand pound towards expense the governor refer the matter to lord stanley whose reply be favourable but the project still hang fire in 1844 eyre again write offer to make the journey at a much more reasonable rate but he offer be however decline as mitchell 's proposal hold the field in 1845 the fund be increase to two thousand pound and sir george gipp order the surveyor-general to make he preparation mitchell favor the search for a practicable road to the gulf of carpentarium and hope also that he would at last find he long-sought northern-flowing river in a letter which he then receive from a well-known grazier walter bagot there be mention of a aboriginal description of a large river run northward to the west of the darling but as native in they description frequently confuse flow to and flow from they probably have cooper 's creek in mind during the earlier part of the year commissioner mitchell the son of sir thoma who be afterwards drown during a passage to newcastle have make a fly survey towards the darling and the discovery of the narran balonne and culgoa river have be attribute to he on the 15th of December 1845 mitchell start from buree with a very large company include eb kennedy as second in command and w stephenson as surgeon and collector he strike the darling much higher than fort bourke and it be not until he be across the river that he pass the outermost cattle-station which have spring rapidly into existence since he last visit to the neighborhood the narran be then follow up until the balonne be reach this river in he superlative style mitchell pronounce to be the finest in australium with the exception of the murray he then strike and follow the culgoa upward until it divide into two branch he skirt the main one which retain the name of the balonne on the 12th of April he come to the natural bridge of rock which he call st george 's bridge and which be the site of the present town of st george here a temporary camp be form kennedy be leave in charge to bring the main body on more slowly mitchell with a few man go ahead he follow up the balonne to the maranoa but as the little he see of that tributary do not tempt he to further investigation of it he keep on he course up the main stream until he reach the junction of a stream which he name the cogoon this riverlet lead he on into a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stand a solitary hill that he name mount abundance it be in he description of this region in he journal that we first find a allusion to the bottle tree the party wander on over a low watershed and come down out on to a river which from its direction and position he surmise to be the maranoa the stream he have not follow at this new point it be full of deep reach of water and drain a tract of most please land on its bank he determine to await kennedy 's arrival kennedy overtake he on the 1st of June bring from sir thomas 's son roderick despatch which have reach the party after the leader 's departure amongst other item of news in the despatch be the report of leichhardt 's return and of the hearty reception that he have be accord in sydney one piece of random information a mere floating newspaper surmise but enough to arouse mitchell 's suspicious temper annoy he greatly we understand it run the intrepid dr leichhardt be about to start another expedition to the gulf keep to the westward of the coast range as this seem to indicate a intention of trespassing on mitchell 's present field of operation he naturally feel some resentment not likely to be allay by such a paragraph as the following : australium felix and the discovery of sir thoma mitchell now dwindle into comparative insignificance again leave kennedy he set out to make a very extended excursion traverse the country from the head of the maranoa he discover the warrego river keep north over the watershed for a time he fondly imagine that he have reach northward-flowing water but the direction of the river that he find the claude and the nogoa soon convinced he of he error and that he be on river of the east coast even when he have reach the belyando a river which he name and follow down for a short distance he still delude himself that he have reach inland water intensely mortify at find that he be on a tributary of the burdekin and approach the ground already trodden by leichhardt he return to the head of the nogoa once more subdivide he party and form a stationary camp to await he return from a westward trip this time however he be bless with the most splendid success he find the barcoo a river that seem to he to promise all he seek for the direction of its upper course easily lead he to believe that it be a affluent of the gulf of carpentarium and after trace it for some distance he return to camp the newly-discovered river he name the victorium think it would prove to be the same as that find by captain stoke on he survey expedition it be on the barcoo or victorium that mitchell first notice the now famous grass that bear he name on they return journey they follow down the maranoa and at the old camp at st george 's bridge they be tell by the native that white man have visit the place during they long absence it be a singular and welcome feature of mitchell 's discovery that they have always prove to be adjacent to civilisation and to be suitable for immediate occupation the discovery of the barcoo be the last feather in the cap of the surveyor-general he be doom to learn soon that it be not the river of he dream but only the head water of that central stream discover by sturt cooper 's creek but meanwhile the delusion must have be very gratifying in 1851 mitchell be send out to report on the bathurst goldfield and on a subsequent visit to england he take with he the first specimen of gold and the first diamond find in australium he be for a short time one of the member for the port phillip electorate but resign as he find faithful discharge of the duty to be incompatible with he office he patent the boomerang screw propeller and be the author of many educational and other work include a translation of the lusiad of camoen although a strict martinet in he official duty and subject to a choleric temper he be strenuous in he devotion to the advancement of australium among whose maker he must always occupy a proud position he die on the 5th of October 1855 at carthona he private residence at darling point sydney new south wale he wife be a daughter of colonel blount chapter 8 the early forty 81 anga mcmillan and gippsland anga mcmillan who be the discoverer of what be now so widely-known as gippsland in victorium be a manager of the currawang station in the maneroo district on the 20th of may 1839 he start from the station on a trip to the southward to look for new grazing land he have with he but one black boy name jimmy gibbu who claim to be the chief of the maneroo tribe so that if the party be small it be very select on the fifth day mcmillan get through to the country water by the buchan river and from the summit of a elevation which he call mount haystack he obtain a most satisfactory view over the surrounding region the next night mcmillan awaken by a noise find jimmy gibbu bend over he with a nulla-nullum in he hand fortunately mcmillan 's pistol be within easy reach and present it at jimmy 's head he compel he to drop the nulla-nullum and to account for he suspicious attitude jimmy confess to a fear of the warrigal or wild black of that region to acute home-sickness and to a general unwillingness to proceed further mcmillan examine the country he have find and have judge it to be very desirable pastoral land he return home he then form a new station for mr macalister on some country he have find on the tambo river and go himself on another trip of discovery this time he have four companion with he two friend name cameron and matthew a stockman and a black boy they follow the tambo river down its course through fine grazing country both plain and forest until in due course it lead they to the point of its embouchure in the lake of the south coast he name lake victorium and then direct he course to the west where he discover and name the nicholson and mitchell river he be so deeply impressed with the resemblance of the country he have just be over to some part of scotland that he call the district by the now obsolete name of caledonium australi on January the 23rd 1840 he be out again and discover and name the macalister river and push on as far west as the la trobe river this addition of rich pastoral region to the already settle district be altogether due to anga mcmillan 's energy and be now know as gippsland be name officially after sir george gipp the governor who have the amusing eccentricity of insist that all the town lay out during he term of office should have no public square include within they boundary be convince that public square encourage the spread of democracy 82 count strzeleckus count strzeleckus 's expedition through gippsland with the discovery of which district he be commonly and wrongly credit be due to the literary and geographical work he have undertake as he be gather material for he well-known work the physical description of new south wale victorium and van dieman 's land he ascend the south-east portion of the main divide range and name the highest peak thereof kosciusko after a fancied resemblance in its outline to that polish patriot 's tomb at cracow on the 27th of march 1840 he reach the cattle station on the tambo whither mcmillan have just return and be direct by he on to he newly-discovered country strzeleckus push through to western port meeting with some scrubby and almost inaccessible country during the last stage of he journey he party have to abandon both horse and pack and fight its way through a dense undergrowth on a scanty ration of one biscuit and a slice of bacon per day vary with a occasional native bear it be here that the count who be a athletic man find that he hardy constitution stand the party in good stead so weakened and exhaust be he companion that it be only by constant encouragement that he urge they along at all when force they way through the mat growth of scrub he often throw himself bodily upon it break a path for he weary follower by the mere weight of he body it be in a wretched condition that they at last reach western port 83 patrick leslie in 1840 patrick leslie who have always be consider the father of settlement on the darling downs start with stock from a new england station then the most northerly settle district in new south wale and form the first station on the condamine river actually before that river have be identify as a tributary of the darling there be a general impression that the condamine flow north and east and finally find its way through the main range to the pacific in 1841 stuart russell who closely follow leslie as a pioneer follow the river down for more than a hundred mile to the westward and in the following year it be trace still further and the darling generally accept as its final destination 84 ludwig leichhardt -lrb- illustration ludwig leichhardt -rrb- leichhardt be the franklin of australium around whose name have ever cling a tantalising veil of mystery and romance truth to tell he claim as a lead explorer rest solely on he first and undoubtedly fruitful expedition but for he mysterious fate mention of he name would not stir the heart of man as it do have he return from he final venture beat it must have be to live through the remainder of he life a disappointed and embittered man far better for one of he temperament to rest in the wilderness he grave unknown but he memory revere leichhardt be bear at beskow near berlin and study at berlin through a oversight he be omit from the list of those liable to the one year of military service and the sweet of exemption tempt he to evade the three-year military course the consequence be that he be prosecute as a deserter and sentence in contumaciam afterwards alexander von humboldt succeed by describe he service to science on he first expedition in australium in obtain a pardon from the king by a cabinet order leichhardt receive permission to return to prussia unpunished when the order arrive in australium he have already start on he last expedition dr leichhardt appear to have be a man whose character to judge from he short career be largely compose of contradiction and inconsistency eager for personal distinction with high and noble aim he yet lack that ready sympathy and feeling of comradeship that attract man leichhardt 's follower never desire to accompany he on a second expedition yet strange to say he be capable of inspiring firm friendship in such man as william nicholson and lieutenant robert lynd when he leave on he first explore expedition on which he be successful owe to the luck of the novice people generally predict -- and with much reason -- that he would fail but when he set out on he second and disastrous journey universally applaud and with he name on everybody 's lip it be never doubt but that he would succeed -lrb- map leichhardt 's route 1844 and 1845 mitchell 's route 1845 and 1846 and kennedy 's route 1847 and 1848 -rrb- on he first expedition he be insufficiently equip have but inexperienced man with he and be a bad bushman himself in fact the journal of the trip read to a man accustom to bush life like the fable of the babe in the wood yet he manage to blunder through on he second expedition he be amply provide and most of he companion be experienced man but it prove a miserable fiasco he great confidence in himself lead he to ignore or undervalue the fact patent to other that he be no bushman either by instinct or training and he seem to prefer for companion man like himself who could not detect this fail as be evident from a letter write by he to w hull of melbourne with reference to a young man who be anxious to join he party in this letter he enumerate the quality that he consider necessary in a follower : -- activity good humor sound moral principle elasticity of mind and body and perfect willingness to obey my order even though give harshlyus have be extremely unfortunate in the choice of my former companion the last remark be a unworthy one and of course apply to the companion of he second expedition he do not include a knowledge of open-air life amongst he qualification nor the needful bushmanship and apparently in leichhardt 's opinion a useless man of good moral principle would be as acceptable to a explorer as a good bushman of doubtful morality it cause one to inquire whether the devoted man who toil for sturt private soldier and prisoner of the crown be man of sound moral principle this extract afford a insight into leichhardt 's failure he want only those man who would blindly and ignorantly obey and believe in he for a man of leichhardt 's temperament such man be not to be find : he have miss the fairy gift at birth -- all the essential of good leadership stuart russell in he genesis of queensland cite he shrewd old stockman 's opinion of dr leichhardt as he be just before he first trip the station from which leichhardt start on that occasion be near russell 's so that the man speak from personal knowledge : it be my belief that if dr leichhardt do it at all ` twill be more by good luck than management why sir he have not get the knack of some of we why it come like mother 's milk to some i can not tell how or why but it do mark my word sir dr leichhardt have not get it in he and never will have two invaluable quality in a explorer apart from he scientific attainment leichhardt possess these be courage and determination necessary no doubt but not sufficient in themselves to carry through a expedition to success he lack tact and be deficient in practical knowledge of the bush and especially in what be know as bushmanship one fix idea of he be that in dry country if one can only keep on far enough one be bind to come to water : a theory plausible enough if it could be carry out to its logical conclusion but the application of which often involve a physical impossibility and it must be take into consideration that leichhardt have never travel in the dry country of the interior but that what small experience he possess have be gain on the fairly well-watered coast he assert in he journal that cattle and horse trust entirely to the sense of vision for find water and not to the sense of smell the exact reverse be of course the case the character of the lose explorer will thus be see to have militate strongly against he success when he come to be pit against the -- to he -- unknown danger of a dry season in the far interior but he fatal self-confidence lead he to challenge the desert think that he must succeed where better man have be deny even the hope of success when he last expedition come to be review a more detailed discussion of the probability of a successful issue to it will be make poor leichhardt with all he mood and caprice it would have be strange if he have not show some appreciation of humor let we quote he description of he sudden and unexpected arrival in sydney after the port essington expedition we do come to sydney it be quite dark we do go ashore and then i think to see my dear friend lynd so i go up george street to the barracks and then i go to he quarter to he window he be dress himself i do put in my head he do jump out of the other window and i stand there wonder soon many people do come round and do look oh so timid i do not know all and there be such a greet i be dead and be alive again i be lose and be find but in thus review leichhardt 's aptitude -- or rather inaptitude -- for the work and comment upon he shortcoming we must do he the fullest justice by pay homage to the sincerity of he belief in himself and he mission in that belief he be honestly loyal he conception of he duty be of the highest and in its interest he would and do make every sacrifice in he power if some prescient tongue could have tell leichhardt that the end of he quest would be a unknown death he would have accept the fate without a murmur provide he death benefit geographical discovery as the man of science in a party under a capable leader leichhardt would have achieve greater success than many man who have fill that position as the leader himself he be of necessity a absolute failure leichhardt arrive in new south wale in 1842 and after some botanical excursion about the hunter river district he travel overland to moreton bay and there occupy himself with short expedition in the neighborhood pursue he favorite study of physical science when the subject of the exploration of the north be moot he be desirous of secure the position of naturalist but the delay in form the project expedition disappoint he and he resolve to try and organise a private one in this he receive very little encouragement he persevere however and eke out he own resource by means of private contribution both in money and stock he manage to get a party together on the 1st of October 1844 he leave jimbor station on the darling downs on the trip that be destine to make he name as a explorer he preparation be on a much smaller scale than mitchell 's consider the importance of the undertake he party be absurdly small he have with he six white and two black man seventeen horse sixteen head of cattle and four kangaroo dog and he supply of provision be equally meager he plan of start from moreton bay to port essington differ considerably from mitchell 's propose journey to the gulf from fort bourke but although longer and more roundabout it would be a safer route for he little party to adopt as they would keep to the comparatively well-watered coastal land leave the condamine he cross the northern watershed and strike the head of one of the main tributary of the fitzroy river which he name the dawson thence he pass westward into a region of fine pastoral country which he name the peak downs here he name the minor water of the planet and the comet and zamium creek on the 10th of January 1845 he find the mackenzie river and thence cross on to and name the isaac a tributary of the fitzroy come from the north this river they follow up till they cross the watershed on to the head water of the suttor river they follow this stream down until it bring they to the burdekin leichhardt 's most important discovery up the valley of this river they travel until they reach the head where at the valley of lagoon they cross the watershed on to the water of the gulf of carpentarium here for some unknown reason leichhardt go far too much to the north which necessitate a long detour around the south-eastern corner of the gulf it be while they be retrace a southern course along the eastern shore of the gulf that the naturalist gilbert meet he fate up to this time they have be so little troubled with the native that they have cease almost to think of a possible hostile encounter with they this fancy immunity be break in a most tragic manner on the night of the 28th of June 1845 it be a calm quiet evening and the party be peacefully encamp beside a chain of shallow lagoon the doctor be think out he plan for the next few day gilbert be plant a few lily he have gather as be he nightly habit when any flower be available roper and the other be group around the fire ward off the attack of the mosquito suddenly about seven o'clock a shower of spear be throw among the unarmed man and gilbert be almost instantly kill roper and calvert be seriously wound the whites rush for they gun but unfortunately not one weapon be ready capped and it be some time before any of they could be discharge when a volley cause the black to scamper off it be most astonishing that the whole of the member of the party be not cut down in one dreadful massacre the body of the murder naturalist be bury at the fatal camp but the grave be leave unmarked and a large fire build and consume above it to hide all trace of it from the native the river where this sad mishap occur now bear the name of gilbert from the scene of this tragedy which ordinary precaution would have avoid the party proceed around the southern shore of the gulf keep a short distance above tidal water but they progress be slow and painful on account of the two wound man most of leichhardt 's name be still retain for the river of the gulf which he cross the leichhardt itself be a exception this river he mistake for the albert so name by captain stoke during he marine survey of the north coast ac gregory rectify the error in after year and give the river the name of the lose explorer for whom he be then search with fast-dwindling supplies lag footstep and depressed spirit the expedition travel slowly on to the south-west corner of the gulf where in cross a large river the roper four of the horse be drown in consequence of the boggy bank this misfortune so limited they means of carriage that leichhardt have to sacrifice the whole of he botanical collection on the 17th of December 1845 the worn-out traveller nearly destitute of everything reach the settlement of victorium at port essington and the long journey of fourteen month be over this expedition successful as it be in open up such a large area of well-watered country attract universal attention both to the gratifying economic result and to the hitherto untried leader he be enthusiastically welcome back to sydney and dub by journalist the prince of explorer but what captivate public fancy be a certain halo of romance that cling to the journey on account of the report death of leichhardt a report that gain general credence he unexpected return invest he with a romance which -- fortunately for he reputation -- the total and absolute disappearance of himself and company in 1848 have but the more richly color enthusiastic poet gush forth in song and a more substantial reward be raise by public and private subscription and share among the expedition in due proportion encourage by these encomium on he success and perhaps a little intoxicated by the general acclamation leichhardt now conceive the ambitious idea of traverse the continent from the eastern to the western shore keep as far as possible on the same parallel of latitude this be a bold project come as it do so soon after sturt have return to adelaide from he excursion into the interior with a terrible tale of thirst and suffering but this time the hero of the hour experience no difficulty in obtain fund and other necessary aid the party when organise travel from the hunter river to the condamine take with they they outfit of mule cattle and goat when the expedition depart from darling downs they number seven white man and two native with 270 goat 180 sheep 40 bullock 15 horse and 13 mule there be besides a ample outfit and provision calculate to last the explorer on a two year ' journey for it be estimate that the expedition would be absent from civilisation for that time instead of set out westwards from the initial point in a direction where leichhardt could reasonably expect fair travel country for some distance he proceed along he old track north to the mackenzie and isaac river what induce he to adopt this course be uncertain he explain to one of he party that it be to verify some former observation or he may have have some dim notion that by keep to the tropical line he would gain some climatic assistance whatever the cause the result be disastrous the wet season and monsoonal rain catch the party amongst the sickly acacia scrub of that region and hem in by mud and bog they lose they stock consume they provision and make no progress henceforth the narrative be one of semi-starvation vary by gorge on the day when a beast be kill and wrangle and quarrel in which the leader appear in no amiable light medicine have be omit from the store and all the cover they have from the torrential rain be provide by two

unjust aspersion jf mann late of the survey department of new south wale be one of the expedition and the last survive member of any expedition connect with leichhardt he write a booklet in which he vigorously defend he comrade and himself against the unworthy slur cast at they by leichhardt amongst he papers be a rough sketch from life of leichhardt in bush costume on reach the condamine leichhardt be put into possession of the news of mitchell 's return and of the discovery of the barcoo be anxious to examine the country lie between the upper condamine and mitchell 's latest track he in company with two or three of he late companion leave cecil plain for that purpose he go as far as the balonne river cross it and return this doubtless be in view of organise another expedition with which he evidently intend to start in another manner straight to the westward still persist and believe in he capability of lead a expedition across the continent and fearful that this ambitious project might be forestall he now make strong and strenuous effort to organise another party he succeed at length but the party be neither so well provide nor so large nor compose of such capable man as the second in fact very little be know of the member that compose it the only thing certain be that it be not at all adapt for the work that lay before it a few word of the reverend wwb clarke the well-known geologist have be many time quote and they convey about all that be know of the personnel of the expedition : -- the party that accompany leichhardt be perhaps little capable of shift for themselves in case of any accident to they leader the second in command a brother-in-law of leichhardt come from germany to join he before start and he tell I when i ask he what he qualification for the journey be that he have be at sea and have suffer shipwreck and be therefore well able to endure hardship i do not know what he other qualification be the last sentence be very pregnant and imply that a very poor opinion of the man as experienced bushman be entertain by those who see they the lose expedition be suppose to have consist of six whites and two black the name know be those of the doctor himself classen hentig stuart and kelly he have with he 12 horse 13 mule 50 bullock and 270 goat beside the utterly inadequate allowance of 800 pound of flour 120 pound of tea some sugar and salt 250 pound of shot and 40 pound of powder he last letter be date the 3rd of April 1848 from mcpherson 's station on the cogoon but in it he speak only of the country he have pass through and nothing of he intended route since the resident of this then outlying station lose sight of he no sure clue as to the fate of he and he companion have ever come to light the total evanishment not alone of the man but of the animal -- especially the mule and the goat -- be one of the strangest mystery of we mysterious interior thirst probably cause the death of the animal and in that case they would have die singly and apart and they remains would in after year elude attention a similar fate probably befel the man rumor have always be rife as to the locality of leichhardt 's death and suggestion the most hopelessly unlikely and inconsistent have be put forward and seriously consider at the same time the only two reliable mark undoubtedly genuine and fitting in in every way with leichhardt 's project course of travel have be neglect leichhardt start from mcpherson 's station on the cogoon now perhaps better know as muckadillum creek there be a rumor never authenticate that after he have proceed nearly one hundred mile he send back a man with a report that he have pass through some splendid pastoral land but this be not at all likely to be true the first indication of he be then meet with on the barcoo -lrb- victorium -rrb- whereon ac gregory in charge of the leichhardt search expedition in 1858 find he marked tree and other indication : -- continue we route along the river -lrb- latitude 24 degree 35 minute longitude 36 degree 6 minute -rrb- we discover a moreton bay ash about two foot in diameter mark with the letter l on the east side cut through the bark about four foot from the ground and near it the stump of some small tree that have be cut with a sharp axe also a deep notch cut in the side of a sloping tree apparently to support the ridge-pole of a tent or some similar purpose all indicate that a camp have be establish here by leichhardt 's party no trace of stock could be find this however be easily account for as the country have be inundate last season there can be little doubt about the authenticity of the trace and it at once do away with the truth of the story tell to hovenden hely by the black as to leichhardt 's murder on the warrego river gregory then go up the thomson river but find no other mark and return follow that river and cooper 's creek down to south australia this camp of leichhardt 's be easily understand then follow a account of the other find by the same explorer in 1856 during a earlier expedition this be on the upper water of elsey creek and he description of it run as follow : -- the smoke of bush fire be visible to the south east and north and several tree cut with iron axis be notice near the camp there be also the remains of a hut and the ash of a large fire indicate that there have be a party encamp there for several week several tree from six to eight inch in diameter have be cut down with iron axis in fair condition and the hut build by cut notch in stand tree and rest a large pole therein for a ridge this hut have be burnt apparently by the subsequent bush fire and only some piece of the thickest timber remain unconsumed search be make for marked tree but none be find nor be there any fragment of iron leather or other material of the equipment of a explore party or of any bone of animal other than those common to australia have a explore party be destroy there there would most likely be some indication and it may therefore be infer that the party proceed on its journey it could not have be a camp of leichhardt 's in 1845 as it be 100 mile south-west of he route to port essington and it be only six or seven year old judge by the growth of the tree have subsequently see some of leichhardt 's camp on the burdekin mackenzie and barcoo river a great similarity be observe in the mode of build the hut and its relative position with regard to the fire and water supply and the position with regard to the great feature of the country be exactly where a party go westward would first receive a check from the waterless tableland between the roper and victorium river and would probably camp and reconnoitre before attempt to cross to the north-west coast leichhardt 's track as far as the elsey seem tolerably plain and entirely in accordance with the character of the man and he intention force to retreat from the dry country west of the thomson he probably follow that river to its head and cross the main watershed regain and re-pursue he track of 1845 as far as the roper of which river elsey creek be a tributary when he leave the camp see by gregory he would go either south-west or west find himself in the driest of dry country which be even now but sparsely settle and there come the end long before the last water they carry with they have be use they beast would have all die leave here and there wherever they fall so too would the man difference of opinion would have arise and some would have be for turn back and other for keep on some would have persist in change the direction they be follow and lead on by some mad delirious fancy in see water indication in some rock or bush would have separate and stagger on to die alone they baggage would have be leave strew over the desert where it have be abandon and the man one by one would have share the same fate into such a waterless and barren region the black would seldom penetrate and what with the sun hot wind bush fire and sand-storm all recognisable trace would soon have be efface with regard to the notch tree to support a ridge-pole which feature be notice by gregory in both camp jf mann of whose companionship with leichhardt mention have already be make often state that he would recognize leichhardt 's camp anywhere by this singular device for support the ridge of a tent chapter 9 edmund b kennedy -lrb- illustration edmund b kennedy -rrb- 91 the victorium and cooper 's creek eb kennedy whose tragic death ineffaceably brand the cape york black as remorselessly cruel come to australia early in life and be appoint a government surveyor in 1840 he first experience as a explorer be gain when as assistant-surveyor and second in command he accompany he chief on the last expedition that mitchell lead into the interior on this occasion he remain in charge of the camp form at st george 's bridge and then conduct part of the expedition on to the maranoa where he rejoin the major and remain in charge whilst mitchell make he exploration westward on mitchell 's return to sydney there be some doubt as to the point of outflow of the newly-discovered victorium river kennedy be send out with a small party to follow the river down and ascertain its course and destination on the 13th of August he reach mitchell 's lowest camp on the victorium river and start to trace the river down during the first day 's journey he come across some native from one of whom he learn that the aboriginal name of the river be the barcoo two day afterwards he observe with some anxiety that the trend of the valley be incline from northwards towards the point whence sturt have turn back from he upward course on cooper 's creek as the second part of he instruction be to find a practicable road to the gulf he fear that he would not have sufficient provision to fulfil both duty he therefore make a stationary camp and with two man proceed down the river but after two day ' journey he find that the barcoo turn to the west and even north of west the channel now show large reach of water within its confines some of they more than one hundred yard in width this induce he to alter he plan and he think he should follow such a important watercourse and ascertain its outflow he therefore turn back for the remainder of he party on the 30th of August he discover a large river come from the north-north-east and he name it the thomson with the usual inconsistency of australian inland river the thomson soon present another and different scene the great pastoral stretch of the upper course be leave behind and be succeed by flat and inferior country intersect by sand-ridge the course of the river itself once more turn to the southward and be but scantily water still kennedy persevere until convinced that further progress must bring he to sturt 's furthest on cooper 's creek the face of the land answer to sturt 's description and grass and feed both begin to fail he kennedy have to consider whether it be worth while risk the life of he man to confirm what be practically a certainty at last vista of the desert describe by sturt with such terrible fidelity appear stretch away to the horizon and kennedy turn back satisfied that the victorium river and cooper 's creek be one and the same stream it be now kennedy 's intention to make a excursion towards the gulf of carpentarium on he way down in order to travel lighter he have bury a large quantity of flour and sugar as well as he dray when he arrive at the cache of provision on he way back he find that the native have dig the ration up and in mere wantonness have so mixed and scatter they as to render they useless a little further on he be just in time to save the cart for a aboriginal be probe in the ground with a spear to ascertain they whereabouts during this excursion kennedy notice that the black be give to chew tobacco in a green state but the tobacco be of course the piturus plant which they be accustom to masticate by the time he reach the head of the warrego kennedy be too short of provision to attempt he project gulf expedition and have to make homeward but resolve to go down by that river and ascertain whether it join the darling or flow westward the warrego divide into many dry channel when they reach its lower course the party strike eastward to the culgoa and reach that river after a very distressing stage over dry country on which they lose six horse from heat and thirst whilst bring the cart across it 92 a tragic expedition kennedy 's first experience of a independent explore expedition in the west be by no mean a fitting prelude to the tragic journey he next undertake the same impulse that lead to mitchell 's and leichhardt 's northern journey stimulate kennedy to make he dangerous journey up the eastern coast of the long peninsula that terminate in cape york -- the desire to find a road to the north coast so that a easy chain of communication should exist between the southern settlement and the far north it be at the end of the month of may that kennedy land at rockingham bay with he party of twelve man he have start from sydney in the barque tam o ' shanter which be convoy by captain owen stanley in the alligator this be in 1848 the same fateful year that witness leichhardt 's disappearance a schooner be to meet the party on the north at port albany where it be propose to form a settlement should the feature of the peninsula warrant such a enterprise in actual point of distance the task be not great be a land traverse of from three to four hundred mile allow for deviation but never be man in australium so dog by disaster and beset by danger as be kennedy and he follower oppose by country as yet unfamiliar to they they find they onward path hinder by many totally unforeseen condition range and ravine clothe with a almost impenetrable jungle which be infested with the venomous leaf of the stinging tree and the hooked spike of the lawyer vine confront they the land be densely populate with the most savage and relentless native on the continent who resent the invasion from the outset death track they steadily throughout and claim ten out of the thirteen of the devoted party as he victim the country through which they course lay be now dot with mining-field and township and fertile space of till tropical plantation the coast-line rich in harbor be the busy haunt of steamer and the narrow waterway between the mainland and the great barrier reef the home of many lightship but when kennedy and he party make they pioneer journey the great desolation of the wilderness beset they on every side from the land whilst the sea off-shore hold myriad danger kennedy land from the tam o'shanter at the little point that still bear the jovial name and bid farewell to owen stanley in good spirit and with no dread premonition he be fresh from the sun-scorched plain of the interior and would confidently confront whatever might lie before he scrub and swampy country delay he on he way to the higher land at the foot of the range where he have hope to find better travel country but the foothill be serry with ravine and gully and the side clothe with the ever-present jungle the horse and sheep unaccustomed to the sour grass of the coast land of northern australium pine and rapidly waste away they trouble be augment by act of annoyance and on one unfortunate occasion of open hostility on the part of the black by the 18th of July a little over six week after they have leave rockingham bay the sheep have be reduce from one hundred to fifty and the horse begin to fail so rapidly that they have to abandon the cart while the man be become completely exhaust from the endless cutting and hacking of the scrub at length they surmount the range the backbone of the peninsula and on the western slope amid the head of the river flow into the gulf of carpentarium make better progress kennedy however adhere to he instruction to examine the eastern slope and recross the watershed where trouble again come thick upon he one after another the horse begin to give in and owe to the storekeeper 's mismanagement they be nearly out of provision on the 9th of December they reach weymouth bay and kennedy determine to form a stationary camp and leave there the main body of he man push forward to port albany whence he would send back the schooner that be await they with relief he select seven man whom he leave in charge of carron the naturalist and with three man and the heroic jacky-jacky a aboriginal of new south wale he push on -- to he death before the departure the last sheep be slaughter and its lean and miserable carcase share between the two party and with carron kennedy ascend a hill that command a prospect of the country lie to the north but could see nothing but rugged hill and black scrub he confide only to carron he gloomy foreboding that he would never reach albany so disheartened be both the man by the prospect and throughout those long week of starvation that ensue carron refrain from crush all hope in he comrade by communicate to they kennedy 's despair of relief for three week kennedy struggle on cut he path through the scrub and with dwindle strength clamber across the spur of the range for the story of he struggle and eventual death australium have have to rely on the report of the only survivor the faithful jacky-jacky they reach shelburne bay where one of the man accidentally shoot himself and become so weak from loss of blood that it be impossible for he to move as another man luff be sick kennedy leave the third man dunn to attend to he two comrade and push on alone with the native boy he have actually gain the escape river within sight of albany island when he fate overtake he and surround by the blood-thirsty foe who have so long and persistently hang upon he footstep he fall at last beneath they spear the story be best tell in jacky 's own word although it have be often repeat they have come across some native whom kennedy be incline to trust but of whom jacky be suspicious and that night they camp in the scrub foodless and fireless i and mr kennedy say jacky watch they that night take it in turn every hour that night by and by i see the blackfellow it be a moonlight night and i walk up to mr kennedy and say : ` there be plenty of blackfellow now ' this be in the middle of the night mr kennedy tell I to get my gun ready the black do not know where we sleep as we do not make a fire we both sit up all night after this daylight come and i fetch the horse and saddle they then we go a good way up the river and then we sit down a little while and then we see three blackfellow come along we track and then they see we and one run back as hard as he could run and fetch up plenty more like a flock of sheep almost i tell mr kennedy to put the saddle on the horse and go on and the black come up and they follow we all day all along it be rain i now tell he to leave the horse and come on without they that horse make too much track mr kennedy be too weak and would not leave the horse we go on this day until the evening rain hard and the black follow we all day some behind some plant before in fact blackfellow all round follow we now we go into a little bit of scrub and i tell mr kennedy to look behind always sometimes he would do so and sometimes he would not do so to look out for the black then a good many blackfellow come behind in the scrub and throw plenty of spear and hit mr kennedy in the back first mr kennedy say to I : ` oh jacky jacky shoot 'em shoot 'em ' then i pull out my gun and fire and hit one fellow all over the face with buck-shot he tumble down and get up again and again and wheel right round and two black pick he up and carry he away they go a little way and come back again throw spear all round more than they do before -- very large spear -lrb- illustration wild black of cape york signalling -rrb- i pull out the spear at once from mr kennedy 's back and cut the jag with mr kennedy 's knife then mr kennedy get he gun and snap but the gun would not go off the black sneak all around by the tree and spear mr kennedy again in the right leg above the knee a little and i get spear in the eye and the black be now throw always never give over and shortly again spear mr kennedy again in the right side there be large jag in the spear and i cut they off and put they in my pocket at the same time we get spear the horse get spear too and jump and buck about and get into the swamp i now tell mr kennedy to sit down while i look after the saddle-bag which i do and when i come back again i see the black along with mr kennedy i then ask he if he see the black with he he be stupid with the spear wound and say ` no ' i then ask he where be he watch i see the black take away watch and hat as i be return to mr kennedy then i carry mr kennedy into the scrub he say ` do not carry I a good way ' then mr kennedy look this way very bad -lrb- jacky roll he eye -rrb- i ask he often ` be you well now ' and he say -- ' i do not care for the spear wound in my leg jacky but for the other two spear wound in my side and back and i be bad inside jacky ' i tell he blackfellow always die when he get spear wound in there -lrb- the back -rrb- he say : ' i be out of wind jacky ' i ask he : ` be you go to leave I ' and he say ` yes my boy i be go to leave you i be very bad jacky you take the book jacky to the captain but not the big one the governor will give you anything for they ' i then tie up the papers he then say : ` jacky give I paper and i will write ' i give he pencil and paper and he try to write and he then fall back and die and i catch he in my arm and hold he and i then turn round myself and cry i be cry a good while until i get well that be about a hour and then i bury he i dig up the ground with a tomahawk and cover he over with log and grass and my shirt and trousers that night i leave he near dark i would go through the scrub and the black throw spear at I a great many and i go back into the scrub then i go down the creek which run into escape river and i walk along the water in the creek very easy with my head only above the water to avoid the black and get out of they way in this way i go half-a-mile then i get out of the creek and get clear of they and walk all night nearly and sleep in the bush without a fire at the southern entrance of albany pass one of the most picturesque spot of the east coast of australium the schooner ariel lay at anchor await day after day some signal to indicate the arrival of the expect kennedy one day the look-out man announce that there be a aboriginal on the mainland make urgent signal to the schooner there be nothing unusual in this for during the delay and tedious wait the black have constantly be see make gesture on the shore a examination through the glass however show the people on the ariel that this blackfellow be make such vehement and persistent signal that it be think worth while to send the boat in to investigate affair no wonder the poor fellow 's signal be urgent and vehement he be jacky-jacky who thirteen day after kennedy 's death by devious twisting and winding occasionally climb a tree in the hope to catch a glimpse of the schooner and exist on root and vermin have at last reach the goal but when he stand prominently on the shore to signal to the schooner he relentless pursuer sight he and he frantic sign be for rescue from imminent peril the boat 's crew fortunately recognize the emergency and a smart race ensue between they and the native the rescuer win and jacky-jacky be save to tell he melancholy story there be no time lose on board the ariel there be three man who might be still alive at shelburne bay and eight more starve at weymouth bay kennedy be dead they duty and urgent duty it be lay with the living at once the schooner commence to beat down the coast and at shelburne bay they land but fail to find the camp but they seize a native canoe which bear sufficient evidence that the man have be murder clearly time must not be waste in inflict punishment accord to jacky 's account the man at weymouth bay be absolutely starve if they have not already succumb to famine after they leader have leave weymouth carron have shift the camp on to the nearest hill as it be more open and less expose to the treacherous attack of the native a flagstaff be erect on the crest in view of the bay then the party have only to sit down and await the come of the grim shadow follow they through the jungle to strike they with the death chill they have two skeleton of horse and two gaunt dog and a tiny remnant of flour the man give themselves up to moody despondency weary out by long endurance of trial that would have shake the courage and try the fortitude of the strongest say carron in he diary a sort of sluggish indifference prevail that prevent the development of those active energy which be necessary to support we in we present critical position one of the two horse be kill and its scanty flesh cut into strip be dry in the sun and smoke this the most repellant sapless food to be find in the world have be they diet for some time dougla be the first to die the survivor be still strong enough to give he burial in a few day taylor follow he and be inter by he side the black threaten they continually though at time they would lay down they arm and bring piece of fish and turtle into the camp but this only the better to spy out they weakness carpenter be the next to succumb and on the 1st of December they be doom to drink they bitterest cup to the dregs they have kill the remain horse but the monsoonal rain descend and in the steamy atmosphere the meat turn putrid tear with anxiety carron be dejectedly mount the look-out to the flagstaff when he catch sight of a vessel beating into the bay the sudden change from despair to relief be overwhelming kennedy must have reach port albany and have doubtless send the bramble to rescue they with eager tremulous hand he hoist a pre-arranged signal to warn they against the black darkness fall and they keep a fire burning and fire off rocket and when daylight come and a boat be lower from the schooner they feel no misgiving time pass and carron again ascend the look-out what he see nearly blast he eyesight the schooner be stand out to sea he be just in time to see she round the point and disappear they strive to persuade themselves that it be not the bramble a relief schooner that be suppose to cruise along the coast but it assuredly have be the bramble and she man have not see the signal against the gloomy background of scrub and hill they know nothing of kennedy 's death nor of carron 's plight the agony of this disappointment must have be more bitter than death mitchell be the next to die and the survivor be too weak to give he burial then niblett and wall depart but on the last day of the year relief come to the remain two some native suddenly bring carron a dirty note to say that help be come and he see by they gesture that there be a vessel in the bay he scribble a note in reply but they refuse to take it and begin to crowd into the camp and handle they weapon they be not go to be baulk of they prey at the very moment when they be poise they spear the relief party arrive four brave man -- captain dobson of the ariel dr vallack barrett a sailor and the eager jacky-jacky -- have force they way through mangrove and hostile threatening native to snatch they from they doom nothing could be carry away but the two famished man and they be help down to the boat without come into active hostility thus end the most disastrous expedition in australian annals kennedy 's body be never recover nor be the fate of the man at shelburne bay reveal the body at weymouth bay be re-bury on albany island and a tablet be erect in memory of kennedy

southern queensland but afterwards make he residence near the center where he join the native police he have long bush experience be a firm believer in the training of the native in quasi-military duty and have take a prominent part in the formation of the queensland native police on this relief expedition the party be compose almost entirely of native police trooper under he leadership on receive he commission he push rapidly out to the barcoo and near the thomson river come upon another tree marked l this might have be make by leichhardt he ascend the main watershed and cross it come down on to the head of the flinder river here he experience many hindrance arise from the rough basaltic nature of the country that border the northern head-water of that river when he finally debouch upon the wide western plain he cross the flinder without recognize it as the main branch in the search for which he go on northward approach the gulf of carpentarium he have several encounter with the aboriginal as he near the coast the bend of the flinder bring that river again across he route and it be then that he come on some camel track which assure he that the miss party the object of he search have at any rate reach the gulf safely on he outward way walker may be say to have pursue a course parallel with that of the flinder a little further to the northward he push on to the albert river to replenish he provision at the depot provide for the use of the various relief party he arrive there safely after have have two more skirmish with the black on the way he report the finding of the camel track and have come to the conclusion that burke and will have probably make for the queensland settlement he decide to follow they thither he trace out a tributary of the flinder the saxby on he homeward route but see no more of the camel track and finally cross the water-shed on to the rough basaltic country at the head of the burdekin here he horse suffer so severely from the rugged nature of the country that by the time they reach strathalbyn a station on the lower burdekin the whole of the party be well-nigh horseless as well as almost out of provision walker be afterwards engage by the queensland government to mark out a course for a telegraph line between rockingham bay and the mouth of the norman river in carpentarium this work he carry out successfully but when at the gulf he be attack by the prevalent malarial fever and die there 102 burdekin and cape york expedition the main portion of eastern australium be now fairly well know it have be cross from south to north and from east to west and it be only the elongate spur of the cape york peninsula that stand in urgent need of detailed exploration amongst what may be call the minor pastoral expedition of that period be one conduct by ge dalrymple who penetrate the coastal country north of rockhampton as far north as the burdekin in 1859 he follow that river down to the sea and find that the mouth have be located further to the south than be really the case he party then strike inland examine the head of that river and find the valley of lagoon the following year another party consist of messr cunningham somer and three other explore the tributary of the upper burdekin and open up several good tract of pastoral country the permanent run stream which flow through a rugged wall of basalt into a ana-branch of the burdekin be first notice by this party and call fletcher 's creek -lrb- illustration frank l jardine illustration alec w jardine -rrb- frank and alec jardine jointly lead up the cape york peninsula a expedition that in its hardship and danger emulate that of kennedy 's but fortunately without a tragic end the year 1863 be one of great activity in the northern part of eastern australium at cape york the imperial government have on the recommendation of sir george bowen the first governor of queensland decide to form a settlement john jardine the police magistrate of the central town of rockhampton be select to take charge and a detachment of marine be send out to be station there somerset the new settlement be form on the albany pass opposite to the island of the same name jardine be to proceed by sea to he new sphere of office but anticipate the want of fresh meat at the propose station he enter into a arrangement with the government whereby he two son be to take a small herd of cattle thither overland and on the way make careful observation of the land through which they be to pass somerset be situate near the scene of kennedy 's death and know what tremendous difficulty that explorer have meet with on the eastern shore it be decide that the expedition should attempt to follow the western shore through the unknown country that face the gulf of carpentarium both the jardine brother be quite young man at the time when they start on they exceedingly adventurous trip which combine cattle-droving with exploration : frank the accept leader be only twenty-two year old and he brother alexander but twenty they father have come from applegarth in dumfriesshire they have both be bear near sydney and have be educate by private tutor and at the sydney grammar school they take with they aj richardson a surveyor send by the government scrutton binney cowderoy and four native the stock consist of forty-two horse and two hundred and fifty head of cattle the cheerful acceptance of this hazardous enterprise by these youth be a fine indication of adventurous spirit and reflect great credit on they courage and the courage of the native-born the fate of the last explorer who dare to face the peril of the peninsula would have deter any but the boldest from take up he task before the final start from carpentarium downs then the furthest station to the north suppose to be situate on leichhardt 's lynd river alec jardine make a trip ahead in order to secure knowledge of a available road for the cattle and save delay in the earlier stage of the main journey on this preliminary observational excursion he follow the presumed lynd down for nearly 180 mile until he be convince that neither in appearance direction nor position do it correspond with the river describe by leichhardt on the subsequent journey with the cattle this conviction be find to be in accordance with fact for the stream be then prove to be a tributary of the gilbert now know as the einnesleigh on the 11th of October the final start be make and the party commence a journey seldom equal in australium for peril and adventure the head of the einnesleigh be amongst rough range and on the 22nd of the month they halt the cattle while they conduct another search for the invisible lynd they find other good-sized creek but no lynd nor do they ever see it they afterwards find that owe to a error in the map they have with they the lynd be place 30 mile out of position a misfortune happen at the outset of they expedition in the morning a large number of horse be miss leave some of the party to stay behind and look for they the two brother and the remainder go on with the cattle on the second day they arrive at a large creek without have be overtake by the party with the miss horse and the pack-horse after a anxious day spend in wait alec jardine start back to find out the cause of the delay he meet the miss party who be bring bad news with they through carelessness in allow the grass round the camp to catch fire half of they ration and nearly the whole of they equipment have be burn in addition one of the most valuable of they horse have be poison this terrible misfortune come at such a early stage of they journey when they have all the unknown country ahead of they seriously imperil the success of they undertaking but there be nothing to do but to bear it with what equanimity they could muster the cape york native now seem to rejoice that they have another party of white man to dog to death once about twenty of they appear about sundown and boldly attack the camp with shower of spear two day afterwards they surprise the younger jardine when alone and he have to fight hard for he life the creek they have be follow down lead they on to the staaten river where the black succeed in stampede they horse and it be day before some of they be recover on the 5th of December they leave this ill-omened river and steer due north bad luck still haunt they tortured by fly mosquito and sand-fly they horse scatter and ramble incessantly while the brother be absent search one day for the horse the party at the camp allow the solitary mule to stray away with its pack on the mule be never find again and it carry with it in its pack some of they most necessary article reduce they nearly to the same state of deprivation as they determine enemy the aboriginal two more horse go mad through drinking salt water one die and the other be so ill that he have to be abandon on the 13th of December they reach the mitchell river not without have have another hot battle with the black who follow they day after day watch for every opportunity and display the same relentless hostility that they have formerly show to kennedy whilst the party be on the mitchell the native muster in force and fall upon the explorer with the greatest determination after a severe contest in which heavy loss have be inflict upon the savage they sullenly and reluctantly retire from what be afterwards gather from the semi-civilised native about somerset these tribe follow the jardine for nearly 400 mile this perseverance and inappeasable enmity have be equal before only by the darling native it can be imagine how these incessant attack combine with the harass nature of the country give the party all they could do to hold they own and but for the prompt and plucky manner in which the attack be meet not one of they would have survive after cross the mitchell steer north they get into poor country thinly-grassed and badly-watered with the native still hang on they flank on the 28th of December the black begin to harass the horse and another hard struggle take place storm of rain now set in and they have to travel through dismal tea-tree flat with the constant expectation of be catch by a flood in the low-lying country in January they have a gleam of hope on the 5th they come to a well-grassed valley with a fine river run through it which they name the archer on the 9th they cross another river which they suppose to be the one name the coen on the seaward side but once across this river trouble gather thick again the rain pour down constantly the country become so boggy that they could scarcely travel and to crown all they misfortune two horse be drown when cross the batavium and six other be poison and die there fate seem now to have do she worst and the explorer face the future manfully bury all that they could dispense with they pack all they remain horse and start resolutely to finish the journey on foot on the 14th two more of they horse die and the black once more come up behind to reconnoitre as may be imagine the whites be not in a patient humor and this last skirmish be brief and severe on the 17th two more horse die from the effect of the poison plant fifteen only be leave out of the forty-two with which they have start they be now approach the narrow point of the cape and find themselves on a dreary waste of barren country whereon only heath grow and which be intersect with boggy creek on the 10th of January they catch a glimpse of the sea from the top of a tree and on the 20th they be in full view of it as they go on they be entangled in the same kind of scrub that baffle kennedy and at last on the 29th after some day of scrub-cutting it be determine to halt the cattle whilst the brother should push on to somerset in the endeavor to find a more practicable track in the tangled scrubby country through which they have pass it have be difficult to form a true conception of the distance and they estimate of twenty mile for the distance separate they from the settlement be much too short on the 30th of January the two jardine and they most trust black boy eulah start to find the settlement for a time they be hem in by a bend of what they take to be the escape river but on get clear of it they be surprise to come to another large and swollen river which apparently run into the gulf this force they to return after a few day ' rest they make a second vain attempt hem in by impassable morass and impenetrable thicket in some place they be cut off from approach even the river by formidable belt of mangrove in fact the jardine river as it be now call head almost from the eastern shore from pudding pan hill in fact kennedy 's fatal camp it overlap the escape river and after many devious winding and twisting flow across the cape out on to the gulf shore it be not until the end of February that on the subsidence of some of the flood creek the brother make a successful effort and get into somewhat better travel country the next morning they come across some black who be eager to be on good term and hail they to they surprise with shout of franco allico tumbacco these cry have be teach they by mr jardine who be get anxious because of he son ' delay and have do all he could think of to help they he have cut a marked tree line almost from sea to sea and coach the local native up in a few english word so as to be recognize as friend this last device succeed admirably from these newcomer they select three as guide and the follow day reach the settlement the rest of the party and the stock be soon bring into somerset where a cattle-station be form when we look back at the difficulty that beset the path of this expedition and the unforseen disaster that befel they one can not help feel the greatest admiration for the leader and they conduct in spite of the numberless treacherous attack of the black to which they have be subject not a member of the band have be lose they have fight they way through the same species of danger that have environ the unfortunate kennedy and have all live to tell the tale the royal geographical society reward the labor of the two brother by elect they fellow of the society and by award they the murchison medal frank jardine be for some period government resident at Thursday island whither the settlement have be remove but of late he have reside at he own station at somerset and engage in pearl-shelling alec enter the queensland civil service as road engineer and in that capacity do much important work in the construction of the road of that state in 1871 and 1872 he design and construct the road and railway-bridge over the dawson river and in 1890 he become engineer-in-chief for harbor and river but the scrubby and hilly nature of the country on cape york militate against its speedy settlement and it need the lure of gold to induce man to risk they life in a land with such hostile inhabitant in 1872 the queensland government decide upon another exploration of the neck of land that form the northern-most point of australium more than eight year have elapse since the jardine have make they dashing journey but they report couple with kennedy 's fate do not offer much temptation to follow up they footstep there be however a tract of country near the base of the peninsula still comparatively unknown and a party be organise and place under the leadership of william hann hann be a native of wiltshire who have come out to the south of victorium with he parent at a early age he be afterwards one of the pioneer squatter of the burdekin in which river he father be drown the object of the trip be to examine the country as far as the 14th parallel south with a special view to its mineral resource the discovery of gold have extend so far north in queensland have raise a hope that its existence would be trace along the promontory hann have with he taylor as geologist and dr tate as botanist the latter be a survivor of the melancholy marium expedition to new guinea apparently he ardor for exploration have not be cool by the narrow escape he have then experience the party leave fossilbrook station on the creek of the same name a tributary of the lynd north of the initial point of the jardine expedition cross much rugged and broken country they find two river run into the mitchell and name they the tate and the walsh from the walsh the party proceed to the upper course of the mitchell and cross it strike a creek mark on kennedy 's map as creek ninety yard wide this be name the palmer and here warner the surveyor find trace of gold a further examination of the river result in likely-looking result be obtain and the discovery be now a matter of history the world-wide palmer rush to north queensland be the result in 1874 on the 1st of September hann reach he northern limit and the next day commence the ascent of the range divide the eastern and western water a few day afterwards he sight the pacific at princess charlotte bay from this point the party return south and come to a large river which he call the normanby where a slight skirmish with the native occur the black have hitherto be on friendly term while the man be collect the horse in the morning the native attempt to cut they off each native have a bundle of spear a few shot at a long distance be sufficient to disperse they and the affair end without bloodsh on the 21st of September hann cross the historical endeavor river and upon a small creek run into this inlet he lose one of he horse from poison below the endeavor the party encounter similar difficulty to those that dog poor kennedy 's footstep -- impenetrable scrub and steep ravine this go on for some day and a attempt to reach the seashore involve they in a perfect sea of scrub and necessitate the final conclusion that advance by white man and horse be impossible hann have reluctantly to make up he mind to return by the gulf coast and abandon the unexplored ground to the south of he after many entanglement in the range and confusion arise from the tortuous course of the river the watershed be at last cross and on the 28th of October they camp once more on the palmer whence they safely return along they outward course the gold discovery on the palmer and the rush cause thereby come soon after this expedition lead to a great deal of minor exploration do under the guise of prospecting and it be greatly to the work of prospector for gold that much of the knowledge of the petty detail of the geographical feature of australium be due to the courage and endurance of this class of settler australium owe a great debt but they labor be unrecorded and often forget part 2 central australium -lrb-

path of the daring explorer make north for most of we of the present day to whom lake torren be but a geographical feature it be hard to imagine the sense of awe it inspire in the breast of the south australian settler who appear to be cut off completely from the north by its gloomy and forbid environs of salt and barrenness in 1836 colonel light survey the shore of st vincent 's gulf and select

shortly this overlanding of stock be extend to the newly-founded city of adelaide charle bonney and joseph hawdon be the first drover on this long journey they adelaide journey be in fact a exploration trip and a important one as they follow the bank of the murray below its junction with the darling this part of the river have be follow down before only by sturt and then only by water it be in January 1838 that hawdon and bonney leave mitchell 's cross at the goulburn river with cattle as pioneer on the overland route to adelaide unknown to they they be closely follow by ej eyre with another mob of cattle eyre as we shall afterwards see be throw out of the race through try to make a short cut to avoid the sweeping bend of the river bonney and hawdon cross the murray above the junction of the darling and in place find the bed of the latter river dry the native strange to say be quite friendly perhaps they have take to heart the lesson mitchell have read they but they amiable demeanor do not last long bonney and hawdon be almost the last overland party to proceed unmolested within a comparatively short time afterwards a incessant war begin to be wage between the black and every overlander who pass down the murray it end only with the sanguinary battle of the rufus more fortunate than sturt hawdon and bonney be able to cut off many of the wearisome bend that have so fatigued sturt 's crew sturt have have to follow every turn and curve whilst the overlander avoid the bend of the murray by follow the native path which spare they in some case a journey of one or two day it be while follow a native path that they discover and name lake bonney at last they sight the mount lofty range and after some difficulty in get through some rough mallee-covered country arrive at adelaide and gladden the resident with the prospect of roast beef up to this time say bonney in he diary they have be live almost exclusively on kangaroo flesh eyre whose name be afterwards so closely ally with a famous story of thirst and hardship narrowly escape with he life during he overland trip it be owe to a very natural mistake that eyre be lead astray he intend to try a straighter and shorter route than the one round the murray and for a time get on very well but come across a tract of dry country across which he could not take the cattle he determine to follow mitchell 's wimmera river to the north naturally think that it would lead he easily to the murray and would probably prove to be identical with the lindsay as mark on sturt 's chart from mitchell 's furthest point he trace it a considerable distance to the north-west and at last find its termination in a large swampy lake which he call after the first governor of south australia lake hindmarsh from this lake he could find no outlet so take with he two man he make a attempt to push through to the murray leave he cattle to await he he find the country cover with a almost impenetrable mallee scrub and as there be neither grass nor water for the horse he be force to retreat he reach he camp after a weary struggle on foot the horse have die from thirst eyre be then compel to return and gain the bank of the murray by the nearest available route the bitter disappointment of the trip be that when force to retreat by the inhospitable nature of the country he be but twenty-five mile from the river bonney however on another occasion take a mob of cattle from the goulburn river to adelaide in almost a direct line in February 1839 he leave the goulburn and steer a course for the grampian mountain where he strike the wannon and follow it down to the glenelg here he come upon one of the henty station and be strongly advise not to persist in he attempt captain hart who have be examine the country with the same purpose in view as bonney 's state that it would be impossible to take cattle through and turn back with he own to follow the old route round the murray bend but bonney be not to be daunt and resolutely push on west of the glenelg he discover and name lake hawdon and also name two mountain mount muirhead and mount benson but at lacepede bay he most serious trouble commence the party have push on steadily to within forty mile of lake alexandrina when in the middle of a sandy desert the work bullock fail bonney divide he party and send some of the man back to take the worker to a brackish pool which they have pass he himself with the stockman and two black boy make a desperate effort to reach the lake with the main mob for two day they push steadily on travel day and night until man and beast be alike at they last gasp bonney then try a desperate expedient : i then determine he say as a last resource to kill a calf and use the blood to assuage we thirst this be do and though the blood do not allay the pang of thirst to any great extent it restore we strength very much the exhaust man then lay down to rest but whilst they sleep they thirsty beast scented a faint smell of damp earth on a wander puff of wind and stampede off to windward too weak to follow on at once the man after a hour or two stagger after they and track they to a half-dry swamp which still maintain a little mud and water it be brackish but palatable enough for man in they exhaust condition and save the life of all after some trouble in cross the murray they reach adelaide in safety with the stock when the news of they arrival reach port phillip many other overlander be encourage by bonney 's example to try the shorter route and the trade in shipping cattle across the strait from tasmanium almost cease bonney have be bear at sandon near stafford and educate at the grammar school rugby he have come out to sydney in 1834 as clerk to sir william westbrook burton but the love of adventure prevail over he other inclination and in 1837 he join ebden in squat pursuit and eventually distinguish himself as one of the lead overlander he subsequently

where he natural love for exploration rapidly increase he fortune as a overlander have already be notice on the 5th August 1839 he leave port lincoln on the western shore of spencer 's gulf meaning to penetrate as far as he could to the westward some time before he have make a expedition to the north of adelaide as far as mount arden a striking elevation to the north-north-east of spencer 's gulf he have ascend this mount and from the summit see a depression which he take to be a lake with a dry bed this lake afterwards play a important part in the history of south australian settlement under the name of lake torren eyre 's party on he westward trip consist of a overseer three man and two native twenty day after leave port lincoln they arrive at streaky bay not have cross a single stream rivulet or chain of pond the whole distance of nearly three hundred mile three small spring only have be find and the country be cover with the gloomy mallee and tea-tree scrub westward of streaky bay the country be still find to be scrubby so eyre form a camp and take only a black boy with he he force a stubborn way onward until he be within nearly fifty mile of the western border of south australium to all appearance the country be slightly more elevated than the level scrubby flat he have be traverse but there be neither grass nor water and a immediate return become necessary before he get back to streaky bay camp he nearly lose three of he horse leave streaky bay again he go east of north to the head of spencer 's gulf find the country on this route a little better but still devoid of water the party get through thanks only to a timely rainfall on the 29th of September he come to he old camp at mount arden where he write : -- it be evident that what i have take on my last journey to be the bed of a dry lake now contain water and be of considerable size but as my time be very limited and the lake at a great distance i have to forego my wish to visit it i have however no

the head of the great bight be impracticable the country be too sterile and the absence of water-course render the idea hopeless for immediate practical result beneficial to the grow pastoral industry eyre favor the extension of discovery to the north this then be the course adopt and subscription be raise towards that end eyre himself provide one-third of the needful horse and other expense and the government and colonist find the remainder meantime it be find that the country in the immediate neighborhood of port lincoln be not altogether of the same wretched nature as that traverse by eyre between streaky bay and the head of spencer 's gulf captain hawson william smith and three other have make a excursion for some considerable distance and find well-grassed country and abundance of water from the point whence they turn back they have see a fine valley with a run stream this valley they name rossitur vale after captain rossitur of the french whaler mississippus the first foreign vessel to enter port lincoln rossitur be the man who be destine later to afford opportune aid to eyre without which he would never have reach albany on the 18th of June 1840 eyre 's preparation be complete and he leave adelaide after a farewell breakfast at government house where captain sturt present he with a flag -- the union jack -- work by some of the lady of adelaide he party be not a large one consider the nature of the undertaking consist as it do of six white man and two black boy at mount arden they form a stationary camp a small vessel call the waterwitch be send to the head of spencer 's gulf with the heaviest portion of they supplies and the party have three horse dray with they eyre trust that a range of hill which he have see stretch to the north-east would continue far enough to take he clear of the flat and depressed country around lake torren -- would in fact as he say form a stepping-stone into the interior take one black boy with he eyre make a short trip to lake torren leave the rest of the party to land the store from the waterwitch he find the bed of the lake coat with a crust of salt pure white and glistening brilliantly in the sunshine it yield to the footstep and below be soft mud which rapidly grow so boggy as to stop they progress in fact they have to return to the shore without be able to ascertain whether there be any water on the surface or not at this point the lake appear to be about fifteen or twenty mile across have high land bound it on the distant west there seem no chance of cross the lake and follow its shore to the north be impossible there be neither grass nor water the very rainwater turn salt after lie a short time on the saline soil the only chance of success appear to be to keep close to the north-eastern range which eyre name the flinder range trust to its broken gully to supply they with some scanty grass and rainwater it be a cheerless outlook on one side be a impassable lake of combined mud and salt on the other a desert of bare and barren plain whilst they onward path be along a range of inhospitable rock the very stone lie upon the hill say eyre look like scorch and wither scorium of a volcanic region and even the native judge from the specimen i have see to-day partook of the general misery and wretchedness of the place he direct he course to the most distant point of the flinder range but when he arrive there he be oblige to christen it mount deception as he hope of finding water there be disappoint subsist as well as they could on rain puddle on the plain eyre and he boy search about for some time and at last find a permanent-looking hole in a small creek they then return to the main party have conceal the supplies land from the cutter eyre send the vessel back to adelaide with despatch and move the whole of the man out to the pool of water that he have just find from this vantage point he make various scout trip with the black boy both to the eastward and westward of north the 2nd of September find he on the summit of a elevation which he appropriately name mount hopeless gaze at the salt lake that he now think hem he in on three side even to the eastward there be no prospect visible of cross the lake which seem persistently to defy he meet he at every attempt with a barrier of stagnant mud there be nothing for it but to leave the interior unvisited by this route and to return to mount arden he divide he party send baxter the overseer with most of the man and store straight across to streaky bay where he have formerly make a camp while with the remainder he make he way to port lincoln have abandon he intention to penetrate to the interior on a northern course he now determine to push out westward to king george 's sound finding perhaps on the way across some inducement that would lead he north at port lincoln he could not obtain the extra supplies he want without send to adelaide it be therefore the 24th of October when he finally start for streaky bay he find that baxter have arrive there safely and be anxiously await he he now camp for many week at fowler 's bay which be as far as the cutter they now have the hero could act as convoy she charter not extend beyond south australian water the waterwitch have spring a leak the hero have take she place during the time that they remain there eyre make many journey ahead to estimate he chance of get across the dry and barren country intervene between he and the sound but the outlook be dishearten he meet some native who all assure he that there be no water ahead nor could he find any but some brackish water obtain by digging in some sandhill worse than all he sacrifice three of he best horse during these fruitless attempt on the 25th of January the hero arrive with the oats and bran he have send back for so poverty-stricken be the country that eyre in the circumstance resolve to send back nearly the whole of he expedition by the vessel and then with only a small party to push through to king george 's sound or perish in the attempt baffle successively to the north and to the west eyre have be put upon he mettle and he could not endure the thought of return to adelaide a beaten man on the 31st of January the cutter depart and eyre baxter and three native boy one of whom have come by the vessel on she last trip be leave alone to face the eight hundred mile of desert solitude before they some time be spend in make they final preparation but on the 24th of February they have actually begin they journey when to they astonishment they hear two shot fire at sea thinking that a whaler have put in to the bay eyre turn back but find the hero again in port with a urgent request from adelaide to abandon he desperate project and return in the vessel upon a man of eyre 's temperament this recall could have only one effect that of strengthen he resolve to proceed westward at all hazard he do not emulate cortez by burn he ship behind he but he none the less effectually deprive himself of means of retreat by dismiss the little hero it be at the close of a hot summer when eyre start and the nature of the sandy soil combine with the low prickly scrub soon begin to hamper they progress and render the lack of water especially severe on one side of they flank they line of march be the cliff of the great bight against which thunder the ever-restless southern roller on the other there stretch a limitless expanse of dark gloomy scrub they only hope of relief be the faint chance of strike some native path which might lead they to a infrequent soakage-spring even in these depressing circumstance eyre seem to have find time to express he admiration of nature as she then reveal herself to he : -- distressing and fatal as the continuance of these cliff might prove to we there be a grandeur and sublimity in they appearance that be most impose and which strike I with admiration stretch out before we in lofty unbroken outline they present the singular and romantic appearance of massy battlements of masonry support by huge buttress glitter in the morning sun which have now rise upon they and make the scene beautiful even amidst the danger and anxiety of we situation five day of slow drag toil pass until with the horse at they last gasp and the man baked and parched they find relief in some native well amongst the sandhill at a point where the cliff recede from the sea after rest for some day at this camp eyre mislead by a report he have obtain from the native again move forward take with he but a small supply of water when he have discover the blunder he have go forty mile and over this weary distance the horse have to return it be one of those mishap that help so much to wear out he unfortunate animal trouble after trouble now add itself to the burden of the explorer another five day have pass without water and they only hope rest upon some sandhill ahead see from the sea by flinder and mark by he upon he chart retreat be impossible and with they horse fail one after another they toil on desperate and well-nigh hopeless eyre 's anxiety be increase by baxter 's grow despondency and pessimistic view of the issue of they enterprise they be now travel along the sea beach firm and hard and ominously mark with wreckage they last drop of water have be consume and that morning they have be collect dew from the bush with a sponge as a last resource when they reach the sand-dunes they be almost too weak to search for a likely place to dig for water but make a final effort they discover a patch whence at six foot they obtain a supply of water it be now that eyre approach the grand crisis of he adventurous journey accord to the chart compile by flinder he have another long succession of cliff to encounter and he know that where these cliff come in and sternly front the ocean he need hope for no relief should this space be happily surmount by a desperate effort he hope to reach a kindlier country disaffection appear in he small camp baxter be always suggest and even urge a return perhaps some shadow of he tragic fate overhang he spirit the native boy be ripe for desertion and two of they do desert only to return in a few day starve and apparently repentant better for eyre have they go altogether amid such discouraging surroundings do eyre commence he last struggle with the cliff of the great bight the party have be tantalise by threaten cloud which never break in rain when on the third day they gather once more black and lower baxter urge eyre to camp that night instead of push on as rain seem certain and the rock hole by which they be then pass be well adapt to catch the slightest shower eyre consent against he better judgment it be necessary to watch the horse lest they should ramble too far and eyre keep the first watch the night be cold the wind blow a gale and drive the fly scud across the face of the moon the horse wander off in different direction in the scrub give the tired man much trouble to keep they together about half-past ten he drive they near the camp intend shortly to call the overseer to relieve he suddenly the dead stillness of the night and the wilderness be break by the report of a gun eyre be not at first alarmed think it be a signal of baxter 's to indicate the position of they camp he call but receive no answer hasten in the direction of the shot he be meet by wylie the king george 's sound native run towards he in great alarm cry out : oh massa massa come here and then lose speech from terror eyre be soon at the camp and one glance be enough to see that he purpose must now be pursue grimly alone baxter fatally wound be stretch upon the ground bleeding and choke in he last agony as eyre raise he faithful companion in he arm he expire at the dead hour of night in the wildest and most inhospitable waste of australium with the fierce wind rage in unison with the scene of violence before I i be leave with a single native whose fidelity i could not rely on and who for aught i know might be in league with the other two who perhaps be even now lurk about to take my life as they have do that of the overseer on examine the camp eyre find that the two boy have carry off both double-barrelled gun all the baked bread and other store and a keg of water all they have leave behind be a rifle with the barrel choke by a ball jam in it four gallon of water forty pound of flour and a little tea and sugar when he have time to think the matter over calmly eyre judge from the position of the body that baxter must have be arouse by the two native plunder the camp and that get up hastily to stop they he be immediately shoot he first care be to put he rifle into serviceable condition and then when morning break he hasten to leave the ill-omened place it be impossible to bury the body of he murder companion one unbroken sheet of rock cover the surface of the country for mile in every direction well might eyre

shudder even now when i think of they a lifetime be crowd into those few short hour and death alone may blot out the impression they produce the two murderer follow the white man and boy during the first day evade all eyre 's attempt to bring they to close quarter and call to the remain boy wylie who refuse to go to they they disappear the next morning and must have die miserably of thirst and starvation seven day pass without a drop of water for the horse before they reach the end of the line of cliff and providentially come to a native well amid the sand dune from this point water be more frequently obtain and what wretched horse they have leave show feeble symptom of renew life at last when they ration be completely exhaust they sight a ship at anchor in thistle cove she prove to be

sturt 's graphic account be at time somewhat misleading and the lapse of year have prove he denunciatory judgment of the fitness of the interior for human habitation to have be hasty but if we examine the circumstance in which he receive the impression he have record we must grant that he have considerable justification for he statement he be a broken and disappointed man wear out by disease and

he expect to find from the account give he by the native a fair-sized creek head from a low range visible at a distance to the north-west but he find the stream to be a mere surface channel distribute the flood water of the darling into some shallow lake about seven or eight mile distant sturt despatch poole and stuart to this range to see if they could obtain a glimpse of the country beyond to the north-west they return with the rather startling intelligence that from the top of a peak of the range poole have see a large lake stud with island although in he publish journal write some time after he return sturt make light of poole 's fancy lake which of course be the effect of a mirage at that time he ardent fancy and the extreme likelihood of the existence of a lake in that locality make he believe that he be on the eve of a important discovery in a letter to mr morphett of adelaide he write : -- poole have just return from the range i have not time to write over again he say there be high range to the north and north-west and water a sea extend along the horizon from south-west by south and then east of north in which there be a number of lofty range and island as far as the eye

the follow July before they would strike camp again this be the depot glen and a extract from sturt 's journal depict the situation of the party : -- it be not however until after we have run down every creek in the neighborhood and have traverse the country in every direction that the truth flash across my mind and it become evident to I that we be lock up in the desolate and heated region into which we have penetrate as effectually as if we have winter at the pole it be long indeed ere i could bring myself to believe that so great a misfortune have overtake we but so it be providence

they with the prospect of success it hold out suddenly they be confront with a wall of sand and for nearly twenty mile they toil over successive ridge fortunately they find both water and grass but the unexpected check to they brighter anticipation be depressing nor do a walk to the extremity of one of the ridge serve to raise they spirit sturt saw before he what he describe as a immense plain of a dark purple hue with a horizon like that of the sea boundless in the direction in which he wish to proceed this be sturt 's stony desert that night they camp within its dreary confines and during the next day cross a earthy plain with here and there a few bush of polygonum grow beside some straggling channel in which they occasionally find a little muddy rain-water remain at night when they camp just before dusk they sight some hill to the north and on examine they through the telescope they discern dark shadow on the face as if produce by cliff next morning they make for these hill in

they be enable to make easy stage for five day when the course of the creek be lose nor could any continuation be trace the lagoon too that be find a short distance from the bank prove to be intensely salt repeat effort to continue he journey to other point of the compass only lead sturt amongst the terrible sandhill they parallel row separate by barren plain encrust with salt sturt now come to the erroneous conclusion that he have reach the head of eyre 's creek and that further progress be effectually bar by a waterless tract of country in fact he be then within reach of a well-watered river along which he could have travel right up to the main divide range of the northern coast but sturt be baffle in the most depressed area on the surface of the continent where river and creek lose they identity in the numberless channel into which they divide before reach they final home in the thirsty shallows of the then unknown lake eyre there be neither sign nor clue afford he he man be sick and any further progress would jeopardise he retreat there be nothing for it but to fall back once more and after a toilsome journey they reach fort gray on the 2nd of October sturt 's last effort have be

he on the second day they reach strzeleckus creek and on the 13th they come on to the bank of a magnificent channel with fine tree grow on its grassy bank and abundance of water in the bed this be the now well-known cooper 's creek which sturt on he late trip have cross unnoticed as it be then dry and divide into several channel on they route this be the most important discovery make in connection with the lake system cooper 's creek be one of the far-reaching affluent its tributary drain the inland slope of the main divide range sturt on make this unexpected discovery be undecided whether to follow cooper 's creek up to the eastward or persevere in he original intention of push to the north a thunder-storm fall at the time make he adhere to he original determination and defer the examination of the new river until he return seven day after cross cooper 's creek he have the negative satisfaction of see he gloomy foreboding fulfil once more he gaze over the dreary waste of the stony desert unchanged and repellant as ever they cross it but be again turn back by sandhill and salt plain and force to retrace they step to cooper 's creek this creek sturt follow up for many day but find that it come from a more easterly direction than the route he desire to travel along moreover the one broad channel that they have commence to follow become divide into several ana-branch run through plain subject to inundation this become so tiring to they now exhaust horse who be woefully footsore that he reluctantly turn back he have find the creek people with well-nurtured native and the prospects of advance be brighter than they have ever be but both sturt and he man be weak and ill and the horse almost incapable of further effort moreover he be not certain of he retreat as they go down cooper 's creek on they way back they find that the water be dry up so rapidly that grave fear be entertain lest strzeleckus 's creek they main resource in get back to fort gray should be dry fortunately they be in time to find a little muddy fluid leave just enough to serve they need here though most anxious to get on they be force to camp the whole of one day on account of a extremely fierce hot wind sturt 's vivid account of the day spend during the blast of that furnace-like sirocco have be oft quote but the reader should remember when read it that the man who write it be in such a weakened condition that he have not sufficient energy leave to withstand the hot wind whilst the shade under which the party seek shelter be of the scantiest description they have still a distance of eighty-six mile to cover to get back to fort gray with but little prospect of finding water on the way after a long and weary ride they reach it only to find the tent strike the flag haul down and the fort abandon the bad state of the water and the steady diminution of supply have force browne to fall back to depot glen ride day and night sturt reach the old encampment so exhaust that he could hardly stand after dismount the problem of they final escape have now to be resolve the water in depot creek be reduce so low that they fear there would be none leave in flood 's creek if this fail they be once more imprison browne now much recover undertake the long ride of one hundred and eighteen mile which would decide the question preparation have be make for he journey by fill a bullock skin with water and send a dray with it as far as possible on the eighth day he return well browne ask sturt who be helpless in he tent what news be it good or bad there be still water in the creek reply browne but that be all i can say what there be be as black as ink and we must make haste for in a week it will be go the boat that be to have float over the inland sea be leave to rot at depot glen all the heaviest of the store be abandon and the retreat of over two hundred mile commence more bullock-skin be fashion into water-bag and with they aid and that of a scanty but kindly shower of rain they cross the dry stage to flood 's creek in safety here they find the growth of the vegetation much advanced and with care and constant activity in search ahead for water they gradually increase the distance from the scene of they suffering and approach the darling sturt have to be carry on one of the dray and lift on and off at each stopping-place on the 21st of December they arrive at the camp of the relief-party under piesse at williorara and sturt 's last expedition come to a end in take leave of this explorer we quote a short extract from he journal to show the exalted character of the man whom australian should ever regard with the greatest of pride : -- circumstance may yet arise to give a value to my recent labor and my name may be remember by after generation in australium as the first who try to penetrate to its center if i fail in that great object i have one consolation in the retrospect of my past service my path among savage tribe have be a bloodless one not but that i have often be place in situation of risk and danger when i might have be justify in shed blood but i trust i have ever make allowance for human timidity and respect the custom of the rudest people sturt 's health and eyesight have be greatly impair by he last trip but although he be for a time almost totally blind he still manage to discharge the duty of colonial secretary he be at last pension by the south australian government and soon afterwards return to england he die at he residence at cheltenham though the home office have treat he disgracefully during he life and ignore he service he live for ever in the heart of the australian as the hero and chief figure of the exploration of they country when he be on he death-bed in 1869 the empty title of knighthood be confer upon he as he could not enjoy the tardy honor he widow who live until 1887 be graciously allow to wear the bauble chapter 13 babbage and stuart 131 b herschel babbage -lrb- illustration b herschel babbage bear 1815 die 1878 -rrb- the unsolved problem of the extent and other detail of that vast region of salt lake and flat country then know under the generic name of lake torren still greatly occupy the attention and excite the imagination of the colonist of south australia and the account bring back by the different explore party be conflict in the extreme in 1851 two squatter name oakden and hulke out run-hunting push westward of lake torren and find suitable grazing country they also discover a lake of fresh water and hear from the native of other lake to the north-west some fabulous legend of strange animal they horse give in oakden and hulke return but although they apply for a squat licence for the country they have be over it be not then settle or stock in 1856 surveyor babbage make some exploration in the field partly traverse by eyre and frome he penetrate through the plain that be suppose to occupy the central portion of the horseshoe formation at that time associate in the public opinion with lake torren more fortunate than he predecessor he find permanent water in a gum-tree creek and see some fair-sized sheet of water one of which he name blanche water or lake blanche some further excursion lead to the discovery of more fresh water and well-grassed pastoral country the aboriginal too direct he to what they say be a crossing-place in that portion of lake torren that have be sight in 1845 by poole and browne of captain sturt 's party when poole think he see a inland sea they direction however prove unreliable or babbage fail to find the place for he lose he horse in the attempt to cross the lake in 1857 another excursion to the westward of lake torren be make by a mr campbell who discover a creek of fresh water which he call the elizabeth he also visit lake torren of which he report in similar term to those of previous explorer -- that it be surround with barren country in April of the same year a survey conduct by deputy surveyor-general goyder over the same country as that lately explore by babbage lead to some absurd mistake a few mile north of blanche water he come to many surface spring surround a fine lagoon to the north of they be a isolate hill which he call weathered hill from the summit of this hill he have a curious example of the effect of refraction in this region in a similar illusion to that which suggest poole 's inland sea to the northward he see a belt of gigantic gum-tree and beyond they what appear to be a sheet of water with elevated land on the far side to the eastward be another large lake but all this be but the glamourie of the desert -- on closer examination the gigantic gum dwindle down to stunt bush and the mountainous ground to broken clod of earth but the greatest surprise reserve for goyder be at lake torren where he find the water quite fresh he describe the lake as stretch from fifteen to twenty mile to the north-west with a water horizon with a extensive bay form to the southward while to the north a bluff headland and perpendicular cliff be clearly to be discern with the telescope from the appearance of the flood-marks goyder come to the conclusion that there be little or no rise and fall in the lake draw the natural conclusion that its size be such as not to be influence appreciably by flood water but that it absorb they without show any variation in its level adelaide be overjoy at the news the threatening desert that hem in they fair province to the north be suddenly convert into a land of milk and honey the surveyor-general colonel freeling immediately start out take with he both a boat and a iron punt with which to float on these new water but there be a sudden fall to they hope when a letter be receive from he state that the cliff the bay and the head-land be all build up on the airy foundation of a mirage the elf and sprite of this desolate region have be play a hoax upon goyder 's party but it be no wonder that goyder have be so open to deception after unexpectedly find fresh water in the lake that have be so long know as salter than the sea on reach the lake freeling find the water still almost fresh but one of goyder 's man who accompany he tell he that it have already recede half-a-mile since the latter 's visit a attempt to float the punt be make but after drag it through mud and a few inch of water for a quarter of a mile the man abandon the attempt as hopeless freeling and some of the party then start to wade through the slush but after proceed three mile and then sound only six inch of water they return some of the more adventurous extend they muddy wade but only meet with a similar result lake torren be re-invest with its evil name only somewhat shrunken in proportion in the same year 1857 stephen hack start with a party from streaky bay to examine the gawler range of eyre and investigate the country west of lake torren he reach the gawler range and examine the country very carefully find numerous fresh-water spring and large plain cover with both grass and saltbush he also discover a large salt lake lake gairdner simultaneously with hack 's expedition a party under major warburton be out in the same neighborhood in fact hack 's party cross warburton 's track on one or two occasion strange to say the report of the two be flatly contradictory warburton describe the country as dry and arid but hack 's account be distinctly favourable of the two man however it be most probable that hack possess the more experience and knowledge of country and moreover time the great arbitrator have endorse he word the year 1857 see much exploration do in south australia one party consist of swinden campbell thompson and stock at about seventy mile from the head of spencer 's gulf find good pastoral country and a permanent water-hole call by the native pernatty to the north they come upon campbell 's former discovery of the elizabeth but they provision fail they be force to return a month afterwards swinden start again from pernatty north of the gawler range he find available pastoral country which become know as swinden 's country during this year also miller and dutton explore the country at the back of fowler 's bay forty mile to the north they see treeless grassy plain stretch far inland but could find no permanent water warburton afterwards report in depreciatory term of this region but delisser and hardwicke who also visit it state that it would make first-class pastoral country if only surface water could be obtain during the whole of warburton 's career he judgment of the pastoral value of country seem to have be lamentably defective he make no allowance for the vary nature of the season a suggestion that he make to the south australian government to explore the interior which have turn back such man as sturt and gregory with the aid of the police verge on the ludicrous in 1858 the south australian government vote a sum of money to fit out a party to continue the northern exploration this party be put under the leadership of babbage but he be not give a free hand be hamper with official instruction and there be no allowance make for unforeseen exigency he instruction be to examine the country between lake torren and gairdner and to map the respective western and eastern shore of the two lake so as to remove for the future any doubt as to they actual formation and accurate position this alone apart from any extended exploration mean a work of considerable time but unfortunately for the surveyor in charge the general public be just then eager for fresh discovery of available pastoral land and be incline to regard survey work as of secondary importance it take several month to complete the survey work of the two lake and when babbage return to port augusta he find that harri the second in command of he depot camp have start to return to adelaide with many of the dray and horse babbage ride one hundred and sixty mile before he overtake he at mount remarkable and there learn that the south australian government have change its official mind with regard to the conduct of the expedition and have decide that it should be conduct in future with pack-horse only it be ac gregory 's arrival in adelaide with pack-horse from he last expedition down the barcoo that have lead to this change of tactic charle gregory who have accompany he brother be now engage by the government to overtake babbage and acquaint he with they intention but when he reach port augusta gregory take it upon himself to order the dray home babbage be away survey babbage overtake they and order they back but plead government order they refuse to return babbage write to the authority point out the unfairness of they action and muster up a small party return to continue he work with six month ' provision on this occasion babbage give more time to discovery than he have do before he go out beyond the boundary of he survey and push on to chamber creek so call by stuart who discover it while babbage be busy at lake gairdner babbage trace chamber creek into lake eyre and be thus the first discoverer of this lake which he call lake gregory he find a range which he call hermit range but from its crest discern no sign of lake torren thus settle a certain limit to its extension to the north he make further exploration to the west of lake gregory now lake eyre and find some hot spring meanwhile during the time he be make these research the government have in a very high-handed manner appoint warburton to supersede he warburton start out to find babbage take charle gregory as he second fail to find he at the elizabeth he follow and overtake he at the newly-discovered lake gregory warburton make a few discovery while seek for babbage amongst they the dougla a creek which be afterwards of great assistance to stuart and the davenport range and he also come upon some fair pastoral country babbage 's survey and exploration have do much to clear up the mystery and confusion that have hitherto obscure the geography of the salt lake region he discovery of lake eyre -lrb- gregory -rrb- and of the complete isolation of lake torren reduce the component part of that huge saline basin to some sort of method and order in addition to these achievement surveyor parry make some further discovery both of fresh water and available pastoral country to the eastward of the lake b herschel babbage be the eldest son of the well-known inventor of the calculate machine he have be educate as a engineer and for a considerable time have follow he profession in europe he have be engage on several main line in england and have work in conjunction with the celebrated brunel he have also be commission by the government of piedmont to report on a line across the alp by way of mount ceni he have remain in italy some year until he work be interrupt by the revolution he have return to england and have subsequently come to south australia in 1851 in the ship hydaspe he die at he residence in 1878 at st mary 's south road where he have a vineyard 132 john mcdouall stuart -lrb- illustration john mcdouall stuart -rrb- john mcdouall stuart the great explorer of the center of australium arrive in south australia in 1839 he first experience of australian exploration be sufficiently try gain as it be when he be act as a draughtsman with captain sturt on he last arduous expedition but it have kindle in he a high ardor for discovery and foster a stubborn resolution to carry through whatever he undertake he commence he early exploration when in a position to do so independently to the north-west of swinden 's country in search of some locality call by the native wingillpin not find it he come to the strange conclusion that wingillpin and cooper 's creek be one and the same although he be now on a different watershed he also at that period seem to have entertain somewhat extensive notion of the course of cooper 's creek as in one part of he journal he remark : -- my only hope of cut cooper 's creek be on the other side of the range the plain we cross to-day resemble those of the cooper also the grass if it be not there it must run to the north-west and form the glenelg of captain gray now although we know that gray hold rather extravagant notion of the importance of the glenelg even he would not have think it possible for the glenelg to be the outlet of such a mighty river as cooper 's creek would have become by the time it reach the north-west coast stuart 's horse be now too footsore to proceed over the stony country he find himself then in and he have no spare shoe with he fail therefore to find the promised land of wingillpin although he have pass over much good and well-watered country he turn to the south-west and make some exploration in the neighborhood of lake gairdner before this however he have find and name chamber creek from lake gairdner he steer for fowler 's bay and he description of some of the country he pass be anything but invite from a spur of the high peak that he name mount finke he see : -- a prospect gloomy in the extreme : i could see a long distance but nothing meet the eye save a dense scrub as black and dismal as night -lrb- map stuart 's route 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 burke and will 's route 1860 and 1861 -rrb- from this point the party pass into a sandy spinifex desert which stuart say be worse than sturt 's there have be a little salt-bush there but here there be nothing but spinifex to be find and the barren ground provide no food of any kind for the horse the state of affair be become desperate with the little band as they provision be nearly finish and though the leader be tempt to persist in the search for good pastoral country he be at last force to abandon the search and beat a hasty retreat dense scrub and the same dreary dismal desert as he call it in he journal surround they day after day tire out and half-starved they reach the coast and have but two meal leave to carry they to streaky bay where they find relief at gibson 's station here the sudden change from starvation to a full diet invalide most of they and stuart himself be very ill for some day finally they reach thompson 's station at mount arden and there stuart 's first expedition terminate but this severe test only whet stuart 's appetite for further exploration and in April 1859 he make another start after cross over some of the already-traversed country hergott one of he companion find the now well-known spring that bear he name stuart cross he former discovery of chamber creek and make for the davenport range discover by warburton finding many of the mound spring that characterize some part of the interior on the 6th of June he discover a large creek which he call the neale it run through very good country and stuart follow it down hope to find it increase in volume and value as he go in this he be not disappoint as large plain cover with salt-bush and grass be find and the party encounter several more spring after satisfy himself of the extent and economic value of the country he have find stuart be oblige to return for he horse ' shoe have again wear out and he have a lively and painful remembrance of the misery which he horse have suffer before from the lack of they in November of the same year he make a third expedition in the vicinity of lake eyre but there be little of interest attach to the journal of this trip as he course be mostly over closely explore country he reach the neale again and institute a survey of the promising pastoral country he have traverse during he last trip approach at time to within sight of what he call in he journal lake torren but which in reality be what be now know as lake eyre all these minor expedition of stuart 's may be look upon as preparatory to he great struggle to find a available passage through the unknown fastness of the center of the continent it be in 1860 that stuart make the first of he daring and stubborn attempt to cross australium from south to north the south australian government have offer a standing reward of 2000 pound for the man who should first succeed in this undertaking stuart 's party on he first trip be but a very small one : three man in all with but thirteen horse it read lilliputian compare with the princely cavalcade that later on set out with burke to travel over comparatively well-known country involve only a short excursion through a land without natural difficulty or obstacle and yet it actually achieve the greatest part of the task set it stuart start from chamber creek but for part of the journey he be of course travel over country that be fairly well-known by that time after pass the neale he enter untrodden country which prove to be good available pastoral land numerous well-watered creek be pass which be name respectively the frew the finke and the stevenson and on the 6th of April they reach a hill of a remarkable shape which have for some time attract and excite they attention and curiosity they find it to be a column of sandstone on the apex of a hill the hill be but a low one of a few hundred foot in height but the sandstone column that surmount it be one hundred and fifty foot in height and twenty foot in width this striking object be name by stuart chamber pillar to commemorate a friend who have assist he greatly in he exploration it stand amongst other elevation of fantastic shape and grotesque formation resemble ruin fort and castle on the 9th of April they sight two remarkable bluff and on the 12th reach the range of which the bluff form the center the eastern bluff be call brinkley bluff and the western hanson bluff the range which be now well-known as a lead geographical feature of australium and on which the most elevated peak in the interior have since be find stuart name the macdonnell range after the then governor of south australia the little band cross the range which be rough but have good grass on its slope there be however a scarcity of water for they be now approach the tropical line and on reach the northern slope of the range find themselves amongst spinifex and scrub and oblige to undergo two night without water for the horse at a high peak which be name mount freel they find a small supply and as it be now evident that there be dry country ahead a more careful search be make before push any further forward in order to ensure certain means of retreat fortunately they find amongst some ledge of rock a large natural reservoir which promise to be permanent and capable of supply they want on they homeward way on the 22nd of April stuart camp in the center of australium on the spot which he former leader sturt have vainly undergo so much suffer to reach and he feeling of elation must have be temper with regret that he old leader be not then with he to share this success about two mile and a half to the north-north-east there be a tolerably high hill which he call in reality central mount sturt it be now however erroneously call stuart owe to the publisher of he diary have misread he manuscript have in company with he tried companion kekwick climb the mount he erect a cairn of stone at the top and hoist the union jack they then recommence they northern journey that night they camp without find water but the next morning be lucky enough to get a permanent supply then ensue much delay cause by fruitless attempt to strike either to the eastward or the westward stuart try on several occasion to reach the head of the victorium river but fail and sacrifice some horse on a creek he call the phillip some native be encounter who accord to stuart make and answer a masonic sign to the north of this spot the explorer come to a large gum-tree creek with very fair-sized sheet of water in it as they follow down they pass a encampment of native but keep steadily on they course without interfere with they not find any water lower down the creek the party have to return and when close to the creek at the point where they have cross that morning they be suddenly surround by a mob of armed and painted savage who have emerge unexpectedly from concealment in a clump of scrub to all attempt at peaceful parley they return shower of boomerang and club until the whites be compel in self-defence to fire on they even then they be not deter from follow the party even up to the camp of the night before this incident cause stuart to hesitate he party be so small that the loss or even disablement of one man would have cripple the expedition and they have already lose a good many horse he therefore wisely decide to fall back as they have penetrate far enough to prove that the passage of the continent could be effect with a few more man it be on the 27th of June that he begin he homeward march and on the 26th of August he reach brodie 's camp at hamilton spring with the strength of all much reduce and stuart himself suffer from scurvy after the result of stuart 's journey have be report in adelaide and it be see how inadequate mean only have lead to he defeat the government vote 2500 pound to equip a better-organized party of this he be to take command stuart judge it best to keep he old track by way of the finke and the hugh on the 12th of April they arrive at the bonney and find it run strong with abundance of good feed on the bank they be betray into follow it down but it soon spread abroad and be lose in a large plain leave the bonney they adhere to the old route and reach tennant 's creek on the 21st of April and four day afterwards they be on the scene of the attack that have be make on they at attack creek but although the track of the native be numerous the explorer be at this time permit to pass on in peace keep at the foot of the low range which there have a approximate northerly and southerly direction stuart cross many creek which promise long course where they form in the range but which be all alike lose when they reach the level country on the 4th of may they attain to the northern termination of this range which he call the ashburton range here he make several attempt to the north and north-west but could discover neither water nor watercourse in those direction nothing indeed but plain beautifully grass but heavy to ride over and yield under the horse ' foot beyond these plain the country change for the worse and become sandy and scrubby on the 16th of may he encounter a new description of scrub that grow in a very obstructive manner and be now know as stuart 's desert hedgewood on the 23rd he find a magnificent sheet of permanent water which he call the newcastle water and at first he judge that a clear way north be now assure but he be delude for beyond these water he could not advance he party a mile north north-east and north-west there be the one outlook -- endless grassy plain terminate in dense scrubby forest country he have to give up all hope for the present and return to adelaide such however be the confidence of the authority in he and such he own energy that in less than a month after he arrival in adelaide he be on he way to chamber creek to make preparation for a fresh departure he last two journey have prove the existence of a long line of good country fairly well-watered and although beyond it he have not be able to gain a footing still there be no know what a fresh endeavor would bring to light he have bring he party back in safety with the loss of only a few horse and have actually reach in point of position as low a latitude as the victorian explorer have do and that with a more difficult country to travel through without camel and with a inferior equipment in all other respects it be not necessary again to follow stuart 's horse-track over the northern way he be now pursue for the third time on the 14th of April 1862 we find he encamp at the northern end of newcastle water once more about to force a passage through the forest of waterless scrub to the north on the second day he be partly successful find a isolate waterhole surround by conglomerate rock this he call frew 's pond and it be now a well-known camping-place for traveller on the overland telegraph line past this spot he be not able to make any progress twice he make strenuous but vain effort to reach some tributary of the victorium river he then spend many day ride through dense mulga and hedgewood scrub at length after much hope defer find a few scanty waterhole that do not serve the purpose he have in view he succeed in strike the head of a chain of pond run in a northerly direction these be follow down lead he to the head of the creek now call daly water creek and finally to the large waterhole on which the present telegraph station bear the name of daly water stand the creek be then lose in a swamp and stuart be unable to find the channel where it reform which have since be name the birdum miss this water-guide stuart work he way to the eastward to a creek he name the strangway which lead he down to the roper river a river which he have never strive to reach he sole aim be the victorium he cross the roper and follow up a northern tributary which he name after he constant friend john chamber scarcity of water be now a thing of the past but he stock of spare horseshoe have to be most jealously guard for he horse be begin to fall lame the country he be on be very stony and he be far remove from adelaide from the chamber he come to the lower course of a creek call by leichhardt flying-fox creek re-name by stuart the katherine the name it now bear thence he strike across the stony tableland and descend on the head water of a river which he christen the adelaide and on follow this river down he find himself in rich tropical scenery which tell he that at last he be approach the sea-shore on the 24th of July he turn a little to the north-east intend to strike the sea-beach and travel along it to the mouth of the adelaide he tell only two of the party of the eventful moment await they as they ride on thring who be ride ahead suddenly call out the sea which so take the majority by surprise that they be some time before they understand what be mean and then three hearty cheer be give at this he first point of contact with the ocean stuart dip he foot and hand in the sea as at last he gaze across the water he have so perseveringly strive for year to reach he attempt to get to the mouth of the adelaide river along the beach but find it too boggy for the horse wish to husband the force at he command stuart wisely resolve to push no further he have a space clear where they be and a tall sapling strip of its bough to serve as a flagstaff on this he hoist the union jack which he have carry with he a record of they arrival contain in a air-tight case be then bury at the foot of the impromptu staff and stuart cut he initial on the largest tree he could find the tree have since be find and recognize but the bury memorial have not be discover more fortunate than the ill-fated burke stuart survey the open sea from he point of contact with the ocean instead of have to be content with some mangrove tree and salt water mcdouall stuart whose last expedition we have thus follow out to its successful end be rightly consider the man to whom the credit for the first cross the continent be due he victory be all he own he have follow in no other person 's footstep he have cross the true center and he have make the coast at a point much further to the north than that reach by burke and will they journey have be considerably shorten by its northern end be place on the southern shore of the great gulf that bite so deeply into north australium along stuart 's track there be now erect the overland telegraph line a enduring monument to he indomitable perseverance stuart 's health be fast fail and he horse be sadly reduce in strength he therefore start back the day after the consummation of he dearest ambition on he way south after leave newcastle water he find the water in many of the short creek head from the ashburton range to be rapidly diminish in some there be none leave in other it be fast dry the horse commence to give in rapidly one after the other and more be lose on successive dry stage stuart himself think that he would never live to see the settle district scurvy have bring he down to a lamentable state and after all he hard-won success it seem as though he would not profit by it he right hand have become useless to he and he eye lose power of sight after sunset he could not undergo the pain of ride and a stretcher have to be sling between two horse to carry he on with painful slowness they creep along until they reach mount margaret the first station here the leader reduce to a mere skeleton be furnish with a little relief and after rest and gain a little strength he ride on to adelaide this be stuart 's last expedition for he never recover he health nor former eyesight he be reward by the government of the colony which he have serve so well and be award the gold medal of the royal geographical society he go to reside in england where he die in the year 1869 on the 16th of July chapter 14 burke and will -lrb- illustration robert o'hara burke from a photograph in the possession of ej welch of the howitt relief expedition illustration william john will from a photo in possession of ej welch of the howitt relief expedition illustration john king from a photo in the possession of ej welch -rrb- we have now to deal with a explore expedition of greater notoriety than that of any similar enterprise in the annals of australium though its result in the way of actual exploration in the true meaning of the term be quite insignificant the expedition could not reasonably hope to reveal any new geographical condition for the nature of the country to be traverse be fairly well-known : there be no such expanse of unknown territory along the suggest course of travel as to justify the anticipation of any discovery of magnitude both kennedy and gregory have follow much the same line of route when trace the course of the barcoo and cooper 's creek a short distance to the eastward the only apparent motive for the expedition seem to have be not particularly creditable the desire to outdo stuart who after nearly accomplish the task might well have be allow the honor of complete it but time be after all the great arbitrator : stuart re-enter adelaide successful on the same day that the body of burke and will arrive for shipment to melbourne robert o'hara burke be bear in the county of galway in ireland in 1821 he be the second son of john hardiman burke of st cleran and be educate in belgium in 1840 he enter the austrian army in which he rise to the rank of captain in 1848 he join the royal irish constabulary but five year later emigrate to tasmanium thence he go to victorium where he enter the local police force and become a inspector such be he position when he be offer the command of the expedition which end in he death william john will be bear at totne in devonshire he be the son of a medical man and after he arrival in victorium in 1852 he lead for a time a bush life on the edward river he be later employ as a surveyor in melbourne and then become assistant to professor neumayer at the melbourne observatory a post he quit in order to act as assistant-surveyor on the ill-starred journey sentiment and a hysterical sentiment at that seem to have dominate this expedition throughout there be no urgent necessity for victorium to equip and send forth a explore expedition she rich and compact little province be know from end to end and she have no surplus territory in which to open up fresh field of pastoral occupation for she son but she people become possess with the explore spirit and the planning and execution of the scheme be a signal indication of national patriotism and if sense and not sentiment have mark the counsel the result might have confer rich benefit upon australium the necessary fund be make up as follow : 6000 pound vote by government 1000 pound present by mr ambrose kyte and the balance of the first expenditure of 12000 pound make up by public subscription but the final cost of the expedition and of the relief party amount to 57000 pound and the exploratory work do by the different relief party far and away exceed in geographical result the small amount effect by the original expedition a committee of management be appoint and to he interest with this committee burke owe he elevation to the position of leader he seem to have be support by that sort of general testimony which fit a man to apply for nearly any position but of special aptitude and training for the work to be do he have none he be frank openhearted impetuous and endowed with all those quality which make he a great favorite with woman moreover he service in the austrian army have give people a exaggerated notion of he ability to command and organize it would appear on the whole that he appointment be due solely to the influence he wield and to he personal popularity will appear to have be a man gifted with many of the quality essential for efficient discharge of the duty and responsibility appertain to the post he hold but he amiable disposition allow he to be influence too readily in council by the rash and foolish judgment of he impetuous superior if for instance he have persist in combate burke 's incomprehensible plan of leave the depot for mount hopeless the last fatality would never have occur when the expedition leave melbourne it be amid the shout and hurrah of acclaim thousand who probably have not the faintest idea of the easy task that the explorer with they impose retinue and outfit have before they in fact with all the resource at burke 's command a favourable season and good open country the excursion would have be a mere picnic to most man of experience a number of camel have be specially import from indium at a cost of 5500 pound gj landell come to the country in charge of they and have be appoint second in command long before they leave the settle district burke quarrel with he whereupon he resign and return to melbourne there he openly declare that under burke 's control the expedition would assuredly meet with disaster will be then appoint second by burke and wright who be suppose to be acquaint with the locality which they be approach be engage as third another most unfortunate selection besides those already mention there be dr hermann beckler medical officer and botanist and dr ludwig becker artist naturalist and geologist ten white assistant and three camel-driver the expedition in full reach menindie on the darling where wright join they on the 19th of October 1860 burke will six man five horse and sixteen camel leave menindie for cooper 's creek wright go with they two hundred mile to indicate the best route and then return to take charge of the main body wait at menindie on the 11th of November burke with the advance party reach cooper 's creek where they camp and await the arrival of wright with the rest grass and water be both plentiful and the journey have hitherto prove no more arduous than a ordinary over-landing trip the long delay and inaction work sadly upon burke 's active and impatient temperament and he suddenly announce he intention to subdivide he party and with three man to start across the belt of unknown country -- a distance of five hundred mile at the furthest -- that separated he from gregory 's track round the gulf although he lavish outfit have be purchase specially to explore this comparatively small extent of land he thus deliberately leave it behind he during the most critical part of the journey he have with he no means of follow up any discovery he might make and he botanist and naturalist and geologist be also leave behind he kill time for a little while by make short excursion northward and then on the 16th of December impatient of further delay he start with will and two man for carpentarium the other be leave with verbal instruction to wait three month for he thus disperse and neglect he leave the costly equipment contain within itself all the element of successful geographical research certainly this be not the plan that have be anticipate by the promoter and organiser we have now at this stage the spectacle of the main body loitering on the outskirts of the settle district four man kill time on the bank of cooper 's creek and the leader and three other scamper across the continent all four of they utterly inexperienced in bushcraft as might have be expect the result of the journey be most barren : will 's diary be sadly uninteresting and burke make only a few scanty note at the end of which he write : 28th march at the conclusion of report it would be as well to say that we reach the sea but we could not obtain a view of the open ocean although we make every endeavor to do so shortly condense will 's diary we gather the follow account of they route the first point they intend to reach be eyre 's creek but before arrive at it they discover a fine watercourse come from the north which take they a long distance in the direction they desire to follow this watercourse which mckinlay afterwards call the mueller begin in time to lead they step too much to the eastward in which direction lay its source they therefore quit it and keep due north follow a tributary well-supplied with both grass and water this tributary lead they well on to the northern divide range which they cross without difficulty come down on to the head of the cloncurry river by trace that river down they reach the flinder river which they follow down to the mangrove and salt water they be however considerably out in they longitude for they think that they be on the albert over one hundred mile to the westward -lrb- illustration scene on cooper 's creek -lrb- after howitt -rrb- 1 burke 's grave 2 where king be find 3

have so often distinguish other explore expedition fall on evil day gray become ill and take some extra flour to make a little gruel with for this infringement of rule burke personally chastise he a few day afterwards will write in he diary that they have to halt and send back for gray who be gammon that he could not walk nine day afterwards the unfortunate man die a act which be not often successfully gammon but to bring the miserable story to a end at last on the evening of the 21st of April 1861 two month after they have reach the gulf they re-enter the depot camp at cooper 's creek where four man have be instruct to await they return only to find it desert and lifeless keenly disappoint for though they know they be behind the appoint time they have still hope that some one would have wait for they they search the locality for some sign or message from they friend and on a tree see the word dig carve beneath this message of hope they be soon busy digging and before long they unearth a welcome store of provision and a letter which run : -- depot cooper 's creek April 21 1861 the depot party of vee \* leave this camp to-day to return to the darling i intend to go south-east

singular and fatal oversight -- that almost seem pre-ordained by mock fate burke consult he companion as to the feasibility of they overtake brahe and they both agree that in they tired and enfeebled

not seem to have occur to either of the leader it will be see further on how this scarcely credible omission be a main factor in decide they fate as they progress slowly down the creek one of the two camel become bog and have to be shoot where it lay the wanderer cut off what meat there be on the body and stay two or three day to dry it in the sun the one camel have now to carry what they have except the bundle that the man bear each some twenty-five pound in weight they make but little progress the creek split up into many channel that run out into earthy plain and at last when they one beast of burden give in they have to acknowledge defeat and commence to return after shoot the wretched camel and dry he flesh the man try to live like the black on fish and nardoo the seed of a small plant of which the native make flour but the struggle for existence be very hard they be not expert hunter and the native who be at first friendly and share they food with they soon out-grow the novelty of they presence begin to find they a encumbrance and constantly shift camp to avoid the burden of they support on the 27th of may will go forward alone to visit the depot and deposit there the journal and a note state they condition he reach there on the 30th and write in he diary that no trace of anyone except black have be here since we leave but while they be absent down the creek brahe and wright have visit the place and finding no sign of they return and the cache apparently untouch have ride away conclude that they have not yet come back this be the note that will leave : --

companion in misfortune some friendly native feed he on he way back to they during the intercourse that of necessity they have with the native along cooper 's creek they have notice the extensive use make by they of the seed of the nardoo plant but for a long time they have be unable to find this plant nor would the black show it to they at last king accidentally find it and by its aid they manage to prolong they life but the seed have to be gather clean pound and cook and in comparison with all this labor the nourishment afford by the cake be very slight a occasional crow or hawk be shoot and a little fish now and then beg from the native as they be sink rapidly it be at last decide that burke and king should go up the creek and endeavor to find the main camp of the native and obtain food from they will who be now so weak as to be unable to move be leave lie under some bough with a eight day ' supply of nardoo and water the other trust that within that period they would have return to he on the 26th of June the two man start and poor will be leave to meet death alone by the entry in he diary which he keep write up as long as he strength remain he evidently retain consciousness almost to the last so exhaust be he that death must have come to he as a merciful release from the pain of live he last entry although give evidence of fading faculty be almost cheerful he jocularly allude to himself as micawber wait for something to turn up but it be evident that he have give up hope and be wait for death 's approach calm and resign without fear like a good and gallant man burke and king do not advance far on the second day burke have to give in from sheer weakness the next morning when he companion look at he he see by the break light that he leader be dead the last entry in burke 's pocket-book run thus : -- i hope we shall be do justice to we have fulfil we task but have be aban -- we have not be follow up as we expect and the depot party abandon they postking have behave nobly he have stay with I to the last and place the pistol in my hand leave I lie on the surface as i wish leave to himself king wander about in search of the native and not find they the lonely man return to the spot where they have leave will and find that he trouble too be over he cover up the corpse with a little sand and then leave once more in search of the native this time he find they and move by he solitary condition they help he to live until rescue by howitt 's party on September 15th -lrb- illustration edwin j welch second in command of the howitt relief expedition and the first man to find king -rrb- meanwhile the absence of any news from wright in charge of the main body be begin to create a feeling of uneasiness in melbourne a light party have already be equip under aw howitt to follow up burke 's track when suddenly despatch from the darling arrive from wright tell of the non-arrival of the four man howitt 's party be double and he be immediately send off to cooper 's creek to commence a search for the miss man he have not far to go on the 13th of September he arrive at the fateful depot camp on cooper 's creek with brahe he immediately commence to follow or try to follow burke 's outward track but on Sunday the 15th while still on cooper 's creek king be find by ej welch the second in command of the relief party welch 's account of the finding of king be as follow : -- after travel about three mile my attention be attract by a number of nigger on the opposite bank of the creek who shout loudly as soon as they see I and vigorously wave and point down the creek a feeling of something about to happen excited I somewhat but i little expect what the sequel be to be move cautiously on through the undergrowth which line the bank of the creek the black keep pace on the opposite side they cry increase in volume and intensity when suddenly round a bend i be startle to see a large body of they gather on a sandy neck in the bed of the creek between two large waterhole immediately they see I they too commence to howl and wave they weapon in the air i at once pull up and consider the propriety of wait the arrival of the party for i feel far from satisfy with regard to they intention but here for the first time my favorite horse -- a black cob know in the camp as piggy a murray downs breed stock-horse of good repute both for foot and temper -- appear to think that he work be cut out for he and the time have arrive in which to do it paw and snort at the noise he suddenly slew round and head down the steep bank through the undergrowth straight for the crowd as he have be wont to do after many a mob of weaner on he native plain the black draw hurriedly back to the top of the opposite bank shout and gesticulate violently and leave one solitary figure apparently cover with some scarecrow rag and part of a hat prominently alone in the sand before i could pull up i have pass it and as i pass it totter throw up its hand in the attitude of prayer and fall on the sand the heavy sand help I to conquer piggy on the level and when i turn back the figure have partially rise hastily dismount i be soon beside it excitedly ask : ` who in the name of wonder be you ' he answer ' i be king sir ' for the moment i do not grasp the thought that the object of we search be attain for king be only one of the undistinguished member of the party he name be unfamiliar to I ` king ' i repeat ` yes ' he say ` the last man of the explore expedition ' ` what burke 's ' ` yes ' he say ` where be he -- and will ' ` dead both dead long ago ' and again he fall to the ground then i know who stand before I jump into the saddle and ride up the bank i fire two or three revolver shot to attract the attention of the party and on they come up send the other black boy to cut howitt 's track and bring he back to camp we then put up a tent to shelter the rescue man and by degree we get from he the sad story of the death of he leader we get it at interval only between the long rest which he exhaust condition compel he to take as soon as king have recover enough strength to accompany the party they go to the place where will have breathe he last and find he body in the gunyah as king have describe it there it be bury on the 21st burke 's body be find up the creek he too be at first bury where he die howitt after reward the black who have care for king start back for melbourne by easy stage on he arrival there he be send back to disinter the remains of the dead a task which he and welch safely accomplish bring the body down by way of adelaide dr becker stone purcell and patton be the other whose life be sacrifice on this expedition so marked with disaster these victim receive no token of public recognition of they fate although a public funeral be accord to burke and will and a statue have be erect to they memory in melbourne -lrb- illustration the burke and will statue melbourne -rrb- the foolish and unaccountable oversight of burke and he companion in not mark a tree or otherwise leave some recognisable sign of they return at the depot seem to have lead brahe astray completely he state he side of the case as follow : -- mr burke 's return be so soon after my departure cause the track of he camel to correspond in the character of age exactly with we own track the remains of three separate fire lead we to suppose that black have be camp therethe ground above the cache be so perfectly restore to the appearance it present when i leave it that in the absence of any fresh sign or mark of any description to be see near it be impossible to suppose that it have be disturb the story of the lose explorer create intense excitement throughout the other colony queensland as the colony wherein the explorer be suppose to have meet with disaster send out two search party the victorium a steam sloop be send up to the mouth of the albert river in the gulf of carpentarium have on board william landsborough with george bourne as second in command and a small and efficient party another queensland expedition under fred walker leave the furthest station in the rockhampton district and from south australia john mckinlay start to traverse the continent on much the same line of route as that take by the unhappy man chapter 15 the relief expedition and attempt towards perth 151 john mckinlay john mckinlay be bear at sandbank on the clyde in 1819 he first come to the colony of new south wale in 1836 and join he uncle a prosperous grazier under whose guidance he soon become a good bushman with a ardent love of bush life he take up several run near the south australian border and thenceforth become associate with that province in 1861 he be appoint leader of the south australian relief party and start from adelaide on October 26th on arrive at blanche water he hear a vague rumor from the black that white man and camel have be see at a distant inland water but put little faith in the story he traverse lake torren and striking north cross the lower end of cooper 's creek at a point where the main watercourse be lose in a maze of channel here he learn definite and particular detail respect the rumor white man and think there might be some groundwork of truth in the report he now press forward to the locality indicate have form a depot camp he go ahead with two white man and a native pass through a belt of country with numerous small shallow lakelet they come to a watercourse whereon they find sign of a grave and they pick up a batter pint-pot next morning feeling sure that the ground have be disturb with a spade they open what prove to be a grave and in it find the body of a european the skull mark so mckinlay state with two sabre cut he note down the description of the body the locality and its surroundings and in view of these particulars it have be state that the body be that of gray who die in the neighborhood \* \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- see chapter 14 consider the minute and circumstantial account that have from time to time be relate by the black concern leichhardt one be not astonish at the legend tell to mckinlay the native with he tell he that the whites have be attack in they camp and that the whole of they have be murder the black have finish by eat the body of the other man and bury the journal saddle and similar portion of the equipment beside a lake a short distance away a further search reveal another grave -- empty -- and there be other and slighter indication that white man have visit the neighborhood so that mckinlay be lead to place some credence in this story next morning a tribe of black appear and although they immediately run away on perceive the party one be capture who corroborate the statement make by the other native both of they bear mark on they like bullet and shot wound the second native say that there be a pistol conceal near a neighbouring lake he be send to fetch it but return the next morning at the head of a host of aboriginal arm paint and evidently bent on mischief the leader be oblige to order he man to fire upon they and it be only after two or three volley that they retire mckinlay be now satisfy that he have discover all there be to find of the victorian expedition and after bury a letter for the benefit of any after-comer he leave lake massacre as it be mistakenly name and return to the depot camp he letter be as follow : -- sabr expedition October 23rd 1861 to the leader of any expedition seek tiding of burke and party sir i reach this water on the 19th instant and by means of a native guide discover a european camp one mile north on west side of flat at or near this camp trace of horse camel and whites be find hair apparently belong to mr will charle gray mr burke or king be pick up from the surface of a grave dig by a spade and from the skull of a european bury by the native other less important trace -- such as a pannikin oil-can saddle-stuffing etc have be find beware of the native on whom we have have to fire we do not intend to return to adelaide but proceed to west of north from information all burke 's party be kill and eat jno mckinlay p all the party in good health if you have any difficulty in reach this spot and wish to return to adelaide by a more practicable route you may do so for at least three month to come by drive west eighteen mile then south of west cut we dray track within thirty mile abundance of water and feed at easy stage mckinlay next send one of he party -- hodgkinson -- with man and pack-horse to blanche water to carry down the news of he discovery and to bring back ration for a prolonged exploration meanwhile he remain in camp from one old native with whom he have a long conversation he obtain another version of the alleged massacre in which there be apparently some vestige of truth the new version be to the effect that the whites on they return have be attack by the native but have repulse they one white man have be kill and have be bury after the fight whilst the other whites go south the native have then dig up the body and eat the flesh the old fellow also describe minutely the different water pass by burke and the way in which the man subsist on the seed of the nardoo plant all of which he must have hear from other native after wait a month hodgkinson return bring the news of the rescue of king and the fate of burke and will this explain mckinlay 's discovery as that of gray 's body the narrative of the fight and massacre be merely ornamental addition by the native after a easterly excursion in which he visit the two grave on cooper 's creek mckinlay start definitely north it be difficult to follow without a map the journal contain the record of he travel during the first week not only do he give the native name of every small lakelet and waterhole in full but he omit to give the bearing of he daily course a northerly course be however in the main pursued and mckinlay describe the country cross as first-class pastoral land as it be then the dry season of the year immediately precede the rain it prove what a abnormally severe season must have be encounter by sturt when that explorer be turn back on he last trip in much the same latitude on the 27th of February the wet season of the tropics set in but fortunately the party find a refuge among some stony hill and sand-ridge in the neighborhood of which they be camp though at one time they be completely surround by water on march 10th the rain have abate sufficiently to allow they to resume they journey but the main creek which they still continue to follow up north be so boggy and swollen that they be force to keep some distance from its bank this river which mckinlay call the mueller be one of the main river of central australium and a important affluent of lake eyre and be now know as the diamantina mckinlay leave it at the point where it come from the north-west and follow up a tributary he cross the divide range there call the mckinlay range in about the same locality as burke 's cross he have christen many of the inland watercourse on he way across but most of he name have be replace by other it have be difficult subsequently to identify they in many case the watercourse which he think to be independent creek be but ana-branch of the diamantina pass through good travel country and finding ample grass and water he reach the leichhardt river flow into the gulf of carpentarium on the 6th of may as he ration be become perilously low mckinlay be anxious to get to the mouth of the albert it have be understand that captain norman with the steam-ship victorium be there to form a depot for the use of the queensland search party he attempt to reach it however be fruitless as he be continually turn back by mangrove creek both broad and deep and by boggy flat so that on the 21st of may he start for the nearest settle district in north queensland in the direction of port denison he follow much the same route as that take by ac gregory on he return from the victorium river \* cross on to the head of the burdekin he follow that river down trust to come across some of the flock and herd of the advance settler on reach mount mcconnell where the two former explorer have cross the burdekin he continue to follow the river and descend the coast range where it force its way through a narrow gorge here on the bowen river he arrive at a temporary station just form by phillip somer where he receive all the accustomed hospitality since leave the gulf the explorer have subsist on little else but horse and camel flesh and be necessarily in a weak condition have they but camp a day or two when on the upper course of the burdekin they would have be relieve much earlier for the pioneer squatter be already there and the party would have be spare a rough trip through the burdekin gorge in fact the track of the camel be see by one pioneer at least a few hour after the caravan have pass e cunningham who have just then form burdekin downs station tell with much amusement how mckinlay 's track puzzle he and he black boy the burdekin pioneer do not of course expect mckinlay 's advent amongst they although they know that he be then somewhere out west and such a animal as a camel do not enter into they calculation cunningham say that the only solution of the problem of the footprint that he could think of be that the track be those of a return party who have be look for new country and that they horse have lose they shoe and become footsore they have wrap they foot in bandage \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- see chapter 18 for he service on this expedition which be of great value in open up central australium mckinlay be present with a gold watch by the royal geographical society and be vote 1000 pound by the south australian government during the early settlement of the northern territory much dissatisfaction have arise concern the site choose at escape cliff mckinlay be send north by the south australian government to select a more favourable position and to report generally on the capability of the new territory he organize a expedition at escape cliff and leave with the intention of make a long excursion to the eastward but a very wet season set in and he have reach only the east alligator river when sudden flood cut he off and hem he in the whole party would have be destroy but for the resourcefulness display by the leader who make coracle of horse-hide stretch on frame of sapling by which mean they escape on he return mckinlay examine the mouth of the daly river and recommend anson bay as a more suitable site but he suggestion be not adopt mckinlay whose health suffer from the effect of the hardship incident to he journey retire to spend he day in the congenial atmosphere of pastoral pursuit and die in 1874 at gawler south australia where a monument be erect to he memory 152 william landsborough william landsborough the son of a scotch physician be bear in ayrshire and educate at irvine when he come to australia he settle first in the new england district of new south wale and thence remove to queensland in 1856 he interest in discovery and a desire to find new country lead he to undertake much private exploration principally on the coastal part of queensland in the district of broadsound and the isaac river in 1858 he explore the comet to its head and in the following year the head water of the thomson a old friend and erstwhile comrade writing of he say : landsborough 's enterprise be entirely found on self-reliance he have neither government aid nor capitalist at he back when he achieve he first success as a explorer he be the very model of a pioneer -- courageous hardy good-humoured and kindly he be a excellent horseman a most entertaining and at time eccentric companion and he could starve with greater cheerfulness than any man i ever see or hear of but excellent fellow though he be he very independence of character and success in explore provoke much ill-will landsborough be recommend for the position of leader by the veteran ac gregory and on the 14th of August he leave brisbane in the firefly have on board a party of volunteer assistant who have be stir by the widespread sympathy with the miss man to take a active part in the relief expedition unfortunately those under landsborough be with one exception unacquainted with bush life the exception be george bourne the second in command a old squatter who have see and suffer many a long drought and whose service prove to be of great value after some mishap the firefly convoy by the victorium reach the mouth of the albert river where the party be safely land after start from the albert landsborough come unexpectedly upon a river hitherto unknown it flow into the nicholson and both leichhardt and gregory have cross below the confluence it be a run stream with much semi-tropical foliage on its bank run through well-grassed level country and he name it the gregory as they near the higher reach of the gregory they find the country of a more arid nature they ascend the main range and on the 21st of December landsborough find a inland river flow south which he name the herbert the queensland authority subsequently re-christen the stream with the singularly inappropriate name of georgina in this river two fine sheet of water be find and call lake france and lake mary a ineffectual attempt be then make to go westward but lack of water compel they to desist landsborough now return to the depot by way of the gregory and on arrive there learn that walker have be in and have report have see the track of burke and will on the flinder landsborough thereupon resolve to return by way of the flinder instead of go back by boat they have very little provision but by reduce the number of the party they manage to subsist on short allowance on this second trip he follow the flinder up and be reward by be the first white man to see the beautiful prairie-like country through which it flow he name the remarkable isolate hill visible from the river fort bowen mount brown and mount little from the upper flinder he strike south hope to come across a newly-formed station but be disappointed though he see numerous horse-track show that settlement be near at hand at last after endure a long period of semi-starvation they reach the warrego and at the station of neilson and william first learn the fate of those whom they have be seek landsborough be next appoint resident at burketown and afterwards inspector of brand for the district of east moreton he die in 1886 153 pe warburton -lrb- illustration major warburton -rrb- major warburton be the fourth son of the reverend rowland warburton of arley hall cheshire where he be bear on the 15th of August 1813 he be first educate in france he enter the royal navy in 1826 and in 1829 proceed to addiscombe college preparatory to enter the east indium company 's service in which he serve from 1831 to 1853 when he retire with the rank of major in 1853 he arrive at albany from there he go on to adelaide and at the end of the same year be appoint commissioner of police a office which he hold until he be place in charge of the imperial pension department on he return from he explore expedition he be vote 1000 pound for himself and 500 pound for he party he be create a cmg in 1875 be award the gold medal of the royal geographical society of london and he die in 1889 in 1873 two prominent south australian colonist whose name be intimately connect with the promotion of exploration in that colony thoma elder and walter hughe fit out a expedition which it be hope would lead to the rapid advancement of geographical knowledge unfortunately the result be not commensurate with the ambitious nature of the undertake the command be give to major warburton who be instruct to start from the neighborhood of central mount stuart and to steer a course direct to perth in spite of be provide with a long string of camel warburton incur so much delay in get through the sandhill that he camel be knock up and he provision nearly all consume before he have advance half-way this compel he to bear up north to the head water of the oakover river besides the leader the party consist of he son richard lewi a surveyor one more white man two afghan and a native lewi the surveyor show himself to be a most capable man in fact but for he energy and forethought the expedition would have be swallow up in the sand of the north-west desert on the 15th of April 1873 the explorer leave alice spring and follow the overland line until they reach a creek call burt 's creek whence they strike to the westward after a vain search for the river hugh and finke which be popularly suppose to rise to the north of the mcdonnell range warburton alter he course to the north-west meaning to connect with ac gregory 's most southerly point on sturt 's creek for some distance he way lead he through available pastoral country and in some of the minor range beautiful glen be discover with deep pool of water in they bed so frightened be the camel by the rock that surround they that they would not approach they to drink on the 22nd of may after travel for some day in poor sandy country they come to a good creek with a full head the whole flat on to which the creek emerge from the hill be one vast spring this place the best camp they have yet meet with be name eva spring leave the main body rest at these spring the leader with two companion start ahead and be successful in find some native well that enable he to break up he main camp and advance with all the man and material on the 5th of June they cross the boundary-line between the two colony and find themselves on the scrubby sandy tableland common to the interior at some native well which be call waterloo well they make a enforced sojourn of about a month in addition they lose three camel and one of the afghan nearly die of scurvy when they be at last enable to leave the waterloo well they find themselves plunge into the salt lake country where the native inhabitant exist on shallow well and soakage spring by they reckoning they be now within ten mile of gregory 's sturt 's creek but though warburton make two separate attempt to find the place he be unable to recognize any country that at all resemble the description give by gregory rightfully ascribe this disappointment to a error in he longitude he proceed on a westerly course once more the tale of each day 's journey now become a dreary record of travels across a monotonous barren country and a incessant search for native well they only means of sustain life in addition to other cause for delay the excessive heat cause by radiation from the surround sandhill during the day compel the leader to spare he camel as much as possible by travel at night this naturally lead to a most unsatisfactory inspection of the country traverse and it be impossible to say what clue to water be pass by unwittingly starvation now commence to press close upon they the constant delay have so reduce they store of provision that they be almost at the end of they resource whilst still surround by the endless desert of sand-ridge and spinifex sickness too befel they so that almost the full brunt of the work of the expedition be place upon the capable shoulder of lewi and the black boy charley the time of these two be take up in watch the smoke of the fire of the native or in look for they track during the early morning and in the evening they could travel a little but at night the myriad swarm of ant prevent the tired man from obtain they natural sleep if they stop to rest the camel they only prolong they own starvation yet without rest the camel could not carry they ahead in the search for water on the 9th of October the camel stray away during the night but luckily come across a small waterhole and at this welcome spot the party rest for a while indeed with the exception of lewi and the native they be all too weak to do aught else they slaughter a camel and be fortunate to shoot a few pigeon and galah parrot the fresh meat restore a little of they strength they have long since despair of carry out the original purpose of the expedition all that they could hope for be to struggle on with the last remain flicker of life to the nearest settled country this be the oakover river on the north coast and to the head of the oakover therefore they worn-out camel be direct they could entertain no hope of relief before reach the oakover for the discoverer of that river frank gregory a man always reluctant to acknowledge defeat have be turn from the southward attempt by this very desert across which they be painfully toiling on the evening that they start for the station the whole party be about to ride blindly on into waterless country where but for the black boy they would all have perish the boy have leave the camp early in the morning and have come across the fresh track of some native follow they up to they camp where he find a well he hasten back to the party to tell they of he discovery only to find that they have go fortunately he have sharp ear and hear the distant recede tinkle of the camel bell by dint of energetically push on and cooee loudly he manage to attract they attention and then lead they back to the new source of relief lewi and the black boy be now the eye and ear of the party and but for they the expedition would never have reach the river a fresh start be make after a welcome halt at this well warburton and he son could scarcely sit they camel and follow the weary caravan almost with apathy on the 14th of November charley find another native well but its discovery nearly cost he he life when close to the native camp he have go ahead by himself as he usually do so as not to startle the aboriginal the black receive he kindly and give he water but when he cooee for he companion they take sudden alarm and attack he they have spear he in the arm and back and cut he head open with a club when lewi come up just in time to rescue he evidently this attack be not premeditated but cause by the sudden fear arouse by the sight of the white man and camel at this well lewi and one of the afghan go ahead to strike the head of the oakover for they think they must be draw near the coast as the night be grow cool and dewy and they have find trace of white iron work in a old camp in a week lewi return have reach a tributary of the river and on the 5th of December the whole party arrive at the rocky creek that he have find they now proceed slowly down the oakover but come across no sign of occupation the indefatigable lewi have therefore again to go ahead for help whilst the other wait for he live on the flesh of the last camel he have 170 mile to journey over before he reach the cattle station belong to grant harper and anderson where he be immediately supply with horse and provision to take back to the starve man it be on the 29th of December as warburton be lie in the shade think moodily that the station must have be abandon and that lewi have surely be compel to push on to roebourne when the black boy from a tree-top give a cheerful signal start to they foot the astonished man find the pack-horse and the relief party almost in they camp of the seventeen camel with which they have start the two that lewi have take on to the station be the only survivor and all they equipment have be abandon piecemeal in the desert 154 william christie gosse -lrb- illustration william christie gosse deputy surveyor-general of south australium -rrb- on the 23rd of April about a week after the departure of warburton william christie gosse deputy surveyor-general of south australia also leave alice spring on a explore expedition have be appoint by the south australian government to take charge of the central and western explore expedition like warburton he be frustrate by dry country in he endeavor to reach perth he have with he both white man and afghan camel driver and a mixed outfit of horse and camel he leave the telegraph line and strike westward soon find himself in very dry country where he lose one horse on a dry stage he make a depot camp on a creek which he call the warburton and while on a excursion from this camp he have the singular experience of ride all day through heavy rain and camping at night without water the sandy soil have quickly absorb the downpour on he return he find that the creek at the camp be run and though repeat attempt have be make by the afghan to goad one of the camel over the animal obstinately refuse to cross probably the leader think that it be fortunate for the progress of the expedition that they be not likely to meet with many more run stream after pass both warburton 's track and those of gile gosse reach the extreme western point of the macdonnell range where another stationary camp be pitch the leader make a long excursion to the south-west and at 84 mile after pass over sand-ridge and spinifex country catch sight of a remarkable hill that on a nearer approach prove to be of singular limestone formation when i get clear of the sandhill and be only two mile distant and the hill for the first time come fairly in view what be my astonishment to find it be one immense rock rise abruptly from the plain the hole i have notice be cause by the water in some place cause immense cave this hill which gosse make a ineffectual attempt to ascend he call ayer 's rock he return to he depot camp cross a arm of lake amadeus as he do so and move the main body on to ayer 's rock rain have set in heavily for some day he push some distance into western australium but soon reach the limit of the rainfall after many attempt to penetrate the sand-hill region which confront he the heat and aridity compel he to turn back he homeward course be by way of the musgrave range where he find a greater extent of pastoral country than have be think to exist there he discover and christen the marryat and follow down the alberga to within sixty mile of the overland line when he turn north-eastward to the charlotte water station although gosse 's exploration do not add any important new

considerable size but without any important affluent mount olga be a singular mountain situate about 50 mile from the lake on this trip gile go over much untrodden country but the smallness of the

of both substantial private help and a small sum from the south australian government the party number four : wh tietkin who afterwards make a honorable name as a independent explorer the unfortunate

so many it be during one of these forlorn hope that gibson die anxious to reach a range which he have sight in the distance and where he hope to find a change of country gile make up he mind to make a determine effort to reach it carry a supply of water with he on pack-horse as usual tietkin be to accompany he but as gibson complain of have be always previously leave in camp he be allow to go instead the two keep doggedly on the horse as they give in be leave to find they way back to the main camp at last when several day out they have but two horse leave gile send gibson back on one with instruction to push on for the camp take what little water he want out of a keg they have bury on they outward way leave the remainder for he use he himself intend to make a final effort to reach the range gile 's horse soon give in after they part and he have to start to return on foot on he weary way back he see that one of the abandon horse have turn off from the trail and that gibson 's track turn off too seemingly follow it when he reach the keg he find that the contents be untouched fear greatly that the unfortunate man 's fate be seal gile drag himself on to the camp a search be at once institute but it be fruitless neither man nor horse be ever see again and the scene of he fate be know as gibson 's desert during he excursion in various direction gile discover and traverse four different range of hill the party be much worry by the hostility of the black and what with the uneasiness cause by they attack the plague of myriad of ant the loss of gibson and the failure of they own hope they be force to return to adelaide baffle for a time but not beat we thus see how the arid belt of the middle country have defy three different explorer -- warburton gosse and gile -- one equip with camel only one with camel and horse and one who have rely on horse alone -lrb- illustration a camel caravan in a australian desert -rrb- in 1875 gile take the field once more this time owe to the generosity of sir thoma elder of south australia he be well-prepared he have a fine caravan of camel and have he former companion tietkin with he besides a completely-equipped party the start be make from beltana the next halting-place be youldeh where a depot be form from this place they shift north to a native well oaldabinna as the water supply here prove but scanty gile start off to the westward to search for a better place send tietkin to the north on a similar errand accompany by young gile push he way for 150 mile through scrub and past shallow lakelet of salt water until he come to a native well or dam contain a small supply of water beyond this he go another 30 mile but find himself amongst saline swamp and scrub he then return to the depot tietkin and he companion be not so successful at they furthest point they have come across a large number of native who after decamp in a terrify manner return fully arm and paint for war no attempt of the two white man to open friendly communication or to obtain any information from they have succeed a slight shower of rain have replenish the well they be camp at gile determine to make a bold push to the west trust to the power of endurance of he camel to carry he on to water on reach the dam that he have formerly visit he be agreeably surprise to find that it have be nearly fill by the late rain as it now contain plenty of water for they want and there be good feed all around they rest by it until the supply of water begin to show sign of decline on the 16th of September 1875 he leave the boundary dam as he call it and commence to try conclusion with the desert to the westward for the first six day of they march the caravan pass through scrub of oak mulga and sandalwood next they enter upon vast plain well-grassed with salt-bush and other edible shrub grow upon they cross these the camel train again pass through scrub but not so dense as before when 250 mile have be accomplish gile distribute amongst the camel the water he have carry with he as they keep on sand-ridge begin to make they appearance native smoke be often see and they frequently cross the track of the native on the seventeenth day from the boundary dam tietkin who judge by the appearance of the sandhill that there be water in the neighborhood send the black boy tommy on to a ridge lie south of they course it be fortunate that he do so for hide in a hollow surround by sandhill be a tiny lake which they be pass by unheeded until tommy arrest they progress with frantic shout gile give this place of succor which he should have name after he companion the commonplace name of victorium spring and here the caravan rest for nine day recruit and in good spirit they soon find themselves amongst the distinctive feature of the inner slope of western australium -- outcrop of granite mound and boulder salt lake and bog they next camp of relief be at a native well 200 mile from victorium spring the quietude of they life at this encampment be however rudely break by the native during they stay they have have friendly intercourse with the black but no suspicion of treachery have be arouse the explorer be just conclude they evening meal when young see a mob of armed and painted native approach he catch sight of they in time to give the alarm to the other who stand to they arm gile say in he journal that they be a perfectly armed and drill force though military discipline be a singular characteristic to find amongst the black of this barren region a discharge of firearm from the whites check they assailant before any spear have be throw and probably prevent the massacre of the whole party on leave this camp the caravan travel through dense scrub with occasional hill and patch of open country intervene they be fortunate to find some well on the way and on the 4th of November arrive at a outside sheep-station in the settle district of western australium and gile 's long-cherished ambition be at last fulfil the result of this trip be satisfactory to gile who thus see he many fruitless though gallant effort at last crown with success but the journey have no substantial geographical or economic result it resemble warburton 's in have be a hasty flight with camel through a unknown country mark only a thin line on the map of australium a explorer with the means at he command in the shape of camel of venture on long dry stage with impunity be tempt to sacrifice extended exploration of the country border he route and the deeper and more valuable knowledge that it bring to rapidity of onward movement john forrest for example be able owe to the many minor excursion he be force to make because of the nature of he equipment to gain infinitely more knowledge of the geographical detail of the country he pass over than either warburton or gile gile now retrace he step to south australia follow a line to the northward of forrest 's track he go by way of the murchison and cross over the gascoyne to the ashburton which he follow up to its head then strike to the south of east he cut he former track of 1873 at the alfred and marie range the range he have so ardently strive to reach when the unfortunate man gibson die how futile be the vain attempt that lead to gibson 's death he now realize he finally arrive at the peake telegraph station few watercourse be cross the country be suffer under extreme drought and no discovery of importance be make gile publish a narrative of he exploration entitle australium twice traverse he be a gold medallist of the royal geographical society he enter the west australian government service on the coolgardie goldfield and on the 13th of November 1897 die at coolgardie west australium where the western australian

the south australian government and then pay a visit to england on he return he go to sydney and do some survey work for the new south wale government into whose service he permanently enter he be now a land inspector on the south coast after he experience as second with ernest gile tietkin take charge in 1889 of the central australian explore expedition he leave alice spring on the overland line on the 14th of march to examine the hitherto unknown country to the north and west of lake amadeus late in the month of may he discover and name the kintore range to the north-west of lake macdonald and ascend one of the elevation mount leisler during the beginning of the next month he practically complete the circuit of lake macdonald and discover the bonython range to the south-east on he return journey tietkin correct the somewhat exaggerated notion entertain as to the extent of lake amadeus as he pass through sixty mile of country suppose to be contain in its area without see a vestige of this natural feature in after year he survey and correctly fix its location in 1874 surveyor lewi the gallant and tireless spirit whose indefatigable effort have pull the warburton expedition out of the fire take charge of a expedition equip by sir thoma elder to define the many affluent of lake eyre start from the overland line lewi skirt lake eyre to the north penetrate to eyre 's creek trace that stream and the diamantina into lake eyre and confirm the opinion that the water of cooper 's creek as well as the more westerly stream find they way into that inland sea jw lewi afterwards die in broome western australium in 1875 the queensland government decide to send out a expedition to ascertain the amount of pastoral country that exist to the westward of the diamantina river it be place in charge of will hodgkinson who have occupy a subordinate position in the burke and will expedition they start from the upper reach of the cloncurry and cross the main divide range on to the diamantina follow that river down to the southern boundary of queensland where it have be name the everard by lewi this portion be now well-known and the track of the pioneer ' stock be everywhere visible from the lower diamantina the party go westwards and beyond eyre 's creek in good pastoral country come upon a watercourse which be name the mulligan this creek hodgkinson follow up to the north and not know that he have cross its head watershed go on down the herbert -lrb- georgina -rrb- under the impression that he be still on the mulligan he be undeceived when he overtake n buchanan with cattle who be then engage in re-stock the station on the herbert that have be abandon in the commercial depression of 1872 and 1873 this be the last explore expedition send out by the queensland authority the country within the bound of that colony being by that time all know but across the western border the vacant and unknown country of south australia attract many private expedition to examine it in search of pastoral holding amongst those from queensland be two brother name prout who with one man go out to look for new grazing land and never return many month afterwards a search party under wjh carr-boyd find some of the horse and then the remains of one of the brother it be evident from the fragment of a diary recover that they have push far into the dry region of south australia and have meet they death from thirst on the return journey probably some of the water on which they have rely have unexpectedly fail in 1878 nathaniel buchanan a veteran pioneer and overlander of queensland make a excursion from the queensland border to tennant 's creek on the overland telegraph line start from the ranken a tributary of the georgina buchanan strike a westerly course and discover the head of a well-watered creek run through fine open downs he follow it down to the westward for some day the creek eventually run out into dry flat so buchanan strike westward to the telegraph line which he reach after some hardship a little to the south of tennant 's creek the creek which he discover and to which favenc afterwards give the name of buchanan 's creek be a most important discovery afford a practicable stock route to the great pastoral district lie between the queensland border and the overland line frank scarr a queensland surveyor be the next to invade this strip of still unknown land he attempt to steer a course south of buchanan 's but be turn back by the dry belt of country on this excursion he also find two of the horse of the ill-fated prout brother scarr then make further north and with the assistance of the creek discover by buchanan be enable to reach the line owing to the severity of the drought however he be unable to extend he research any further and return safely to queensland -lrb- illustration ernest favenc -rrb- in 1878 a project for a railway line on the land-grant principle between brisbane and port darwin

value of the land in the neighborhood of the propose line and the geographical feature of the unexplored portion the leader be ernest favenc who be accompany by surveyor brigg g hedley and a black boy they leave cork station on the diamantina and keep a north-west course through the untraversed country between that river and the georgina or herbert as it be then call they then cross the border into south australia and strike the creek which buchanan have find and to which the name of buchanan 's creek be now give leave this creek at the lowest water the party strike north and after find two large but shallow lake come in the midst of most excellent pastoral country to a fine lagoon which they name the corellum lagoon the tree on the bank of this lagoon which be about four mile long be at the time of the visit white with myriad of corellum parrot hence the name some three hundred native be assemble at this lagoon to celebrate they tribal rite but they show a friendly disposition from the corellum lagoon the expedition proceed north and discover a large creek run from east to west it prove to be one of the principal creek of that region and be name cresswell creek and a permanent lagoon on it be name the anthony lagoon cresswell creek be follow down until like its fellow creek the buchanan it too be absorb in dry parched flat the last permanent water on cresswell creek be name the adder waterhole on account of the large number of death-adder that be kill there a dry stage of ninety mile now intervene between the party and the telegraph line and the first attempt to cross on a day of terrible heat result in a return to the adder camp three horse have succumb to the heat thirst and the crack and fissure arid plain it be the height of the summer season and no water within a reasonable distance it be evidently useless to sacrifice any more horse there be nothing to do therefore but to await at the last camp the fall of a kindly thundershower by means of which they might bridge the dry gap between they and the line the long delay exhaust the supply of ration but by means of bird -- duck and pigeon -- horseflesh and the usual edible bush plant -- blue-bush and pigweed -- the party fare sufficiently well during they detention at this camp many short excursion be make and the country traverse be find to be mostly richly grassed downs where flood country be encroach upon the dry bed of former lake be find encircle in all case with a ring of dead tree in January 1879 the thunderstorm set in and the party reach powell 's creek telegraph station in safety this

roebourne and cross to the overland line in south australia ostensibly theirs be a prospect expedition but as the country to the eastward of the fitzroy river be then unknown it be a important exploration event they be unsuccessful in find gold but on they arrival at the line they report have pass through good pastoral country there be no doubt that the east and west track of the queensland explorer and of alexander forrest \* do more to throw open that part of australium to settlement than do the north and south journey of stuart more important as that one be from the purely geographical point of view stuart lead the way across the center of the continent but even after the telegraph line be construct on he route very little be know of the country to the east and the west

discover some curious cave painting of the black in which the aboriginal figure be represent as clothed -lrb- \* footnote -rrb- a subsequent photograph of these painting by brockman be reproduce in chapter 20 unable to find a pass through the mountain and enfeebled by he wound gray determine to retrace he step as a last resort he send lushington some distance ahead but there be no noticeable

stoke who be away explore the coast the party have embark the lynher sail for the isle of france where they safely arrive thus end captain gray 's first expedition which be interesting chiefly as a proof of the heroic quality of its member for the glenelg river have never invite settlement and have yet to prove that it possess any considerable economic value during January 1839 gray explore the country between the william and the leschenhault while search for a settler who have be lose in the bush on the 17th of February in the same year gray who have be back endeavor to persuade sir jame stirl to assist he in he exploration be enable to start on another explore enterprise the object of this he second important expedition be to examine the undiscovered part of shark 's bay and to make excursion as far inland as circumstance permit the party comprise four of the member of he first expedition five other man and a western australian aboriginal and they leave fremantle in a american whaler take three whale-boat with they they be duly land at bernier island where they trouble commence at once the whaler sail away take with she by mistake the whole of they supply of tobacco there be no water on the island and in they first attempt to start one of the boat be smash and nearly half a ton of store lose the next day they succeed in make dorre island but that night both the remain boat be drive ashore by a violent storm two or three day be spend in make good the damage when they succeed in make the mainland and obtain a supply of fresh water they have land at or near the mouth of a stream which afterwards prove to be the second longest river in western australium gray name it the gascoyne and find that it be then dry beyond the limit of tidal influence they then pull up the coast but one night when effect a landing both boat be swamp and they previously-damaged provision suffer another soak this accident keep they prisoner for a week till the wind and surf have abate tired hungry and ill they be here harass by frequent threat and one actual attack by the black a slight break in the weather tempt they forth once more and have succeed in right the boat they make for the mouth of the gascoyne where they re-fill they water-beaker on march 20th they make a desperate effort in the tooth of foul weather to fetch they depot on bernier island we may picture they dismay when they find that during they absence a hurricane have sweep the island and scatter they cherish store to the four wind they position be now as desperate as could be imagine : the southerly wind have set in and they have to coast along a surf-beaten shore against a head wind they food be scanty and they be weak with the constant toil they have undergo there be nothing for it however but to put to sea again and they succeed in reach gantheaume bay on the 31st of march fate have not yet spend all she wrath on they and in attempt a landing gray 's boat be dash to destruction upon a rock and the other receive such a buffeting as to place it beyond repair the only hope of safety lay in a overland march to perth three hundred mile away upon they twenty pound of damage flour and one pound of salt pork per man and yet so wearied be they with the unceasing battle against wind and sea that they even welcome this hazardous prospect as a change for the better they have not proceed far before difference of opinion arise gray naturally wish the man to cover the ground as quickly as possible whilst they strength last whilst they favor slow march relieve by frequent rest gray who recognize that in they weakened condition they could not replenish they scanty food supplies from the native game hold firmly to he opinion and make strenuous effort to quicken they progress but the comparative safety of the shore have lull he follower into a feeling of false security and after goad they along for a hundred mile bear the chief burden of the march and share much of he scanty food with the black boy gray leave they to push onward and if possible send they assistance he take two or three pick man with he and after terrible suffering and privation reach perth whence a rescue party be immediately despatch this party find only one man charle wood who by more closely follow gray 's instruction have make better progress than the other the remain five could not be find and at the end of a fortnight the rescuer be force to return on account of the lack of provision roe immediately leave with another party and after experience trouble in track the erratic wanderings of the unfortunate come upon most of they hopelessly regard a face of rock that stop they march along the beach unable to muster sufficient strength to climb it they have then be three day without water have nothing in they canteen but a loathsome substitute one of they smith a lad of eighteen who have accompany the expedition as a volunteer have die two day before the rescue he body be recover and bury in the wilderness walker the surgeon and second in charge be still absent but he have voluntarily leave the main body and have push on for assistance towards fremantle which he safely reach during these unfortunate expedition gray have show a generous spirit of self-sacrifice combine with high courage and a fine enthusiasm for geographical discovery but he lack of experience and he ignorance of the local seasonal condition counterbalance these and explain he failure afterwards he become act government resident at albany on king george 's sound and he be at a critical period governor of south australia but australia proper saw little of he in he after prime and he fame be build up elsewhere in new zealand and at the cape of good hope gray 's report leave doubt as to the precise value of the country he traverse under such try circumstance but he be justly credit with the discovery of many river on the west coast -- the gray the buller the chapman the greenough the arrowsmith the hutt the bowyer and those important stream the murchison and the gascoyne 173 augustus c gregory -lrb- illustration augustus c gregory 1880 photo freeman sydney -rrb- in 1846 we come upon a name destine to become link with the history of exploration in most part of australium there be three notable brother of the name of gregory but as they expedition at least those of augustus and frank be conduct independently with the exception of the first we shall deal with they separately hc gregory it be true associate he work mostly with that of he brother ac gregory generally in a subordinate position but frank gregory win nearly equal fame with he brother augustus as a independent explorer ac gregory be the son of lieutenant j gregory of the 78th highlander he be bear at farnsfield nottinghamshire in 1819 and come to western australium with he parent in 1829 in the lotus 500 ton captain summerson the second passenger ship that sail for western australium lieutenant gregory have five son in all : william augustus franci henry and jame the lotus reach fremantle about the 10th of October 1829 captain gregory have be oblige to retire from active service be incapacitate by serious wound receive at el hame in egypt and hold a large grant of land from the imperial government in lieu of pension on this grant situate not far from perth he establish a farm and on that farm augustus and he brother receive the balance of they education and undergo they course of bush training augustus after he last expedition be appoint in 1859 surveyor-general of queensland in which colony he settle down later after retire from active official life he have a seat in the legislative council and be a prominent freemason he be create cmg in 1874 and kcmg in 1903 and have several honor confer upon he by the royal geographical society he die in brisbane in 1905 if we except a short excursion down the blackwood and kojonup river he expedition of 1846 in which he be accompany both by ft and hc gregory be the first important enterprise undertake by he it be in August that he party leave captain scully 's station at bolgart 's spring about seventy mile from perth on leave the settle district they at once find themselves in the barren country that be dam back the eastward flow of settlement have traverse it they reach a range of granite hill and turn more to the northward they keep along these for the sake of the rain-water to be find in the rock hole on striking again to the east they encounter a extensive salt lake and in attempt to cross a arm of this marsh they horse be bog and extricate only after great labor the lake be afterwards prove to be of great size and to hem they in completely to the eastward whilst owe to its crescent-like formation for five day it baffle all they attempt to proceed northwards finally abandon the lake which they call lake moore they turn to the westward to examine some of the stream cross by gray during he return from shark 's bay on the head of one of these river the irwin they find a seam of coal have pitch we tent and tethered we horse we commence to collect specimen of the various stratum and succeed in cut out five or six hundredweight of coal with the tomahawk and in a short time have the satisfaction of see the first fire of west australian coal burning cheerfully in front of the camp this be the first discovery of coal in western australium the party then return by way of the moore river to bolgart spring which they reach on the 22nd of September the discovery of coal deposit and of country available for settlement be see to be of great importance by the government and lieutenant helpman ac gregory he brother henry and messr irby and meekleham in the colonial schooner champion be despatch to procure a quantity of coal for testing they be also instruct to make a further inspection of the pastoral capability of the district of which there have be so many conflict opinion a three day ' examination of the country convince they that it be suitable for settlement in 1846 gregory take charge of a expedition to the north of perth organise by the settler of the colony and entitle the settler ' expedition its object be to proceed to the gascoyne river examine the intervene country as to its suitability for pastoral purpose gregory be accompany by one of he brother messr burges walcott and bedart and private king of the 96th regiment of whose service he speak very highly this expedition excited great hope amongst the settler who find most of the horse and provision the party leave lefroy 's station of welb on the 9th of September with ten pack and two riding-horse but do not succeed in penetrate any distance beyond the murchison be turn back at all point after repeat effort by the belt of impervious scrub between the murchison and gascoyne they therefore return without see the latter river after have attain a distance of 350 mile from perth but they succeed in find a considerable extent of available country both pastoral and agricultural and in discover a vein of galena on the murchison they re-enter perth on the 17th of November the follow month gregory bland and three soldier of the 96th accompany governor fitzgerald by sea to champion bay to examine the new mineral discovery the galena lode be find to be more important than have be at first suppose on they return to the schooner a affray occur with the native in which the governor be wound as the country be cover with dense wattle thicket the native take advantage of the ground and have completely surround the party commence first to threaten to throw they spear then to throw stone and finally one man catch hold of mr bland by the arm threaten to strike he with a dowak another native throw a spear at myself though without effect but before i could fire at he the governor perceive that unless some severe example be make the whole party would be cut off fire at one of the most forward of we assailant and kill he two other shot be fire by the soldier but the thickness of the bush prevent we see with what effect a shower of spear stone kyly and dowak follow and although we move to a more open spot the native be only keep off by firing at any that expose themselves at this moment a spear strike the governor in the leg just above the knee with such force as to cause it to protrude two foot on the other side which be so far fortunate as to enable I to break off the barb and withdraw the shaft the governor notwithstanding he wound continue to direct the party and although the native make many attempt to approach close enough to reach we with they spear we be able by keep on the most open ground and check they by a occasional shot to avoid they attack when cross the gully the native follow they for seven mile but finally desist and the whites reach the beach and board the champion without further mishap in 1856 gregory make he most celebrated journey in the north of central australium a account of this journey might have be include in part 2 but as the name of gregory be so intimately connect with western australium this section be perhaps the most appropriate place in which to recount its incident -lrb- but its lengthy place in which to recount its incident -lrb- sic -rrb- -rrb- but its numerous detail demand another chapter chapter 18 ac and ft gregory 181 ac gregory on sturt 's creek and the barcoo the imperial government have long consider the feasibility of further exploration of the interior of australium vote 5000 pound for the purpose and offer the command of the expedition to ac gregory as the inexplicable disappearance of leichhardt be then exciting much interest in australium search for the lose expedition be to form one of its chief duty on the 12th of August 1855 gregory 's party leave moreton bay in the barque monarch attend by the schooner tom tough there be eighteen man in all hc gregory be second in command ferdinand von mueller be botanist j wilson geologist jr elsey surgeon and naturalist and j baine artist and storekeeper they have on board fifty horse two hundred sheep and provision and store calculate to last they eighteen month on full ration they do not reach point pearce at the mouth of the victorium river until the 24th of September there they separate the schooner take the store up the river and the monarch proceeding on she voyage to singapore the horse have be land at point pearce whence gregory he brother and seven man take they on overland by easy stage one night the horse be attack by crocodile and three of they be severely wound they follow up the course of the fitzmaurice river and then pass over rough country not reach the victorium until the 17th on the 20th they rejoin the member who have go round by the schooner and learn that she be aground in the river a large part of they store be spoil and the number of the sheep have also be reduce to forty in consequence of they be foolishly keep pen up on board these loss and accident considerably weaken gregory 's resource and it be not until the 24th of November that any excursion on horseback be undertake a attempt have previously be make to ascend the river in the portable boat with which the expedition have be supply but it be not successful as the boat could not navigate the rocky bar in safety gregory leave camp accompany by he brother dr von mueller and wilson take seven horse and twenty day ' ration he object be to examine the country through which the explore party would have to travel on they route to the interior on this preliminary trip he penetrate as far as latitude 16 1\/2 south whence find the tributary flow from fine open plain and level forest country all well-grassed he return to the main camp on the 4th of January 1856 gregory start with a much larger party on a energetic dash into the interior he have with he six man besides he brother dr von mueller and baine the artist and thirty-six horse he retrace he step along he preliminary route and on the 30th of January think it wise judge from the rapid evaporation of the waterhole to make he means of retreat secure he form a temporary camp leave there four man and all the horse but eleven to await he return whilst he he brother dr mueller and a man name dean ride ahead to challenge the desert to the south on the 9th of February have run the victorium out he cross a almost level watershed and find himself on the confines of the desert from a slight rise he look southward : -- the horizon be unbroken all appear one slightly undulating plain with just sufficient triodium and bush grow on it to hide the red sand when view at a distance gregory review the problem from a logical standpoint he decide to follow the northern limit of the desert to the westward until he should find a southern-flowing watercourse which would afford he the opportunity to make a dash beyond its confines on the 15th of February he come to a small flat which gradually develop into a channel and ultimately become a creek run first west and then south-west this give he he desire opening and he pursue the course of the creek through good open country find the water plentiful though shallow on February 20th however the channel of the creek be lose in a immense grassy plain the country to the south be sandy and unpromising gregory keep westwards and succeed in again pick up the channel now find the water in it to be slightly brackish that day he cross the boundary of western australium the creek now give promise of continuity the water-hole take on a more permanent appearance it be now pursue a general south-west course and gregory though still rightly anticipate that it would eventually be lose in the dry interior determine to follow it as far south as should be compatible with safety he name the creek sturt 's creek after the gallant explorer of that name who be naturally then often in he mind the creek maintain its southern course until on the 8th of march it run out into a mud plain and a salt lake thus after have follow sturt 's creek for nearly 300 mile we have be disappoint in we hope that it would lead to some important outlet to the water of the australian interior it have however enable we to penetrate far into the level tract of country which may be term the great australian desert gregory convince that no useful result could arise from any attempt to penetrate the inhospitable region to the south determine to return before the rapidly-evaporating water on which they be dependent should vanish and cut off all retreat he therefore retrace he step up sturt 's creek and on the 28th of march arrive at he temporary depot where he find the man all well and the horse much improve in condition on the 2nd of April ac gregory take he brother henry baine and one man start on a excursion to examine the eastern tributary of the victorium and be absent a little over a fortnight on they return the whole of the member start for the landing-place on the victorium which they reach on the 9th of may after all arrangement and preparation have be complete gregory with most of the party start on the return journey overland to moreton bay the tom tough now caulk and repair be to make she way to the albert river in the gulf of carpentarium where they would again probably meet traverse the tributary of the victorium on he homeward way gregory meet with no remarkable incident until he arrival on the elsey a tributary of the roper river which he name after the surgeon of the expedition it be here that he come upon the last authentic trace of leichhardt he describe he discovery as follow : -- there be also the remains of a hut and the ash of a large fire indicate that there have be a party camp there for several week several tree from six to eight inch in diameter have be cut down with iron axis in fair condition and the hut build by cut notch in stand tree and rest a large pole therein for a ridge this hut have be burnt apparently by the subsequent bush fire and only some piece of the thickest timber remain unconsumed search be make for marked tree but none find nor be there any fragment of leather iron or other equipment of a explore party or of any bone of animal other than those common to australia have a explore party be destroy here there would most likely have be some indication and it may therefore be infer that the party proceed on its journey it could not have be a camp of leichhardt 's in 1845 as it be 100 mile south of he route to port essington and it be only six or seven year old judge by the growth of the tree have subsequently see some of leichhardt 's camp on the burdekin mackenzie and barcoo river a great similarity be observe in regard to the manner of build the hut and its relative position with regard to the fire and water supply and the position in regard to the great feature of the country be exactly where a party go westward would first receive a check from the waterless tableland between the roper and victorium river and would probably camp and reconnoitre ahead before attempt to cross to the north-west coast from the roper the party travel around the shore of the gulf keep rather more inland than leichhardt have do on reach the albert they find that the tom tough have not yet arrive at the rendezvous and gregory leave a marked tree with a message indicate the situation of some instruction he have bury push onward he route from the albert lay along much the same line of country as that follow by leichhardt during he journey to port essington he do not however make such a wide sweep to the north up to the mitchell but strike away from carpentarium at the gilbert river he correct the error leichhardt have fall into over the situation of the albert and re-name the river that he have mistake the leichhardt the explore party reach the settle district at hay 's station ranne south of the fitzroy and thence reach brisbane on the 16th of December 1856 to advance the search after leichhardt the interest in whose fate have be stimulate by the discovery make by gregory a public meeting be hold in September 1857 at which resolution be pass request monetary assistance from the government and offer the leadership of a new expedition to ac gregory the appeal be successful and accordingly in march 1858 gregory leave euroomba station on the dawson with a party of nine in all one of he brother go as second the expedition be equip for light travel take as mean of carriage pack-horse only of which there be thirty-one as well as nine saddle-horse gregory cross the nive on to the barcoo which he proceed to run down find the country in a very different condition from that in which it bloom when mitchell ride rejoicingly along what he think be a gulf river a sharp look out be of course keep for any trace of the miss party and on the 21st of April they come across another marked tree we discover a moreton bay ash -lrb- eucalyptus sp -rrb- about two foot in diameter mark with the letter l on the east side cut through the bark about four foot from the ground and near it the stump of some small tree that have be cut with a sharp axe also a deep notch cut in the side of a sloping tree apparently to support the ridge-pole of a tent or some similar purpose all indicate that a camp have be establish here by leichhardt 's partyno other indication have be find we continue the search down the river examine every likely spot for marked tree but without success approach the thomson river they find the country suffer from drought although the river be run in consequence of some late rain as winter be now approach there be however no spring in the vegetation and they horse be suffer great hardship on the 15th of may they find themselves beyond the rainfall and realize that lack of water be likely to be add to a absence of grass we however succeed in reach latitude 23 degree 47 minute when the absence of water and grass -- the rain not have extend so far north and the channel of the river separate into small gully and spread on to the wide plain -- preclude we progress further to the north or west and the only chance of save we horse be to return south as quickly as possible this be a most severe disappointment as we have just reach that part of the country through which leichhardt most probably travel if the season be sufficiently wet to render it practicable thus compel to abandon the principal object of the expedition only two course remain open -- either to return to the head of the victorium -lrb- barcoo -rrb- river and attempt a northern course by the valley of the belyando or to follow down the river and ascertain whether it flow into cooper 's creek or the darling the latter alternative be choose and they proceed to retrace they step down the thomson and on reach the junction of the barcoo they continue south and west in fact follow kennedy 's route they soon find themselves involve in the same difficulty that have beset that explorer the river -- now cooper 's creek -- break up into countless channel run through barren fissured plain toiling on through these vary by a interlude of sandhill gregory at last reach a better-grassed land where he famished horse regain a little strength he reach sturt 's furthest point and continue on to the point where strzeleckus 's creek carry off some of the surplus flood water and finally lose the many channel amongst the sandhill and flood plain he again strike strzeleckus 's creek and trace it as he then think into lake torren but in reality into lake blanche for the salt lake region have not then be properly delimit he reach baker 's recently-formed station eight mile beyond mount hopeless and thence he go on to adelaide 182 frank t gregory -lrb- illustration frank t gregory -rrb- it be in western australium in march 1857 that frank t gregory commence he career as a independent explorer by take advantage of a sudden heavy downpour of rain on the upper reach of the murchison river which flood the dry course of the lower portion where he be then engage on survey work gregory at once seize the opportunity thus afford of examine the upper reach of this river from which former explorer have be drive back by the aridity of the country accompany by he assistant s trigg he proceed up the river finding thanks to the wet season that have precede he luxuriant grass and ample supplies of water in consequence he have a more please account of the country to bring back than the report base on the thirsty experience of austin so easy do he find the country that only scarcity of provision prevent he from push on to the long-sought-for gascoyne river as it be he return after a absence of thirteen day have complete what the perth gazette of that time justly describe as one of the most unassuming expedition yet important in its result it be so far satisfactory and rouse such fresh hope in the mind of the settler that they once more form bright hope of what the river gascoyne might have in store for the successful explorer for a long time now they have become resign to the conclusion that they northern pathway be bar by a dry scrubby country but they at once take advantage of the promising practical passage along which frank gregory have lead the way another expedition be organise to penetrate to the gascoyne and the leadership be naturally offer to frank gregory be accept by he on the 16th of April 1858 he leave the geraldine mine with a lightly-equipped party of six include jb roe son of the surveyor-general they have with they six pack and six riding-horse and ration for 60 day they proceed up the murchison and on the 25th of the same month they reach a tributary call the impey which have be the highest point reach by gregory the precede year this time however the party do not find such ample pasture as he have describe still follow the river up until the 30th April on that day they strike off on a nor-north-east course the course of the murchison tend too much in a easterly direction to lead they speedily on to the gascoyne on the 3rd they reach a gentle stony ascent which prove to be the watershed between the two river descend the slope to the northward they soon come to the head of a watercourse flow northwards they follow the new creek and on the 6th of may come to a river join it from the eastward which at last prove to be the gascoyne gregory keep down the south bank of the gascoyne and on the 12th of may pass a large tributary come from the north which he name the lyon on the 17th they ascend a sandy ridge about sixty foot in height and have a view of shark 's bay he return along the north bank of the river and have reach the lyon follow that river up on the 3rd of June he ascend the highest mountain yet discover in western australium which he name mount augustus after he brother gregory give the elevation at 3480 foot but mount bruce in the hammersley range to the north of it have since be find to be higher \* from the summit however he have a extensive view and be enable to sketch in the course of the various river for over twenty mile \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- 3800 foot as they have now be out 51 day and they supply of provision be approach the end the party turn back at mount augustus and strike southwards on the 8th the gascoyne be re-crossed at a place where its course lay through flat and ana-branch on the 10th of June they again come to the murchison and follow it down to the geraldine mine and finally reach perth on the 10th of July this expedition so fruitful in its result to the pastoral welfare of the colony cost the settler only they contribution in horse and ration and a cash expenditure of forty pound the discovery of so much fresh available country on the gascoyne river with the prospect of a new base for exploration in the tropical region beyond attract the attention of english capitalist the american civil war have so depressed the cotton trade that those interested in cotton manufacture be seek for fresh field in which to establish the growth of the plant frank gregory be then in london and advantage be take of he presence to urge upon the home government and the royal geographical society the desirability of fitting out a expedition to proceed direct to the north-west coast of australium accompany by a large body of asiatic labourer and all the necessary appliance for the establishment of a colony fortunately this rash and ill-considered scheme be greatly modify under wise advice roe the surveyor-general of western australium and other gentleman practically acquaint with the subject suggest that the country should be explore before the idea of any actual settlement should be entertain act on this advice the imperial government give a grant of 2000 pound to be supplement by a equal subsidy by the colonial treasury gregory therefore obtain a suitable outfit in london for the party and leave for perth to complete the necessary detail the usual official delay occur and the expedition do not leave fremantle in the barque dolphin until 23rd April 1861 nearly two month later than have be arrange as the rainy season in northern australium terminate in march this delay be unfortunate nickol bay on the north-west coast be the destination and be safely reach the work of disembarkation be complete the explore party start on the 25th of may 1861 gregory first pursue a western course as he wish to cut any considerable river discharging into the sea and come from the interior -lrb- illustration maitland brown -rrb- on the 29th of may they strike the river which be subsequently name the fortescue as this river seem likely to answer they expectation of a passage through the broken range that hem they in to the south they follow it up a narrow precipitous gorge force they to leave the river and after surmount a table-land they steer a course due south to a high range which however they find too rough to surmount make back on to a north-east course they again strike the fortescue above the narrow glen which have stop they they follow it up once more through good country occasionally hamper by its course lie between rugged hill but they finally cross the range partly by the aid of the river-bed and partly through a gap on the 18th June they succeed in completely surmount the range and find that to the south the decline be more gradual the range be name the hammersley range they horse have suffer considerably and have lose some of they shoe in the rough hill from here they keep south mean to strike the lyon river discover by frank gregory during he last trip on come to a small tributary which he name the hardey he form a depot camp leave some of the party and the most sore-footed of the horse he push on with three man brown harding and brockman take three packhorse and provision for eight day on the 23rd of June they come on a large western-flowing river which he call the ashburton and which have since prove to be the longest river in western australium have cross this river and still pursue a southerly course he arrive at a sandstone tableland and on the 23rd have as gregory write at last the satisfaction of observe the bold outline of mount augustus he return to the depot camp on the 29th and though anxious to follow up the ashburton to the east the condition of he horse ' foot and the lack of shoe prevent he during the return journey to nickol bay he ascend mount samson and from the summit obtain a extensive view that embrace every prominent peak within seventy mile include mount bruce to the north and mount augustus to the south the distance between these two elevation be 124 geographical mile they cross the hammersley range on to the level plain of the fortescue by means of a far easier pass than that use on the outward journey and arrive at the bay on the 19th of July on the 31st of July gregory start on a new expedition to the east on the 9th of August he come to a river which apparently head from the direction they desire to explore -- namely the south-east cross another river which they name the shaw the explorer still keep east and south of east find on the 27th of August a river of some importance run through a large extent of good pastoral and agricultural land this river be name the de gray but as they present object be to push to the south-east they leave its promising bank and proceed into a hilly country where they soon become involve in deep ravine after surmount a rugged tableland they camp that night at some spring the next night the 29th of August they come some time after dark on to the bank of a wide river line with the magnificent weep tea-tree as three of the horse be tire out gregory determine to follow this river up for a day or two instead of close with a range of granite hill cap with horizontal sandstone which loom threateningly in they path so for two or three day they continue on the oakover as he christen the river and follow its western branch a tributary of that lead they in amongst the range which be thread by a easy pass on the 2nd of September they get through the range and emerge upon open sandy plain of great extent with nothing visible across the vast expanse but low ridge of red drift-sand here it be gregory 's lot to experience a test almost equal to one of the grim tramp that have try sturt and eyre he camp at a native desert camp and the next day fail to find any water ahead have to return and form a depot here he leave five of the party with instruction to remain three day and then fall back upon the oakover he himself with brown and harding and six horse go on to find a passage so far he have encounter fewer obstacle and make more encouraging discovery than have fall to the lot of any other western australian explorer but he be now confront with the stern presence that have daunt the bravest and best in australium in front of he lay barren plain hill of drift sand and the ominous red haze of the desert let gregory describe the scene in he own word as the locality have become historic : -- the three man start on the 6th of September steer south-south-east along the range look for some stream-bed that might lead we through the plain but i be disappoint to find that they be all lose in the first mile after leave the hill and as cross the numerous ridge of sand prove very fatiguing to the horse we determine once more to attempt to strike to the eastward between the ridge which we do for fifteen mile when we horse again show sign of fail we which leave we the only alternative of either push on at all hazard to a distant range that be just visible to the eastward where from the numerous native fire and general depression of the country there be every reason to think a large river would be find to exist or to make for some deep rocky gorge in the granite hill ten mile to the south in which there be every prospect of finding water in the former case the travel would be smoothest but the distance so great that in the event of we fail to find water we probably should not succeed in bring back one of we horse while in the latter we should have to climb over the sand-ridge which we have already find so fatiguing this course however involve the least amount of risk and we accordingly strike south four mile and halt for the night 7th September the horse do not look much refresh by the night 's rest we however divide three gallon of water amongst they and start off early in the hope of reach the range by noon but we have not go three mile when one of the pack-horse that be carry less than forty pound weight begin to fail and the load be place on my saddle-horse it do not however enable he to get on more than a couple of mile further when we be compel to abandon he leave he under the shade of the only tree we could find in the hope that we could bring back water to he relief finding that it would be many hour before the horse could be get on to the range i start ahead on foot leave brown and harding to come on gently while i be to make a signal by fire if successful in find water two hour ' heavy toil through the sand under a broiling sun bring I to the range where i continue to hunt up one ravine after another until 5 pm without success twelve hour ' almost incessant walk on a scanty breakfast and without water with the thermometer over a hundred degree of fahrenheit begin to tell upon I severely so much so that by the time i have track up my companion -lrb- who have reach the hill by 1 pm and be anxiously wait for I -rrb- it be as much as i could do to carry my rifle and accoutrements the horse be look truly wretched and i be convince that the only chance of save they if water be not find would be by abandon we pack-saddles provision and everything we could possibly spare and try and recover they afterwards if practicable we therefore encamp for the night on the last plot of grass we could find and proceed to make arrangement for a early start in the morning there be still a few pint of water in the keg have be very spare in the use of it this enable we to have a little tea and make a small quantity of damper of which we all stand in much need camp 77 8th September at 4 pm we be again up have dispose of we equipment and provision except we riding-saddle instrument and firearm by suspend they in the branch of a low tree we divide a pint of water for we breakfast and by the first peep of dawn be drive we famished horse at they best speed towards the depot which be now thirty-two mile distant for the first eight mile they go on pretty well but the moment the sun begin to have power they flag greatly and it be not long before we be oblige to relinquish another horse quite unable to proceed by 9 be i find that my previous day 's march and the small allowance of food that i have take be begin to have its effect upon I and that it be probable that i could not reach the depot before the next morning by which time the party leave there be to fall back to the oakover i therefore direct brown who be somewhat fresher than myself to push on to the camp and bring out fresh horse and water while harding and myself would do we best to bring on any straggle horse that could not keep up with he by dark we succeed in reach to within nine mile of the depot finding unmistakable sign towards evening of the condition to which the horse take on by brown be reduce by the saddle gun hobble and even bridle scatter along the line of march which have be take off to enable they to get on a few mile further next morning they meet brown within a few mile of the depot come back to they with water all the horse but the two which have be leave at the remotest point be recover further on gregory remark upon the painful effect produce on the horse by excessive heat and thirst : -- i can not omit to remark the singular effect of excessive thirst upon the eye of the horse they absolutely sink into they head until there be a hollow of sufficient depth to bury the thumb in and there be a appearance as though the whole of the head have shrink with they produce a very unpleasant and ghastly expression gregory be now convince that the sandy tract before he be not to be cross with the means at he command so reluctantly he have to return to the oakover and follow that river down to its junction with the de gray down the unite stream which now bear the name of the de gray the weary explorer travel through good fertile land until the coast be reach on the 25th of September the worn-out state of they horse delay they greatly in get across a piece of dry country between the yule and the sherlock where one animal have to be abandon on the 18th of October they reach nickol bay and be gladly welcome by the crew of the dolphin who have profitably pass they time in collect several ton of pearl-shell and a few pearl on the 23rd the horse and equipment be ship and the dolphin sail for fremantle this journey end frank gregory 's active life as a explorer and it be a noteworthy career which now close for the western colony he have throw open to settlement the vast area of the north-western coastal territory and after relieve the murchison from the stigma of barrenness that rest on it he have discover and make know all the river to the north and east until the oakover be reach it be singular that frank gregory should like nearly all explorer have err greatly in the deduction he draw when force to turn back from the country beyond the oakover he much lament the fact because not only have we now attain to within a very few mile of the longitude in which from various geographical datum there be just grounds for believe that a large river may be find to exist drain central australium but the character of the country appear strongly to indicate the vicinity of such a feature of course we now know that no such river drain the center of australium on the contrary beyond gregory 's eastern limit there occur a long stretch of coastline unmarked by the mouth of any river inland to the southward the country even in this day be know as the most hostile and repellant desert in australium markedly deficient in continuous watercourse providence then restrain he footstep from a land wherein earth and sun seem to unite in hostility against the white intruder it be a pity that frank gregory do not give he undoubted power of description free scope in he journal now and again he give they rein but soon call a halt as though alarm that picturesque language should be find in a scientific geographical journal he brother augustus be unfortunately just as correct and precise frank go to reside in queensland in 1862 and be nominate to the legislative council of that colony in 1874 before go to queensland he have act for some time as surveyor-general of western australium he be marry at ipswich queensland to the daughter of alexander hume he hold office for some time in the mcilwraith ministry as postmaster-general he be a gold medallist of the royal geographical society and one of the best of the australian explorer as bushman navigator surveyor and scientist he die at toowoomba in 1888 on the 24th of October chapter 19 from west to east 191 austin by 1854 the gold fever be run high in australium and each colony be eager to discover new digging within its border robert austin assistant surveyor-general of western australium be instruct to take charge of a inland explore party to search for pastoral country and to examine the interior for indication of gold he start from the head of the swan river on a north-easterly course and on the 16th of July reach a lake rumor of whose existence have be spread by the black who have call it cowcow the colonist have hope that it would prove to be a lake of fresh water in the gascoyne valley but cowcowing in reality be a salt marsh no great distance from the starting-point of austin 's expedition the lake be dry and its bed cover with salt incrustation show that its water be undoubtedly saline thence austin make directly north and pass through repellant country such as always fall to the lot of the early western explorer in they initial effort he direct he course to a distant range of table-topped hill here he find both grass and water and name the highest elevation mount kenneth after kenneth brown a member of he party thence he keep a north-east course traverse stony plain intersect by the dry bed of sandy watercourse here the party meet with dire misfortune the horse eat from a patch of poisonous box plant and nearly all of they be disabled a few escape but the greater number never recover from the effect of the poison and fourteen die push on in the hope of find a safe place in which to recruit austin find himself so cripple in he means of transit that he have to abandon all but he most necessary store he now make for shark 's bay whither a vessel be to be send to render he assistance or take the party home if require the course to shark 's bay lead they over country that do not tempt they to linger on the way on the 21st of September a sad accident occur they be then camp at a spring near a cave in the face of a cliff in which there be some curious native rock-painting while rest here a young man name charle farmer accidentally shoot himself in the arm and in spite of the most careful attention the poor fellow die of lockjaw in the most terrible agony he be bury at the cave-spring camp and the highest hill in the neighborhood be christen mount farmer he death and burial remind one of sturt 's friend poole who rest in the east of the continent under the shadow of mount poole thus two lonely grave in the australian wilderness be guard by mountain whose name perpetuate the memory of they occupant and who could desire a nobler monument than the everlasting hill austin now come to the upper tributary of the murchison only to find they waterless even the deep cut channel of the murchison itself be dry they cross the river but beyond it all they effort to penetrate westward be in vain they have fight they way to within one hundred mile of shark 's bay but they have then be so long without water that further advance mean certain death even during the retreat to the murchison the life of the horse be save only by the accidental discovery of a small native well in a most improbable situation namely in the middle of a bare ironstone plain they only course now be to fall back on the murchison hope that they would find water at they cross austin push on ahead of the main body and strike the river twenty-five mile below they previous cross to make the tantalising discovery that the pool of water on which they have fix they hope be hopelessly salt a desperate and vain search be make to the southward during a day of fierce and terrible heat but on the next day have make for some small hill they have sight they providentially find both water and grass the whole party rest at this spot which be gratefully name mount welcome nothing daunt by the suffering he have undergo austin now make another attempt to reach shark 's bay on the way to the murchison they have induce a old native to come with they to point out the watering-place of the black at first he be able to show they one or two that in all probability they would have miss but after they have cross the murchison and proceed some distance to the westward the water the native have rely on be find to have disappear and it be only after the most acute suffering from thirst and the loss of some more horse that they manage to struggle back to mount welcome austin 's conduct during these terrible march seem to have border on the heroic whilst he companion fall away one by one and lay down to die and the one native of the wild be cower weep under a bush he toil on and manage to reach a little well which the blackfellow have formerly show he without rest he tramp back with water to revive he exhaust companion at mount welcome they find the water on the point of give out and weak and exhaust though they be a immediate start have to be make to the geraldine mine a small settlement have be form there to work the galena lode discover by gregory that they would ever reach the mine the explorer could not hope they and they horse be in a state of extreme weakness the distance to the mine be one hundred and sixty mile and to the highest point on the murchison where gregory have find water they first stage be ninety mile they begin they journey at midnight and by means of forced march travel day and night they reach gregory 's old camp on the river fortunately they have find a small supply of water at one place on the way from this point the worst of they peril be pass they follow the river down obtain water from spring in the bank and on the 27th of November arrive at the mine where they be warmly entertain thence they return to perth some by sea and some overland austin 's exploration have lead to no profitable result cowcowing have prove only a saline marsh similar to lake moore the large lake which have haunt gregory the upper murchison be not of a nature to invite further acquaintance or settlement and the whole of the journey have be a disheartening round of daily struggle with a barren and waterless district under the fiery sun of the southern summer austin think that eastward of he limit the country would improve but subsequent exploration have not substantiate he supposition he have have singularly hard fortune to contend against after the serious loss he sustain by the poisoning of he horse a risk that can not be effectually ward off by the greatest care he have be pit against exceptionally dry country cover with dense scrub and almost grassless in which the man and horse must assuredly have lose they life but for he dauntless and heroic conduct austin afterwards settle in north queensland and follow the profession of mining surveyor 192 sir john forrest -lrb- illustration john forrest in 1874 -rrb- john forrest the explorer who ultimately succeed in cross the hitherto impassable desert of the western center now make he first essay a old rumor that the black have slay some white man and they horse on a salt lake in the interior be now revive and gain some credence a black who state that he have visit the scene of the incident be interview and baron von mueller write to the western australian government offer to lead a party thither and ascertain if there be any truth in the report the government favourably consider the offer and make preparation to send out a party von mueller be prevent from take charge and the command be give to john forrest then a surveyor in the government service forrest be bear near bunbury western australium on the 22nd of August 1847 and enter the survey department of west australium in December 1865 on the 26th of April 1869 forrest leave yarrage then the furthest station to the eastward when camp at a native well visit by austin thirteen year before he say that he could still distinctly see the track of that explorer 's horse past this spot he fall in with some native who tell he that a large party of man and horse have die in a locality away to the north and that a gun belong to the party be in possession of the native on closer examination this story be prove to have its origin in the death of austin 's horse forrest continue he journey to the east and on the 18th come to a large dry salt lake which he name lake barlee a attempt to cross this lake result in the bog of the horse and it be only after strenuous exertion that the horse and pack be once more bring on to hard ground lake barlee be afterwards find to be of considerable size extend for more than forty mile to the eastward the native guide forrest have with he now begin to express doubt as to he knowledge of the exact spot at which he see the remains after considerable search forrest come across a large party of the aborigine of the district these man however prove to be anything but friendly they throw dowak at the guide and advise the whites to go back before they be kill next morning they have speech with two of they who say that the bone be those of horse some distance to the north they say they would come to the camp the next day and lead the whites there but they do not fulfil they promise no other profitable intercourse with the black be possible one old man howl piteously all the time they be in he company and another who have two child with he give they to understand most emphatically that he have never hear of any horse have be kill though some native have just kill and eat he own brother after vainly search the district for many day forrest determine to utilise the remainder of the time at he disposal by examine the country as far to the eastward as he resource would permit it be now clear that the story of the white man 's remains have originate in the skeleton of the horse that perish during austin 's trip no matter how circumstantial might be a narration of the black they invariably contradict themselves the next time they be interrogate and it be evident that no useful purpose would be serve by follow they on a foolish errand from place to place forrest therefore penetrate some distance east but be not encourage by the discovery of any useful country nevertheless he start on a solitary expedition ahead take only one black boy and provision for seven day he reach a point one hundred mile beyond the camp of the main body to the eastward of mount margaret on the present goldfield he ascend the highest tree he could find and find the outlook be dreary and desolate the country be certainly slightly more open than that hitherto traverse but it be cover with spinifex intersperse with a occasional stunt gum-tree rough sandstone cliff be visible about six mile to the north-east and more to the north appear a narrow line of samphire flat with gum tree and cypress grow on they edge of surface water there be no appearance on he homeward route forrest keep a more northerly and westerly course and cross lake barlee and examine the northern shore but he find nothing to induce he to modify the unfavourable opinion pronounce on the country by other explorer he return to perth on the 6th August forrest be next place at the head of a expedition which be to cross to adelaide by way of the shore of the great australian bight along the same ill-omened route follow by eyre and never trodden since he remarkable journey this time the historic cliff be to be traverse with but slight privation and no bloodshed though the information supply by eyre be consider to be thoroughly trustworthy it be recognize that with the scanty means of observation at he command and he famished condition a few important fact might have escape he notice and that if he route be follow by a well-equipped party the terror of the region might assume less gigantic proportion forrest 's company be to consist of the leader and he brother alexander two white man and two native one of whom have accompany forrest on he former trip a coast schooner the adur of 30 ton be to accompany they round the coast call at esperance bay israelite bay and euclum supply they with provision at these depot on the 30th of march they leave perth the first part of the journey to esperance bay be through comparatively settle and well-known country so that no fresh interest attach to it they arrive at dempster 's station at esperance a few day before the adur sail into the bay and on the 9th of may

esperance bay to israelite bay the journey lack incident and it be not until forrest again part from he relief boat that he have to encounter the most serious part of he undertaking he have now to face the line of cliff which frown over the bight behind which he have as he know little or no chance of finding water for 150 mile have make what arrangement he could to carry water he leave the last water on the 5th of April about a week afterwards he reach the break in the cliff where water could be obtain by digging in the sandhill luckily they have find many small rock-hole fill with water which have enable they to push steadily on forrest say that the cliff which fall perpendicularly to the sea although grand in the extreme be terrible to gaze from : -- after look very cautiously over the precipice we all run back quite terrify by the dreadful view while rest and recruit at the sandhill he make a excursion to the north and after pass through a fringe of scrub twelve mile deep he come upon most beautifully-grassed downs at fifty mile from the sea there be nothing visible as far as the eye could reach but gentle undulating plain of grass and saltbush there be no prospects of water he be force to turn back fortunately find a few surface pool both on he outward and homeward way on the 24th they start from the sandhill for euclum the last meeting-place appoint with the adur during this stage he keep to the north of the hampton range and through a country well-grassed but destitute of surface water the party reach euclum on the 2nd of July and find the adur duly await they whilst at euclum forrest in company with he brother make another excursion to the north he penetrate some thirty mile inland and find as before boundless plain beautifully grass though destitute of any sign of water after leave euclum the explorer have a distressing stage to the head of the great bight where they finally obtain water by digging in the sand on this stage the horse suffer more than on any previous one have have to travel three day without a drink from this point they soon reach the settle district of south australia in safety although this journey of forrest 's can not strictly be call a explore expedition inasmuch as he repeat the journey make under such terrible condition by eyre travel in the opposite direction yet it be of first-rate importance inasmuch as owe to the greater facility he enjoy he be able to pronounce a more final verdict than eyre be able to give forrest find that the gloomy thicket be a fringe confine to the immediate coast-line on every occasion that he penetrate it he come on good pastoral land beyond he write : -- the country pass over between longitude 126 degree 24 minute and 128 degree 30 minute east as a grazing country far surpass anything i have ever see there be nothing in the settle portion of western australium equal to it either in extent or quality but the absence of permanent water be a great drawbackthe country be very level with scarcely any undulation and become clearer as you proceed north on he arrival in adelaide he receive a hearty welcome and a similar reception be accord he on he return to perth unfortunately this expedition destroy all hope of the existence of any river the mouth of which might have be cross unwittingly by eyre we now come to that exploit which gain for forrest a place in the foremost rank of australian explorer the western central desert have long defy the explorer in they attempt to cross its dread confines but the young west australian take he man and most of he horse through the very heart of the terrible desert we have see how three expedition have start from the east for the purpose of make this continental traverse all differently compose -- one with the

alexander two white man and two native to endeavor to cross the unknown stretch of desert country that separate the colony of eastern australium from the western settlement they route at first lay along the murchison river follow the upper course which they find to run through well-grassed country available for either sheep or cattle from the crest of the head watershed they have a view of they future travelling-ground to the eastward it appear level with low elevation but there be a lack of conspicuous hill which do not promise favourably for water-finding though good pasture might be obtainable for the next few day the party be dependent for water on occasional spring and scanty clay-pan on the 27th when follow down a creek they suddenly come upon a fine spring apparently permanent which be describe by forrest in he journal as one of the best he have ever see both the grass and other herbage around be of fine quality this place he name windich spring after tommy windich one of the black who have now be with forrest on three expedition to the north-west be a fine range of hill which he name the carnarvon range on leave this oasis the explorer find themselves in less attractive country spinifex and sand become more frequent feature of the landscape and the occasional water-supply become precarious on the 2nd of June forrest discover the spring which aid they so greatly in they effort to cross this he call weld spring and he describe it as unlimited in supply clear fresh and extend down its gully for over twenty chain at this relief camp they halt in order to rest the horse on the 8th forrest start on a scout expedition ahead take only a black boy with he he fully anticipate finding water for as yet they have not reach a waterless region and he leave instruction for the rest to follow in he track in a day 's time he be unfortunate in he selection of a course for it lead they for more than twenty mile over undulating sand-ridge without a sight of any indication of the presence of water at daybreak from the top of a low stony rise he obtain a extensive outlook far as he could see to the north and east nothing be visible but the level unending spinifex not a watercourse or a hill in sight evidently they be trespassing on the edge of the central desert turn back they meet the remainder of the party about twenty mile from weld spring and the whole body retreat to they lately desert camp after a day 's rest alexander forrest and a black boy start to the south-east search for water at one o'clock sixty or seventy native appear on the brow of the rise overlook the camp they be paint and dress in war costume and evidently plan a attack after some consultation they suddenly descend the slope and dash at the camp fortunately the whites be on the alert and a well-directed volley send they in head-long retreat to they vantage-point on the brow of the ridge where they hold a fresh council of war presently they renew the assault but a rifle-shot from forrest put a end to the skirmish that evening alexander and the boy return and be much surprised to hear of the adventure with the black they have be over fifty mile from camp and have pass over some well-grassed country but have find no water as they detention at weld spring promise to be indefinite the party then build a rough shelter of stone in order to ensure themselves some measure of protection against night attack when this small defense work be finish forrest again reconnoitr ahead for water accompany by one black boy and find some clay waterhole of no great extent but sufficient for camp purpose thither the camp be shift on the 22nd the leader make another search in advance and in thirty mile come to a fine supply of water in a gully run through a well-grassed plain whereon there be abundance of good feed for the horse to the south of this spot there be a small salt lake which he name lake augusta another good spring in grassy country be also find on the 30th of June forrest make a scout excursion to the eastward but experience ill fortune for have penetrate as far as possible into the spinifex country he horse give out by the aid of some scanty pool of rainwater trap in some rock he succeed in get a short distance farther on foot and in reach a low range from its summit he obtain a extensive but depressing view such as too often greet the explorer at that time and in that part of australium far away to the north and east the gray horizon be as level and as uniform as the placid sea spinifex everywhere unbroken by range or elevation within over thirty mile he be now worried and perplexed as to the direction of he future movement the main party be follow up he track but to plunge unthinkingly into such a desert as lay in front of they be sheer madness fate relent however and after much toilsome search forrest find a small supply of water enough for a few day where he gratefully await the approach of he companion during the short respite thus accord they a diligent search for water be make amongst the low range the only alternative be a retreat of seventy mile a little more water be find to the south-east and as there be coarse rough grass around the well it help to prolong they rest and afford more time for further search this time alexander forrest go ahead and twenty-five mile further to the eastward find a spring which be name after he the alexander spring another scout excursion to the east be likewise fortunate as far as water be concerned but the feed for the horse be very poor indeed and they be suffer greatly they be now within one hundred mile of gosse 's furthest point west but that hundred mile be one long line of desert peril repeat effort to traverse it only reduce the little remaining strength in the horse lead to no discovery of water but at length a kindly shower fill some rock hole to the north-east of they camp and after much exertion and hardship they reach the old camp that gile have name fort mueller and be able to congratulate themselves upon have be the first to bridge the central gap of desert that separate the two colony as the course of forrest 's party from fort mueller to the telegraph line be more or less the same as that pursue by gosse it be unnecessary to follow the journal to its end it be enough to state that on Sunday the 27th of September the telegraph line be reach at a point some distance to the north of the peake station thus safely conclude a expedition that make a mark in we geographical history although it be accompany by no notable discovery central australium have now be cross in the same zone that have turn back the explorer from the east and the fact that forrest get through equip with only the ordinary outfit of horse stamp he as a leader of unusual foresight and judgment forrest 's last expedition be rather a survey than a journey of discovery in 1883 in company with several other surveyor he land at roebuck bay and examine a large portion of the kimberley division he proceed from roebuck bay to the fitzroy river which he brother have lately explore and examine the intermediate country as far as st george 's range reporting that it consist mainly of rich elevated grassy plain with abundance of water he also investigate cambridge gulf and the lowest part of the ord river after quit the field of exploration

1879 alexander forrest lead a expedition from the de gray river to the now customary goal the overland telegraph line of south australia he leave the de gray on the 25th of February and reach beagle bay on the 10th of April the country pass over be like most land in the immediate neighborhood of the coast poor and indifferent from beagle bay he follow the coast round to the fitzroy and proceed up that river until he encounter a range which be name the king leopold range here the party leave the fitzroy of which river forrest speak very highly and strike north look for a pass through the range it prove to be very rough and precipitous and when at last they reach the sea they find themselves in a angle wedge in between the sea and the range romantic and picturesque accord to forrest 's description but quite impassible here too the native approach they in threaten number but through the exercise of tact peace be preserve on the 22nd of June they attack one tier of the range and after a steep climb which cause the death of one horse they reach the height of 800 foot and camp find it so hard upon the horse forrest leave they to rest and go on foot to discover a road but he come upon endless rugged zigzag which so involved and baffle he that he give it up in despair and return he have now most reluctantly to abandon the idea of surmount the range and to make for the fitzroy once more follow up the margaret a tributary of the fitzroy he manage to work round the southern end of the range which still frown defiance at he and at last reach the summit the crest of a tableland whence he see before he good grassy hill and plain of this country which he call nicholson plain forrest speak most enthusiastically and doubtless after the late struggle with the range it must have appear a perfect picture of enchantment on the 24th they reach a fine river which be then run strong they name it the ord and follow its course for a time thence he continue he way to the line and on the 18th of August come to the victorium river from the victorium forrest have a hard struggle to reach the telegraph line the ration be nearly exhaust and one man be very ill the leader start for daly water station take one man with he after much suffering and privation they at last reach the line and obtain water at some tank keep for the use of the line repairer the absence of a map of the

as the calvert expedition from its originator it be under la well the south australian surveyor who have be the energetic second of the former elder expedition the other be equip and lead by the honorable david carnegie well form a depot at a spot well provide with camel feed and water at some distance to the south-west of forrest 's lake augusta which he find at that time dry here he leave the main part of he caravan to await he return whilst he make a fly trip to the north he be away from the 10th of August to the 8th of September during which he find at he furthest point a distance of two hundred mile a good native well which he name midway well on the 14th of September the whole party make a start and reach midway well on the 29th all well at separation well another good well a little farther to the north the party separated cf well a cousin of the leader and gl jone intend to travel for about eighty mile in a north-west direction to examine the country and then to return on a north-east course and rejoin the caravan at joanna spring which have relieve warburton in he extremity about thirty mile south of joanna spring where the leader expect the two man to cut he track well find he camel suffer terribly from the extreme heat and they labor among the constantly-recurring sand-ridge whilst the scanty native well they find be insufficient to give they camel water when at last they reach the latitude of joanna spring they have be oblige to abandon three camel and all they equipment except the actual necessaries it be also evident that the longitude of the spring give by warburton be wrong for all the country around be a sandy desert without the slightest indication of well or spring to linger in such a spot be to court destruction and they have to push on to the fitzroy as fast as they worn-out camel could take they the reader will remember that warburton have fail to find ac gregory 's most southerly point on sturt 's creek when look for it and it be afterwards prove that joanna spring have be chart by he about ten mile to the westward of its true position on the 7th of November in the darkness of morning they at last reach the fitzroy with the camel just at they last gasp on the 16th of December well accompany by that veteran pioneer n buchanan formerly of queensland start back with a afghan a native boy and eight camel to look for the two man who he hope have succeed in find joanna spring he be absent until the 10th of January 1897 when he be force to return unsuccessful at the beginning of April take with he he former companion of the expedition well renew the search and on the 9th at last succeed in identify the joanna spring of warburton on the 13th some article belong to the lose man be find amongst the native but he do not at that time find the body he start again with two member of the west australium police force sub-inspector ord and trooper nicholson and native tracker this time they be successful in induce some native to guide they to the exact spot where the remains lay amongst the spinifex and sand the body be within six mile of the place where on the last search expedition well have find article of equipment with the native gl jone have keep a journal which supply the clue to the cause of they death he state in he journal say well that they have go west-north-west for five day after separate from the main party then travel a short distance north-east and that both he and charle feel the heat terribly and be both unwell they then return to the well -lrb- separation well -rrb- after a absence of nine day rest at the water five day and then start to follow we track northward afterwards one of they camel die which oblige they to walk a great deal and they become very weak and exhaust by the intense heat when write he say that two day previously he attempt to follow they camel which have stray but after walk half-a-mile he feel too weak to proceed and return with difficulty there be at that time about two quart of water remain to they and he do not think they could last long after that be finish from the above extract from well 's journal it be evident that the unfortunate man lose they life through a mistake in judgment in return to separation well the stray away of they camel and the merciless ray of the desert sun the account of this the first expedition to cross the great sandy desert from south to north confirm in every particular warburton 's experience of the difficulty of exploration in that region the intense heat of the sun and its radiation from the red sand-ridge the heat from both sky and earth render it nearly impossible to travel during day the only time when a man can perceive those slight indication which may eventually lead he to water the traveller be therefore compel to make night-stage and frequently pass unheed the very pool or well that would have save he life during the night not only be the natural physical feature difficult to discern but the bird

braeside station on the oakover river cross into the desert country rudall guide by black come upon a camp in which footstep suppose to be those of the miss man be traceable he camel fail he the track be lose and he be oblige to return a second search be likewise fruitless but rumor bring in by the native of stray camel cause a third party to be organise rudall this time go south of the head of the oakover and penetrate the dry spinifex country below the tropic here the body of two man suppose to have be murder by the native be find but on further investigation it be decide that the remains be not those of the man they be search for on he return rudall start out on a final trip and penetrate to a point sixty mile south of joanna spring before return though these journey be not successful in attain the initial object of they search they be of great service in gain much information concern the hitherto unknown desert run easterly into this dry belt rudall find a creek which be now know as the rudall river -lrb- illustration david wynford carnegie -rrb- four day after well have start the honorable david carnegie fourth son of the ninth earl of southesk bear march 23rd 1871 leave a outpost of civilization call doyle 's well some fifty mile south of lake darlot intend to cross warburton 's desert on a north-easterly course about two hundred mile to the east of the route pursue by

kimberley and coolgardie -lrb- 3 -rrb- the discovery of patch of auriferous country within the confines of the desert in the two last object carnegie be doom to disappointment but as a geographical contribution to we scanty knowledge of north-west australium the outcome of he repeated journey be distinctly valuable carnegie start with three white man and a native boy and for many day pass through country that afford no water for the camel of which they have nine a native be induce to lead they to a singular spring situate in a cavern twenty-five foot underground though the water be not easy of access have to be haul up by bucket to the surface there be a ample supply for the camel and as carnegie consider the well to be permanent he name it the empress spring the discovery of this subterranean spring be indeed a godsend as when they eventually reach forrest 's alexander spring they find it dry a similar experience have befall ww mill who after forrest 's exploration have attempt to take over a mob of camel in forrest 's track strangely enough a lagoon of fresh water be find at the foot of the creek in which the spring be situate and this satisfied they want from this sheet which be name woodhouse lagoon the party keep a nearly northerly course across what carnegie call in he book the great undulating desert of gravel over this terrible region of drought and desolation the party make they painful way by the aid of miserable native well find with the greatest difficulty and a few chance patch of parakeelium \* until they be relieve by find through the good office of a aboriginal guide a beautiful spring which be name helena spring they be then seven day out from woodhouse lagoon and during the last day of the stage they have be travel across most distressing parallel sand-ridge \* -lrb- footnote -rrb- a ground plant which camel eat and which assuage they thirst from helena spring carnegie struggle on intend to strike the northern settlement at hall 's creek where there be a small mining township on the way there while still in unexplored country they discover one more oasis in a rock hole which be call godfrey 's tank after godfrey massie one of the party on November 25th 1896 they congratulate themselves that they be at last clear of the desert and its desolation have come out on to a well-watered shady river run towards the northern coast but a sad accident turn they rejoice into mourning charle stansmore accidentally slip on a rock when out shooting and he gun go off he be shoot through the heart and die instantly he friend carnegie speak most highly of he and he sudden death on the threshold of success be a sad blow to the company stansmore be the third explorer to lose he life from a gun accident at hall 's creek carnegie hear of the misfortune that have befall well in the loss of two of he party and he at once volunteer he assistance but as search-party have already start out he aid be not require he therefore rest for a short time before again try conclusion with the desert on the return journey sturt 's creek be by this time occupy and stock and the party follow it down until they arrive at its termination in gregory 's salt sea from this point carnegie keep a southerly course to lake macdonald near the south australian border pass on he way a striking range which he name the stansmore range after he unfortunate companion lake macdonald be long think to be a continuation of lake amadeus until the exploration of tietkin in 1889 prove its isolation from lake macdonald carnegie who have now three horse in he equipment keep a more south-westerly course towards the rawlinson range the endless sand-dune still cross he track in dreary succession so persistently do they rise across he path that on one day eighty-six of they be cross by the caravan during a progress of eight hour from the rawlinson range they keep on the same south-west course until they strike they outward track at alexander spring a fall of rain fortunately replenish the spring shortly after the arrival of the party they reach lake darlot on the 15th of July and they desert pilgrimage be end not only do carnegie get safely across the dreaded desert but he return overland to he starting-point by a different route he write a book spinifex and sand which contain a most interesting account of this journey as well as a graphic and picturesque description of the physical feature of the great sandy desert carnegie die before he have make more than this one contribution to australian geography like the ill-fated horrock he have the explorer 's ardent spirit he restless and adventurous soul ever lead he onward to the frontier of settlement and the outskirts of civilised life he fall beneath a

story of those bold spirit who play no mean part in the making of australasium by explore the continent for nearly a century and a quarter the white man have be restlessly search out and traverse every square mile of the land and now at the beginning of the twentieth century he work be finish and throughout the long struggle it have ever be a stubborn conflict between the explorer and the inert force of nature through the weary toilsome year of arduous discovery man and nature have seldom march side by side as friend and ally when nature pose as the explorer 's friend and guide it be often only to lure he on with a smile face to he doom from the day when the soldier of king george the third go forth with he firelock on he shoulder compute the distance he cover by wearily count the number of pace he trudge to the day when the modern adventurer aloft on he camel eagerly scan the horizon of the red desert in search of the distant smoke of a native fire and then patiently track the naked denizen of the wilderness to he hoarded rock-hole or scanty spring the explorer have ever have to fight the battle of discovery unaided by nature the aborigine generally either feigned ignorance of the nature of the country or give only false clue and misguide direction even the bird and animal of the untrodden region seem to resent the advance of civilization and to delight in lead the footstep of the white intruder astray hence it be by slow degree by careful study of the work of he predecessor in the field and often by heed the warning convey in they unhappy fate that the
