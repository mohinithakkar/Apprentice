produce by keith m eckrich and pg distribute proofreader the land of little rain by mary austin 1903 to eve the comfortress of unsuccess preface i confess to a great liking for the indian fashion of name-giving : every man know by that phrase which best express he to whoso name he thus he may be mighty-hunter or man-afraid-of-a-bear accord as he be call by friend or enemy and scar-face to those who know he by the eye 's grasp only no other fashion i think set so well with the various nature that inhabit in we and if you agree with I you will understand why so few name be write here as they appear in the geography for if i love a lake know by the name of the man who discover it which endear itself by reason of the close-locked pine it nourish about its border you may look in my account to find it so describe but if the indian have be there before I you shall have they name which be always beautifully fit and do not originate in the poor human desire for perpetuity nevertheless there be certain peak cañons and clear meadow space which be above all compassing of word and have a certain fame as of the nobly great to whom we give no familiar name guide by these you may reach my country and find or not find accord as it lieth in you much that be set down here and more the earth be no wanton to give up all she best to every comer but keep a sweet separate intimacy for each but if you do not find it all as i write think I not less dependable nor yourself less clever there be a sort of pretense allow in matter of the heart as one should say by way of illustration i know a man who and so give up he dearest experience without betrayal and i be in no mind to direct you to delectable place toward which you will hold yourself less tenderly than i so by this fashion of name i keep faith with the land and annex to my own estate a very great territory to which none have a surer title the country where you may have sight and touch of that which be write lie between the high sierra south from yosemite -- east and south over a very great assemblage of broken range beyond death valley and on illimitably into the mojave desert you may come into the border of it from the south by a stage journey that have the effect of involve a great lapse of time or from the north by rail drop out of the overland route at reno the best of all way be over the sierra pass by pack and trail see and believe but the real heart and core of the country be not to be come at in a month 's vacation one must summer and winter with the land and wait its occasion pine wood that take two and three season to the ripening of cone root that lie by in the sand seven year await a growing rain fir that grow fifty year before flowering -- these do not scrape acquaintance but if ever you come beyond the border as far as the town that lie in a hill dimple at the foot of kearsarge never leave it until you have knock at the door of the brown house under the willow-tree at the end of the village street and there you shall have such news of the land of its trail and what be astir in they as one lover of it can give to another note on the illustration the publisher feel that they have be peculiarly fortunate in secure mr e boyd smith as the illustrator and interpreter of mr austin 's charming sketch of the land of little rain he familiarity with the region and he rare artistic skill have enable he to give the very atmosphere of the desert and graphically to portray its life animal and human this will be feel not only in the full-page composition but in the delightful marginal sketch which be not less illustrative although from they nature it be impracticable to enumerate they in a formal list contents : the land of little rain water trail of the ceriso the scavenger the pocket hunter shoshone land jimville -- a bret harte town my neighbor 's field the mesa trail the basket maker the street of the mountain water border other water border nursling of the sky the little town of the grape vine east away from the sierra south from panamint and amargosa east and south many a uncounted mile be the country of lose border ute paiute mojave and shoshone inhabit its frontier and as far into the heart of it as a man dare go not the law but the land set the limit desert be the name it wear upon the map but the indian 's be the better word desert be a loose term to indicate land that support no man whether the land can be bit and break to that purpose be not prove void of life it never be however dry the air and villainous the soil this be the nature of that country there be hill round blunt burn squeeze up out of chaos chrome and vermilion paint aspire to the snow-line between the hill lie high level-looking plain full of intolerable sun glare or narrow valley drown in a blue haze the hill surface be streak with ash drift and black unweathered lava flow after rain water accumulate in the hollow of small closed valley and evaporate leaf hard dry level of pure desertness that get the local name of dry lake where the mountain be steep and the rain heavy the pool be never quite dry but dark and bitter rimmed about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposit a thin crust of it lie along the marsh over the vegetate area which have neither beauty nor freshness in the broad waste open to the wind the sand drift in hummock about the stubby shrub and between they the soil show saline trace the sculpture of the hill here be more wind than water work though the quick storm do sometimes scar they past many a year 's redeeming in all the western desert edge there be essay in miniature at the famed terrible grand cañon to which if you keep on long enough in this country you will come at last since this be a hill country one expect to find spring but not to depend upon they for when find they be often brackish and unwholesome or maddening slow dribble in a thirsty soil here you find the hot sink of death valley or high rolling district where the air have always a tang of frost here be the long heavy wind and breathless calm on the tilted mesa where dust devil dance whirling up into a wide pale sky here you have no rain when all the earth cry for it or quick downpour call cloud-burst for violence a land of lose river with little in it to love yet a land that once visit must be come back to inevitably if it be not so there would be little tell of it this be the country of three season from June on to November it lie hot still and unbearable sick with violent unrelieving storm then on until April chill quiescent drinking its scant rain and scanter snow from April to the hot season again blossom radiant and seductive these month be only approximate later or earlier the rain-laden wind may drift up the water gate of the colorado from the gulf and the land set its season by the rain the desert flora shame we with they cheerful adaptation to the seasonal limitation they whole duty be to flower and fruit and they do it hardly or with tropical luxuriance as the rain admit it be record in the report of the death valley expedition that after a year of abundant rain on the colorado desert be find a specimen of amaranthus ten foot high a year later the same species in the same place mature in the drought at four inch one hope the land may breed like quality in she human offspring not tritely to try but to do seldom do the desert herb attain the full stature of the type extreme aridity and extreme altitude have the same dwarfing effect so that we find in the high sierra and in death valley related species in miniature that reach a comely growth in mean temperature very fertile be the desert plant in expedient to prevent evaporation turn they foliage edgewise toward the sun grow silky hair exude viscid gum the wind which have a long sweep harry and help they it roll up dune about the stocky stem encompass and protective and above the dune which may be as with the mesquite three time as high as a man the blossom twig flourish and bear fruit there be many area in the desert where drinkable water lie within a few foot of the surface indicate by the mesquite and the bunch grass _ -lrb- sporobolus airoide -rrb- _ it be this nearness of unimagined help that make the tragedy of desert death it be related that the final breakdown of that hapless party that give death valley its forbid name occur in a locality where shallow well would have save they but how be they to know that properly equip it be possible to go safely across that ghastly sink yet every year it take its toll of death and yet man find there sun-dried mummy of whom no trace or recollection be preserve to underestimate one 's thirst to pass a give landmark to the right or leave to find a dry spring where one look for run water -- there be no help for any of these thing along spring and sunken watercourse one be surprise to find such water-loving plant as grow widely in moist ground but the true desert breed its own kind each in its particular habitat the angle of the slope the frontage of a hill the structure of the soil determine the plant south-looking hill be nearly bare and the lower tree-line higher here by a thousand foot cañons run east and west will have one wall naked and one clothe around dry lake and marsh the herbage preserve a set and orderly arrangement most species have well-defined area of growth the best index the voiceless land can give the traveler of he whereabouts if you have any doubt about it know that the desert begin with the creosote this immortal shrub spread down into death valley and up to the lower timber-line odorous and medicinal as you might guess from the name wandlike with shine fret foliage its vivid green be grateful to the eye in a wilderness of gray and greenish white shrub in the spring it exude a resinous gum which the indian of those part know how to use with pulverize rock for cement arrow point to shaft trust indian not to miss any virtue of the plant world nothing the desert produce express it better than the unhappy growth of the tree yucca torment thin forest of it stalk drearily in the high mesa particularly in that triangular slip that fan out eastward from the meeting of the sierra and coastwise hill where the first swing across the southern end of the san joaquin valley the yucca bristle with bayonet-pointed leaf dull green grow shaggy with age tip with panicle of fetid greenish bloom after death which be slow the ghostly hollow network of its woody skeleton with hardly power to rot make the moonlight fearful before the yucca have come to flower while yet its bloom be a creamy cone-shaped bud of the size of a small cabbage full of sugary sap the indian twist it deftly out of its fence of dagger and roast it for they own delectation so it be that in those part where man inhabit one see young plant of _ yucca arborensis _ infrequently other yucca cactus low herb a thousand sort one find journey east from the coastwise hill there be neither poverty of soil nor species to account for the sparseness of desert growth but simply that each plant require more room so much earth must be preëmpted to extract so much moisture the real struggle for existence the real brain of the plant be underground above there be room for a round perfect growth in death valley repute the very core of desolation be nearly two hundred identify species above the lower tree-line which be also the snow-line map out abruptly by the sun one find spread growth of piñon juniper branch nearly to the ground lilac and sage and scattering white pine there be no special preponderance of self-fertilized or wind-fertilized plant but everywhere the demand for and evidence of insect life now where there be seed and insect there will be bird and small mammal and where these be will come the slink sharp-toothed kind that prey on they go as far as you dare in the heart of a lonely land you can not go so far that life and death be not before you paint lizard slip in and out of rock crevice and pant on the white hot sand bird hummingbird even nest in the cactus scrub woodpecker befriend the demoniac yucca out of the stark treeless waste ring the music of the night-singing mockingbird if it be summer and the sun well down there will be a burrow owl to call strange furry tricksy thing dart across the open place or sit motionless in the con tower of the creosote the poet may have name all the bird without a gun but not the fairy-footed ground-inhabiting furtive small folk of the rainless region they be too many and too swift how many you would not believe without see the footprint tracing in the sand they be nearly all night worker find the day too hot and white in mid-desert where there be no cattle there be no bird of carrion but if you go far in that direction the chance be that you will find yourself shadow by they tilted wing nothing so large as a man can move unspied upon in that country and they know well how the land deal with stranger there be hint to be have here of the way in which a land force new habit on its dweller the quick increase of sun at the end of spring sometimes overtake bird in they nesting and effect a reversal of the ordinary manner of incubation it become necessary to keep egg cool rather than warm one hot stifle spring in the little antelope i have occasion to pass and repass frequently the nest of a pair of meadowlark located unhappily in the shelter of a very slender weed i never catch they sit except near night but at midday they stand or droop above it half faint with pitifully part bill between they treasure and the sun sometimes both of they together with wing spread and half lift continue a spot of shade in a temperature that constrain I at last in a fellow feeling to spare they a bit of canvas for permanent shelter there be a fence in that country shut in a cattle range and along its fifteen mile of post one could be sure of find a bird or two in every strip of shadow sometimes the sparrow and the hawk with wing trail and beak part droop in the white truce of noon if one be incline to wonder at first how so many dweller come to be in the loneliest land that ever come out of god 's hand what they do there and why stay one do not wonder so much after have live there none other than this long brown land lay such a hold on the affection the rainbow hill the tender bluish mist the luminous radiance of the spring have the lotus charm they trick the sense of time so that once inhabit there you always mean to go away without quite realize that you have not do it man who have live there miner and cattle-man will tell you this not so fluently but emphatically cursing the land and go back to it for one thing there be the divinest cleanest air to be breathe anywhere in god 's world some day the world will understand that and the little oasis on the windy top of hill will harbor for healing its ail house-weary brood there be promise there of great wealth in ore and earth which be no wealth by reason of be so far remove from water and workable condition but man be bewitch by it and tempt to try the impossible you should hear salty william tell how he use to drive eighteen and twenty-mule team from the borax marsh to mojave ninety mile with the trail wagon full of water barrel hot day the mule would go so mad for drink that the clank of the water bucket set they into a uproar of hideous maimed noise and a tangle of harness chain while salty would sit on the high seat with the sun glare heavy in he eye deal out curse of pacification in a level uninterested voice until the clamor fall off from sheer exhaustion there be a line of shallow grave ' along that road they use to count on drop a man or two of every new gang of coolie bring out in the hot season but when he lose he swamper smitten without warn at the noon halt salty quit he job he say it be too durn hot the swamper he bury by the way with stone upon he to keep the coyote from digging he up and seven year later i read the penciled line on the pine headboard still bright and unweathered but before that drive up on the mojave stage i meet salty again cross indian well he face from the high seat tan and ruddy as a harvest moon loom through the golden dust above he eighteen mule the land have call he the palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breed fable chiefly of lose treasure somewhere within its stark border if one believe report be a hill strew with nugget one seam with virgin silver a old clayey water-bed where indian scoop up earth to make cooking pot and shape they reek with grain of pure gold old miner drift about the desert edge weather into the semblance of the tawny hill will tell you tale like these convincingly after a little sojourn in that land you will believe they on they own account it be a question whether it be not better to be bite by the little horned snake of the desert that go sidewise and strike without coil than by the tradition of a lose mine and yet -- and yet -- be it not perhaps to satisfy expectation that one fall into the tragic key in writing of desertness the more you wish of it the more you get and in the mean time lose much of pleasantness in that country which begin at the foot of the east slope of the sierra and spread out by less and less lofty hill range toward the great basin it be possible to live with great zest to have red blood and delicate joy to pass and repass about one 's daily performance a area that would make a atlantic seaboard state and that with no peril and accord to we way of think no particular difficulty at any rate it be not people who go into the desert merely to write it up who invent the fabled hassaympa of whose water if any drink they can no more see fact as naked fact but all radiant with the color of romance i who must have drunk of it in my twice seven year ' wanderings be assure that it be worth while for all the toll the desert take of a man it give compensation deep breath deep sleep and the communion of the star it come upon one with new force in the pause of the night that the chaldean be a desert-bred people it be hard to escape the sense of mastery as the star move in the wide clear heaven to rising and setting unobscure they look large and near and palpitant as if they move on some stately service not needful to declare wheeling to they station in the sky they make the poor world-fret of no account of no account you who lie out there watch nor the lean coyote that stand off in the scrub from you and howl and howl water trail of the ceriso by the end of the dry season the water trail of the ceriso be wear to a white ribbon in the lean grass spread out faint and fanwise toward the home of gopher and ground rat and squirrel but however faint to man-sight they be sufficiently plain to the furred and feathered folk who travel they get down to the eye level of rat and squirrel kind one perceive what might easily be wide and wind road to we if they occur in thick plantation of tree three time the height of a man it need but a slender thread of barrenness to make a mouse trail in the forest of the sod to the little people the water trail be as country road with scent as signboard it seem that man-height be the least fortunate of all height from which to study trail it be better to go up the front of some tall hill say the spur of black mountain look back and down across the hollow of the ceriso strange how long the soil keep the impression of any continuous tread even after grass have overgrow it twenty year since a brief heyday of mining at black mountain make a stage road across the ceriso yet the parallel line that be the wheel trace show from the height dark and well define afoot in the ceriso one look in vain for any sign of it so all the path that wild creature use go down to the lone tree spring be map out whitely from this level which be also the level of the hawk there be little water in the ceriso at the best of time and that little brackish and smell vilely but by a lone juniper where the rim of the ceriso break away to the lower country there be a perpetual rill of fresh sweet drink in the midst of lush grass and watercress in the dry season there be no water else for a man 's long journey of a day east to the foot of black mountain and north and south without count be the burrow of small rodent rat and squirrel kind under the sage be the shallow form of the jackrabbit and in the dry bank of wash and among the strew fragment of black rock lair of bobcat fox and coyote the coyote be you true water-witch one who snuff and paw snuff and paw again at the smallest spot of moisture-scented earth until he have free the blind water from the soil many water-hole be no more than this detect by the lean hobo of the hill in locality where not even a indian would look for it it be the opinion of many wise and busy people that the hill-folk pass the ten-month interval between the end and renewal of winter rain with no drink but you true idler with day and night to spend beside the water trail will not subscribe to it the trail begin as i say very far back in the ceriso faintly and converge in one span broad white hard-trodden way in the gully of the spring and why trail if there be no traveler in that direction i have yet to find the land not scar by the thin far roadway of rabbit and what not of furry folk that run in they venture to look for some seldom-touched water-hole and so long as the trail run with you general direction make sure you be right but if they begin to cross yours at never so slight a angle to converge toward a point leave or right of you objective no matter what the map say or you memory trust they they _ know _ it be very still in the ceriso by day so that be it not for the evidence of those white beaten way it might be the desert it look the sun be hot in the dry season and the day be fill with the glare of it now and again some unseen coyote signal he pack in a long-drawn dolorous whine that come from no determinate point but nothing stir much before mid-afternoon it be a sign when there begin to be hawk skim above the sage that the little people be go about they business we have fall on a very careless usage speaking of wild creature as if they be bind by some such limitation as hamper clockwork when we say of one and another they be night prowler it be perhaps true only as the thing they feed upon be more easily come by in the dark and they know well how to adjust themselves to condition wherein food be more plentiful by day and they accustomed performance be very much a matter of keen eye keener scent quick ear and a better memory of sight and sound than man dare boast watch a coyote come out of he lair and cast about in he mind where he will go for he daily killing you can not very well tell what decide he but very easily that he have decide he trot or break into short gallop with very perceptible pause to look up and about at landmark alter he tack a little look forward and back to steer he proper course i be persuade that the coyote in my valley which be narrow and beset with steep sharp hill in long passage steer by the pinnacle of the sky-line go with head cock to one side to keep to the left or right of such and such a promontory i have trail a coyote often go across country perhaps to where some slant-winged scavenger hanging in the air signal prospect of a dinner and find he track such as a man a very intelligent man accustom to a hill country and a little cautious would make to the same point here a detour to avoid a stretch of too little cover there a pause on the rim of a gully to pick the better way -- and it be usually the best way -- and make he point with the greatest economy of effort since the time of seyavus the deer have shift they feeding ground across the valley at the beginning of deep snow by way of the black rock ford the river at charley 's butte and make straight for the mouth of the cañon that be the easiest go to the winter pasture on waban so they still cross though whatever trail they have have be long break by plough ground but from the mouth of tinpah creek where the deer come out of the sierra it be easily see that the creek the point of black rock and charley 's butte be in line with the wide bulk of shade that be the foot of waban pass and along with this the deer have learn that charley 's butte be almost the only possible ford and all the shortest cross of the valley it seem that the wild creature have learn all that be important to they way of life except the change of the moon i have see some prowl fox or coyote surprise by its sudden rise from behind the mountain wall slink in its increase glow watch it furtively from the cover of near-by brush unprepared and half uncertain of its identity until it ride clear of the peak and finally make off with all the air of one catch nap by a ancient joke the moon in its wanderings must be a sort of exasperation to cunning beast likely to spoil by untimely rising some fore-planned mischief but to take the trail again the coyote that be astir in the ceriso of late afternoon harry the rabbit from they shallow form and the hawk that sweep and swing above they be not there from any mechanical prompting of instinct but because they know of old experience that the small fry be about to take to seed gathering and the water trail the rabbit begin it take the trail with long light leap one eye and ear cock to the hill from whence a coyote might descend upon they at any moment rabbit be a foolish people they do not fight except with they own kind nor use they paw except for foot and appear to have no reason for existence but to furnish meal for meat-eater in flight they seem to rebind from the earth of they own elasticity but keep a sober pace go to the spring it be the young watercress that tempt they and the pleasure of society for they seldom drink even in locality where there be flow stream they seem to prefer the moisture that collect on herbage and after rain may be see rise on they haunch to drink delicately the clear drop catch in the top of the young sage but drink they must as i have often see they morning and evening at the rill that go by my door wait long enough at the lone tree spring and sooner or later they will all come in but here they mating be accomplish and though they be fearful of so little as a cloud shadow or blow leaf they contrive to have some playful hour at the spring the bobcat drop down upon they from the black rock and the red fox pick they up return in the dark by day the hawk and eagle overshadow they and the coyote have all time and season for he own cattle when there be any in the ceriso drink morning and evening spending the night on the warm last light slope of neighbor hill stir with the peep o ' day in these half wild spotted steer the habit of a earlier lineage persist it must be long since they have make bed for themselves but before lie down they turn themselves round and round as dog do they choose bare and stony ground expose front of westward face hill and lie down in company usually by the end of the summer the cattle have be drive or go of they own choose to the mountain meadow one year a maverick yearling stray or overlook by the vaquero keep on until the season 's end and so betray another visitor to the spring that else i might have miss on a certain morning the half-eaten carcass lay at the foot of the black rock and in moist earth by the rill of the spring the foot-pad of a cougar puma mountain lion or whatever the beast be rightly call the kill must have be make early in the evening for it appear that the cougar have be twice to the spring and since the meat-eater drink little until he have eat he must have feed and drunk and after a interval of lie up in the black rock have eat and drunk again there be no know how far he have come but if he come again the second night he find that the coyote have leave he very little of he kill nobody venture to say how infrequently and at what hour the small fry visit the spring there be such number of they that if each come once between the last of spring and the first of winter rain there would still be water trail i have see badger drink about the hour when the light take on the yellow tinge it have from come slantwise through the hill they find out shallow place and be loath to wet they foot rat and chipmunk have be observe visit the spring as late as nine o'clock morning the larger spermophile that live near the spring and keep awake to work all day come and go at no particular hour drinking sparingly at long interval on half-lighted day meadow and field mouse steal delicately along the trail these visitor be all too small to be watch carefully at night but for evidence of they frequent come there be the trail that may be trace mile out among the crisp grass on rare night in the place where no grass grow between the shrub and the sand silver whitely to the moon one see they whisk to and fro on innumerable errand of seed gathering but the chief witness of they presence near the spring be the elf owl those burrow-haunting speckled fluff of greediness begin a twilight flit toward the spring feeding as they go on grasshopper lizard and small swift creature diving into burrow to catch field mouse asleep battle with chipmunk at they own door and get down in great number toward the lone juniper now owl do not love water greatly on its own account not to my knowledge have i catch one drinking or bathing though on night wanderings across the mesa they flit up from under the horse 's foot along stream border they presence near the spring in great number would indicate the presence of the thing they feed upon all night the rustle and soft hooting keep on in the neighborhood of the spring with seldom small shriek of mortal agony it be clear day before they have all get back to they particular hummock and if one follow cautiously not to frighten they into some near-by burrow it be possible to trail they far up the slope the crested quail that troop in the ceriso be the happiest frequenter of the water trail there be no furtiveness about they morning drink about the time the burrower and all that feed upon they be address themselves to sleep great flock pour down the trail with that peculiar melting motion of move quail twitter shove and shoulder they splatter into the shallows drink daintily shake out small shower over they perfect coat and melt away again into the scrub preening and prank with soft contented noise after the quail sparrow and ground-inhabiting bird bathe with the utmost frankness and a great deal of splutter and here in the heart of noon hawk resort sit pant with wing aslant and a truce to all hostility because of the heat one summer there come a road-runner up from the lower valley peek and prying and he have never any patience with the water bath of the sparrow he own ablutions be perform in the clean hopeful dust of the chaparral and whenever he happen on they morning splattering he would depress he glossy crest slant he shine tail to the level of he body until he look most like some bright venomous snake daunt they with shrill abuse and feint of battle then suddenly he would go tilt and balance down the gully in fine disdain only to return in a day or two to make sure the foolish body be still at it out on the ceriso about five mile and wholly out of sight of it near where the immemorial foot trail go up from saline flat toward black mountain be a water sign worth turn out of the trail to see it be a lay circle of stone large enough not to be disturb by any ordinary hap with a opening flank by two parallel row of similar stone between which be a arrow place touch the opposite rim of the circle it would point as the crow fly to the spring it be the old indubitable water mark of the shoshone one still find it in the desert range in salt well and mesquite valley and along the slope of waban on the other side of ceriso where the black rock begin about a mile from the spring be the work of a older forget people the rock hereabout be all volcanic fracture with a crystalline whitish surface but weather outside to furnace blackness around the spring where must have be a gathering place of the tribe it be score over with strange picture and symbol that have no meaning to the indian of the present day but out where the rock begin there be carve into the white heart of it a point arrow over the symbol for distance and a circle full of wavy line read thus : in this direction three -lrb- unit of measurement unknown -rrb- be a spring of sweet water look for it the scavenger fifty-seven buzzard one on each of fifty-seven fence post at the rancho el tejon on a mirage-breeding September morning sit solemnly while the white tilted traveler ' van lumber down the canada de los uvas after three hour they have only clap they wing or exchange post the season 's end in the vast dim valley of the san joaquin be palpitatingly hot and the air breathe like cotton wool through it all the buzzard sit on the fence and low hummock with wing spread fanwise for air there be no end to they and they smell to heaven they head droop and all they communication be a rare horrid croak the increase of wild creature be in proportion to the thing they feed upon : the more carrion the more buzzard the end of the third successive dry year breed they beyond belief the first year quail mate sparingly the second year the wild oats mature no seed the third cattle die in they track with they head towards the stop watercourse and that year the scavenger be as black as the plague all across the mesa and up the treeless tumble hill on clear day they betake themselves to the upper air where they hang motionless for hour that year there be vulture among they distinguish by the white patch under the wing all they offensiveness notwithstanding they have a stately flight they must also have what pass for good quality among themselves for they be social not to say clannish it be a very squalid tragedy -- that of the die brute and the scavenger bird death by starvation be slow the heavy-headed rack-boned cattle totter in the fruitless trail they stand for long patient interval they lie down and do not rise there be fear in they eye when they be first stricken but afterward only intolerable weariness i suppose the dumb creature know nearly as much of death as do they betters who have only the more imagination they even-breathing submission after the first agony be they tribute to its inevitableness it need a nice discrimination to say which of the basket-ribbed cattle be likest to afford the next meal but the scavenger make few mistake one stoop to the quarry and the flock follow cattle once down may be day in die they stretch out they neck along the ground and roll up they slow eye at longer interval the buzzard have all the time and no beak be drop or talon strike until the breath be wholly pass it be doubtless the economy of nature to have the scavenger by to clean up the carrion but a wolf at the throat would be a shorter agony than the long stalk and sometime perching of these loathsome watcher suppose now it be a man in this long-drawn hungrily spy upon distress when timmie o'shea be lose on armogossa flat for three day without water long tom basset find he not by any trail but by make straight away for the point where he see buzzard stoop he could hear the beat of they wing tom say and tread on they shadow but o'shea be past recall what he think about thing after the second day my friend ewan tell I among other thing when he come back from san juan hill that not all the carnage of battle turn he bowels as the sight of slant black wing rise flockwise before the burial squad there be three kind of noise buzzard make -- it be impossible to call they note -- raucous and elemental there be a short croak of alarm and the same syllable in a modify tone to serve all the purpose of ordinary conversation the old bird make a kind of throaty chuckle to they young but if they have any love song i have not hear it the young yawp in the nest a little with more breath than noise it be seldom one find a buzzard 's nest seldom that grown-up find a nest of any sort it be only child to whom these thing happen by right but by make a business of it one may come upon they in wide quiet cañons or on the lookout of lonely table-topped mountain three or four together in the top of stubby tree or on rotten cliff well open to the sky it be probable that the buzzard be gregarious but it seem unlikely from the small number of young note at any time that every female incubate each year the young bird be easily distinguish by they size when feed and high up in air by the worn primary of the older bird it be when the young go out of the nest on they first forage that the parent full of a crass and simple pride make they indescribable chuckling of gobble gluttonous delight the little one would be amusing as they tug and tussle if one could forget what it be they feed upon one never come any nearer to the vulture 's nest or nestling than hearsay they keep to the southerly sierra and be bold enough it seem to do kill on they own account when no carrion be at hand they dog the shepherd from camp to camp the hunter home from the hill and will even carry away offal from under he hand the vulture merit respect for he bigness and for he bandit air but he be a sombre bird with none of the buzzard 's frank satisfaction in he offensiveness the least objectionable of the inland scavenger be the raven frequenter of the desert range the same call locally carrion crow he be handsomer and have such a air he be nice in he habit and be say to have likable trait a tame one in a shoshone camp be the butt of much sport and enjoy it he could all but talk and be another with the child but a arrant thief the raven will eat most thing that come he way -- egg and young of ground-nesting bird seed even lizard and grasshopper which he catch cleverly and whatever he be about let a coyote trot never so softly by the raven flap up and after for whatever the coyote can pull down or nose out be meat also for the carrion crow and never a coyote come out of he lair for kill in the country of the carrion crow but look up first to see where they may be gather it be a sufficient occupation for a windy morning on the lineless level mesa to watch the pair of they eye each other furtively with a tolerable assumption of unconcern but no doubt with a certain amount of good understanding about it once at red rock in a year of green pasture which be a bad time for the scavenger we see two buzzard five raven and a coyote feeding on the same carrion and only the coyote seem ashamed of the company probably we never fully credit the interdependence of wild creature and they cognizance of the affair of they own kind when the five coyote that range the tejon from pasterium to tunawai plan a relay race to bring down a antelope stray from the band beside myself to watch a eagle swing down from mt pino buzzard materialize out of invisible ether and hawk come troop like small boy to a street fight rabbit sit up in the chaparral and cock they ear feel themselves quite safe for the once as the hunt swing near they nothing happen in the deep wood that the blue jay be not all agog to tell the hawk follow the badger the coyote the carrion crow and from they aerial station the buzzard watch each other what would be worth know be how much of they neighbor 's affair the new generation learn for themselves and how much they be teach of they elder so wide be the range of the scavenger that it be never safe to say eyewitness to the contrary that there be few or many in such a place where the carrion be there will the buzzard be gather together and in three day ' journey you will not sight another one the way up from mojave to red butte be all desertness afford no pasture and scarcely a rill of water in a year of little rain in the south flock and herd be drive to the number of thousand along this road to the perennial pasture of the high range it be a long slow trail ankle deep in bitter dust that get up in the slow wind and move along the back of the crawl cattle in the worst of time one in three will pine and fall out by the way in the defile of red rock the sheep pile up a stink lane it be the sun smite by day to these shambles come buzzard vulture and coyote from all the country round so that on the tejon the ceriso and the little antelope there be not scavenger enough to keep the country clean all that summer the dead mummified in the open or drop slowly back to earth in the quagmire of the bitter spring meanwhile from red rock to coyote hole and from coyote hole to haiwai the scavenger gorge and gorge the coyote be not a scavenger by choice prefer he own kill but be on the whole a lazy dog be apt to fall into carrion eating because it be easier the red fox and bobcat a little press by hunger will eat of any other animal 's kill but will not ordinarily touch what die of itself and be exceedingly shy of food that have be manhandle very clean and handsome quite belie he relationship in appearance be clark 's crow that scavenger and plunderer of mountain camp it be permissible to call he by he common name camp robber : he have earn it not content with refuse he peck open meal sack filch whole potato be a gormand for bacon drill hole in packing case and be daunt by nothing short of tin all the while he do not neglect to vituperate the chipmunk and sparrow that whisk off crumb of comfort from under the camper 's foot the camp robber 's gray coat black and white bar wing and slender bill with certain trick of perch accuse he of attempt to pass himself off among woodpecker but he behavior be all crow he frequent the higher pine belt and have a noisy strident call like a jay 's and how clean he and the frisk-tailed chipmunk keep the camp no crumb or pare or bit of eggshell go amiss high as the camp may be so it be not above timber-line it be not too high for the coyote the bobcat or the wolf it be the complaint of the ordinary camper that the wood be too still deplete of wild life but what dead body of wild thing or neglect game untouched by its kind do you find and put out offal away from camp over night and look next day at the foot track where it lay man be a great blunderer go about in the wood and there be no other except the bear make so much noise be so well warn beforehand it be a very stupid animal or a very bold one that can not keep safely hide the cunningest hunter be hunt in turn and what he leave of he kill be meat for some other that be the economy of nature but with it all there be not sufficient account take of the work of man there be no scavenger that eat tin can and no wild thing leave a like disfigurement on the forest floor the pocket hunter i remember very well when i first meet he walk in the evening glow to spy the marriage of the white gilia i sniff the unmistakable odor of burn sage it be a smell that carry far and indicate usually the nearness of a campoodie but on the level mesa nothing taller show than diana 's sage over the top of it begin to dusk under a young white moon trail a waver ghost of smoke and at the end of it i come upon the pocket hunter make a dry camp in the friendly scrub he sit tailorwise in the sand with he coffee-pot on the coal he supper ready to hand in the frying pan and himself in a mood for talk he pack burro in hobble stray off to hunt for a wetter mouthful than the sage afford and give he no concern we come upon he often after that thread the windy pass or by water-hole in the desert hill and get to know much of he way of life he be a small bow man with a face and manner and speech of no character at all as if he have that faculty of small hunt thing of take on the protective color of he surroundings he clothes be of no fashion that i could remember except that they bear liberal marking of pot black and he have a curious fashion of go about with he mouth open which give he a vacant look until you come near enough to perceive he busy about a endless hum wordless tune he travel far and take a long time to it but the simplicity of he kitchen arrangement be elemental a pot for bean a coffee-pot a frying-pan a tin to mix bread in -- he feed the burro in this when there be need -- with these he have be half round we western world and back he explain to I very early in we acquaintance what be good to take to the hill for food : nothing sticky for that dirty the pot nothing with juice to it for that would not pack to advantage and nothing likely to ferment he use no gun but he would set snare by the water-hole for quail and dove and in the trout country he carry a line burro he keep one or two accord to he pack for this chief excellence that they would eat potato paring and firewood he have own a horse in the foothill country but when he come to the desert with no forage but mesquite he find himself under the necessity of pick the bean from the brier a labor that drive he to the use of pack animal to whom thorn be a relish i suppose no man become a pocket hunter by first intention he must be bear with the faculty and along come the occasion like the tap on the test tube that induce crystallization my friend have be several thing of no moment until he strike a thousand-dollar pocket in the lee district and come into he vocation a pocket you must know be a small body of rich ore occur by itself or in a vein of poorer stuff nearly every mineral ledge contain such if only one have the luck to hit upon they without too much labor the sensible thing for a man to do who have find a good pocket be to buy himself into business and keep away from the hill the logical thing be to set out look for another one my friend the pocket hunter have be look twenty year he work outfit be a shovel a pick a gold pan which he keep cleaner than he plate and a pocket magnifier when he come to a watercourse he would pan out the gravel of its bed for color and under the glass determine if they have come from far or near and so spy he would work up the stream until he find where the drift of the gold-bearing outcrop fan out into the creek then up the side of the cañon till he come to the proper vein i think he say the best indication of small pocket be a iron stain but i could never get the run of miner 's talk enough to feel instruct for pocket hunting he have another method in the waterless hill where he would work in and out of blind gully and all winding of the manifold stratum that appear not to have cool since they have be heave up he itinerary begin with the east slope of the sierra of the snow where that range swing across to meet the coast hill and all up that slope to the truckee river country where the long cold forbid he progress north then he work back down one or another of the nearly parallel range that lie out desertward and so down to the sink of the mojave river burrow to oblivion in the sand -- a big mysterious land a lonely inhospitable land beautiful terrible but he come to no harm in it the land tolerate he as it might a gopher or a badger of all its inhabitant it have the least concern for man there be many strange sort of human breed in a mining country each sort despise the queerness of the other but of they all i find the pocket hunter most acceptable for he clean companionable talk there be more color to he reminiscence than the fade sandy old miner kyote-ing that be tunneling like a coyote -lrb- kyote in the vernacular -rrb- in the core of a lonesome hill such a one have find perhaps a body of tolerable ore in a poor lead -- remember that i can never be depend on to get the term right -- and follow it into the heart of country rock to no profit hope burrowing and hope these man go harmlessly mad in time believe themselves just behind the wall of fortune -- most likable and simple man for whom it be well to do any kindly thing that occur to you except lend they money i have know grub staker too those persuasive sinner to whom you make allowance of flour and pork and coffee in consideration of the ledge they be about to find but none of these prove so much worth while as the pocket hunter he want nothing of you and maintain a cheerful preference for he own way of life it be a excellent way if you have the constitution for it the pocket hunter have get to that point where he know no bad weather and all place be equally happy so long as they be out of door i do not know just how long it take to become saturated with the element so that one take no account of they myself can never get past the glow and exhilaration of a storm the wrestle of long dust-heavy wind the play of live thunder on the rock nor past the keen fret of fatigue when the storm outlast physical endurance but prospector and indian get a kind of a weather shell that remain on the body until death the pocket hunter have see destruction by the violence of nature and the violence of man and feel himself in the grip of a all-wisdom that kill man or spare they as seem for they good but of death by sickness he know nothing except that he believe he should never suffer it he have be in grape-vine cañon the year of storm that change the whole front of the mountain all day he have come down under the wing of the storm hope to win past it but find it travel with he until night it keep on after that he suppose a steady downpour but could not with certainty say be securely deep in sleep but the weather instinct do not sleep in the night the heaven behind the hill dissolve in rain and the roar of the storm be bear in and mixed with he dream so that it move he still asleep to get up and out of the path of it what finally wake he be the crash of pine log as they go down before the unbridled flood and the swirl of foam that lash he where he cling in the tangle of scrub while the wall of water go by it go on against the cabin of bill gerry and lay bill strip and break on a sand bar at the mouth of the grape-vine seven mile away there when the sun be up and the wrath of the rain spend the pocket hunter find and bury he but he never lay he own escape at any door but the unintelligible favor of the power the journeying of the pocket hunter lead he often into that mysterious country beyond hot creek where a hidden force work mischief mole-like under the crust of the earth whatever agency be at work in that neighborhood and it be popularly suppose to be the devil it change means and direction without time or season it creep up whole hillside with insidious heat unguessed until one note the pine wood die at the top and have scorch out a good block of timber return to steam and spout in cake forget crevice of year before it will break up sometimes blue-hot and bubble in the midst of a clear creek or make a suck scalding quicksand at the ford these outbreak have the kind of morbid interest for the pocket hunter that a house of unsavory reputation have in a respectable neighborhood but i always find the account he bring I more interesting than he explanation which be compound of fag end of miner 's talk and superstition he be a perfect gossip of the wood this pocket hunter and when i could get he away from lead and strike and contact full of fascinating small talk about the ebb and flood of creek the piñon crop on black mountain and the wolf of mesquite valley i suppose he never know how much he depend for the necessary sense of home and companionship on the beast and tree meeting and find they in they wonted place -- the bear that use to come down pine creek in the spring paw out trout from the shelter of sod bank the juniper at lone tree spring and the quail at paddy jack 's there be a place on waban south of white mountain where flat wind-tilted cedar make low tent and cove of shade and shelter where the wild sheep winter in the snow woodcutter and prospector have bring I word of that but the pocket hunter be accessory to the fact about the opening of winter when one look for sudden big storm he have attempt a cross by the nearest path begin the ascent at noon it grow cold the snow come on thick and blinding and wipe out the trail in a white smudge the storm drift blow in and cut off landmark the early dark obscure the rise drift accord to the pocket hunter 's account he know where he be but could not exactly say three day before he have be in the west arm of death valley on a short water allowance ankle-deep in shifty sand now he be on the rise of waban knee-deep in sodden snow and in both case he do the only allowable thing -- he walk on that be the only thing to do in a snowstorm in any case it might have be the creature instinct which in he way of life have room to grow that lead he to the cedar shelter at any rate he find it about four hour after dark and hear the heavy breathing of the flock he say that if he think at all at this juncture he must have think that he have stumble on a storm-belated shepherd with he silly sheep but in fact he take no note of anything but the warmth of packed fleece and snuggle in between they dead with sleep if the flock stir in the night he stir drowsily to keep close and let the storm go by that be all until morning wake he shine on a white world then the very soul of he shake to see the wild sheep of god stand up about he nod they great horn beneath the cedar roof look out on the wonder of the snow they have move a little away from he with the come of the light but pay he no more heed the light broaden and the white pavilion of the snow swam in the heavenly blueness of the sea from which they rise the cloud drift scatter and break billow in the cañons the leader stamp lightly on the litter to put the flock in motion suddenly they take the drift in those long light leap that be nearest to flight down and away on the slope of waban think of that to happen to a pocket hunter but though he have fall on many a wished-for hap he be curiously inapt at get the truth about beast in general he believe in the venom of toad and charm for snake bite and -- for this i could never forgive he -- have all the miner 's prejudice against my friend the coyote thief sneak and son of a thief be the friendliest word he have for this little gray dog of the wilderness of course with so much seek he come occasionally upon pocket of more or less value otherwise he could not have keep up he way of life but he have as much luck in miss great ledge as in find small one he have be all over the tonopah country and bring away float without happen upon anything that give promise of what that district be to become in a few year he claim to have chip bit off the very outcrop of the californium rand without find it worth while to bring away but none of these thing put he out of countenance it be once in rove weather when we find he shift pack on a steep trail that i observe certain of he belongings do up in green canvas bag the veritable green bag of english novel it seem so incongruous a reminder in this untenanted west that i drop down beside the trail overlook the vast dim valley to hear about the green canvas he have get it he say in london year before and that be the first i have know of he have be abroad it be after one of he big strike that he have make the grand tour and have bring nothing away from it but the green canvas bag which he conceive would fit he need and a ambition this last be nothing less than to strike it rich and set himself up among the eminently bourgeois of london it seem that the situation of the wealthy english middle class with just enough gentility above to aspire to and sufficient smaller fry to bully and patronize appeal to he imagination though of course he do not put it so crudely as that it be no news to I then two or three year after to learn that he have take ten thousand dollar from a abandon claim just the sort of luck to have pleased he and go to london to spend it the land seem not to miss he any more than it have mind he but i miss he and could not forget the trick of expect he in least likely situation therefore it be with a prick sense of the familiar that i follow a twilight trail of smoke a year or two later to the swale of a drip spring and come upon a man by the fire with a coffee-pot and frying-pan i be not surprise to find it be the pocket hunter no man can be stronger than he destiny shoshone land it be true i have be in shoshone land but before that long before i have see it through the eye of winnenap ' in a rosy mist of reminiscence and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the light that never be sit on the golden slope at the campoodie look across the bitter lake to the purple top of mutarango the medicine-man draw up its happy place one by one like little bless island in a sea of talk for he be bear a shoshone be winnenap ' and though he name he wife he child and he tribal relation be of the paiute he thought turn homesickly toward shoshone land once a shoshone always a shoshone winnenap ' live gingerly among the paiute and in he heart despise they but he could speak a tolerable english when he would and he always would if it be of shoshone land he have come into the keep of the paiute as a hostage for the long peace which the authority of the whites make interminable and though there be now no order in the tribe nor any power that could have lawfully restrain he keep on in the old usage to save he honor and the word of he vanish kin he have see he child 's child in the border of the paiute but love best he own mile of sand and rainbow-painted hill professedly he have not see they since the beginning of he hostage but every year about the end of the rain and before the strength of the sun have come upon we from the south the medicine-man go apart on the mountain to gather herb and when he come again i know by the new fortitude of he countenance and the new color of he reminiscence that he have be alone and unspied upon in shoshone land to reach that country from the campoodie one go south and south within hearing of the lip-lip-lapping of the great tideless lake and south by east over a high rolling district mile and mile of sage and nothing else so one come to the country of the paint hill -- old red cone of crater wasteful bed of mineral earth hot acrid spring and steam jet issue from a leprous soil after the hill the black rock after the crater the spew lava ash strew of incredible thickness and full of sharp wind rift there be picture writings carve deep in the face of the cliff to mark the way for those who do not know it on the very edge of the black rock the earth fall away in a wide sweeping hollow which be shoshone land south the land rise in very blue hill blue because thickly wood with ceanothus and manzanita the haunt of deer and the border of the shoshone eastward the land go very far by broken range narrow valley of pure desertness and huge mesa uplift to the sky-line east and east and no man know the end of it it be the country of the bighorn the wapiti and the wolf nesting place of buzzard land of cloud-nourished tree and wild thing that live without drink above all it be the land of the creosote and the mesquite the mesquite be god 's best think in all this desertness it grow in the open be thorny stocky close grown and iron-rooted long wind move in the draughty valley blow sand fill and fill about the lower branch pile pyramidal dune from the top of which the mesquite twig flourish greenly fifteen or twenty foot under the drift where it seem no rain could penetrate the main trunk grow attain often a yard 's thickness resistant as oak in shoshone land one dig for large timber that be in the southerly sandy exposure higher on the table-topped range low tree of juniper and piñon stand each apart round and spread heap of greenness between they but each to itself in smooth clear space tuft of tall feathered grass this be the sense of the desert hill that there be room enough and time enough tree grow to consummate dome every plant have its perfect work noxious weed such as come up thickly in crowd field do not flourish in the free space live long enough with a indian and he or the wild thing will show you a use for everything that grow in these border the manner of the country make the usage of life there and the land will not be live in except in its own fashion the shoshone live like they tree with great space between and in pair and in family group they set up wattled hut by the infrequent spring more wickiup than two make a very great number they shelter be lightly build for they travel much and far follow where deer feed and seed ripen but they be not more lonely than other creature that inhabit there the year 's round be somewhat in this fashion after the piñon harvest the clan foregather on a warm southward slope for the annual adjustment of tribal difficulty and the medicine dance for marriage and mourning and vengeance and the exchange of serviceable information if for example the deer have shift they feeding ground if the wild sheep have come back to waban or certain spring run full or dry here the shoshone winter flockwise weave basket and hunting big game drive down from the country of the deep snow and this brief intercourse be all the use they have of they kind for now there be no war and many of they ancient craft have fall into disuse the solitariness of the life breed in the man as in the plant a certain well-roundedness and sufficiency to its own end any shoshone family have in itself the man-seed power to multiply and replenish potentiality for food and clothing and shelter for healing and beautify when the rain be over and go they be stir by the instinct of those that journey eastward from eden and go up each with he mate and young brood like bird to old nesting place the beginning of spring in shoshone land -- oh the soft wonder of it -- be a mistiness as of incense smoke a veil of greenness over the whitish stubby shrub a web of color on the silver sand soil no counting cover the multitude of rayed blossom that break suddenly underfoot in the brief season of the winter rain with silky furred or prickly viscid foliage or no foliage at all they be morning and evening bloomers chiefly and strong seeder year of scant rain they lie shut and safe in the winnow sand so that some species appear to be extinct year of long storm they break so thickly into bloom that no horse tread without crush they these year the gully of the hill be rank with fern and a great tangle of climb vine just as the mesa twilight have they vocal note in the love call of the burrow owl so the desert spring be voice by the mourning dove welcome and sweet they sound in the smoky morning before breed time and where they frequent in any great number water be confidently look for still by the spring one find the cunning brush shelter from which the shoshone shoot arrow at they when the dove come to drink now as to these same shoshone there be some who claim that they have no right to the name which belong to a more northerly tribe but that be the word they will be call by and there be no greater offense than to call a indian out of he name accord to they tradition and all proper evidence they be a great people occupy far north and east of they present bound drive thence by the paiute between the two tribe be the residuum of old hostility winnenap ' whose memory run to the time when the boundary of the paiute country be a dead-line to shoshone tell I once how himself and another lad in a unforgotten spring discover a nesting place of buzzard a bit of a way beyond the border and they two burn to rob those nest oh for no purpose at all except as boy rob nest immemorially for the fun of it to have and handle and show to other lad as a exceed treasure and afterwards discard so not quite mean to but breathless with daring they creep up a gully across a sage brush flat and through a waste of boulder to the rugged pine where they sharp eye have make out the buzzard settle the medicine-man tell I always with a quake relish at this point that while they grow bold by success be still in the tree they sight a paiute hunting party cross between they and they own land that be mid-morning and all day on into the dark the boy creep and crawl and slide from boulder to bush and bush to boulder in cactus scrub and on naked sand always in a sweat of fear until the dust cake in the nostril and the breath sob in the body around and away many a mile until they come to they own land again and all the time winnenap ' carry those buzzard 's egg in the slack of he single buckskin garment young shoshone be like young quail know without teach about feed and hide and learn what civilized child never learn to be still and to keep on be still at the first hint of danger or strangeness as for food that appear to be chiefly a matter of be willing desert indian all eat chuck-walla big black and white lizard that have delicate white flesh savor like chicken both the shoshone and the coyote be fond of the flesh of _ gopherus agassizius _ the turtle that by feed on bud go without drink and burrow in the sand through the winter contrive to live a known period of twenty-five year it seem that most seed be foodful in the arid region most berry edible and many shrub good for firewood with the sap in they the mesquite bean whether the screw or straight pod pound to a meal boil to a kind of mush and dry in cake sulphur-colored and need a axe to cut it be a excellent food for long journey ferment in water with wild honey and the honeycomb it make a pleasant mildly intoxicating drink next to spring the best time to visit shoshone land be when the deer-star hang low and white like a torch over the morning hill go up past winnedumah and down saline and up again to the rim of mesquite valley take no tent but if you will have a indian build you a wickiup willow plant in a circle draw over to a arch and bind cunningly with withe all the leaf on and chink to count the star through but there be never any but winnenap ' who could tell and make it worth tell about shoshone land and winnenap ' will not any more he die as do most medicine-man of the paiute where the lot fall when the campoodie choose a medicine-man there it rest it be a honor a man seldom seek but must wear a honor with a condition when three patient die under he ministration the medicine-man must yield he life and he office wound do not count broken bone and bullet hole the indian can understand but measle pneumonia and smallpox be witchcraft winnenap ' be medicine-man for fifteen year besides considerable skill in healing herb he use he prerogative cunningly it be permit the medicine-man to decline the case when the patient have have treatment from any other say the white doctor whom many of the younger generation consult or if before have see the patient he can definitely refer he disorder to some supernatural cause wholly out of the medicine-man 's jurisdiction say to the spite of a evil spirit go about in the form of a coyote and state the case convincingly he may avoid the penalty but this must not be push too far all else fail he can hide winnenap ' do this the time of the measles epidemic return from he yearly herb gathering he hear of it at black rock and turn aside he be not to be find nor do he return to he own place until the disease have spend itself and half the child of the campoodie be in they shallow grave with bead sprinkle over they it be possible the tale of winnenap '' s patient have not be strictly keep there have not be a medicine-man kill in the valley for twelve year and for that the perpetrator have be severely punish by the whites the winter of the big snow a epidemic of pneumonia carry off the indian with scarcely a warning from the lake northward to the lava flat they die in the sweat-house and under the hand of the medicine-men even the drug of the white physician have no power after two week of this plague the paiute draw to council to consider the remissness of they medicine-men they be sore with grief and afraid for themselves as a result of the council one in every campoodie be sentence to the ancient penalty but schooling and native shrewdness have raise up in the younger man a unfaith in old usage so judgment halt between sentence and execution at three pine the government teacher bring out influential whites to threaten and cajole the stubborn tribe at tunawaus the conservative send into nevada for that pacific old humbug johnson side most notable of paiute orator to harangue he people citizen of the town turn out with food and comfort and so after a season the trouble pass but here at maverick there be no school no oratory and no alleviation one third of the campoodie die and the rest kill the medicine-men winnenap expect it and for day walk and sit a little apart from he family that he might meet it as become a shoshone no doubt suffer the agony of dread defer when finally three man come and sit at he fire without greet he know he time he turn a little from they drop he chin upon he knee and look out over shoshone land breathing evenly the woman go into the wickiup and cover they head with they blanket so much have the indian lose of savageness by merely desist from kill that the executioner brave themselves to they work by drinking and a show of quarrelsomeness in the end a sharp hatchet-stroke discharge the duty of the campoodie afterward he woman bury he and a warm wind come out of the south the force of the disease be break and even they acquiesce in the wisdom of the tribe that summer they tell I all except the name of the three since it appear that we make we own heaven here no doubt we shall have a hand in the heaven of hereafter and i know what winnenap 's will be like : worth go to if one have leave to live in it accord to he like it will be tawny gold underfoot wall up with jacinth and jasper rib with chalcedony and yet no hymn-book heaven but the free air and free space of shoshone land jimville -- a bret harte town when mr harte find himself with a fresh palette and he particular local color fading from the west he do what he consider the only safe thing and carry he young impression away to be work out untroubled by any newer fact he should have go to jimville there he would have find cast up on the ore-ribbed hill the bleached timber of more tale and better one you could not think of jimville as anything more than a survival like the herb-eating bony-cased old tortoise that poke cheerfully about those border some thousand of year beyond he proper epoch not that jimville be old but it have a atmosphere favorable to the type of a half century back if not forty-niner of that breed it be say of jimville that get away from it be such a piece of work that it encourage permanence in the population the fact be that most have be draw there by some real likeness or liking not however that i would deny the difficulty of get into or out of that cove of reminder i who have make the journey so many time at great pain of a poor body any way you go at it jimville be about three day from anywhere in particular north or south after the railroad there be a stage journey of such interminable monotony as induce forgetfulness of all previous state of existence the road to jimville be the happy hunting ground of old stage-coach buy up from supersede route the west over rock lumber wide vehicle far go in the odor of romance coach that vasquez have hold up from whose high seat express messenger have shoot or be shoot as they luck hold this be to comfort you when the driver stop to rummage for wire to mend a fail bolt there be enough of this sort of thing to quite prepare you to believe what the driver insist namely that all that country and jimville be hold together by wire first on the way to jimville you cross a lonely open land with a hint in the sky of thing go on under the horizon a palpitant white hot land where the wheel gird at the sand and the midday heaven shut it in breathlessly like a tent so in still weather and when the wind blow there be occupation enough for the passenger shift seat to hold down the windward side of the wag coach this be a mere trifle the jimville stage be build for five passenger but when you have seven with four trunk several parcel three sack of grain the mail and express you begin to understand that proverb about the road which have be report to you in time you learn to engage the high seat beside the driver where you get good air and the best company beyond the desert rise the lava flat scoriae strew sharp-cutting wall of narrow cañons league-wide frozen puddle of black rock intolerable and forbid beyond the lava the mouth that spew it out ragged-lipped ruin crater shoulder to the cloud-line mostly of red earth as red as a red heifer these have some comforting of shrub and grass you get the very spirit of the meaning of that country when you see little pete feed he sheep in the red choke maw of a old vent -- a kind of silly pastoral gentleness that glaze over a elemental violence beyond the crater rise worn auriferous hill of a quiet sort tumble together a valley full of mist whitish green scrub and bright small panting lizard then jimville the town look to have spill out of squaw gulch and that in fact be the sequence of its growth it begin around the bully boy and theresa group of mine midway up squaw gulch spread down to the smelter at the mouth of the ravine the freight wagon dump they load as near to the mill as the slope allow and jimville grow in between above the gulch begin a pine wood with sparsely grow thicket of lilac azalea and odorous blossom shrub squaw gulch be a very sharp steep ragged-walled ravine and that part of jimville which be build in it have only one street -- in summer pave with bone-white cobble in the wet month a frothy yellow flood all between the ore dump and solitary small cabin piece out with tin can and packing case run footpath draw down to the silver dollar saloon when jimville be have the time of its life the silver dollar have those same coin let into the bar top for a border but the proprietor pry they out when the glory depart there be three hundred inhabitant in jimville and four bar though you be not to

mediaeval time you would have have a legend or a ballad bret harte would have give you a tale you see in I a mere recorder for i know what be best for you you shall blow out this bubble from you own breath you could never get into any proper relation to jimville unless you could slough off and swallow you acquire prejudice as a lizard do he skin once want some womanly attention the stage-driver assure I i might have they at the nine-mile house from the lady barkeeper the phrase tickle all my after-dinner-coffee sense of humor into a anticipation of poker flat the stage-driver prove himself really right though you be not to suppose from this that jimville have no convention and no caste they work out these thing in the personal equation largely almost every latitude of behavior be allow a good fellow one no liar a free spender and a backer of he friend ' quarrel you be respect in as much ground as you can shoot over in as many pretension as you can make good that probably explain mr fanshawe the gentlemanly faro dealer of those part build for the role of oakhurst go white-shirted and frock-coated in a community of overalls and persuade you that whatever shift and trick of the game be lay to he deal he could not practice they on a person of you penetration but he do by he own account and the evidence of he manners he have be breed for a clergyman and he certainly have gift for the part you find he always in possession of you point of view and with a evident though not obtrusive desire to stand well with you for a account of he killing for he way with woman and the way of woman with he i refer you to brown of calaveras and some other of that stripe he impropriety have a certain sanction of long standing not accord to the gay lady who wear mr fanshawe 's favor there be perhaps too many of they on the whole the point of the moral distinction of jimville appear to be a point of honor with a absence of humorous appreciation that stranger mistake for dullness at jimville they see behavior as history and judge it by fact untroubled by invention and the dramatic sense you glimpse a crude equity in they dealings with wilkin who have shoot a man at lone tree fairly in a open quarrel rumor of it reach jimville before wilkin rest there in flight i see wilkin all jimville see he in fact he come into the silver dollar when we be hold a church fair and buy a pink silk pincushion i have often wonder what become of it some of we shake hand with he not because we do not know but because we have not be officially notify and there be those present who know how it be themselves when the sheriff arrive wilkin have move on and jimville organize a posse and bring he back because the sheriff be a jimville man and we have to stand by he i say we have the church fair at the silver dollar we have most thing there dance town meeting and the kinetoscope exhibition of the passion play the silver dollar have be build when the border of jimville spread from minton to the red hill the defiance twist through side-winder smith scrub the floor for we and move the bar to the back room the fair be design for the support of the circuit rider who preach to the few that would hear and bury we all in turn he be the symbol of jimville 's respectability although he be of a sect that hold dancing among the cardinal sin the management take no chance on offend the minister at 1130 they tender he the receipt of the evening in the chairman 's hat as a delicate intimation that the fair be close the company file out of the front door and around to the back then the dance begin formally with no feeling hurt these be the sort of courtesy common enough in jimville that bring tear of delicate inner laughter there be other besides mr fanshawe who have walk out of mr harte 's demesne to jimville and wear name that smack of the soil -- alkali bill pike wilson three finger and mono jim fierce shy profane sun-dried derelict of the windy hill who each own or have own a mine and be wishful to own one again they lay up on the worn bench of the silver dollar or the same old luck like beached vessel and they talk run on endlessly of strike and contact and mother lode and work around to fight and hold-up villainy haunt and the hoodoo of the minietta tell austerely without imagination do not suppose i be go to repeat it all you who want these thing write up from the point of view of people who do not do they every day would get no savor in they speech say three finger relate the history of the mariposa i take it off 'n tom beatty cheap after he brother bill be shoot say jim jenkin what be the matter of he who bill abe johnson shoot he he be fool around johnson 's wife a ' tom sell I the mine dirt cheap why do not he work it himself he oh he be lay for abe and calculate to have to leave the country pretty quick huh say jim jenkin and the tale flow smoothly on yearly the spring fret float the loose population of jimville out into the desolate waste hot land guide by the peak and a few rarely touch water-hole always always with the golden hope they develop prospects and grow rich develop other and grow poor but never embittered say the hill it be all one there be gold enough time enough and man enough to come after you and at jimville they understand the language of the hill jimville do not know a great deal about the crust of the earth it prefer a hunch that be a intimation from the god that if you go over a brown back of the hill by a drip spring up coso way you will find what be worth while i have never hear that the failure of any particular hunch disprove the principle somehow the rawness of the land favor the sense of personal relation to the supernatural there be not much intervention of crop city clothes and manners between you and the organize force to cut off communication all this beget in jimville a state that pass explanation unless you will accept a explanation that pass belief along with killing and drunkenness coveting of woman charity simplicity there be a certain indifference blankness emptiness if you will of all vaporing no bubbling of the pot -- it want the german to coin a word for that -- no bread-envy no brother-fervor western writer have not sense it yet they smack the savor of lawlessness too much upon they tongue but you have these to witness it be not mean-spiritedness it be pure greek in that it represent the courage to sheer off what be not worth while beyond that it endure without snivel renounce without self-pity fear no death rate itself not too great in the scheme of thing so do beast so do st jerome in the desert so also in the elder day do god life its performance cessation be no new thing to gape and wonder at here you have the repose of the perfectly accept instinct which include passion and death in its perquisite i suppose that the end of all we hammering and yawp will be something like the point of view of jimville the only difference will be in the decoration my neighbor 's field it be one of those place god must have mean for a field from all time lie very level at the foot of the slope that crowd up against kearsarge fall slightly toward the town north and south it be fence by low old glacial ridge boulder strew and untenable eastward it butt on orchard close and the village garden brim over into they by wild brier and creep grass the village street with its double row of unlike house break off abruptly at the edge of the field in a footpath that go up the streamside beyond it to the source of water the field be not greatly esteem of the town not be put to the plough nor afford firewood but breed all manner of wild seed that go down in the irrigate ditch to come up as weed in the garden and grass plot but when i have no more than see it in the charm of its spring smile i know i should have no peace until i have buy ground and build I a house beside it with a little wicket to go in and out at all hour as afterward come about edswick roeder connor and ruffin own the field before it fall to my neighbor but before that the paiute mesne lord of the soil make a campoodie by the rill of pine creek and after contest the soil with they cattle-man who find its foodful pasture greatly to they advantage and band of blether flock shepherd by wild hairy man of little speech who attest they rights to the feeding ground with they long stave upon each other 's skull edswick homestead the field about the time the wild tide of mining life be roar and rioting up kearsarge and where the village now stand build a stone hut with loophole to make good he claim against cattle-man or indian but edswick die and roeder become master of the field roeder own cattle on a thousand hill and make it a recruiting ground for he bellow herd before begin the long drive to market across a shifty desert he keep the field fifteen year and afterward fall into difficulty put it out as security against certain sum connor who hold the security be cleverer than roeder and not so busy the money fall due the winter of the big snow when all the trail be forty foot under drift and roeder be away in san francisco sell he cattle at the set time connor take the law by the forelock and be adjudge possession of the field eighteen day later roeder arrive on snowshoe both foot freeze and the money in he pack in the long suit at law ensue the field fall to ruffin that clever one-armed lawyer with the tongue to wile a bird out of the bush connor 's counsel and be sell by he to my neighbor whom from envy he possession i call naboth curiously all this human occupancy of greed and mischief leave no mark on the field but the indian do and the unthinking sheep round its corner child pick up chip arrow point of obsidian scatter through it be kitchen midden and pit of old sweat-house by the south corner where the campoodie stand be a single shrub of hoopee -lrb- _ lycium andersonius _ -rrb- maintain itself hardly among alien shrub and near by three low rakish tree of hackberry so far from home that no prying of mine have be able to find another in any cañon east or west but the berry of both be food for the paiute eagerly seek and trade for as far south as shoshone land by the fork of the creek where the shepherd camp be a single clump of mesquite of the variety call screw bean the seed must have shake there from some sheep 's coat for this be not the habitat of mesquite and except for other single shrub at sheep camp none grow freely for a hundred and fifty mile south or east naboth have put a fence about the best of the field but neither the indian nor the shepherd can quite forego it they make camp and build they wattled hut about the border of it and no doubt they have some sense of home in its familiar aspect as i have say it be a low-lying field between the mesa and the town with no hillock in it but a gentle swale where the waste water of the creek go down to certain farm and the hackberry-tree of which the tallest might be three time the height of a man be the tallest thing in it a mile up from the water gate that turn the creek into supply pipe for the town begin a row of long-leaved pine thread the watercourse to the foot of kearsarge these be the pine that puzzle the local botanist not easily determine and unrelated to other conifer of the sierra slope the same pine of which the indian relate a legend mixed of brotherliness and the retribution of god once the pine possess the field as the worn stump of they along the streamside show and it would seem they secret purpose to regain they old footing now and then some seedling escape the devastating sheep a rod or two down-stream since i come to live by the field one of these have tiptoe above the gully of the creek beckon the procession from the hill as if in fact they would make back toward that skyward-pointing finger of granite on the opposite range from which accord to the legend when they be bad indian and it a great chief they run away this year the summer flood bring the round brown fruitful cone to my very door and i look if i live long enough to see they come up greenly in my neighbor 's field it be interesting to watch this retake of old ground by the wild plant banish by human use since naboth draw he fence about the field and restricted it to a few wild-eyed steer halt between the hill and the shambles many old habitués of the field have come back to they haunt the willow and brown birch long ago cut off by the indian for wattle have come back to the streamside slender and virginal in they spring greenness and leave long stretch of the brown water open to the sky in stony place where no grass grow wild olive sprawl close-twigged blue-gray patch in winter more translucent greenish gold in spring than any aureole along with willow and birch and brier the clemati that shyest plant of water border slip down season by season to within a hundred yard of the village street convince after three year that it would come no nearer we spend time fruitlessly pull up root to plant in the garden all this while when no coaxing or care prevail upon any transplant slip to grow one be come up silently outside the fence near the wicket coil so secretly in the rabbit-brush that its presence be never suspect until it flower delicately along its twining length the horehound come through the fence and under it shoulder the picket off the railing the brier rise mine under the horehound and no care though i own i be not a close weeder keep the small pale moon of the primrose from rise to the night moth under my apple-tree the first summer in the new place a clump of cypripedium come up by the irrigate ditch at the bottom of the lawn but the clemati will not come inside nor the wild almond i have forget to find out though i mean to whether the wild almond grow in that country where mose keep the flock of he father-in-law but if so one can account for the burning bush it come upon one with a flame-burst as of revelation little hard red bud on leafless twig swell unnoticeably then one two or three strong sun and from tip to tip one soft fiery glow whisper with bee as a singing flame a twig of finger size will be fur to the thickness of one 's wrist by pink five-petaled bloom so close that only the blunt-faced wild bee find they way in it in this latitude late frost cut off the hope of fruit too often for the wild almond to multiply greatly but the spiny tap-rooted shrub be resistant to most plant evil it be not easy always to be attentive to the mature of wild fruit plant be so unobtrusive in they material process and always at the significant moment some other bloom have reach its perfect hour one can never fix the precise moment when the rosy tint the field have from the wild almond pass into the inspiring blue of lupine one notice here and there a spike of bloom and a day later the whole field royal and ruffle lightly to the wind part of the charm of the lupine be the continual stir of its plume to air not suspect otherwhere go and stand by any crown of bloom and the tall stalk do but rock a little as for drowsiness but look off across the field and on the stillest day there be always a trepidation in the purple patch from midsummer until frost the prevail note of the field be clear gold pass into the rusty tone of bigelovium go into a decline a succession of color scheme more admirably manage than the transformation scene at the theater under my window a colony of cleome make a soft web of bloom that draw I every morning for a long still time and one day i discover that i be look into a rare fretwork of fawn and straw color twig from which both bloom and leaf have go and i could not say if it have be for a matter of week or day the time to plant cucumber and set out cabbage may be set down in the almanac but never seed-time nor blossom in naboth 's field certain winged and mail denizen of the field seem to reach they heyday along with the plant they most affect in June the lean tower of the white milkweed be jewel over with red and gold beetle climb dizzily this be that milkweed from whose stem the indian flay fiber to make snare for small game but what use the beetle put it to except for a display ground for they gay coat i could never discover the white butterfly crop come on with the bigelovium bloom and on warm morning make a airy twinkle all across the field in September young linnet grow out of the rabbit-brush in the night all the nest discoverable in the neighbor orchard will not account for the number of they somewhere by the same secret process by which the field mature a million more seed than it need it be mature red-hooded linnet for they devour all the purlieus of bigelovium and artemisia be noisy with they for a month suddenly as they come as suddenly go the fly-by-night that pitch and toss on dusky bar wing above the field of summer twilight never one of these nighthawk will you see after linnet time though the hurtle of they wing make a pleasant sound across the dusk in they season for two summer a great red-tailed hawk have visit the field every afternoon between three and four o'clock swoop and soar with the air of a gentleman adventurer what he find there be chiefly conjecture so secretive be the little people of naboth 's field only when leave fall and the light be low and slant one see the long clean flank of the jackrabbit leap like small deer and of late afternoon little cotton-tail scamper in the runway but the most one see of the burrower gopher and mouse be the fresh earthwork of they newly open door or the pitiful small shred the butcher-bird hang on spiny shrub it be a still field this of my neighbor 's though so busy and admirably compound for variety and pleasantness -- a little sand a little loam a grassy plot a stony rise or two a full brown stream a little touch of humanness a footpath trodden out by moccasin naboth expect to make town lot of it and he fortune in one and the same day but when i take the trail to talk with old seyavus at the campoodie it occur to I that though the field may serve a good turn in those day it will hardly be happier no certainly not happier the mesa trail the mesa trail begin in the campoodie at the corner of naboth 's field though one may drop into it from the wood road toward the cañon or from any of the cattle path that go up along the streamside a clean pale smooth-trodden way between spiny shrub comfortably wide for a horse or a indian it begin i say at the campoodie and go on toward the twilight hill and the border of shoshone land it strike diagonally across the foot of the hill-slope from the field until it reach the larkspur level and hold south along the front of oppapago have the high range to the right and the foothill and the great bitter lake below it on the leave the mesa hold very level here cut across at interval by the deep wash of dwindle stream and its treeless space uncramp the soul mesa trail be mean to be travel on horseback at the jig coyote trot that only western-bred horse learn successfully a foot-pace carry one too slowly past the unit in a decorative scheme that be on a scale with the country round for bigness it take day ' journey to give a note of variety to the country of the social shrub these chiefly clothe the bench and eastern foot-slope of the sierra -- great spread of artemisia _ coleogyne _ and spinosa suffering no other woody stem thing in they purlieus this by election apparently with no elbowing and the several shrub have each they clientèle of flowering herb it would be worth know how much the devastate sheep have have to do with drive the tender plant to the shelter of the prickle-bush it might have begin earlier in the time seyavus of the campoodie tell of when antelope run on the mesa like sheep for number but scarcely any foot-high herb rear itself except from the midst of some stout twig shrub larkspur in the _ coleogyne _ and for every spinosa the purple coil of phacelium in the shrub shelter in the season flock the little stemless thing whose blossom time be as short as a marriage song the larkspur make the best showing be tall and sweet sway a little above the shrubbery scattering pollen dust which navajo bride gather to fill they marriage basket this be a easier task than to find two of they of a shade larkspur in the botany be blue but if you be to slip rein to the stub of some black sage and set about prove it you would be still at it by the hour when the white gilias set they pale disk to the westering sun this be the gilium the child call evening snow and it be no use try to improve on child 's name for wild flower from the height of a horse you look down to clean space in a shifty yellow soil bare to the eye as a newly sand floor then as soon as ever the hill shadow begin to swell out from the sidelong range come little flake of whiteness flutter at the edge of the sand by dusk there be tiny drift in the lee of every strong shrub rosy-tipped corolla as riotous in the slide mesa wind as if they be real flake shake out of a cloud not spring from the ground on wiry three-inch stem they keep awake all night and all the air be heavy and musky sweet because of they farther south on the trail there will be poppy meet ankle deep and singly peacock-painted bubble of calochortus blow out at the top of tall stem but before the season be in tune for the gayer blossom the best display of color be in the lupin wash there be always a lupin wash somewhere on a mesa trail -- a broad shallow cobble-paved sink of vanish water where the hummock of _ lupinus ornatus _ run a delicate gamut from silvery green of spring to silvery white of winter foliage they look in fullest leaf except for color most like the huddle hut of the campoodie and the largest of they might be a man 's length in diameter in they season which be after the gilia be at they best and before the larkspur be ripe for pollen gathering every terminal whorl of the lupin send up its blossom stalk not hold any constant blue but paling and purple to guide the friendly bee to virginal honey sip or away from the perfect and deplete flower the length of the blossom stalk conform to the round contour of the plant and of these there will be a million move indescribably in the airy current that flow down the swale of the wash there be always a little wind on the mesa a slide current of cooler air go down the face of the mountain of its own momentum but not to disturb the silence of great space pass the wide mouth of cañons one get the effect of whatever be do in they openly or behind a screen of cloud -- thunder of fall wind in the pine leaf or rush and roar of rain the rumor of tumult grow and die in pass as from open door gaping on a village street but do not impinge on the effect of solitariness in quiet weather mesa day have no parallel for stillness but the night silence break into certain mellow or poignant note late afternoon the burrowing owl may be see blinking at the door of they hummock with perhaps four or five elfish nestling arow and by twilight begin a soft _ whoo-oo-ing _ rounder sweeter more incessant in mating time it be not possible to disassociate the call of the burrow owl from the late slant light of the mesa if the fine vibration which be the golden-violet glow of spring twilight be to tremble into sound it would be just that mellow double note break along the blossom-top while the glow hold one see the thistle-down flight and pouncing after prey and on into the dark hear they soft _ pus-ssh _ clear out of the trail ahead maybe the pin-point shriek of field mouse or kangaroo rat that prick the wakeful pause of the night be extort by these mellow-voiced plunderer though it be just as like to be the work of the red fox on he twenty-mile constitutional both the red fox and the coyote be free of the night hour and both killer for the pure love of slaughter the fox be no great talker but the coyote go garrulously through the dark in twenty key at once gossip warning and abuse they be light treader the split-foot so that the solitary camper see they eye about he in the dark sometimes and hear the soft intake of breath when no leaf have stir and no twig snap underfoot the coyote be you real lord of the mesa and so he make sure you be arm with no long black instrument to spit you tooth into he vitals at a thousand yard be both bold and curious not so bold however as the badger and not so much of a curmudgeon this short-legged meat-eater love half light and lower day have no friend no enemy and disown he offspring very likely if he know how hawk and crow dog he for dinner he would resent it but the badger be not very well contrived for look up or far to either side dull afternoon he may be meet nose a trail hot-foot to the home of ground rat or squirrel and be with difficulty persuade to give the right of way the badger be a pot-hunter and no sportsman once at the hill he dive for the central chamber he sharp-clawed splayey foot splash up the sand like a bather in the surf he be a swift trailer but not so swift or secretive but some small sailing hawk or lazy crow perhaps one or two of each have spy upon he and come drift down the wind to the killing no burrower be so unwise as not to have several exit from he dwelling under protect shrub when the badger go down as many of the furry people as be not catch nap come up by the back door and the hawk make short work of they i suspect that the crow get nothing but the gratification of curiosity and the pickings of some secret store of seed unearth by the badger once the excavation begin they walk about expectantly but the little gray hawk beat slow circle about the door of exit and be wiser in they generation though they do not look it there be always solitary hawk sail above the mesa and where some blue tower of silence lift out of the neighboring range a eagle hang dizzily and always buzzards high up in the thin translucent air make a merry-go-round between the coyote and the bird of carrion the mesa be keep clear of miserable dead the wind too be a besom over the treeless space whisk new sand over the litter of the scant-leaved shrub and the little doorway of the burrower be as trim as city front it take man to leave unsightly scar on the face of the earth here on the mesa the abandon campoody of the paiute be spot of desolation long after the wattle of the hut have warped in the brush heap the campoody be near the watercourse but never in the swale of the stream the paiute seek rise ground depend on air and sun for purification of he dwelling and when it become wholly untenable move a campoodie at noontime when there be no smoke rise and no stir of life resemble nothing so much as a collection of prodigious wasp ' nest the hut be squat and brown and chimneyless face east and the inhabitant have the faculty of quail for make themselves scarce in the underbrush at the approach of stranger but they be really not often at home during midday only the blind and incompetent leave to keep the camp these be work hour and all across the mesa one see the woman whisk seed of _ chium _ into they spoon-shaped basket these empty again into the huge conical carrier support on the shoulder by a leather band about the forehead morning and late afternoon one meet the man singly and afoot on unguessable errand or ride shaggy browbeaten pony with game sling across the saddle-bow this might be deer or even antelope rabbit or very far south towards shoshone land lizard there be myriad of lizard on the mesa little gray dart or larger salmon-sided one that may be find swallow they skin in the safety of a prickle-bush in early spring now and then a palm 's breadth of the trail gather itself together and scurry off with a little rustle under the brush to resolve itself into sand again this be pure witchcraft if you succeed in catch it in transit it lose its power and become a flat horn toad-like creature horrid look and harmless of the color of the soil and the curio dealer will give you two bit for it to stuff man have they season on the mesa as much as plant and four-footed thing and one be not like to meet they out of they time for example at the time of _ rodeo _ which be perhaps April one meet free ride vaquero who need no trail and can find cattle where to the layman no cattle exist as early as February band of sheep work up from the south to the high sierra pasture it appear that shepherd have not change more than sheep in the process of time the shy hairy man who herd the tractile flock might be except for some add clothing the very brethren of david of necessity they be hardy simple liver superstitious fearful give to see vision and almost without speech it need the bustle of shearing and copious libation of sour weak wine to restore the human faculty petite pete who work a circuit up from the ceriso to red butte and around by way of salt flat pass year by year on the mesa trail he thick hairy chest throw open to all weather twirl he long staff and deal brotherly with he dog who be possibly as intelligent certainly handsomer a flock 's journey be seven mile ten if pasture fail in a windless blur of dust feeding as it go and rest at noon such hour pete weave a little screen of twig between he head and the sun -- the rest of he be as impervious as one of he own sheep -- and sleep while he dog have the flock upon they conscience at night wherever he may be there pete camp and fortunate the trail-weary traveler who fall in with he when the fire kindle and savory meat seethe in the pot when there be a drowsy blether from the flock and far down the mesa the twilight twinkle of shepherd fire when there be a hint of blossom underfoot and a heavenly whiteness on the hill one hark back without effort to judaea and the nativity but one feel by day anything but good will to note the shear shrub and crop blossom-top so many season ' effort so many sun and rain to make a pound of wool and then there be the loss of ground-inhabiting bird that must fail from the mesa when few herb ripen seed out west the west of the mesa and the unpatented hill there be more sky than any place in the world it do not sit flatly on the rim of earth but begin somewhere out in the space in which the earth be poise hollow more and be full of clean winey wind there be some odor too that get into the blood there be the spring smell of sage that be the warning that sap be begin to work in a soil that look to have none of the juice of life in it it be the sort of smell that set one think what a long furrow the plough would turn up here the sort of smell that be the beginning of new leafage be best at the plant 's best and leave a pungent trail where wild cattle crop there be the smell of sage at sundown burning sage from campoody and sheep camp that travel on the thin blue wraith of smoke the kind of smell that get into the hair and garment be not much like except upon long acquaintance and every paiute and shepherd smell of it indubitably there be the palpable smell of the bitter dust that come up from the alkali flat at the end of the dry season and the smell of rain from the wide-mouthed cañons and last the smell of the salt grass country which be the beginning of other thing that be the end of the mesa trail the basket maker a man say seyavus of the campoodie must have a woman but a woman who have a child will do very well that be perhaps why when she lose she mate in the die struggle of he race she never take another but set she wit to fend for herself and she young son no doubt she be often put to it in the begin to find food for they both the paiute have make they last stand at the border of the bitter lake battle-driven they die in its water and the land fill with cattle-man and adventurer for gold : this while seyavus and the boy lay up in the cavern of the black rock and eat tule root and fresh-water clam that they dig out of the slough bottom with they toe in the interim while the tribe swallow they defeat and before the rumor of war die out they must have come very near to the bare core of thing that be the time seyavus learn the sufficiency of mother wit and how much more easily one can do without a man than might at first be suppose to understand the fashion of any life one must know the land it be live in and the procession of the year this valley be a narrow one a mere trough between hill a draught for storm hardly a crow 's flight from the sharp sierra of the snow to the curl red and ochre uncomforted bare rib of waban midway of the groove run a burrow dull river nearly a hundred mile from where it cut the lava flat of the north to its widening in a thick tideless pool of a lake hereabouts the range have no foothill but rise up steeply from the bench land above the river down from the sierra for the east range have almost no rain pour glance white flood toward the lowest land and all beside they lie the campoody brown wattled brush heap look east in the river be mussel and reed that have edible white root and in the soddy meadow tuber of joint grass all these at they best in the spring on the slope the summer growth afford seed up the steep the one-leafed pine a oily nut that be really all they could depend upon and that only at the mercy of the little god of frost and rain for the rest it be cunning against cunning caution against skill against quack horde of wild-fowl in the tulare against pronghorn and bighorn and deer you can guess however that all this war of rifle and bowstring this influx of overlord whites have make game wilder and hunter fearful of be hunt you can surmise also for it be a crude time and the land be raw that the woman become in turn the game of the conqueror there use to be in the little antelope a she dog stray or outcast that have a litter in some forsake lair and range and forage for they slink savage and afraid remember and mistrust humankind wistful lean and sufficient for she young i have think seyavus might have have day like that and have have perfect leave to think since she will not talk of it paiute have the art of reduce life to its lowest ebb and yet save it alive on grasshopper lizard and strange herb and that time must have leave no shift untried it last long enough for seyavus to have evolve the philosophy of life which i have set down at the begin she have go beyond learn to do for she son and learn to believe it worth while in we kind of society when a woman cease to alter the fashion of she hair you guess that she have pass the crisis of she experience if she go on crimp and uncrimp with the change mode it be safe to suppose she have never come up against anything too big for she the indian woman get nearly the same personal note in the pattern of she basket not that she doe 's not make all kind carrier water-bottle and cradle -- these be kitchen ware -- but she work of art be all of the same piece seyavus make flare flat-bottomed bowl cooking pot really when cooking be do by drop hot stone into water-tight food basket and for decoration a design in color bark of the procession of plumed crest of the valley quail in this pattern she have make cooking pot in the golden spring of she wedding year when the quail go up two and two to they rest place about the foot of oppapago in this fashion she make they when after pillage it be possible to reinstate the housewifely craft quail run then in the black rock by hundred -- so you will still find they in fortunate year -- and in the famine time the woman cut they long hair to make snare when the flock come morning and evening to the spring seyavi make basket for love and sell they for money in a generation that prefer iron pot for utility every indian woman be a artist -- see feel create but do not philosophize about she process seyavi 's bowl be wonder of technical precision inside and out the palm find no fault with they but the subtlest appeal be in the sense that warn we of humanness in the way the design spread into the flare of the bowl there use to be a indian woman at olancha who make bottle-neck trinket basket in the rattlesnake pattern and could accommodate the design to the swell bowl and flat shoulder of the basket without sensible disproportion and so cleverly that you might own one a year without think how it be do but seyavus 's basket have a touch beyond cleverness the weaver and the warp live next to the earth and be saturate with the same element twice a year in the time of white butterfly and again when young quail run neck and neck in the chaparral seyavus cut willow for basketry by the creek where it wind toward the river against the sun and suck wind it never quite reach the river except in far-between time of summer flood but it always try and the willow encourage it as much as they could you nearly always find they a little farther down than the trickle of eager water the paiute fashion of count time appeal to I more than any other calendar they have no stamp of heathen god nor great one nor any succession of moon as have red man of the east and north but count forward and back by the progress of the season the time of _ taboose _ before the trout begin to leap the end of the piñon harvest about the beginning of deep snow so they get nearer the sense of the season which run early or late accord as the rain be forward or delay but whenever seyavi cut willow for basket be always a golden time and the soul of the weather go into the wood if you have ever own one of seyavus 's golden russet cooking bowl with the pattern of plumed quail you would understand all this without say anything before seyavus make basket for the satisfaction of desire -- for that be a house-bred theory of art that make anything more of it -- she dance and dress she hair in those day when the spring be at flood and the blood prick to the mating fever the maid choose they flower wreathe themselves and dance in the twilight young desire cry out to young desire they sing what the heart prompt what the flower express what bode in the mating weather and what flower do you wear seyavus i ah -- the white flower of twining -lrb- clemati -rrb- on my body and my hair and so i sing : -- i be the white flower of twine little white flower by the river oh flower that twine close by the river oh tremble flower so tremble the maiden heart so sing seyavus of the campoodie before she make basket and in she later day lay she arm upon she knee and laugh in they at the recollection but it be not often she would say so much never understand the keen hunger i have for bit of lore and the fool talk of she people she have feed she young son with meadowlark ' tongue to make he quick of speech but in late year be loath to admit it though she have come through the period of unfaith in the lore of the clan with a fine appreciation of its beauty and significance what good will you dead get seyavus of the basket you burn say i covet they for my own collection thus seyavi as much good as yours of the flower you strew oppapago look on waban and waban on coso and the bitter lake and the campoodie look on these three and more it see the beginning of wind along the foot of coso the gathering of cloud behind the high ridge the spring flush the soft spread of wild almond bloom on the mesa these first you understand be the paiute 's wall the other he furnishings not the wattled hut be he home but the land the wind the hill front the stream these he can not duplicate at any furbisher 's shop as you who live within door who if you purse allow may have the same home at sitka and samarcand so you see how it be that the homesickness of a indian be often unto death since he get no relief from it neither wind nor weed nor sky-line nor any aspect of the hill of a strange land sufficiently like he own so it be when the government reach out for the paiute they gather into the northern reservation only such poor tribe as could devise no other end of they affair here all along the river and south to shoshone land live the clan who own the earth fall into the deplorable condition of hanger-on yet you hear they laugh at the hour when they draw in to the campoodie after labor when there be a smell of meat and the steam of the cooking pot go up against the sun then the child lie with they toe in the ash to hear tale then they be merry and have the joy of repletion and the nearness of they kind they have they hill and though jostle be sufficiently free to get some fortitude for what will come for now you shall hear of the end of the basket maker in she best day seyavi be most like deborah deep bosomed broad in the hip quick in counsel slow of speech esteem of she people this be that seyavus who rear a man by she own hand she own wit and none other when the townspeople begin to take note of she -- and it be some year after the war before there begin to be any town -- she be then in the quick maturity of primitive woman but when i know she she seem already old indian woman do not often live to great age though they look incredibly steep in year they have the wit to win sustenance from the raw material of life without intervention but they have not the sleek look of the woman whom the social organization conspire to nourish seyavus have somehow squeeze out of she daily round a spiritual ichor that keep the skill in she knotted finger long after the accustomed time but that also fail by all count she would have be about sixty year old when it come she turn to sit in the dust on the sunny side of the wickiup with little strength leave for anything but look and in time she pay the toll of the smoky hut and become blind this be a thing so long expect by the paiute that when it come they find it neither bitter nor sweet but tolerable because common there be three other blind woman in the campoodie withered fruit on a bough but they have memory and speech by noon of the sun there be never any leave in the campoodie but these or some mother of weanling and they sit to keep the ash warm upon the hearth if it be cold they burrow in the blanket of the hut if it be warm they follow the shadow of the wickiup around stir much out of they place they hardly dare since one might not help another but they call in high old crack voice gossip and reminder across the ash heap then if they have you speech or you theirs and have a hour to spare there be thing to be learn of life not set down in any book folk tale famine tale love and long-suffering and desire but no whimpering now and then one or another of the blind keeper of the camp will come across to where you sit gossip tap she way among the kitchen midden guide by you voice that carry far in the clearness and stillness of mesa afternoon but suppose you find seyavus retire into the privacy of she blanket you will get nothing for that day there be no other privacy possible in a campoodie all the process of life be carry on out of door or behind the thin twig-woven wall of the wickiup and laughter be the only corrective for behavior very early the indian learn to possess he countenance in impassivity to cover he head with he blanket something to wrap around he be as necessary to the paiute as to you you closet to pray in so in she blanket seyavus sometime basket maker sit by the unlit hearth of she tribe and digest she life nourish she spirit against the time of the spirit 's need for she know in fact quite as much of these matter as you who have a larger hope though she have none but the certainty that have bear herself courageously to this end she will not be reborn a coyote the street of the mountain all street of the mountain lead to the citadel steep or slow they go up to the core of the hill any trail that go otherwhere must dip and cross sidle and take chance rift of the hill open into each other and the high meadow be often wide enough to be call valley by courtesy but one keep this distinction in mind -- valley be the sunken place of the earth cañons be score out by the glacier plough of god they have a better name in the rocky for these hill-fenced open glade of pleasantness they call they park here and there in the hill country one come upon blind gully front by high stony barrier these head also for the heart of the mountain they distinction be that they never get anywhere all mountain street have stream to thread they or deep groove where a stream might run you would do well to avoid that range uncomforted by singing flood you will find it forsake of most thing but beauty and madness and death and god many such lie east and north away from the mid sierra and quicken the imagination with the sense of purpose not reveal but the ordinary traveler bring nothing away from they but a intolerable thirst the river cañons of the sierra of the snow be better worth while than most broadway though the choice of they be like the choice of street not very well determine by they name there be always a amount of local history to be read in the name of mountain highway where one touch the successive wave of occupation or discovery as in the old village where the neighborhood be not build but grow here you have the spanish californian in _ cero gordo _ and piñon symme and shepherd pioneer both tunawaus probably shoshone oak creek kearsarge -- easy to fix the date of that christen -- tinpah paiute that mist cañon and paddy jack 's the street of the west sierra sloping toward the san joaquin be long and wind but from the east my country a day 's ride carry one to the lake region the next day reach the pass of the high divide but whether one get passage depend a little on how many have go that road before and much on one 's own power the pass be steep and windy ridge though not the highest by two and three thousand foot the snow-cap overtop they it be even possible to win through the sierra without have pass above timber-line but one miss a great exhilaration the shape of a new mountain be roughly pyramidal run out into long shark-finned ridge that interfere and merge into other thunder-splintered sierra you get the saw-tooth effect from a distance but the near-by granite bulk glitter with the terrible keen polish of old glacial age i say terrible so it seem when those glossy dome swim into the alpenglow wet after rain you conceive how long and imperturbable be the purpose of god never believe what you be tell that midsummer be the best time to go up the street of the mountain -- well -- perhaps for the merely idle or sportsmanly or scientific but for see and understand the best time be when you have the longest leave to stay and here be a hint if you would attempt the stateliest approach travel light and as much as possible live off the land mulligatawny soup and tinned lobster will not bring you the favor of the woodlander every cañon commend itself for some particular pleasantness this for pine another for trout one for pure bleak beauty of granite buttress one for its far-flung irised fall and as i say though some be easier go lead each to the cloud shoulder citadel first near the cañon mouth you get the low-heading full-branched one-leaf pine that be the sort of tree to know at sight for the globose resin-dripping cone have palatable nourishing kernel the main harvest of the paiute that perhaps account for they grow accommodatingly below the limit of deep snow group sombrely on the valley-ward slope the real procession of the pine begin in the rift with the long-leafed _ pinus jeffreyus _ sigh its soul away upon the wind and it ought not to sigh in such good company here begin the manzanita adjust its tortuous stiff stem to the sharp waste of boulder its pale olive leave twist edgewise to the sleek ruddy chestnut stem begin also the meadowsweet burnish laurel and the million unregarded trumpet of the coral-red pentstemon wild life be likely to be busiest about the lower pine border one look in hollow tree and hive rock for wild honey the drone of bee the chatter of jay the hurry and stir of squirrel be incessant the air be odorous and hot the roar of the stream fill up the morning and evening interval and at night the deer feed in the buckthorn thicket it be worth watch the year round in the purlieus of the long-leafed pine one month or another you get sight or trail of most roving mountain dweller as they follow the limit of forbid snow and more bloom than you can properly appreciate whatever go up or come down the street of the mountain water have the right of way it take the lowest ground and the shortest passage where the rift be narrow and some of the sierra cañons be not a stone 's throw from wall to wall the best trail for foot or horse wind considerably above the watercourse but in a country of cone-bearer there be usually a good strip of swardy sod along the cañon floor pine wood the short-leafed balfor and murryana of the high sierra be sombre root in the litter of a thousand year hushed and corrective to the spirit the trail pass insensibly into they from the black pine and a thin belt of fir you look back as you rise and strain for glimpse of the tawny valley blue glint of the bitter lake and tender cloud film on the farther range for such picture the pine branch make a noble frame presently they close in wholly they draw mysteriously near cover you track give up the trail indifferently or with a secret grudge you get a kind of impatience with they lock rank until you come out lastly on some high windy dome and see what they be about they troop thickly up the open way river bank and brook border up open swale of dribble spring swarm over old moraine circle the peaty swamp and part and meet about clean still lake scale the stony gully torment bow persist to the door of the storm chamber tall priest to pray for rain the spring wind lift cloud of pollen dust finer than frankincense and trail it out over high altar stain the snow no doubt they understand this work better than we in fact they know no other come say the church of the valley after a season of dry year let we pray for rain they would do better to plant more tree it be a pity we have let the gift of lyric improvisation die out sit island on some gray peak above the encompass wood the soul be lift up to sing the iliad of the pine they have no voice but the wind and no sound of they rise up to the high place but the water the evidence of they power that go down the steep and stony way the outlet of ice-bordered pool the young river sway with the force of they run they sing and shout and trumpet at the fall and the noise of it far outreach the forest spire you see from these con tower how they call and find each other in the slender gorge how they fumble in the meadow need the sheer near wall to give they countenance and show the way and how the pine wood be make glad by they nothing else in the street of the mountain give such a sense of pageantry as the conifer other tree if there be any be home dweller like the tender flutter sisterhood of quake asp they grow in clump by spring border and all they stem have a permanent curve toward the down slope as you may also see in hillside pine where they have bear the weight of sag drift well up from the valley at the confluence of cañons be delectable summer meadow fireweed flame about they against the gray boulder stream be open go smoothly about the glacier slip and make deep bluish pool for trout pine raise statelier shaft and give themselves room to grow -- gentian shinleaf and little grass of parnassus in they golden checkered shadow the meadow be white with violet and all outdoors keep the clock for example when the ripple at the ford of the creek raise a clear half tone -- sign that the snow water have come down from the heated high ridge -- it be time to light the evening fire when it drop off a note -- but you will not know it except the dougla squirrel tell you with he high fluty chirrup from the pine ' aerial gloom -- sign that some star watcher have catch the first far glint of the near sun whitney cry it from he vantage tower it flash from oppapago to the front of williamson leconte speed it to the westering peak the high rill wake and run the bird begin but down three thousand foot in the cañon where you stir the fire under the cooking pot it will not be day for a hour it go on the play of light across the high place rosy purple tender glint and glow thunder and windy flood like the grave exult talk of elder above a merry game who shall say what another will find most to he liking in the street of the mountain as for I once set above the country of the silver fir i must go on until i find white columbine around the amphitheatre of the lake region and above they to the limit of perennial drift they gather flock-wise in splintered rock waste the crowd of they the airy spread of sepal the pale purity of the petal spur the quiver swing of bloom obsess the sense one must learn to spare a little of the pang of inexpressible beauty not to spend all one 's purse in one shop there be always another year and another linger on in the alpine region until the first full snow which be often before the cessation of bloom one go down in good company first snow be soft and clog and make laborious path then it be the roving inhabitant range down to the edge of the wood below the limit of early storm early winter and early spring one may have sight or track of deer and bear and bighorn cougar and bobcat about the thicket of buckthorn on open slope between the black pine but when the ice crust be firm above the twenty foot drift they range far and forage where they will often in midwinter will come now and then a long fall of soft snow pile three or four foot above the ice crust and work a real hardship for the dweller of these street when such a storm portend the weather-wise black-tail will go down across the valley and up to the pasture of waban where no more snow fall than suffice to nourish the sparsely grow pine but the bighorn the wild sheep able to bear the bitterest storm with no sign of stress can not cope with the loose shifty snow never such a storm go over the mountain that the indian do not catch they flounder belly deep among the lower rift i have a pair of horn inconceivably heavy that be bear as late as a year ago by a very monarch of the flock whom death overtook at the mouth of oak creek after a week of wet snow he meet it as a king should with no vain effort or tremble and it be wholly kind to take he so with four of he follow rather than that the night prowler should find he there be always more life abroad in the winter hill than one look to find and much more in evidence than in summer weather light foot of hare that make no print on the forest litter leave a wondrously plain track in the snow we use to look and look at the beginning of winter for the bird to come down from the pine land look in the orchard and stubble look north and south on the mesa for they migratory passing and wonder that they never come busy little grosbeak pick about the kitchen door and woodpecker tap the eve of the farm building but we see hardly any other of the frequenter of the summer cañons after a while when we grow bold to tempt the snow border we find they in the street of the mountain in the thick pine wood where the overlap bough hang with snow-wreath make wind-proof shelter tent in a very community of dwelling winter the bird-folk who get they living from the persist cone and the larva harbor bark ground inhabit species seek the dim snow chamber of the chaparral consider how it must be in a hill-slope overgrown with stout-twigged partly evergreen shrub more than man high and as thick as a hedge not all the cañon 's sifting of snow can fill the intricate space of the hill tangle here and there a overhang rock or a stiff arch of buckthorn make a open to communicate room and runway deep under the snow the light filter through the snow wall be blue and ghostly but serve to show seed of shrub and grass and berry and the wind-built wall be warm against the wind it seem that live plant especially if they be evergreen and grow give off heat the snow wall melt earliest from within and hollow to thinness before there be a hint of spring in the air but you think of these thing afterward up in the street it have the effect of be do consciously the buckthorn lean to each other and the drift to they the little bird run in and out of they appoint way with the greatest cheerfulness they give almost no token of distress and even if the winter try they too much you be not to pity they you of the house habit can hardly understand the sense of the hill no doubt the labor of be comfortable give you a exaggerated opinion of yourself a exaggerated pain to be set aside whether the wild thing understand it or not they adapt themselves to its process with the greater ease the business that go on in the street of the mountain be tremendous world-formative here go bird squirrel and red deer child cry small wares and play in the street but they do not obstruct its affair summer be they holiday come now say the lord of the street i have need of a great work and no more playing but they be leave border and breathing-space out of pure kindness they be not push out except by the exigency of the nobler plan which they accept with a dignity the rest of we have not yet learn water border i like that name the indian give to the mountain of lone pine and find it pertinent to my subject -- oppapago the weeper it sit eastward and solitary from the lordliest rank of the sierra and above a range of little old blunt hill and have a bow grave aspect as of some woman you might have know look out across the grassy barrow of she dead from twin gray lake under its noble brow stream down incessant white and tumble water mahala all time cry say winnenap ' draw furrow in he rugged wrinkled cheek the origin of mountain stream be like the origin of tear patent to the understanding but mysterious to the sense they be always at it but one so seldom catch they in the act here in the valley there be no cessation of water even in the season when the niggard frost give they scant leave to run they make the most of they midday hour and tinkle all night thinly under the ice a ear lay to the snow catch a muffle hint of they eternal busyness fifteen or twenty foot under the cañon drift and long before any appreciable spring thaw the sag edge of the snow bridge mark out the place of they run one who venture to look for it find the immediate source of the spring freshet -- all the hill front furrow with the reek of melting drift all the gravelly flat in a swirl of water but later in June or July when the camping season begin there run the stream away full and singing with no visible reinforcement other than a icy trickle from some high belated clot of snow oftenest the stream drop bodily from the bleak bowl of some alpine lake sometimes break out of a hillside as a spring where the ear can trace it under the rubble of loose stone to the neighborhood of some blind pool but that leave the lake to be account for the lake be the eye of the mountain jade green placid unwinking also unfathomable whatever go on under the high and stony brow be guess at it be always a favorite local tradition that one or another of the blind lake be bottomless often they lie in such deep cairn of broken boulder that one never get quite to they or get away unhurt one such drop below the plunge slope that the kearsarge trail wind over perilously near the pass it lie still and wickedly green in its sharp-lipped cup and the guide of that region love to tell of the pack and pack animal it have swallow up but the lake of oppapago be perhaps not so deep less green than gray and better befriend the ousel haunt they while still hang about they coast the thin undercut drift that never quite leave the high altitude in and out of the bluish ice cave he flit and sing and he singing hear from above be sweet and uncanny like the nixie 's chord one find butterfly too about these high sharp region which might be call desolate but will not by I who love they this be above timber-line but not too high for comforting by succulent small herb and golden tufted grass a granite mountain do not crumble with alacrity but once resolve to soil make the best of it every handful of loose gravel not wholly water leach afford a plant footing and even in such unpromising surroundings there be a choice of location there be never go to be any communism of mountain herbage they affinity be too sure full in the runnel of snow water on gravelly open space in the shadow of a drift one look to find buttercup frozen knee-deep by night and own no desire but to ripen they fruit above the icy bath soppy little plant of the portulaca and small fine fern shiver under the drip of fall and in dribble crevice the bleaker the situation so it be near a stream border the better the cassiope love it yet i have not find it on the polished glacier slip but where the country rock cleave and splinter in the high windy headland that the wild sheep frequent horde and horde of the white bell swing over mat mossy foliage on oppapago which be also call sheep mountain one find not far from the bed of cassiope the ice-worn stony hollow where the bighorn cradle they young these be above the wolf 's quest and the eagle 's wont and though the heather bed be softer they be neither so dry nor so warm and here only the star go by no other animal of any pretension make a habitat of the alpine region now and then one get a hint of some small brown creature rat or mouse kind that slip secretly among the rock no other adapt themselves to desertness of aridity or altitude so readily as these ground inhabit graminivorous species if there be a open stream the trout go up the lake as far as the water breed food for they but the ousel go farthest for pure love of it since no lake can be at the highest point it be possible to find plant life higher than the water border grass perhaps the highest gilia royal blue truss of polymonium rosy plat of sierra primrose what one have to get use to in flower at high altitude be the bleaching of the sun hardly do they hold they virgin color for a day and this early fading before they function be perform give they a pitiful appearance not accord with they hardihood the color scheme run along the high ridge from blue to rosy purple carmine and coral red along the water border it be chiefly white and yellow where the mimulus make a vivid note run into red when the two scheme meet and mix about the border of the meadow at the upper limit of the columbine here be the fashion in which a mountain stream get down from the perennial pasture of the snow to its proper level and identity as a irrigating ditch it slip stilly by the glacier scour rim of a ice border pool drop over sheer broken ledge to another pool gather itself plunge headlong on a rocky ripple slope find a lake again reinforce roar downward to a pot-hole foam and bridle glide a tranquil reach in some still meadow tumble into a sharp groove between hill flank curdle under the stream tangle and so arrive at the open country and steadier go meadow little strip of alpine freshness begin before the timber-line be reach here one tread on a carpet of dwarf willow downy catkin of creditable size and the greatest economy of foliage and stem no other plant of high altitude know its business so well it hug the ground grow root from stem joint where no root should be grow a slender leaf or two and twice as many erect full catkin that rarely even in that short grow season fail of fruit dip over bank in the inlet of the creek the fortunate find the rosy apple of the miniature manzanita barely but always quite sufficiently bear above the spongy sod it do not do to be anything but humble in the alpine region but not fearful i have paw about for hour in the chill sward of meadow where one might properly expect to get one 's death and get no harm from it except it might be oliver twist 's complaint one come soon after this to shrubby willow and where willow be trout may be confidently look for in most sierra stream there be no accounting for they distribution though provident angler have assist nature of late one still come upon roar brown water where trout might very well be but be not the highest limit of conifer -- in the middle sierra the white bark pine -- be not along the water border they come to it about the level of the heather but they have no such affinity for dampness as the tamarack pine scarcely any bird-note break the stillness of the timber-line but chipmunk inhabit here as may be guess by the gnaw ruddy cone of the pine and lower hour the woodchuck come down to the water on a little spit of land run into windy lake we find one summer the evidence of a tragedy a pair of sheep 's horn not fully grow catch in the crotch of a pine where the living sheep must have lodge they the trunk of the tree have quite close over they and the skull bone crumble away from the weathered horn case we hope it be not too far out of the running of night prowler to have put a speedy end to the long agony but we could not be sure i never like the spit of windy lake again it seem that all snow nourished plant count nothing so excellent in they kind as to be forehand with they bloom work secretly to that end under the high pile winter the heather begin by the lake border while little sodden drift still shelter under they branch i have see the tiniest of they -lrb- _ kalmium glauca _ -rrb- bloom and with well-formed fruit a foot away from a snowbank from which it could hardly have emerge within a week somehow the soul of the heather have enter into the blood of the english-speaking and oh be that heather they say and the most indifferent end by pick a sprig of it in a hushed wonder way one must suppose that the root of they respective race issue from the glacial border at about the same epoch and remember they origin among the pine where the slope of the land allow it the stream run into smooth brown trout-abounding rill across open flat that be in reality fill lake basin these be the display grounds of the gentian -- blue -- blue -- eye-blue perhaps virtuous and likable flower one be not surprise to learn that they have tonic property but if you meadow should be outside the forest reserve and the sheep have be there you will find little but the shorter paler _ g newberryius _ and in the matted sod of the little tongue of greenness that lick up among the pine along the watercourse white scentless nearly stemless alpine violet at about the nine thousand foot level and in the summer there will be host of rosy-winged dodecatheon call shooting-stars outline the crystal runnel in the sod single flower have often a two-inch spread of petal and the full twelve blossom head above the slender pedicel have the airy effect of wing it be about this level one look to find the largest lake with thick rank of pine bear down on they often swamp in the summer flood and pay the inevitable penalty for such encroachment here in wet cove of the hill harbor that crowd of bloom that make the wonder of the sierra cañons they drift under the alternate flicker and gloom of the windy room of pine in gray rock shelter and by the ooze of blind spring and they juxtaposition be the best imaginable lily come up out of fern bed columbine swing over meadowsweet white rein-orchid quake in the lean grass open swale where in wet year may be run water be plantation of false hellebore -lrb- _ veratrum californicum _ -rrb- tall branch candelabrum of greenish bloom above the sessile sheathing boat-shaped leaf semi-translucent in the sun a stately plant of the lily family but why false it be frankly offensive in its character and its young juice deadly as any hellebore that ever grow like most mountain herb it have a uncanny haste to bloom one hear by night when all the wood be still the crepitatious rustle of the unfold leaf and the push flower-stalk within that have open blossom before it have fairly uncramped from the sheath it commend itself by a certain exclusiveness of growth take enough room and never elbow for if the flora of the lake region have a fault it be that there be too much of it we have more than three hundred species from kearsarge cañon alone and if that do not include they all it be because they be already collect otherwhere one expect to find lake down to about nine thousand foot lead into each other by comparatively open ripple slope and white cascade below the lake be fill basin that be still spongy swamp or substantial meadow as they get down and down here begin the stream tangle on the east slope of the middle sierra the pine all but a occasional yellow variety desert the stream border about the level of the lowest lake and the birch and tree-willow begin the fir hold on almost to the mesa level -- there be no foothill on this eastern slope -- and whoever have fir miss nothing else it go without say that a tree that can afford to take fifty year to its first fruit will repay acquaintance it keep too all that half century a virginal grace of outline but have once flowered begin quietly to put away the thing of its youth year by year the lower round of bough be shed leave no scar year by year the star-branched minaret approach the sky a fir-tree love a water border love a long wind in a draughty cañon love to spend itself secretly on the inner finishing of its burnished shapely cone break open in mid-season the petal-shaped scale show a crimson satin surface perfect as a rise the birch -- the brown-bark western birch characteristic of lower stream tangle -- be a spoil sport it grow thickly to choke the stream that feed it grudge it the sky and space for angler 's rod and fly the willow do better painted-cup cypripedium and the hollow stalk of span-broad white umbel find a footing among they stem but in general the steep plunge the white swirl green and tawny pool the glide hush of water between the meadow and the mesa afford little fishing and few flower one look for these to begin again when once free of the rifted cañon wall the high note of babble and laughter fall off to the steadier mellow tone of a stream that know its purpose and reflect the sky other water border it be the proper destiny of every considerable stream in the west to become a irrigating ditch it would seem the stream be willing they go as far as they can or dare toward the tillable land in they own boulder fenced gully -- but how much farther in the man-made waterway it be difficult to come into intimate relation with appropriate water like very busy people they have no time to reveal themselves one need to have know a irrigating ditch when it be a brook and to have live by it to mark the morning and evening tone of its croon rise and fall to the excess of snow water to have watch far across the valley south to the eclipse and north to the twisted dyke the shine wall of the village water gate to see still blue heron stalk the little glint weir across the field perhaps to get into the mood of the waterway one need to have see old amo judson asquat on the headgate with he gun guard he water-right toward the end of a dry summer amo own the half of tule creek and the other half pertain to the neighbor greenfield ranch year of a short water crop that be when too little snow fall on the high pine ridge or fall melt too early amo hold that it take all the water that come down to make he half and maintain it with a winchester and a deadly aim jesus montaña first proprietor of greenfield -- you can see at once that judson have the racial advantage -- contest the right with he walk into five of judson 's bullet and he eternal possession on the same occasion that be the homeric age of settlement and pass into tradition twelve year later one of the clark hold greenfield not so very green by now shoot one of the judson perhaps he hope that also might become classic but the jury find for manslaughter it have the effect of discourage the greenfield claim but amo use to sit on the headgate just the same as quaint and lone a figure as the sandhill crane watch for water toad below the tule drop every subsequent owner of greenfield buy it with amo in full view the last of these be diedrick along in August of that year come a week of low water judson 's ditch fail and he go out with he rifle to learn why there on the headgate sit diedrick 's frau with a long-handled shovel across she lap and all the water turn into diedrick 's ditch there she sit knit through the long sun and the child bring out she dinner it be all up with amo he be too much of a gentleman to fight a lady -- that be the way he express it she be a very large lady and a long-handled shovel be no mean weapon the next year judson and diedrick put in a modern water gauge and take the summer ebb in equal inch some of the water-right difficulty be more squalid than this some more tragic but unless you have know they you can not very well know what the water think as it slip past the garden and in the long slow sweep of the canal you get that sense of brooding from the confine and sober flood not all at once but by degree as one might become aware of a middle-aged and serious neighbor who have have that in he life to make he so it be the repose of the completely accept instinct with the water run a certain following of thirsty herb and shrub the willow go as far as the stream go and a bit farther on the slightest provocation they will strike root in the leak of a flume or the dribble of a overfull bank coax the water beyond its appoint bound give a new waterway in a barren land and in three year the willow have fringe all its mile of bank three year more and they will touch top across it it be perhaps due to the early usurpation of the willow that so little else find growing-room along the large canal the birch begin far back in the cañon tangle be more conservative it be shy of man haunt and need to have the permanence of its drink assure it stop far short of the summer limit of water and i have never know it to take up a position on the bank beyond the plough land there be something almost like premeditation in the avoidance of cultivate tract by certain plant of water border the clemati mingle its foliage secretly with its host come down with the stream tangle to the village fence skip over to corner of little used pasture land and the plantation that spring up about waste water pool but never venture a footing in the trail of spade or plough will not be persuade to grow in any garden plot on the other hand the horehound the common european species import with the colony hanker after hedgerow and snug little border it be more widely distribute than many native species and may be always find along the ditch in the village corner where it be not appreciate the irrigate ditch be a impartial distributer it gather all the alien weed that come west in garden and grass seed and afford they harbor in its bank there one find the european mallow _ -lrb- malva rotundifolium _ -rrb- spread out to the street with the summer overflow and every spring a dandelion or two bring in with the blue grass seed uncurl in the swardy soil farther than either of these have come the lily that the chinese coolie cultivate in adjacent mud hole for they foodful bulb the _ seegoo _ establish itself very readily in swampy border and the white blossom spike among the arrow-pointed leaf be quite as acceptable to the eye as any native species in the neighborhood of town found by the spanish californian whether this plant be native to the locality or not one can always find aromatic clump of _ yerba buena _ the good herb -lrb- _ micromerium douglassius _ -rrb- the virtue of it as a febrifuge be teach to the mission father by the neophyte and wise old dame of my acquaintance have work astonishing cure with it and the succulent _ yerba mansa _ this last be native to wet meadow and distinguish enough to have a family all to itself where the irrigate ditch be shallow and a little neglect they choke quickly with watercress that multiply about the lowest sierra spring it be characteristic of the frequenter of water border near man haunt that they be chiefly of the sort that be useful to man as if they make they service a excuse for the intrusion the joint-grass of soggy pasture produce edible nut-flavored tuber call by the indian _ taboose _ the common reed of the ultramontane marsh -lrb- here _ phragmite vulgari _ -rrb- a very stately whisper reed light and strong for shaft or arrow afford sweet sap and pith which make a passable sugar it seem the secret of plant power and influence yield themselves most readily to primitive people at least one never hear of the knowledge come from any other source the indian never concern himself as the botanist and the poet with the plant 's appearance and relation but with what it can do for he it can do much but how do you suppose he find it out what instinct or accident guide he how do a cat know when to eat catnip why do western breed cattle avoid loco weed and stranger eat it and go mad one might suppose that in a time of famine the paiute dig wild parsnip in meadow corner and die from eat it and so learn to produce death swiftly and at will but how do they learn repent in the last agony that animal fat be the best antidote for its virulence and who teach they that the essence of joint pine -lrb- _ ephedron nevadensis _ -rrb- which look to have no juice in it of any sort be efficacious in stomachic disorder but they so understand and so use one believe it to be a sort of instinct atrophy by disuse in a complexer civilization i remember very well when i come first upon a wet meadow of _ yerba mansa _ not know its name or use it _ look _ potent the cool shiny leave the succulent pink stem and fruity bloom a little touch a hint a word and i should have know what use to put they to so i feel unwilling to leave it until we have come to a understanding so a musician might have feel in the presence of a instrument know to be within he province but beyond he power it be with the relieved sense of have shape a long surmise that i watch the senora romero make a poultice of it for my burned hand on down from the lower lake to the village weir the brown and golden disk of _ helenum _ have beauty as a sufficient excuse for be the plant anchor out on tiny cape or mid-stream islet with the nearly sessile radicle leave submerge the flower keep up a constant trepidation in time with the hasty water beating at they stem a quiver instinct with life that seem always at the point of break into flight just as the babble of the watercourse always approach articulation but never quite achieve it although of wide range the helenum never make itself common through profusion and may be look for in the same place from year to year another lake dweller that come down to the plough land be the red columbine -lrb- _ c trunca _ -rrb- it require no encouragement other than shade but grow too rank in the summer heat and lose its wildwood grace a common enough orchid in these part be the false lady 's slipper -lrb- _ epipacti gigantea _ -rrb- one that spring up by any water where there be sufficient growth of other sort to give it countenance it seem to thrive best in a atmosphere of suffocation the middle sierra fall off abruptly eastward toward the high valley peak of the fourteen thousand class belt with sombre swath of pine rise almost directly from the bench land with no foothill approach at the lower edge of the bench or mesa the land fall away often by a fault to the river hollow and along the drop one look for spring or intermittent swampy swale here the plant world resemble a little the lake garden modify by altitude and the use the town folk put it to for pasture here be cress blue violet potentillum and in the damp of the willow fence-row white false asphodel i be sure we make too free use of this word _ false _ in name plant -- false mallow false lupine and the like the asphodel be at least no falsifier but a true lily by all the heaven-set mark though small of flower and run mostly to leaf and should have a name that give it credit for grow up in such celestial semblance native to the mesa meadow be a pale iris garden of it acre wide that in the spring season of full bloom make a airy fluttering as of azure wing single flower be too thin and sketchy of outline to affect the imagination but the full field have the misty blue of mirage water roll across desert sand and quicken the sens to the anticipation of thing ethereal a very poet 's flower i think not fit for gather up and prove a nuisance in the pasture therefore need to be the more loved and one day i catch winnenap ' draw out from mid leaf a fine strong fiber for make snare the border of the iris field be pure gold nearly sessile buttercup and a creeping-stemmed composite of a redder hue i be convince that english-speaking child will always have buttercup if they do not light upon the original companion of little frog they will take the next best and cherish it accordingly i find five unrelated species love by that name and as many more and as inappropriately call cowslip by every mesa spring one may expect to find a single shrub of the buckthorn call of old time _ cascara sagrada _ -- the sacred bark up in the cañons within the limit of the rain it seek rather a stony slope but in the dry valley be not find away from water border in all the valley and along the desert edge of the west be considerable area of soil sickly with alkali-collecting pool black and evil-smelling like old blood very little grow hereabout but thick-leaved pickle weed curiously enough in this stiff mud along roadway where there be frequently a little leakage from canal grow the only western representative of the true heliotrope -lrb- _ heliotropium curassavicum _ -rrb- it have flower of fade white foliage of fade green resemble the live-for-ever of old garden and graveyard but even less attractive after so much schooling in the virtue of water-seeking plant one be not surprise to learn that its mucilaginous sap have healing power last and inevitable resort of overflow water be the tulare great waste of reed -lrb- _ juncus _ -rrb- in sickly slow stream the reed call tule be ghostly pale in winter in summer deep poisonous-looking green the water thick and brown the reed bed break into dingy pool clump of rot willow narrow wind water lane and sink path the tule grow inconceivably thick in place stand man-high above the water cattle no not any fish nor fowl can penetrate they old stalk succumb slowly the bed soil be quagmire settle with the weight as it fill and fill too slowly for count they raise little island from the bog and reclaim the land the water push out cut deeper channel gnaw off the edge of the solid earth the tulare be full of mystery and malaria that be why we have mean to explore they and have never do so it must be a happy mystery so you would think to hear the redwinged blackbird proclaim it clear march morning flock of they and every flock a myriad shelter in the dry whisper stem they make little arched runway deep into the heart of the tule bed mile across the valley one hear the clamor of they high keen fluting in the mating weather wild fowl quack horde of they nest in the tulare any day 's venture will raise from open shallows the great blue heron on he hollow wing chill evening the mallard drake cry continually from the glassy pool the bittern 's hollow boom roll along the water path strange and far-flown fowl drop down against the saffron autumn sky all day wing beat above it hazy with speed long flight of crane glimmer in the twilight by night one wake to hear the clang goose go over one wish for but get no nearer speech from those the reedy fen have swallow up what they do there how fare what find be the secret of the tulare nursling of the sky choose a hill country for storm there all the business of the weather be carry on above you horizon and lose its terror in familiarity when you come to think about it the disastrous storm be on the level sea or sand or plain there you get only a hint of what be about to happen the fume of the god rise from they meeting place under the rim of the world and when it break upon you there be no stay nor shelter the terrible mewing and mouthing of a kansas wind have the add terror of viewlessness you be lap in they like uproot grass suspect they of a personal grudge but the storm of hill country have other business they scoop watercourse manure the pine twist they to a finer fiber fit the fir to be mast and spar and if you keep reasonably out of the track of they affair do you no harm they have habit to be learn appoint path season and warning and they leave you in no doubt about they performance one who build he house on a water scar or the rubble of a steep slope must take chance so they do in overtown who build in the wash of argus water and at kearsarge at the foot of a steep treeless swale after twenty year argus water rise in the wash against the frail house and the pile snow of kearsarge slide down at a thunder peal over the cabin and the camp but you could conceive that it be the fault of neither the water nor the snow the first effect of cloud study be a sense of presence and intention in storm process weather do not happen it be the visible manifestation of the spirit move itself in the void it gather itself together under the heaven rain snow yearn mightily in wind smile and the weather bureau situate advantageously for that very business tap the record on he instrument and go out on the street deny he god not have gather the sense of what he have see hardly anybody take account of the fact that john muir who know more of mountain storm than any other be a devout man of the high sierra choose the neighborhood of the splintered peak about the kern and king 's river divide for storm study or the short wide-mouthed cañons open eastward on high valley day when the hollow be steep in a warm winey flood the cloud come walk on the floor of heaven flat and pearly gray beneath round and pearly white above they gather flock-wise move on the level current that roll about the peak lock hand and settle with the cooler air draw a veil about those place where they do they work if they meeting or parting take place at sunrise or sunset as it often do one get the splendor of the apocalypse there will be cloud pillar mile high snow-capped glorified and preserve a orderly perspective before the unbarred door of the sun or perhaps mere ghost of cloud that dance to some pie piper of a unfelt wind but be it day or night once they have settle to they work one see from the valley only the blank wall of they tent stretch along the range to get the real effect of a mountain storm you must be inside one who go often into a hill country learn not to say : what if it should rain it always do rain somewhere among the peak : the unusual thing be that one should escape it you might suppose that if you take any account of plant contrivance to save they pollen powder against shower note how many there be deep-throated and bell-flowered like the pentstemon how many have nod pedicel as the columbine how many grow in copse shelter and grow there only there be keen delight in the quick shower of summer cañons with the add comfort bear of experience of know that no harm come of a wet at high altitude the day be warm a white cloud spy over the cañon wall slip up behind the ridge to cross it by some windy pass obscure you sun next you hear the rain drum on the broad-leaved hellebore and beat down the mimulus beside the brook you shelter on the lee of some strong pine with shut-winged butterfly and merry fiddling creature of the wood runnel of rain water from the glacier-slip swirl through the pine needle into rivulet the stream froth and rise in they bank the sky be white with cloud the sky be gray with rain the sky be clear the summer shower leave no wake such as these follow each other day by day for week in August weather sometimes they chill suddenly into wet snow that pack about the lake garden clear to the blossom frill and melt away harmlessly sometimes one have the good fortune from a heather -- grown headland to watch a rain-cloud form in mid-air out over meadow or lake region begin a little darkling of the sky -- no cloud no wind just a smokiness such as spirit materialize from in witch story it ray out and draw to it some float film from secret cañons rain begin slow drop veil of thinnest lawn a wind come up and drive the formless thing across a meadow or a dull lake pit by the glancing drop dissolve as it drive such rain relieve like tear the same season bring the rain that have work to do plough storm that alter the face of thing these come with thunder and the play of live fire along the rock they come with great wind that try the pine for they work upon the sea and strike out the unfit they shake down avalanche of splinter from sky-line pinnacle and raise up sudden flood like battle front in the cañons against town tree and boulder they would be kind if they could but have more important matter such storm call cloud-burst by the country folk be not rain rather the spilling of thor 's cup jar by the thunderer after such a one the water that come up in the village hydrant mile away be white with forced bubble from the wind-tormented stream all that storm do to the face of the earth you may read in the geography but not what they do to we contemporary i remember one night of thunderous rain make unendurably mournful by the houseless cry of a cougar whose lair and perhaps he family have be bury under a slide of broken boulder on the slope of kearsarge we have hear the heavy denotation of the slide about the hour of the alpenglow a pale rosy interval in a darkling air and judge he must have come from hunting to the ruin cliff and pace the night out before it cry a very human woe i remember too in that same season of storm a lake make milky white for day and crowd out of its bed by clay wash into it by a fury of rain with the trout float in it belly up stun by the shock of the sudden flood but there be trout enough for what be leave of the lake next year and the beginning of a meadow about its upper rim what tax I most in the wreck of one of my favorite cañons by cloudburst be to see a bobcat mother mouth she drowned kitten in the ruin lair build in the wash far above the limit of accustomed water but not far enough for the unexpected after a time you get the point of view of god about these thing to save you from be too pitiful the great snow that come at the beginning of winter before there be yet any snow except the perpetual high bank be best worth while to watch these come often before the late bloomers be go and while the migratory bird be still in the piney wood down in the valley you see little but the flock of blackbird in the street or the low flight of mallard over the tulare and the gathering of cloud behind williamson first there be a wait stillness in the wood the pine-tree creak although there be no wind the sky glower the fir rock by the water border the noise of the creek rise insistently and fall off a full note like a child abashed by sudden silence in the room this change of the stream-tone follow tardily the change of the sun on melting snow be most meaningful of wood note after it run a little trumpeter wind to cry the wild creature to they hole sometimes the warning hang in the air for day with increase stillness only clark 's crow and the strident jay make light of it only they can afford to the cattle get down to the foothill and ground inhabit creature make fast they door it grow chill blind cloud fumble in the cañons there will be a roll of thunder perhaps or a flurry of rain but mostly the snow be bear in the air with quietness and the sense of strong white pinion softly stir it increase be wet and clog and make a white night of midday there be seldom any wind with first snow more often rain but later when there be already a smooth foot or two over all the slope the drift begin the late snow be fine and dry mere ice granule at the wind 's will keen morning after a storm they be blow out in wreath and banner from the high ridge sift into the cañons once in a year or so we have a big snow the cloud tent be widen out to shut in the valley and a outlying range or two and be draw tight against the sun such a storm begin warm with a dry white mist that fill and fill between the ridge and the air be thick with formless groan now for day you get no hint of the neighbor range until the snow begin to lighten and some shoulder peak lift through a rent morning after the heavy snow be steely blue two-edged with cold divinely fresh and still and these be time to go up to the pine border there you may find flounder in the unstable drift taint wether of the wild sheep faint from age and hunger easy prey even the deer make slow go in the thick fresh snow and once we find a wolverine go blind and feebly in the white glare no tree take the snow stress with such ease as the silver fir the star-whorled fan-spread branch droop under the soft wreath -- droop and press flatly to the trunk presently the point of overloading be reach there be a soft sough and muffle drop the bough recover and the weighting go on until the drift have reach the midmost whorl and cover up the branch when the snow be particularly wet and heavy they spread over the young fir in green-ribbed tent wherein harbor winter loving bird all storm of desert hill except wind storm be impotent east and east of the sierra they rise in nearly parallel range desertward and no rain break over they except from some far-strayed cloud or roving wind from the californium gulf and these only in winter in summer the sky travail with thundering and the flare of sheet lightning to win a few blister big drop and once in a lifetime the chance of a torrent but you have not know what force reside in the mindless thing until you have know a desert wind one expect it at the turn of the two season wet and dry with electrify tense nerve along the edge of the mesa where it drop off to the valley dust devil begin to rise white and steady fan out at the top like the genie out of the fisherman 's bottle one suppose the indian might have learn the use of smoke signal from these dust pillar as they learn most thing direct from the tutelage of the earth the air begin to move fluently blow hot and cold between the range far south rise a murk of sand against the sky it grow the wind shake itself and have a smell of earth the cloud of small dust take on the color of gold and shut out the neighborhood the push of the wind be unsparing only man of all folk be foolish enough to stir abroad in it but be in a house be really much worse no relief from the dust and a great fear of the creaking timber there be no look ahead in such a wind and the bite of the small sharp sand on expose skin be keener than any insect sting one might sleep for the lapping of the wind wear one to the point of exhaustion very soon but there be dread in open sand stretch sometimes justified of be over blow by the drift it be hot dry fretful work but by go along the ground with the wind behind one may come upon strange thing in its tumultuous privacy i like these truce of wind and heat that the desert make otherwise i do not know how i should come by so many acquaintance with furtive folk i like to see hawk sit daunt in shallow hole not daring to spread a feather and dove in a row by the prickle bush and shut-eyed cattle turn tail to the wind in a patient doze i like the smother of sand among the dune and find small coiled snake in open place but i never like to come in a wind upon the silly sheep the wind rob they of what wit they have and they seem never to have learn the self-induced hypnotic stupor with which most wild thing endure weather stress i have never hear that the desert wind bring harm to any other than the wander shepherd and they flock once below pastarium little pete show I bone stick out of the sand where a flock of two hundred have be smother in a bygone wind in many place the four-foot post of a cattle fence have be bury by the wind-blown dune it be enough occupation when no storm be brew to watch the cloud current and the chamber of the sky from kearsarge say you look over inyo and find pink soft cloud mass asleep on the level desert air south of you hurry a white troop late to some gathering of they kind at the back of oppapago nose the foot of waban a woolly mist creep south in the clean smooth path of the middle sky and highest up in air drift unshepherded small flock range contrarily you will find the proper name of these thing in the report of the weather bureau -- cirrus cumulus and the like -- and chart that will teach by study when to sow and take up crop it be astonishing the trouble man will be at to find out when to plant potato and gloze over the eternal meaning of the sky you have to beat out for yourself many morning on the windly headland the sense of the fact that you get the same rainbow in the cloud drift over waban and the spray of you garden hose and not necessarily then do you live up to it the little town of the grape vine there be still some place in the west where the quail cry _ cuidado _ where all the speech be soft all the manners gentle where all the dish have _ chile _ in they and they make more of the sixteenth of September than they do of the fourth of July i mean in particular el pueblo de las uvas where it lie how to come at it you will not get from I rather would i show you the heron 's nest in the tulare it have a peak behind it glint above the tamarack pine above a breaker of ruddy hill that have a long slope valley-ward and the shoreward steep of wave toward the sierra below the town of the grape vine which shorten to las uvas for common use the land dip away to the river pasture and the tulare it shroud under a twilight thicket of vine under a dome of cottonwood-trees drowsy and murmurous as a hive hereabouts be some strip of tillage and the headgate that dam up the creek for the village weir upstream you catch the growl of the arrastra wild vine that begin among the willow lap over to the orchard row take the trellis and roof-tree there be another town above las uvas that merit some attention a town of arch and airy croft full of linnet blackbird fruit bird small sharp hawk and mockingbird that sing by night they pour out pierce unendurably sweet cavatina above the fragrance of bloom and musky smell of fruit singing be in fact the business of the night at las uvas as sleeping be for midday when the moon come over the mountain wall new-washed from the sea and the shadow lie like lace on the stamped floor of the patio from recess to recess of the vine tangle run the thrum of guitar and the voice of singing at las uvas they keep up all the good custom bring out of old mexico or breed in a lotus-eating land drink and be merry and look out for something to eat afterward have child nine or ten to a family have cock-fight keep the siesta smoke cigarette and wait for the sun to go down and always they dance at dusk on the smooth adobe floor afternoon under the trellis where the earth be damp and have a fruity smell a betrothal a wedding or a christening or the mere proximity of a guitar be sufficient occasion and if the occasion lack send for the guitar and dance anyway all this require explanation antonio sevadra drift this way from old mexico with the flood that pour into the tappan district after the first notable strike discover la golondrina it be a generous lode and tony a good fellow to work it he bring in all the sevadra even to the twice-removed all the castro who be he wife 's family all the saise romero and eschobar -- the relation of he relations-in - law there you have the beginning of a pretty considerable town to these accrue much of the spanish californium float sweep out of the southwest by eastern enterprise they slack away again when the price of silver go down and the ore dwindle in la golondrina all the hot eddy of mining life sweep away from that corner of the hill but there be always those too idle too poor to move or too easily content with el pueblo de las uvas nobody come nowadays to the town of the grape vine except as we say with the breath of cry but of these enough all the low sill run over with small head ah ah there be a kind of pride in that if you do but know it to have you baby every year or so as the time set and keep a full breast so great a blessing as marriage be easily come by it be tell of ruy garcium that when he go for he marriage license he lack a dollar of the clerk 's fee but borrow it of the sheriff who expect reelection and exhibit thereby a commendable thrift of what account be it to lack meal or meat when you may have it of any neighbor besides there be sometimes a point of honor in these thing jesus romero father of ten have a job sack ore in the marionette which he give up of he own accord eh why say jesus for my fam ` ly it be so señora he say solemnly i go to the marionette i work i eat meat -- pie -- frijole -- good ver ' good i come home sad ` day nigh ' i see my fam ` ly i play lil ' game poker with the boy have lil ' drink wine my money all go my family have no money nothing eat all time i work at mine i eat good ver ' good grub i think sorry for my fam ` ly no no señora i no work no more that marionette i stay with my fam ` ly the wonder of it be i think that the family have the same point of view every house in the town of the vine have its garden plot corn and brown bean and a row of pepper redden in the sun and in damp border of the irrigate ditch clump of _ yerba santa _ horehound catnip and spikenard wholesome herb and curative but if no pepper then nothing at all you will have for a holiday dinner in las uvas soup with meat ball and chile in it chicken with chile rice with chile fry bean with more chile enchilada which be corn cake with a sauce of chile and tomato onion grate cheese and olive and for a relish chile _ tepine _ pass about in a dish all of which be comfortable and corrective to the stomach you will have wine which every man make for himself of good body and inimitable bouquet and sweet that be not nearly so nice as they look there be two occasion when you may count on that kind of a meal always on the sixteenth of September and on the two-yearly visit of father shannon it be absurd of course that el pueblo de las uvas should have a irish priest but black rock minton jimville and all that country round do not find it so father shannon visit they all wait by the red butte to confess the shepherd who go through with they flock carry blessing to small and isolate mine and so in the course of a year or so work around to las uvas to bury and marry and christen then all the little grave in the _ campo santo _ be brave with taper the brown pine headboard blossom like aaron 's rod with paper rose and bright cheap print of we lady of sorrow then the señora sevadra who think herself elect of heaven for that office gather up the original sinner the little elijias lola manuelita josé and felipés by dint of adjuration and sweet smuggle into small perspire palm to fit they for the sacrament i use to peek in at they never so softly in dona ina 's living-room raphael-eyed little imp go sidewise on they knee to rest they from the bare floor candle light on the mantel to give a religious air and a great sheaf of wild bloom before the holy family come Sunday they set out the altar in the schoolhouse with the fine-drawn altar cloth the beaten silver candlestick and the wax image chief glory of las uvas bring up mule-back from old mexico forty year ago all in white the communicant go up two and two in a hushed sweet awe to take the body of they lord and tomaso who be priest 's boy try not to look unduly puff up by he office after that you have dinner and a bottle of wine that ripen on the sunny slope of escondito all the week father shannon have shrive he people who bring clean conscience to the betterment of appetite and the father set they a example father shannon be rather big about the middle to accommodate the large laugh that live in he but a most shrewd searcher of heart it be report that one derive comfort from he confessional and i for my part believe it the celebration of the sixteenth though it come every year take as long to prepare for as holy communion the señoritas have each a new dress apiece the señoras a new _ rebosa _ the young gentleman have new silver trimming to they sombrero unspeakable tie silk handkerchief and new leather to they spur at this time when the pepper glow in the garden and the young quail cry _ cuidado _ have a care you can hear the _ plump plump _ of the _ metate _ from the alcove of the vine where comfortable old dame whose experience give they the touch of art be pound out corn for tamale school-teacher from abroad have try before now at las uvas to have school begin on the first of September but get nothing else to stir in the head of the little castro garcia and romero but feast and cock-fight until after the sixteenth perhaps you need to be tell that this be the anniversary of the republic when liberty awake and cry in the province of old mexico you be arouse at midnight to hear they shout in the street _ vive la libertad _ answer from the house and the recess of the vine _ vive la mexico _ at sunrise shot be fire commemorate the tragedy of unhappy maximilian and then music the noblest of national hymn as the great flag of old mexico float up the flag-pole in the bare little plaza of shabby la uva the sun over pine mountain greet the eagle of montezuma before it touch the vineyard and the town and the day begin with a great shout by and by there will be a reading of the declaration of independence and a address puncture by _ vive _ all the town in its best dress and some exhibit of horsemanship that make lather bit and bloodly spur also a cock-fight by night there will be dance and such music old santo to play the flute a little lean man with a saintly countenance young garcium whose guitar have a soul and carrasco with the violin they sit on a high platform above the dancer in the candle flare back by the red white and green of old mexico and play fervently such music as you will not hear otherwhere at midnight the flag come down count yourself at a loss if you be not move by that performance pine mountain watch whitely overhead shepherd fire glow strongly on the glooming hill the plaza the bare glisten pole the dark folk the bright dress be light ruddily by a bonfire it leap up to the eagle flag die down the music begin softly and aside they play air of old longing and exile slowly out of the dark the flag drop down belly and fall with the midnight draught sometimes a hymn be sing always there be tear the flag be down tony sevadra have receive it in he arm the music strike a barbaric swell tune another flag begin a slow ascent -- it take a breath or two to realize that they be both flag and tune the star spangled banner -- a volley be fire we be back if you please in californium of america every youth who have the blood of patriot in he lay ahold on tony sevadra 's flag happiest if he can get a corner of it the music go before the folk fall in two and two singing they sing everything america the marseillaise for the sake of the french shepherd hereabout the hymn of cuba and the chilian national air to comfort two family of that land the flag go to do ± a ina 's with the candlestick and the altar cloth then las uvas eat tamale and dance the sun up the slope of pine mountain you be not to suppose that they do not keep the fourth washington 's birthday and thanksgiving at the town of the grape vine these make excellent occasion for quit work and dancing but the sixteenth be the holiday of the heart on memorial day the grave have garland and new picture of the saint tack to the headboard there be great virtue in a _ ave _ say in the camp of the saint i like that name which the spanish speak
