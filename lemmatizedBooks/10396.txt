line the sash he remove the pane and set it noiselessly on the floor as he stick he head out through the aperture andy look calculate and serious it be fully thirty foot to the ground and no friendly projection offer help in a descent it be furthermore a question if he could even squeeze through the window space andy have nothing to make a rope of the old piece of carpet could not be utilize in any way if he could force he body through the window head first it be a dive to go foot first on a dangerous drop andy investigate the aperture experiment take in the situation in all its various phase finally he decide what he would do he have unearth a long iron board from a corner of the room he pull a heavy dresser up to the window and open one of its drawer a few inch by slant the iron board he manage to get its broad end out through the window then he drop it flat with its narrow end hold firmly under the project drawer andy get flat on the board squirm along it and just manage to squeeze through the window space at the end of five minute he find himself extend outside on the board a touch might throw it out of position and drop he like a shot very carefully he arise to he foot

show say andy i have get to coast it or get all tear up he let go he hold of the staple instantly he have a hand firmly grasp either side of the iron board andy drop to a past-centre slant give he foot a prodigious push against the window sill he shoot forward and downward for a instant andy sail through the air he fear he might dive short of the tree he hope he would land flat the latter by luck or he own precision he do the board strike the tree top there be a slide swish a vast crack of branch he weight drop one end of the iron board it land against a big branch and andy find himself safely anchor in the tree top chapter ix good-bye to fairview look back at the attic window andy wildwood wonder how he have ever make the successful descent any boy lack he sense of athletic

level only increase she already terrific rate of speed andy take heart however as she swerve to one side the intelligent animal appear to enjoy she wild runaway and want to keep it up apparently she aim to keep precisely to she own side of the road and avoid a collision the driver of the team come have jump from he seat and pull he rig to the very edge of the plank all might have go well but for a slight miscalculation as lute 's foot strike the bridge plankway she press close to the right the wagon swerve the front end of the box land squarely against the stone post the shock be a stunning one it tear the wagon shaft harness and all clear off the horse with a circle twist the vehicle reverse like lightning the box strike the wooden rail this snap like a pipe stem lute dash on like a whirlwind the driver of the other team stare in appal wonder the box slide clear of the plankway and go whirling to the river bed fifteen foot below andy be throw from side to side then as the wagon

last stealthily glide up behind he seize both the fellow 's arm he whirl he around face to face let go of he and with two quick movement of one hand tear the false moustache and the false goatee from he face he surmise be correct it be jim tapp the latter give andy a quick startled glance wildwood he say and switch he cane towards andy 's face no you do not cry andy grasp he arm again jim tapp the circus people want you let go nobody want I i have do nothing call benare brother the stake you partner hit I with the steal mail bag nothing demand andy you 'll come along with I or i 'll call the

but he never let go of he antagonist both land with a crash on the board sidewalk there be a vacant lot just next to a brilliantly light store as they take a roll they land nearly at the inner edge of the walk there pant andy you will not trip I again he be the stronger of the two and get tapp on he back sit astride of he andy catch both hand at the wrist let go pant tapp say do not draw a crowd i

rascal he ferret-like eye twinkle and follow the glance of andy 's own tapp be too keen a fellow not to observe that andy be startle and unnerve by the unexpected appearance of some one on the scene he probably catch the word speak by andy : my aunt and presumably identify miss lavinium talcott as the cause of the boy 's disquietude further jim tapp know that andy have run away from home and have be seek for by the police as it turn out later in andy wildwood 's career jim tapp know a great deal more than all this put together in fact he know some thing of which andy never dream andy have be completely drive off he balance at the sight of he aunt it be natural that she should be at tipton she go there quite often loneliness at home and the variety of the county fair at tipton have probably induce she to make the present visit instantly andy thought of but one thing -- to escape recognition still the minute he let go of tapp he presence of mind return and he be sorry he have lose he nerve on a impulse it would have be quite a easy thing to roll and force he antagonist over the sidewalk edge now however tapp have wriggle past he reach andy make one grab for he prostrate on

that aunt be in that room think andy halt near the hoop-pole framework and look up at the window she always have the middle room here yes she be there and a man with she maybe i would better skirmish around a little instead of run the risk of be nab before i can have a explanation i want a little private talk with aunt alone if i can get it andy bent he ear he catch no word only the sound of human voice he aunt 's high strained tone be unmistakable he seize one of the support pole of the framework it rattle and quiver yet he believe it would hold he if he proceed carefully it be no trick at all

shot big bob be worth a good deal of money to the show the principal aim of the menagerie man therefore be to prevent the slaughter of a escape animal down the hill bruin run and andy after he then there be a country road and big bob put down this andy could easily outrun the fugitive but this be not he policy for the present the disabled foot of the animal diminish he normal speed andy believe that bruin would soon find and harbor himself in some cozy nook at a turn in the road andy notice that there be a house a few hundred foot ahead beyond this several other dwelling be scatter about the landscape i do not like that mused andy it may mean trouble i would rather see the old scamp take to the open country wonder if i can head he off andy leap a field fence he double he pace get even with big bob then ahead of he he snatch up a pitchfork lie across a heap of hay and bolt over the fence to the road again extend the implement he stand ready to challenge the approach fugitive and if

foot come on say andy sure now that he bait be a good one and that he experiment would succeed i have get you i guess andy start on a run pay out the rope just as big bob be about to pounce upon the toothsome spoil andy give it a jerk he gauge he rate of progress on a close estimate along the trail speed bruin andy put across the field he hear a bell ring out glance back at the farmhouse he see a human arm reach through a open window it pull at a rope lead to a big alarm bell hang from the eaves look beyond the farmhouse he also see three or four man in a distant field summon by the bell now
