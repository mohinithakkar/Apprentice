be not need if i can help people i 'll do it by give they a chance to help themselves and if i can uplift or inspire let it be by example inference and suggestion rather than by injunction and dictation that be to say i desire to be radiant -- to radiate life life and expression by exercise of its faculty the spirit grow just as a muscle grow strong thru continue use expression be necessary life be expression and repression be stagnation -- death yet there can be right and wrong expression if a man permit he life to run riot and only the animal side of he nature be allow to express itself he be repress he highest and best and the quality not use atrophy and die man be punish by they sin not for they sensuality gluttony and the life of license repress the life of the spirit and the soul never blossom and this be what it be to lose one 's soul all adown the century think man have note these truth and again and again we find individual forsake in horror the life of the sens and devote themselves to the life of the spirit this question of expression through the spirit or through the sens -- through soul or body -- have be the pivotal point of all philosophy and the inspiration of all religion every religion be make up of two element that never mix any more than oil and water mix a religion be a mechanical mixture not a chemical combination of morality and dogma dogma be the science of the unseen : the doctrine of the unknown and unknowable and in order to give this science plausibility its promulgator have always fasten upon it morality morality can and do exist entirely separate and apart from dogma but dogma be ever a parasite on morality and the business of the priest be to confuse the two but morality and religion never saponify morality be simply the question of express you life force -- how to use they you have so much energy and what will you do with it and from out the multitude there have always be man to step forward and give you advice for a consideration without they suppose influence with the unseen we might not accept they interpretation of what be right and wrong but with the assurance that they advice be back up by deity follow with a offer of reward if we believe it and a threat of dire punishment if we do not the self-appointed superior class have drive man wheresoever it will the evolution of formal religion be not a complex process and the fact that they embody these two unmixable thing dogma and morality be a very plain and simple truth easily see undisputed by all reasonable man and be it say that the morality of most religion be good love truth charity justice and gentleness be teach in they all but like a rule in greek grammar there be many exception and so in the morality of religion there be exceptional instance that constantly arise where love truth charity gentleness and justice be waive on suggestion of the superior class that good may follow be it not for these exception there would be no war between christian nation the question of how to express you life will probably never down for the reason that man vary in temperament and inclination some man have no capacity for certain sin of the flesh other there be who have lose they inclination for sensuality through too much indulgence turn ascetic yet all sermon have but one theme : how shall life be express between asceticism and indulgence man and race swing asceticism in we day find a interesting manifestation in the trappist who live on a mountain top nearly inaccessible and deprive themselves of almost every vestige of bodily comfort go without food for day wear uncomfortable garment suffer severe cold and should one of this community look upon the face of a woman he would think he be in instant danger of damnation so here we find the extreme instance of man repress the faculty of the body in order that the spirit may find ample time and opportunity for exercise somewhere between this extreme repression of the monk and the license of the sensualist lie the truth but just where be the great question and the desire of one person who think he have discover the norm to compel all other man to stop there have lead to war and strife untold all law center around this point -- what shall man be allow to do and so we find statute to punish stroll play actor player on fiddle disturber of the public conscience person who dance wantonly blasphemer and in england there be in the year 1800 thirty-seven offens that be legally punishable by death what expression be right and what be not be simply a matter of opinion one religious denomination that now exist do not allow singing instrumental music have be to some a rock of offense exciting the spirit through the sense of hear to improper thought -- through the lascivious pleasing of the lute other think dance wicked while a few allow pipe-organ music but draw the line at the violin while still other use a whole orchestra in they religious service some there be who regard picture as implement of idolatry while the hook-and-eye baptist look upon button as immoral strange evolution be often witness within the life of one individual for instance leo tolstoy a great and good man at one time a sensualist have now turn ascetic a common evolution in the life of the saint but excellent as this man be there be yet a grave imperfection in he cosmos which to a degree vitiate the truth he desire to teach : he leave the element of beauty out of he formulum not care for harmony as set forth in color form and sweet sound he be quite willing to deny all other these thing which minister to they well-being there be in most soul a hunger for beauty just as there be physical hunger beauty speak to they spirit through the sens but tolstoy would have you house barren to the verge of hardship my veneration for count tolstoy be profound yet i mention he here to show the grave danger that lie in allow any man even one of the wisest of man to dictate to we what be best we ourselves be the better judge most of the frightful cruelty inflict on man during the past have arise simply out of a difference of opinion that arise through a difference in temperament the question be as alive to-day as it be two thousand year ago -- what expression be best that be what shall we do to be save and concrete absurdity consist in say that we must all do the same thing whether the race will ever grow to a point where man will be willing to leave the matter of life-expression to the individual be a question but the millennium will never arrive until man cease try to compel all other man to live after one pattern most people be anxious to do what be best for themselves and least harmful for other the average man now have intelligence enough : utopia be not far off if the self-appointed folk who rule we and teach we for a consideration would only be willing to do unto other as they would be do by that be to say mind they own business and cease covet thing that belong to other people war among nation and strife among individual be a result of the covetous spirit to possess a little more patience a little more charity for all a little more love with less bow down to the past and the silent ignore of pretended authority a brave look forward to the future with more self-confidence and more faith in we fellow man and the race will be ripe for a great burst of life and light -lrb- illustration -rrb- time and chance as the subject be somewhat complex i will have to explain it to you the first point be that there be not so very much difference in the intelligence of people after all the great man be not so great as folk think and the dull man be not quite so stupid as he seem the difference in we estimate of man lie in the fact that one individual be able to get he goods into the show-window and the other be not aware that he have any show-window or any goods the soul know all thing and knowledge be only a remember say emerson this seem a very broad statement and yet the fact remain that the vast majority of man know a thousand time as much as they be aware of far down in the silent depths of subconsciousness lie myriad of truth each await a time when its owner shall call it forth to utilize these stored-up thought you must express they to other and to be able to express they well you soul have to soar into this subconscious realm where you have cache these net result of experience in other word you must come out -- get out of self -- away from self-consciousness into the region of partial oblivion -- away from the boundary of time and the limitation of space the great painter forget all in the presence of he canvas the writer be oblivious to he surroundings the singer float away on the wing of melody -lrb- and carry the audience with she -rrb- the orator pour out he soul for a hour and it seem to he as if barely five minute have pass so rapt be he in he exalted theme when you reach the height of sublimity and be express you highest and best you be in a partial trance condition and all man who enter this condition surprise themselves by the quantity of knowledge and the extent of insight they possess and some go a little deeper than other into this trance condition and have no knowledge of the miraculous store up of truth in the subconscious cell jump to the conclusion that they intelligence be guide by a spirit not theirs when one reach this conclusion he begin to wither at the top for he rely on the dead and cease to feed the well-spring of he subconscious self the mind be a dual affair -- objective and subjective the objective mind see all hear all reason thing out the subjective mind store up and only give out when the objective mind sleep and as few man ever cultivate the absorb reflective or semi-trance state where the objective mind rest they never really call on they subconscious treasury for its store they be always self-conscious a man in commerce where man prey on they kind must be alive and alert to what be go on or while he dream he competitor will seize upon he birthright and so you see why poet be poor and artist often beg and the sum up of this sermonette be that all man be equally rich only some thru fate be able to muster they mental legion on the plain of they be and count they while other be never able to do so but what think you be necessary before a person can come into full possession of he subconscious treasure well i 'll tell you : it be not ease nor prosperity nor requited love nor worldly security -- not these you sing well say the master impatiently to he best pupil but you will never sing divinely until you have give you all for love and then be neglect and reject and scorn and beat and leave for dead then if you do not exactly die you will come back and when the world hear you voice it will mistake you for a angel and fall at you foot and the moral be that as long as you be satisfied and comfortable you use only the objective mind and live in the world of sense but let love be tear from you grasp and flee as a shadow -- live only as a memory in a haunting sense of loss let death come and the sky shut down over less worth in the world or stupid misunderstanding and crush defeat grind you into the dust then you may arise forget time and space and self and take refuge in mansion not make with hand and find a certain sad sweet satisfaction in the contemplation of treasure store up where moth and rust do not corrupt and where thief do not break through and steal and thus look out into the eternal you entirely forget the present and go forth into the land of subconsciousness -- the land of spirit where yet dwell the god of ancient and innocent day be it worth the cost psychology of a religious revival travel to and fro over the land and up and down in it be man who manage street-fair let it be know that a street-fair or mardi gras be never a spontaneous expression of the carnival spirit on the part of the townspeople these festival be a business -- carefully plan well advertise and carry out with much astuteness the man who manage street-fair send advance agent to make arrangement with the local merchant of the place -- these secure the legal permit that be necessary a week be set apart for the carnival much advertising be do the newspaper reflect the will of the many devote page to the wonderful thing that will happen the show arrive -- the touter the spieler the clown the tumbler the girl in tights the singer the band play -- the carnival be on the object of the fair be to boom the business of the town the object of the professional manager of the fair be to make money for themselves and this they do thru the guaranty of the merchant or a percentage on concession or both i be tell that no town whose business be on a absolutely safe and secure footing ever resort to a street-fair the street-fair come in when a rival town seem to be get more than its share of the trade when the business of skaneatele be drift to waterloo then skaneatele succumb to a street-fair sanitation sewerage good water supply and schoolhouse and pave street be not the result of throw confetti toot tin horn and waive the curfew law whether commerce be effectually help by the street-fair or a town assist to get on a firm financial basis through the ministry of the tom-tom be a problem i leave the question with student of political economy and pass on to a local condition which be not a theory the religious revival that have recently be conduct in various part of the country be most carefully plan business scheme one f wilbur chapman and he corps of well-trained associate may be take as a type of the individual who work up local religious excitement for a consideration religious revival be manage very much as be street-fair if religion be get at a low ebb in you town you can hire chapman the revivalist just as you can secure the service of farley the strike-breaker chapman and he helper go from town to town and from city to city and work up this excitation as a business they be pay for they service a thousand dollar a week or down to what they can get from collection sometimes they work on a guaranty and at other time on a percentage or contingent fee or both town especially in need of mr chapman 's assistance will please send for circular term and testimonial no soul save -- no pay the basic element of the revival be hypnotism the scheme of bring about the hypnosis or the obfuscation of the intellect have take generation to carefully perfect the plan be first to depress the spirit to a point where the subject be incapable of independent thought mournful music a monotonous voice of woe tearful appeal to god dreary groan the whole mingled with pious ejaculation all tend to produce a terrifying effect upon the auditor the thought of god 's displeasure be constantly dwell upon -- the idea of guilt death and eternal torment if the victim can be make to indulge in hysterical laughter occasionally the control be better bring about no chance be allow for repose poise or sane consideration when the time seem ripe a general promise of joy be make and the music take a adagio turn the speaker 's voice now tell of triumph -- offer of forgiveness be tender and then the promise of eternal life the final intent be to get the victim on he foot and make he come forward and acknowledge the fetich this once do the convert find himself among pleasant companion he social station be improve -- people shake hand with he and solicitously ask after he welfare he approbativeness be appeal to -- he position be now one of importance and moreover he be give to understand in many subtile way that as he will be damned in another world if he do not acquiesce in the fetich so also will he be damned financially and socially here if he do not join the church the intent in every christian community be to boycott and make a social outcast of the independent thinker the fetich furnish excuse for the hypnotic process without assume a personal god who can be appease eternal damnation and the proposition that you can win eternal life by believe a myth there be no sane reason for the absurd hypnotic formula we be heir to the past its good and ill and we all have a touch of superstition like a syphilitic taint to eradicate this tyranny of fear and get the cringe and crawl out of we nature seem the one desirable thing to lofty mind but the revivalist know human nature as all confidence man do bank on we superstitious fear and make he appeal to we acquisitiveness offer we absolution and life eternal for a consideration -- to cover expense as long as man be pay honor and money can wear good clothes and be immune from work for preach superstition they will preach it the hope of the world lie in withhold supplies from the pious mendicant who seek to hold we mind in thrall this idea of a divine bankrupt court where you can get forgiveness by pay ten cent on the dollar with the guaranty of become a winged pauper of the sky be not alluring except to a man who have be well scared advance agent pave the way for revivalist by arrange detail with the local orthodox clergy universalist unitarian christian scientist and befaymillite be all studiously avoid the object be to fill deplete pew of orthodox protestant church -- these pay the freight and to the victor belong the spoil the plot and plan be to stampede into the pen of orthodoxy the intellectual unwary -- child and neurotic grown-up the cap-and-bell element be largely represent in chapman 's select company of german-american talent : the confetti of foolishness be throw at we -- we dodge laugh listen and no one have time to think weigh sift or analyze there be the boom of rhetoric the crack of confession the intersperse rebel-yell of triumph the groan of despair the cry of victory then come song by pay singer the peal of the organ -- rise and sing kneel and pray entreaty condemnation misery tear threat promise joy happiness heaven eternal bliss decide now -- not a moment be to be lose whoop-la you 'll be a long time in hell all this whirl be a carefully prepared plan work out by expert flim-flammer to addle the reason scramble intellect and make of man drool derelict what for i 'll tell you -- that doctor chapman and he professional rooter may roll in cheap honor be immune from all useful labor and wax fat on the pay of those who work second that the orthodox church may not advance into workshop and schoolhouse but may remain forever the home of a superstition one would think that the promise of make a person exempt from the result of he own misdeed would turn the man of brain from these religious shell-man in disgust but under they hypnotic spell the mind of many seem to suffer a obsession and they be catch in the swirl of foolish feeling like a grocer 's clerk in the hand of a mesmerist at northfield massachusett be a college at which man be teach and train just as man be drill at a tonsorial college in every phase of this pleasing episcopopography there be a good fellow by the suggestive name of Sunday who work the religious graft Sunday be the whirling dervish up to date he and chapman and they capper purposely avoid any trace of the ecclesiastic in they attire they dress like drummer -- trousers carefully crease two watch-chain and a warm vest they manner be free and easy they attitude familiar the way they address the almighty reveal that they reverence for he spring out of the supposition that he be very much like themselves the indelicacy of the revivalist who recently call meeting to pray for fay mill be show in they ardent supplication to god that he should make mill to be like they fay mill tell of the best way to use this life here and now he do not prophesy what will become of you if you do not accept he belief neither do he promise everlasting life as a reward for think as he do he realize that he have not the agency of everlasting life fay mill be more interested in have a soul that be worth save than in save a soul that be not chapman talk about lose soul as he might about collar button lose under a bureau just as if god ever misplace anything or that all soul be not god 's soul and therefore forever in he keep doctor chapman want all man to act alike and believe alike not realize that progress be the result of individuality and so long as a man think whether he be right or wrong he be make head neither do he realize that wrong thinking be better than no thinking at all and that the only damnation consist in cease to think and accept the conclusion of another final truth and final conclusion be wholly unthinkable to sensible people in they sane moment but these revivalist wish to sum up truth for all time and put they leaden seal upon it in lo angele be a preacher by the name of mcintyre a type of the blatant bellarmine who exile galileo -- a man who never doubt he own infallibility who talk like a oracle and continually tell of perdition for all who disagree with he needless to say that mcintyre lack humor personally i prefer the mcgregor but in lo angele the mcintyre be popular it be mcintyre who call a meeting to pray for fay mill and in propose the meeting mcintyre make the unblushing announcement that he have never meet mill nor hear he speak nor have he read one of he book chapman and mcintyre represent the modern type of phariseeism -- spieler and spouter for churchianity and such be the man who make superstition of so long life superstition be the one infamy -- voltaire be right to pretend to believe a thing at which you reason revolt -- to stultify you intellect -- this if it exist at all be the unpardonable sin these mufti preach the blood of jesus the dogma that man without a belief in miracle be eternally lose that everlasting life depend upon acknowledge this that or the other self-reliance self-control and self-respect be the three thing that make a man a man but man have so recently take on this ability to think that he have not yet get use to handle it the tool be cumbrous in he hand he be afraid of it -- this one characteristic that differentiate he from the lower animal -- so he abdicate and turn he divine birthright over to a syndicate this combination call a church agree to take care of he doubt and fear and do he think for he and to help matter along he be assure that he be not fit to think for himself and to do so would be a sin man in he present crude state hold somewhat the same attitude toward reason that a apache indian hold toward a camera -- the indian think that to have he picture take means that he will shrivel up and blow away in a month and stanley relate that a watch with its constant ticking send the bravest of congo chief into a cold sweat of agonizing fear on discover which the explorer have but to draw he waterbury and threaten to turn the whole bunch into crocodile and at once they get busy and do he bidding stanley exhibit the true northfield-revival quality in banking on the superstition of he wavering and frightened follower the revival meetin ' be a orgie of the soul a spiritual debauch -- a drop from sane and sensible control into eroticism no person of normal intelligence can afford to throw the rein of reason on the neck of emotion and ride a tam o'shanter race to bedlam this hysteria of the uncurbed feeling be the only blasphemy and if there be a personal god he surely would be grieve to see that we have so absurd a idea of he as to imagine he would be please with we deport the divine gift of reason into the hell-box revivalism work up the voltage then make no use of the current -- the wire be ground let any one of these revivalist write out he sermon and print they in a book and no sane man could read they without danger of paresis the book would lack synthesis defy analysis puzzle the brain and paralyze the will there would not be enough attic salt in it to save it it would be the supernaculum of the commonplace and prove the author to be the lobscouse of literature the loblolly of letter the church want to enroll member and so desperate be the situation that they be willing to get they at the price of self-respect hence come Sunday Monday Tuesday and chapman and play svengalus to we trilby these gentleman use the method and the trick of the auctioneer -- the blandishments of the bookmaker -- the sleek smooth way of the professional spieler with this troupe of christian clown be one chaeffer who be a specialist with child he have meeting for boy and girl only where he play trick grimace tell story and get he little hearer laugh and thus have find a entrance into they heart he suddenly reverse the lever and have they cry he talk to these little innocent about sin the wrath of god the death of christ and offer they a choice between everlasting life and eternal death to the person who know and love child -- who have study the gentle way of froebel -- this excitement be vicious concrete cruelty weaken vitality follow close upon overwrought nerve and every excess have its penalty -- the pendulum swing as far this way as it do that these reverend gentleman bray it into the ear of innocent little child that they be bear in iniquity and in sin do they mother conceive they that the soul of all child over nine year -lrb- why nine -rrb- be lose and the only way they can hope for heaven be through a belief in a barbaric blood bamboozle that man of intelligence have long since discard and all this in the name of the gentle christ who take little child in he arm and say of such be the kingdom of heaven this pagan proposition of be bear in sin be pollution to the mind of a child and cause misery unrest and heartache incomputable a few year ago we be congratulating ourselves that the devil at last be dead and that the tear of pity have put out the fire of hell but the serpent of superstition be only slightly scotch not kill the intent of the religious revival be dual : first the claim be that conversion make man lead better life second it save they soul from endless death or everlasting hell to make man lead beautiful life be excellent but the reverend doctor chapman nor any of he colleague nor the denomination that they represent will for a instant admit that the fact of a man live a beautiful life will save he soul alive in fact doctor chapman doctor torrey and doctor Sunday back by the reverend doctor mcintyre repeatedly warn they hearer of the danger of a morality that be not accompany by a belief in the blood of jesus so the beautiful life they talk of be the bait that cover the hook for gudgeon you have to accept the superstition or you beautiful life to they be a byword and a hissing hence to they superstition and not conduct be the vital thing if such a belief be not fanaticism then have i read webster 's unabridged dictionary in vain belief in superstition make no man kinder gentler more useful to himself or society he can have all the virtue without the fetich and he may have the fetich and all the vice beside morality be really not control at all by religion -- if statistics of reform school and prison be to be believe fay mill accord to reverend doctor mcintyre have all the virtue -- he be forgiving kind gentle modest helpful but fay have abandon the fetich -- hence mcintyre and chapman call upon the public to pray for fay mill mill have the virtue when he believe in the fetich -- and now that he have disavow the fetich he still have the virtue and in a degree he never before have even those who oppose he admit this but still they declare that he be forever lose reverend doctor chaeffer say there be two kind of habit -- good and bad there be also two kind of religion good and bad the religion of kindness good cheer helpfulness and useful effort be good and on this point there be no dispute -- it be admit everywhere by every grade of intellect but any form of religion that incorporate a belief in miracle and other barbaric superstition as a necessity to salvation be not only bad but very bad and all man if leave alone long enough to think know that salvation depend upon redemption from a belief in miracle but the intent of doctor chapman and he theological rough rider be to stampede the herd and set it a milling to rope the maverick and place upon they the mcintyre brand be then quite easy as for the reaction and the clean up after the carnival we revivalist be not concern the confetti collapse balloon and peanut shuck be the net asset of the revival -- and these be leave for the local manager revival be for the revivalist and some fine morning these revival town will arise rub they sleepy eye and chapman will be but a bad taste in the mouth and Sunday chaeffer torrey biederwolf and company a troubled dream to preach hagiology to civilized people be a lapse that nemesis will not overlook america stand for the twentieth century and if in a moment of weakness she slip back to the exuberant folly of the frenzied piety of the sixteenth she must pay the penalty two thing man will have to do -- get free from the bondage of other man and second liberate himself from the phantom of he own mind on neither of these point do the revivalist help or aid in any way effervescence be not character and every debauch must be pay for in vitality and self-respect all formal organize religion through which the promoter and manager thrive be bad but some be worse than other the more superstition a religion have the worse it be usually religion be make up of morality and superstition pure superstition alone would be revolting -- in we day it would attract nobody -- so the idea be introduce that morality and religion be inseparable i be against the man who pretend to believe that ethic without a fetich be vain and useless the preacher who preach the beauty of truth honesty and a useful helpful life i be with head heart and hand the preacher who declare that there can be no such thing as a beautiful life unless it will accept superstition i be against tooth claw club tongue and pen down with the infamy i prophesy a day when business and education will be synonymous -- when commerce and college will join hand -- when the preparation for life will be to go to work as long as trade be trickery business barter commerce finesse government exploitation slaughter honorable and murder a fine art when religion be ignorant superstition piety the worship of a fetich and education a clutch for honor there be small hope for the race under these condition everything tend towards division dissipation disintegration separation -- darkness death but with the supremacy gain by science the introduction of the one-price system in business and the gradually grow conviction that honesty be man 's most valuable asset we behold light at the end of the tunnel it only remain now for the laity to drive conviction home upon the clergy and prove to they that pretence have its penalty and to bring to the mourner ' bench that trinity of offender somewhat ironically designate as the three learn profession and mankind will be well out upon the broad highway the tower dome of the ideal city in sight one-man power every successful concern be the result of a one-man power coöperation technically be a iridescent dream -- thing coöperate because the man make they he cement they by he will but find this man and get he confidence and he weary eye will look into yours and the cry of he heart shall echo in you ear o for some one to help I bear this burden then he will tell you of he endless search for ability and of he continual disappointment and thwarting in try to get some one to help himself by help he ability be the one cry need of the hour the bank be bulge with money and everywhere be man look for work the harvest be ripe but the ability to captain the unemployed and utilize the capital be lack -- sadly lack in every city there be many five - and ten-thousand-dollar-a-year position to be fill but the only applicant be man who want job at fifteen dollar a week you man of ability have a place already yes ability be a rare article but there be something that be much scarcer something finer far something rarer than this quality of ability it be the ability to recognize ability the sternest comment that ever can be make against employer as a class lie in the fact that man of ability usually succeed in show they worth in spite of they employer and not with he assistance and encouragement if you know the life of man of ability you know that they discover they power almost without exception thru chance or accident have the accident not occur that make the opportunity the man would have remain unknown and practically lose to the world the experience of tom potter telegraph operator at a obscure little way station be truth paint large that fearful night when most of the wire be down and a passenger train go through the bridge give tom potter the opportunity of discover himself he take charge of the dead care for the wound settle fifty claim -- draw draft on the company -- burn the last vestige of the wreck sink the waste iron in the river and repair the bridge before the arrival of the superintendent on the spot who give you the authority to do all this demand the superintendent nobody reply tom i assume the authority the next month tom potter 's salary be five thousand dollar a year and in three year he be make ten time this simply because he could get other man to do thing why wait for a accident to discover tom potter let we set trap for tom potter and lie in wait for he perhaps tom potter be just around the corner across the street in the next room or at we elbow myriad of embryonic tom potter await discovery and development if we but look for they i know a man who roam the wood and field for thirty year and never find a indian arrow one day he begin to think arrow and step out of he doorway he pick one up since then he have collect a bushel of they suppose we cease wail about incompetence sleepy indifference and slipshod help that watch the clock these thing exist -- let we dispose of the subject by admit it and then emphasize the fact that freckled farmer boy come out of the west and east and often go to the front and do thing in a masterly way there be one name that stand out in history like a beacon light after all these twenty-five hundred year have pass just because the man have the sublime genius of discover ability that man be pericles pericle make athen and to-day the very dust of the street of athen be be sift and search for relic and remnant of the thing make by people who be captain by man of ability who be discover by pericle there be very little competition in this line of discover ability we sit down and wail because ability do not come we way let we think ability and possibly we can jostle pericle there on he pedestal where he have stand for over a score of century -- the man with a supreme genius for recognize ability hail to thee pericle and hail to thee great unknown who shall be the first to successfully imitate this captain of man mental attitude success be in the blood there be man whom fate can never keep down -- they march forward in a jaunty manner and take by divine right the best of everything that the earth afford but they success be not attain by means of the samuel smiles-connecticut policy they do not lie in wait nor scheme nor fawn nor seek to adapt they sail to catch the breeze of popular favor still they be ever alert and alive to any good that may come they way and when it come they simply appropriate it and tarry not move steadily on good health whenever you go out of door draw the chin in carry the crown of the head high and fill the lung to the utmost drink in the sunshine greet you friend with a smile and put soul into every hand-clasp do not fear be misunderstand and never waste a moment think about you enemy try to fix firmly in you own mind what you would like to do and then without violence of direction you will move straight to the goal fear be the rock on which we split and hate the shoal on which many a barque be strand when we become fearful the judgment be as unreliable as the compass of a ship whose hold be full of iron ore when we hate we have unshipped the rudder and if ever we stop to meditate on what the gossip say we have allow a hawser to foul the screw keep you mind on the great and splendid thing you would like to do and then as the day go glide by you will find yourself unconsciously seize the opportunity that be require for the fulfillment of you desire just as the coral insect take from the run tide the element that it need picture in you mind the able earnest useful person you desire to be and the thought that you hold be hourly transform you into that particular individual you so admire thought be supreme and to think be often better than to do preserve a right mental attitude -- the attitude of courage frankness and good cheer darwin and spencer have tell we that this be the method of creation each animal have evolve the part it need and desire the horse be fleet because he wish to be the bird fly because it desire to the duck have a web foot because it want to swim all thing come through desire and every sincere prayer be answer we become like that on which we heart be fix many people know this but they do not know it thoroughly enough so that it shape they life we want friend so we scheme and chase ` cross lot after strong people and lie in wait for good folk -- or allege good folk -- hope to be able to attach ourselves to they the only way to secure friend be to be one and before you be fit for friendship you must be able to do without it that be to say you must have sufficient self-reliance to take care of yourself and then out of the surplus of you energy you can do for other the individual who crave friendship and yet desire a self-centered spirit more will never lack for friend if you would have friend cultivate solitude instead of society drink in the ozone bathe in the sunshine and out in the silent night under the star say to yourself again and yet again i be a part of all my eye behold and the feeling then will come to you that you be no mere interloper between earth and heaven but you be a necessary part of the whole no harm can come to you that do not come to all and if you shall go down it can only be amid a wreck of world like old job that which we fear will surely come upon we by a wrong mental attitude we have set in motion a train of event that end in disaster people who die in middle life from disease almost without exception be those who have be prepare for death the acute tragic condition be simply the result of a chronic state of mind -- a culmination of a series of event character be the result of two thing mental attitude and the way we spend we time it be what we think and what we do that make we what we be by lay hold on the force of the universe you be strong with they and when you realize this all else be easy for in you artery will course red corpuscle and in you heart the determine resolution be bear to do and to be carry you chin in and the crown of you head high we be god in the chrysali the outsider when i be a farmer lad i notice that whenever we buy a new cow and turn she into the pasture with the herd there be a general inclination on the part of the rest to make the new cow think she have land in the orthodox perdition they would hook she away from the salt chase she from the water and the long-horned one for several week would lose no opportunity to give she vigorous dig poke and prod with horse it be the same and i remember one particular little black mare that we boy use to transfer from one pasture to another just to see she back into a herd of horse and hear she hoof play a resounding solo on they rib as they gather round to do she mischief man be animal just as much as be cow horse and pig and they manifest similar proclivity the introduction of a new man into a institution always cause a small panic of resentment especially if he be a person of some power even in school and college the new teacher have to fight he way to overcome the opposition he be certain to meet in a lumber camp the newcomer would do well to take the initiative like that little black mare and meet the first black look with a short-arm jab but in a bank department store or railroad office this can not be so the next best thing be to endure and win out by a attention to business to which the place be unaccustomed in any event the bigger the man unless he have the absolute power to overawe everything the more uncomfortable will be he position until gradually time smooth the way and new issue come up for criticism opposition and resentment and he be forget the idea of civil service reform -- promotion for the good man in you employ rather than hire new one for the big place -- be a rule which look well on paper but be a fatal policy if carry out to the letter the business that be not progressive be sowing the seed of its own dissolution life be a movement forward and all thing in nature that be not evolve into something better be prepare to return into they constituent element one general rule for progress in big business concern be the introduction of new blood you must keep step with the business world if you lag behind the outlaw that hang on the flank of commerce will cut you out and take you captive just as the wolf lie in wait for the sick cow of the plain to keep you column march you must introduce new method new inspiration and seize upon the best that other have invent or discover the great railroad of america have evolve together no one of they have a appliance or a method that be much beyond the rest if it be not for this interchange of man and idea some railroad would still be use the link and pin and snake-head would be as common as in the year 1869 the railroad manager who know he business be ever on the lookout for excellence among he man and he promote those who give a undivided service but besides this he hire a strong man occasionally from the outside and promote he over everybody then out come the hammer but this make but little difference to you competent manager -- if a place be to be fill and he have no one on he payroll big enough to fill it he hire a outsider that be right and well for every one concern the new life of many a firm date from the day they hire a new man community that intermarry raise a fine crop of scrub and the result be the same in business venture two of america 's largest publish house fail for a tidy sum of five million or so each a few year ago just thru a dogged policy that extend over a period of fifty year of promote cousin uncle and aunt whose only claim of efficiency be that they have be on the pension roll for a long time this way lie dry-rot if you be a business man and have a position of responsibility to be fill look carefully among you old helper for a man to promote but if you have not a man big enough to fill the place do not put in a little one for the sake of peace go outside and find a man and hire he -- never mind the salary if he can man the position -- wages be always relative to earn power this will be the only way you can really man you ship as for civil service rule -- rule be make to be break and as for the long-horned one who will attempt to make life miserable for you new employe be patient with they it be the privilege of everybody to do a reasonable amount of kick especially if the person have be a long time with one concern and have receive many benefit but if at the last worst come to worst do not forget that you yourself be at the head of the concern if it fail you get the blame and should the anvil chorus become so persistent that there be danger of discord take the place of harmony stand by you new man even tho it be necessary to give the blue envelope to every antediluvian precedence in business be a matter of power and year in one position may mean that the man have be there so long that he need a change let the zephyr of natural law play freely thru you whisker so here be the argument : promote you deserving man but do not be afraid to hire a keen outsider he help everybody even the kicker for if you disintegrate and go down in defeat the kicker will have to skirmish around for new job anyway be not that so get out or get in line abraham lincoln 's letter to hooker if all the letter message and speech of lincoln be destroy except that one letter to hooker we still would have a excellent index to the heart of the rail-splitter in this letter we see that lincoln rule he own spirit and we also behold the fact that he could rule other the letter show wise diplomacy frankness kindliness wit tact and infinite patience hooker have harshly and unjustly criticise lincoln he commander in chief but lincoln waive all this in deference to the virtue he believe hooker possess and promote he to succeed burnside in other word the man who have be wrong promote the man who have wrong he over the head of a man whom the promotee have wrong and for whom the promoter have a warm personal friendship but all personal consideration be sink in view of the end desire yet it be necessary that the man promote should know the truth and lincoln tell it to he in a way that do not humiliate nor fire to foolish anger but which surely prevent the attack of cerebral elephantiasis to which hooker be liable perhaps we have better give the letter entire and so here it be : executive mansion washington January 26 1863 major-general hooker : general : -- i have place you at the head of the army of the potomac of course i have do this upon what appear to I to be sufficient reason and yet i think it best for you to know that there be some thing in regard to which i be not quite satisfied with you i believe you to be a brave and skilful soldier which of course i like i also believe you do not mix politics with you position in which you be right you have confidence in yourself which be a valuable if not a indispensable quality you be ambitious which within reasonable bound do good rather than harm but i think that during general burnside 's command of the army you have take counsel of you ambition and thwart he as much as you could in which you do a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer i have hear in such a way as to believe it of you recently say that both the army and the government need a dictator of course it be not for this but in spite of it that i have give you the command only those general who gain success can set up dictator what i now ask of you be military success and i will risk the dictatorship the government will support you to the utmost of its ability which be neither more nor less than it have do and will do for all commander i much fear that the spirit you have aid to infuse into the army of criticise they commander and withholding confidence from he will now turn upon you i shall assist you as far as i can to put it down neither you nor napoleon if he be alive again could get any good out of a army while such a spirit prevail in it and now beware of rashness but with sleepless vigilance go forward and give we victory yours very truly a lincoln one point in this letter be especially worth we consideration for it suggest a condition that spring up like deadly nightshade from a poisonous soil i refer to the habit of carp sneering grumbling and criticise those who be above we the man who be anybody and who do anything be certainly go to be criticise vilify and misunderstand this be a part of the penalty for greatness and every great man understand it and understand too that it be no proof of greatness the final proof of greatness lie in be able to endure contumely without resentment lincoln do not resent criticism he know that every life be its own excuse for be but look how he call hooker 's attention to the fact that the dissension hooker have sow be go to return and plague he neither you nor napoleon if he be alive could get any good out of a army while such a spirit prevail in it hooker 's fault fall on hooker -- other suffer but hooker suffer most of all not long ago i meet a yale student home on a vacation i be sure he do not represent the true yale spirit for he be full of criticism and bitterness toward the institution president hadley come in for he share and i be give item fact datum with time and place for a peach of a roast very soon i see the trouble be not with yale the trouble be with the young man he have mentally dwelt on some trivial slight until he have get so out of harmony with the place that he have lose the power to derive any benefit from it yale college be not a perfect institution -- a fact i suppose that president hadley and most yale man be quite willing to admit but yale do supply young man certain advantage and it depend upon the student whether they will avail themselves of these advantage or not if you be a student in college seize upon the good that be there you receive good by give it you gain by give -- so give sympathy and cheerful loyalty to the institution be proud of it stand by you teacher -- they be do the best they can if the place be faulty make it a better place by a example of cheerfully do you work every day the best you can mind you own business if the concern where you be employ be all wrong and the old man be a curmudgeon it may be well for you to go to the old man and confidentially quietly and kindly tell he that he policy be absurd and preposterous then show he how to reform he way and you might offer to take charge of the concern and cleanse it of its secret fault do this or if for any reason you should prefer not then take you choice of these : get out or get in line you have get to do one or the other -- now make you choice if you work for a man in heaven 's name work for he if he pay you wages that supply you you bread and butter work for he -- speak well of he think well of he stand by he and stand by the institution that he represent i think if i work for a man i would work for he i would not work for he a part of the time and the rest of the time work against he i would give a undivided service or none if put to the pinch a ounce of loyalty be worth a pound of cleverness if you must vilify condemn and eternally disparage why resign you position and then when you be outside damn to you heart 's content but i pray you as long as you be a part of a institution do not condemn it not that you will injure the institution -- not that -- but when you disparage a concern of which you be a part you disparage yourself more than that you be loosen the tendril that hold you to the institution and the first high wind that happen along you will be uproot and blow away in the blizzard 's track -- and probably you will never know why the letter only say time be dull and we regret there be not enough work et cetera everywhere you will find these out-of-a-job fellow talk with they and you will find that they be full of railing bitterness scorn and condemnation that be the trouble -- thru a spirit of fault-finding they get themselves swing around so they block the channel and have to be dynamite they be out of harmony with the place and no longer be a help they have to be remove every employer be constantly look for people who can help he naturally he be on the lookout among he employee for those who do not help and everything and everybody that be a hindrance have to go this be the law of trade -- do not find fault with it it be found on nature the reward be only for the man who help and in order to help you must have sympathy you can not help the old man so long as you be explain in a undertone and whisper by gesture and suggestion by thought and mental attitude that he be a curmudgeon and that he system be dead wrong you be not necessarily menacing he by stir up this cauldron of discontent and warm envy into strife but you be do this : you be get yourself on a well-greased chute that will give you a quick ride down and out when you say to other employee that the old man be a curmudgeon you reveal the fact that you be one and when you tell they that the policy of the institution be rotten you certainly show that yours be this bad habit of fault-finding criticising and complain be a tool that grow keener by constant use and there be grave danger that he who at first be only a moderate kicker may develop into a chronic knocker and the knife he have sharpen will sever he head hooker get he promotion even in spite of he many failing but the chance be that you employer do not have the love that lincoln have -- the love that suffereth long and be kind but even lincoln could not protect hooker forever hooker fail to do the work and lincoln have to try some one else so there come a time when hooker be supersede by a silent man who criticise no one rail at nobody -- not even the enemy and this silent man who could rule he own spirit take the city he mind he own business and do the work that no man can ever do unless he constantly give absolute loyalty perfect confidence unswerving fidelity and untiring devotion let we mind we own business and allow other to mind theirs thus work for self by work for the good of all the week-day keep it holy do it ever strike you that it be a most absurd and semi-barbaric thing to set one day apart as holy if you be a writer and a beautiful thought come to you you never hesitate because it be Sunday but you write it down if you be a painter and the picture appear before you vivid and clear you make haste to materialize it ere the vision fade if you be a musician you sing a song or play it on the piano that it may be etch upon you memory -- and for the joy of it but if you be a cabinet-maker you may make a design but you will have to halt before you make the table if the day happen to be the lord 's day and if you be a blacksmith you will not dare to lift a hammer for fear of conscience or the police all of which be a admission that we regard manual labor as a sort of necessary evil and must be do only at certain time and place the orthodox reason for abstinence from all manual labor on Sunday be that god make the heaven and the earth in six day and on the seventh he rest therefore man create in the image of he maker should hold this day sacred how it can be possible for a supreme omnipotent and all-powerful be without body part or passion to become wearied thru physical exertion be a question that be as yet unanswered the idea of serve god on Sunday and then forget he all the week be a fallacy that be foster by the reverend doctor sayle and he coadjutor deacon buffum who pass the panama for the benefit of those who would buy absolution or if you prefer salvation be free what we place in the panama be a honorarium for deity or he agent just as we note author never speak at banquet for pay but accept the honorarium that in some occult and mysterious manner be leave on the mantel Sunday with its immunity from work be devise for slave who get out of all the work they could during the week then to tickle the approbativeness of the slave it be declare a virtue not to work on Sunday a most please bit of tom sawyer diplomacy by follow he inclination and do nothing a mysterious skyey benefit accrue which the lazy man hope to have and to hold for eternity then the slave who do no work on Sunday point out those who do as beneath they in virtue and deserving of contempt upon this theory all law which punish the person who work or play on Sunday have be pass do god cease work one day in seven or be the work that he do on Sunday especially different from that which he perform on Tuesday the Saturday half-holiday be not sacred -- the Sunday holiday be and we have law to punish those who violate it no man can violate the sabbath he can however violate he own nature and this he be more apt to do through enforce idleness than either work or play only run water be pure and stagnant nature of any sort be dangerous -- a breeding-place for disease change of occupation be necessary to mental and physical health as it be most people get too much of one kind of work all the week they be chained to a task a repugnant task because the dose be too big they have to do this particular job or starve this be slavery quite as much as when man be buy and sell as a chattel will there not come a time when all man and woman will work because it be a bless gift -- a privilege then if all work wasteful consuming as a business would cease as it be there be many people who do not work at all and these pride themselves upon it and uphold the Sunday law if the idler would work nobody would be overwork if this time ever come shall we not cease to regard it as wicked to work at certain time just as much as we would count it absurd to pass a law make it illegal for we to be happy on Wednesday be not good work a effort to produce a useful necessary or beautiful thing if so good work be a prayer prompt by a loving heart -- a prayer to benefit and bless if prayer be not a desire back up by a right human effort to bring about its efficacy then what be it work be a service perform for ourselves and other if i love you i will surely work for you -- in this way i reveal my love and to manifest my love in this manner be a joy and gratification to I thus work be for the worker alone and labor be its own reward these thing be true if it be wrong to work on Sunday it be wrong to love on Sunday every smile be a sin every caress a curse and all tenderness a crime must there not come a time if we grow in mentality and spirit when we shall cease to differentiate and quit call some work secular and some sacred be not it as necessary for I to hoe corn and feed my loved one -lrb- and also the priest -rrb- as for the priest to preach and pray would any priest ever preach and pray if somebody do not hoe if life be from god then all useful effort be divine and to work be the highest form of religion if god make we surely he be pleased to see that he work be a success if we be miserable willing to liberate life with a bare bodkin we certainly do not compliment we maker in thus proclaim he work a failure but if we life be full of gladness and we be grateful for the feeling that we be one with deity -- help god to do he work then and only then do we truly serve he be not it strange that man should have make law declare that it be wicked for we to work exclusive friendship a excellent and gentle man of my acquaintance have say when fifty-one per cent of the voter believe in coöperation as oppose to competition the ideal commonwealth will cease to be a theory and become a fact that man should work together for the good of all be very beautiful and i believe the day will come when these thing will be but the simple process of fifty-one per cent of the voter cast ballot for socialism will not bring it about the matter of voting be simply the expression of a sentiment and after the ballot have be count there still remain the work to be do a man might vote right and act like a fool the rest of the year the socialist who be full of bitterness fight faction and jealousy be create a opposition that will hold he and all other like he in check and this opposition be well for even a very imperfect society be force to protect itself against dissolution and a condition which be worse to take over the monopoly and operate they for the good of society be not enough and not desirable either so long as the idea of rivalry be rife as long as self be uppermost in the mind of man they will fear and hate other man and under socialism there would be precisely the same scramble for place and power that we see in politics now society can never be reconstruct until its individual member be reconstruct man must be bear again when fifty-one per cent of the voter rule they own spirit and have put fifty-one per cent of they present envy jealousy bitterness hate fear and foolish pride out of they heart then christian socialism will be at hand and not until then the subject be entirely too big to dispose of in a paragraph so i be just go to content myself here with the mention of one thing that so far as i know have never be mention in print -- the danger to society of exclusive friendship between man and man and woman and woman no two person of the same sex can complement each other neither can they long uplift or benefit each other usually they deform the mental and spiritual estate we should have many acquaintance or none when two man begin to tell each other everything they be hike for senility there must be a bit of well-defined reserve we be tell that in matter -- solid steel for instance -- the molecule never touch they never surrender they individuality we be all molecule of divinity and we personality should not be abandon be yourself let no man be necessary to you -- you friend will think more of you if you keep he at a little distance friendship like credit be highest where it be not use i can understand how a strong man can have a great and abide affection for a thousand other man and call they all by name but how he can regard any one of these man much higher than another and preserve he mental balance i do not know let a man come close enough and he 'll clutch you like a drown person and down you both go in a close and exclusive friendship man partake of other ' weakness in shop and factory it happen constantly that man will have they chum these man relate to each other they trouble -- they keep nothing back -- they sympathize with each other they mutually condole they combine and stand by each other they friendship be exclusive and other see that it be jealousy creep in suspicion awaken hate crouch around the corner and these man combine in mutual dislike for certain thing and person they foment each other and they sympathy dilute sanity -- by recognize they trouble man make they real thing get out of focus and the sense of value be lose by think some one be a enemy you evolve he into one soon other be involve and we have a clique a clique be a friendship go to seed a clique develop into a faction and a faction into a feud and soon we have a mob which be a blind stupid insane crazy ramping and roar mass that have lose the rudder in a mob there be no individual -- all be of one mind and independent thought be go a feud be found on nothing -- it be a mistake -- a fool idea fan into flame by a fool friend and it may become a mob every man who have have anything to do with communal life have notice that the clique be the disintegrate bacillus -- and the clique have its rise always in the exclusive friendship of two person of the same sex who tell each other all unkind thing that be say of each other -- so be on you guard beware of the exclusive friendship respect all man and try to find the good in all to associate only with the sociable the witty the wise the brilliant be a blunder -- go among the plain the stupid the uneducated and exercise you own wit and wisdom you grow by give -- have no favorite -- you hold you friend as much by keep away from he as you do by follow after he revere he -- yes but be natural and let space intervene be a divine molecule be yourself and give you friend a chance to be himself thus do you benefit he and in benefit he you benefit yourself the finest friendship be between those who can do without each other of course there have be case of exclusive friendship that be point out to we as grand example of affection but they be so rare and exceptional that they serve to emphasize the fact that it be exceedingly unwise for man of ordinary power and intellect to exclude they fellow man a few man perhaps who be big enough to have a place in history could play the part of david to another 's jonathan and yet retain the good will of all but the most of we would engender bitterness and strife and this beautiful dream of socialism where each shall work for the good of all will never come about until fifty-one per cent of the adult shall abandon all exclusive friendship until that day arrive you will have clique denomination -- which be clique grown big -- faction feud and occasional mob do not lean on any one and let no one lean on you the ideal society will be make up of ideal individual be a man and be a friend to everybody when the master admonish he disciple to love they enemy he have in mind the truth that a exclusive love be a mistake -- love die when it be monopolize -- it grow by give love lim be a error you enemy be one who misunderstand you -- why should you not rise above the fog and see he error and respect he for the good quality you find in he the folly of living in the future the question be often ask what become of all the valedictorian and all the class-day poet i can give information as to two party for whom this inquiry be make -- the valedictorian of my class be now a most industrious and worthy floor-walker in siegel cooper & company 's store and i be the class-day poet both of we have we eye fix on the goal we stand on the threshold and look out upon the world preparatory to go forth seize it by the tail and snap its head off for we own delectation we have we eye fix on the goal -- it might better have be the gaol it be a very absurd thing for we to fix we eye on the goal it strain we vision and take we attention from we work we lose we grip on the present to think of the goal be to travel the distance over and over in you mind and dwell on how awfully far off it be we have so little mind -- do business on such a limited capital of intellect -- that to wear it threadbare look for a far-off thing be to get hopelessly strand in siegel cooper & company of course siegel cooper & company be all right too but the point be this -- it be not the goal a goodly dash of indifference be a requisite in the formulum for do a great work no one know what the goal be -- we be all sailing under sealed order do you work to-day do it the best you can and live one day at a time the man that do this be conserve he god-given energy and not spin it out into tenuous spider thread so fragile and filmy that unkind fate will probably brush it away to do you work well to-day be the certain preparation for something better to-morrow the past have go from we forever the future we can not reach the present alone be ours each day 's work be a preparation for the next day 's duty live in the present -- the day be here the time be now there be only one thing that be worth pray for -- that we may be in the line of evolution the spirit of man maybe i be all wrong about it yet i can not help believe that the spirit of man will live again in a better world than ours fenelon say : justice demand another life to make good the inequality of this astronomer prophesy the existence of star long before they can see they they know where they ought to be and train they telescope in that direction they wait know they shall find they materially no one can imagine anything more beautiful than this earth for the simple reason that we can not imagine anything we have not see we may make new combination but the whole be make up of part of thing with which we be familiar this great green earth out of which we have spring of which we be a part that support we body which must return to it to repay the loan be very very beautiful but the spirit of man be not fully at home here as we grow in soul and intellect we hear and hear again a voice which say : arise and get thee hence for this be not thy rest and the greater and nobler and more sublime the spirit the more constant be the discontent discontent may come from various cause so it will not do to assume that the discontented one be always the pure in heart but it be a fact that the wise and excellent have all know the meaning of world-weariness the more you study and appreciate this life the more sure you be that this be not all you pillow you head upon mother earth listen to she heart-throb and even as you spirit be fill with the love of she you gladness be half pain and there come to you a joy that hurt to look upon the most exalted form of beauty such as sunset at sea the come of a storm on the prairie or the sublime majesty of the mountain beget a sense of sadness a increase loneliness it be not enough to say that man encroach on man so that we be really deprive of we freedom that civilization be cause by a bacillus and that from a natural condition we have get into a hurly-burly where rivalry be rife -- all this may be true but beyond and outside of all this there be no physical environment in way of plenty which earth can supply that will give the tired soul peace they be the happiest who have the least and the fable of the stricken king and the shirtless beggar contain the germ of truth the wise hold all earthly tie very lightly -- they be strip for eternity world-weariness be only a desire for a better spiritual condition there be more to be write on this subject of world-pain -- to exhaust the theme would require a book and certain it be that i have no wish to say the final word on any topic the gentle reader have certain rights and among these be the privilege of sum up the case but the fact hold that world-pain be a form of desire all desire be just proper and right and they gratification be the means by which nature supply we that which we need desire not only cause we to seek that which we need but be a form of attraction by which the good be bring to we just as the amoebae create a swirl in the water that bring they food within reach every desire in nature have a fixed and definite purpose in the divine economy and every desire have its proper gratification if we desire the close friendship of a certain person it be because that person have certain soul-quality that we do not possess and which complement we own through desire do we come into possession of we own by submit to its beckoning we add cubit to we stature and we also give out to other we own attribute without become poorer for soul be not limit all nature be a symbol of spirit and so i be force to believe that somewhere there must be a proper gratification for this mysterious nostalgia of the soul the valhallum of the norseman the nirvana of the hindu the heaven of the christian be natural hope of being whose care and disappointment here be soften by belief that somewhere thor brahma or god give compensation the eternal unity require a condition where man and woman shall be permit to love and not to sorrow where the tyranny of thing hate shall not prevail nor that for which the heart yearn turn to ash at we touch art and religion while this seem true in the main i be not sure it will hold in every case please think it out for yourself and if i happen to be wrong why put I straight the proposition be this : the artist need no religion beyond he work that be to say art be religion to the man who think beautiful thought and express they for other the best he can religion be a emotional excitement whereby the devotee rise into a state of spiritual sublimity and for the moment be bath in a atmosphere of rest and peace and love all normal man and woman crave such period and bernard shaw say that we reach they through strong tea tobacco whiskey opium love art or religion i think bernard shaw a cynic but there be a glimmer of truth in he idea that make it worth repeat but beyond the natural religion which be a passion for oneness with the whole all formalize religion engraft the element of fear and teach the necessity of placate a supreme be we idea of a supreme be be suggest to we by the political government under which we live the situation be sum up by carlyle when he say that deity to the average british mind be simply a infinite george iv the thought of god as a terrible supreme tyrant first find form in a unlimited monarchy but as government have become more lenient so have the god until you get they down -lrb- or up -rrb- to a republic where god be only a president and we all approach he in familiar prayer on a absolute equality then soon for the first time we find man say i be god and you be god and we be all simply particle of he and this be where the president be do away with and the referendum come in but the absence of a supreme govern head imply simplicity honesty justice and sincerity wherever plotting scheming and doubtful method of life be employ a ruler be necessary and there too religion with its idea of placate god have a firm hold man whose life be doubtful feel the need of a strong government and a hot religion formal religion and sin go hand in hand formal religion and slavery go hand in hand formal religion and tyranny go hand in hand formal religion and ignorance go hand in hand and sin slavery tyranny and ignorance be one -- they be never separate formal religion be a scheme whereby man hope to make peace with he maker and a formal religion also tend to satisfy the sense of sublimity where the man have fail to find satisfaction in he work voltaire say when woman no longer find herself acceptable to man she turn to god when man be no longer acceptable to himself he go to church in order to keep this article from extend itself into a tome i purposely omit say a single thing about the protestant church as a useful social club and have just assume for argument 's sake that the church be really a religious institution a formal religion be only a cut ` cross lot -- a attempt to bring about the emotion and the sensation that come to a man by the practice of love virtue excellence and truth when you do a splendid piece of work and express you best there come to you as reward a exaltation of soul a sublimity of feeling that put you for the time be in touch with the infinite a formal religion bring this feeling without you do anything useful therefore it be unnatural formalize religion be the strongest where sin slavery tyranny and ignorance abound where man be free enlighten and at work they find all the gratification in they work that they soul demand -- they cease to hunt outside themselves for something to give they rest they be at peace with themselves at peace with man and with god but any man chained to a

for those who reveal a fine capacity to waste and consume those who would write they name high on society 's honor roll need not be either useful or intelligent -- they need only seem and this give to the disagreeable girl she opportunity in the paper box factory she would have to make good cluett coon & co ask for result the stage demand at least a modicum of intellect in addition to shape but society ask for nothing but pretense and the palm be award to palaver but do not if you please imagine that the disagreeable girl do not wield a influence that be the very point -- she influence be so far-reaching in its effect that george bernard shaw give cross-section of life in the form of drama can not write a play and leave she out she be always with we ubiquitous omniscient and omnipresent -- be the disagreeable girl she be a disappointment to she father a source of humiliation to she mother a pest to she brother and sister and when she finally marry she slowly sap the inspiration of she husband and very often convert a proud and ambitious man into a weak and cowardly cur only in society do the disagreeable girl shine -- everywhere else she be a abject failure the much-vaunted

than the artist turner could paint a picture and leave man out or paul veronese produce a canvas and omit the dog the disagreeable girl be a female of the genus homo persuasion build around a digestive apparatus that possess marked marshmallow proclivity she be pretty pug-nosed pink pert and poetical and at first glance to the unwary she show sign of gentleness and intelligence she age be anywhere from eighteen to twenty-eight at twenty-eight she begin to evolve into something else and she capacity for harm be largely curtail because by this time spirit have write itself in she form and feature and the grossness and animality which before be veil be become apparent habit write itself on the face and body be a automatic recording machine to have a beautiful old age you must live a beautiful youth for we ourselves be posterity and every man be he own ancestor i be to-day what i be because i be yesterday what i be the disagreeable girl be always pretty at least we have be tell she be pretty and she fully accept the dictum she have also be tell she be clever and she think she be the actual fact be she be only sassy the fine flare up of youth have tend to set sex rampant but

care she be gross coarse and sensual in every feature of she life she eat too much do not exercise enough and consider it amusing to let other people wait on she and do for she the thing she should do for herself she room be a jumble of disorder the one gleam of hope for she lie in the fact that out of shame she allow no visitor to enter she apartment if she can help it concrete selfishness be she chief mark she will avoid responsibility side-step every duty that call for honest effort be untruthful secretive indolent and dishonest what be you eat ask nora hebler 's husband as she enter the room not expect to see he nothing be the answer and she hide the box of bonbon behind she and soon back out of the room i think mr hebler have no business to ask she what she be eat -- no man should

woman and man be never really far apart anyway and woman be largely what man have make they we be all just get rid of we shackle listen closely anywhere even among honest and intellectual people if such there be and you can detect the rattle of chain the disagreeable girl 's mind and soul have not keep pace with she body yesterday she be a slave sell in a circassian mart and freedom to she be so new and strange that she be unfamiliar with she environment and she do not know what to do with it the tragedy she work accord to george bernard shaw be through the fact that very often good man blind by the glamour of sex imagine they love the disagreeable girl when what they love be they own ideal -- a image bear in they own mind nature be both a trickster and a humorist and ever set the will of the species beyond the discernment of the individual the picador have to blindfold he horse in order to get he into the bull-ring and likewise dan cupid do the myopic to a purpose for aught we know the lovely beatrice of dante be only a disagreeable girl clothe in a poet 's fancy and idealized by a dreamer fortunate be dante that he worship she afar that he never know she well enough to be undeceived and so walk through life in love with love sensitive saintly sweetly sad and most divinely happy in he melancholy the neutral there be know to I a prominent business house that by the very force of its directness and worth have incur the enmity of many rival in fact there be a very general conspiracy on hand to put the institution down and out in talk with a young man employ by this house he yawn and say oh in this quarrel i be neutral but you get you bread and butter from this firm and in a matter where the very life of the institution be concerned i do not see how you can be a neutral and he change the subject i think that if i enlist in the japanese army i would not be a neutral business be a fight -- a continual struggle -- just as life be man have reach he present degree of development through struggle struggle there must be and always will be the struggle begin as purely physical as man evolve it shift ground to the mental psychic and the spiritual with a few dash of cave-man proclivity still leave but depend upon it the struggle will always be -- life be activity and when it get to be a struggle in well-doing it will still be a struggle when inertia get the better of you it be time to telephone to the undertaker the only real neutral in this game of life be a dead one eternal vigilance be not only the price of liberty but of every other good thing a business that be not safeguard on every side by active alert attentive vigilant man be go as oxygen be the disintegrate principle of life work night and day to dissolve separate pull apart and dissipate so there be something in business that continually tend to scatter destroy and shift possession from this man to that a million mouse nibble eternally at every business venture the mouse be not neutral and if enough employe in a business house be neutral the whole concern will eventually come tumble about they ear i like that order of field-marshal oyama : give every honorable neutral that you find in we line the honorable jiu-jitsu hikerino reflection on progress renan have say that truth be always reject when it come to a man for the first time its evolution be as follow : first we say the thing be rank heresy and contrary to the bible second we say the matter really amount to nothing anyway third we declare that we always believe it two hundred year ago partnership in business be very rare a man in business simply make thing and sell they -- and all the manufacturing be do by himself and he immediate family soon we find instance of brother continue the work the father have begin as in the case of the elzevir and the plantin the great bookmaker of holland to meet this competition four printer in 1640 form a partnership and pool they effort a local writer by the name of van krugen denounce these four man and make savage attack on partnership in general as wicked and illegal and oppose to the best interest of the people this view seem to have be quite general for there be a law in amsterdam forbid all partnership in business that be not license by the state the legislature of the state of missourus have recently make war on the department store in the same way use the ancient van krugen argument as a reason for there be no copyright on stupidity in london in the seventeenth century man who be find guilty of pool they effort and divide profit be convict by law and punish for contumacy contravention and connivance and be give a taste of the stock in the public square when corporation be form for the first time only a few year ago there be a fine burst of disapproval the corporation be declare a scheme of oppression a hungry octopus a grinder of the individual and to prove the case various instance of hardship be cite and no doubt there be much suffering for many people be never able to adjust themselves to new condition without experience pain and regret but we now believe that corporation come because they be require certain thing the time demand and no one man or two or three man could perform these task alone -- hence the corporation the rise of england as a manufacturing nation begin with the plan of the stock company the aggregation know as the joint-stock company everybody be willing now to admit be absolutely necessary in order to secure the machinery that be to say the tool the raw stock the building and to provide for the permanence of the venture the railroad system of america have build up this country -- on this thing of joint-stock company and transportation we prosperity have hinge commerce consist in carry thing from where they be plentiful to where they be need say emerson there be ten combination of capital in this country that control over six thousand mile of railroad each these company have take in a large number of small line and many connect line of track have be build competition over vast section of country have be practically obliterate and this have be do so quietly that few people be aware of the change only one general result of this consolidation of management have be feel and that it be better service at less expense no captain of any great industrial enterprise dare now to say the public be damned even if he ever say it -- which i much doubt the pathway to success lie in serve the public not in affront it in no other way be success possible and this truth be so plain and patent that even very simple folk be able to recognize it you can only help yourself by help other thirty year ago when p t barnum say the public delight in be humbug he know that it be not true for he never attempt to put the axiom in practice he amuse the public by tell it a lie but p t barnum never try anything so risky as deception even when he lie we be not deceive truth can be state by indirection when my love tell I she be make of truth i do believe she though i know she lie barnum always give more than he advertise and go over and over the same territory he continue to amuse and instruct the public for nearly forty year this tendency to coöperate be see in such splendid feature as the saint loui union station for instance where just twenty great railroad company lay aside envy prejudice rivalry and whim and use one terminal if competition be really the life of trade each railroad that enter saint loui would have a station of its own and the public would be put to the worry trouble expense and endless delay of find where it want to go and how to get there as it be now the entire aim and end of the scheme be to reduce friction worry and expense and give the public the greatest accommodation -- the best possible service -- to make travel easy and life secure servant in uniform meet you as you alight and answer you every question -- speed you courteously and kindly on you way there be woman to take care of woman and nurse to take care of child and wheel chair for such as may be infirm or lame the intent be to serve -- not to pull you this way and that and sell you a ticket over a certain road you be free to choose you route and you be free to utilize as you own this great institution that cost a million dollar and that require the presence of two hundred people to maintain all be for you it be for the public and be only make possible by a oneness of aim and desire -- that be to say coöperation before coöperation come in any line there be always competition push to a point that threaten destruction and promise chaos then to divert ruin man devise a better way a plan that conserve and economize and behold it be find in coöperation civilization be a evolution civilization be not a thing separate and apart any more than art be art be the beautiful way of do thing civilization be the expeditious way of do thing and as haste be often waste -- the more hurry the less speed -- civilization be the best way of do thing as mankind multiply in number the problem of supply people what they need be the important question of earth and mankind have ever hold out offer of reward in fame and money -- both be form of power -- to those who would supply it better thing teacher be those who educate the people to appreciate the thing they need the man who study mankind and find out what man really want and then supply they this whether it be a idea or a thing be the man who be crown with the laurel wreath of honor and clothe with riches what people need and what they want may be very different to undertake to supply people a thing you think they need but which they do not want be to have you head elevate on a pike and you bone bury in potter 's field but wait and the world will yet want the thing that it need and you bone will then become sacred relic this change in desire on the part of mankind be the result of the growth of intellect it be progress and progress be evolution and evolution be progress there be man who be continually try to push progress along : we call these individual reformer then there be other who always oppose the reformer -- the mildest name we have for they be conservative the reformer be either a savior or a rebel all depend on whether he succeed or fail and you point of view he be what he be regardless of what other man think of he the man who be indict and execute as a rebel often afterward have the word savior carve on he tomb and sometimes man who be hail as savior in they day be afterward find to be sham savior -- to wit charlatan conservation be a plan of nature to keep the good be to conserve a conservative be a man who put on the brake when he think progress be go to land civilization in the ditch and wreck the whole concern brakeman be necessary but in the language of koheleth there be a time to apply the brake and there be a time to abstain from apply the brake to clog the wheel continually be to stand still and to stand still be to retreat progress have need of the brakeman but the brakeman should not occupy all of he time put on the brake the conservative be just as necessary as the radical the conservative keep the reformer from go too fast and pluck the fruit before it be ripe government be only good where there be strong opposition just as the planet be hold in place by the opposition of force and so civilization go forward by stop and start -- push by the reformer and hold back by the conservative one be necessary to the other and they often shift place but forward and forward civilization forever go -- ascertain the best way of do thing in commerce we have have the individual worker the partnership the corporation and now we have the trust the trust be simply corporation form a partnership the thing be all a evolution -- a move forward it be all for man and it be all do by man it be all do with the consent aye and approval of man the trust be make by the people and the people can and will unmake they should they ever prove a engine of oppression they exist only during good behavior and like man they be live under a sentence of death with a indefinite reprieve the trust be good thing because they be economizer of energy they cut off waste increase the production and make a panic practically impossible the trust be here in spite of the man who think they originate they and in spite of the reformer who turn conservative and oppose they the next move of evolution will be the age of socialism socialism mean the operation of all industry by the people and for the people socialism be coöperation instead of competition competition have be so general that economist mistake it for a law of nature when it be only a incident competition be no more a law of nature than be hate hate be once so thoroughly believe in that we give it personality and call it the devil we have banish the devil by educate people to know that he who work have no time to hate and no need to fear and by this same means education will the people be prepare for the age of socialism the trust be now get thing ready for socialism socialism be a trust of trust humanity be grow in intellect in patience in kindness -- in love and when the time be ripe the people will step in and take peaceful possession of they own and the coöperative commonwealth will give to each one he due sympathy knowledge and poise sympathy knowledge and poise seem to be the three ingredient that be most need in form the gentle man i place these element accord to they value no man be great who do not have sympathy plus and the greatness of man can be safely gauge by they sympathy sympathy and imagination be twin sister you heart must go out to all man the high the low the rich the poor the learn the unlearned the good the bad the wise and the foolish -- it be necessary to be one with they all else you can never comprehend they sympathy -- it be the touchstone to every secret the key to all knowledge the open sesame of all heart put yourself in the other man 's place and then you will know why he think certain thing and do certain deed put yourself in he place and you blame will dissolve itself into pity and you tear will wipe out the record of he misdeed the savior of the world have simply be man with wondrous sympathy but knowledge must go with sympathy else the emotion will become maudlin and pity may be waste on a poodle instead of a child on a field-mouse instead of a human soul knowledge in use be wisdom and wisdom imply a sense of value -- you know a big thing from a little one a valuable fact from a trivial one tragedy and comedy be simply question of value : a little misfit in life make we laugh a great one be tragedy and cause for expression of grief poise be the strength of body and strength of mind to control you sympathy and you knowledge unless you control you emotion they run over and you stand in the mire sympathy must not run riot or it be valueless and token weakness instead of strength in every hospital for nervous disorder be to be find many instance of this loss of control the individual have sympathy but not poise and therefore he life be worthless to himself and to the world he symbol inefficiency and not helpfulness poise reveal itself more in voice than it do in word more in think than in action more in atmosphere than in conscious life it be a spiritual quality and be feel more than it be see it be not a matter of bodily size nor of bodily attitude nor attire nor of personal comeliness : it be a state of inward be and of know you cause be just and so you see it be a great and profound subject after all great in its ramification limitless in extent imply the entire science of right living i once meet a man who be deform in body and little more than a dwarf but who have such spiritual gravity -- such poise -- that to enter a room where he be be to feel he presence and acknowledge he superiority to allow sympathy to waste itself on unworthy object be to deplete one 's life force to conserve be the part of wisdom and reserve be a necessary element in all good literature as well as in everything else poise be the control of we sympathy and knowledge it imply a possession of these attribute for without have sympathy and knowledge you have nothing to control but you physical body to practice poise as a mere gymnastic exercise or study in etiquette be to be self-conscious stiff preposterous and ridiculous those who cut such fantastic trick before high heaven as make angel weep be man void of sympathy and knowledge try to cultivate poise they science be a mere matter of what to do with arm and leg poise be a question of spirit control flesh heart control attitude get knowledge by come close to nature that man be the greatest who best serve he kind sympathy and knowledge be for use -- you acquire that you may give out you accumulate that you may bestow and as god have give unto you the sublime blessing of sympathy and knowledge there will come to you the wish to reveal you gratitude by give they out again for the wise man be aware that we retain spiritual quality only as we give they away let you light shine to he that have shall be give the exercise of wisdom bring wisdom and at the last the infinitesimal quantity of man 's knowledge compare with the infinite and the smallness of man 's sympathy when compare with the source from which ours be absorb will evolve a abnegation and a humility that will lend a perfect poise the gentleman be a man with perfect sympathy knowledge and poise love and faith no woman be worthy to be a wife who on the day of she marriage be not lose absolutely and entirely in a atmosphere of love and perfect trust the supreme sacredness of the relation be the only thing which at the time should possess she soul be she a bawd that she should bargain woman should not obey man anymore than man should obey woman there be six requisite in every happy marriage the first be faith and the remain five be confidence nothing so compliment a man as for a woman to believe in he -- nothing so please a woman as for a man to place confidence in she obey god help I yes if i love a woman my whole heart 's desire would be to obey she slightest wish and how could i love she unless i have perfect confidence that she would only aspire to what be beautiful true and right and to enable she to realize this ideal she wish would be to I a sacred command and she attitude of mind toward I i know would be the same and the only rivalry between we would be as to who could love the most and the desire to obey would be the one control impulse of we life we gain freedom by give it and he who bestow faith get it back with interest to bargain and stipulate in love be to lose the woman who stop the marriage ceremony and request the minister to omit the word obey be sowing the first seed of doubt and distrust that later may come to fruition in the divorce court the haggle and bickering of settlement and dowry that usually precede the marriage of blood and dollar be the unheeded warning that misery heartache suffering and disgrace await the principal perfect faith imply perfect love and perfect love casteth out fear it be always the fear of imposition and a lurk intent to rule that cause the woman to haggle over a word -- it be absence of love a limitation a incapacity the price of a perfect love be a absolute and complete surrender keep back part of the price and yours will be the fate of anania and sapphira you doom be swift and sure to win all we must give all give something for nothing to give a man something for nothing tend to make the individual dissatisfied with himself you enemy be the one you have help and when a individual be dissatisfy with himself he be dissatisfy with the whole world -- and with you a man 's quarrel with the world be only a quarrel with himself but so strong be this inclination to lay blame elsewhere and take credit to ourselves that when we be unhappy we say it be the fault of this woman or that man especially do woman attribute they misery to that man and often the trouble be he have give she too much for nothing this truth be a reversible back-action one well lubricate by use work both way -- as the case may be nobody but a beggar have really definite idea concern he rights people who give much -- who love much -- do not haggle that form of affection which drive sharp bargain and make demand get a check on the bank in which there be no balance there be nothing so costly as something you get for nothing my friend tom lowry magnate in ordinary of minneapoli and the east side of wall street have recently have a little experience that prove my point a sturdy beggar-man a specimen of decayed gentility once call on tamma with a hard-luck story and a family bible and ask for a small loan on the good book to be compel to soak the family bible would surely melt the heart of gneiss tom be melt tom make the loan but refuse the collateral state he have no use for it which be god 's truth for once in a few week the man come back and try to tell tom he hard-luck story concern the cold ingratitude of a cruel world tom say spare I the slow music and the recital -- i have trouble of my own i need mirth and good cheer -- take this dollar and peace be with you peace be multiply unto thee say the beggar and depart the next month the man return and begin to tell tom a tale of cruelty injustice and ingratitude tom be rile -- he have he magnate business to attend to and he make a remark in italics the beggar say mr lowry if you have you business a little better systematize i would not have to trouble you personally -- why do not you just speak to you cashier and the great man who once take a party of friend out for a tally-ho ride and through mental habit collect five cent from each guest be so pleased at the thought of relief that he press the buzzer the cashier come and tom say put this man grabheimer on you pay-roll give he two dollar now and the same the first of every month then turn to the beggar-man tom say now get out of here -- hurry vamose hike -- and be damned to you the same to you and many of they say he effluvium politely and withdraw all this happen two year ago the beggar get he money regularly for a year and then in auditing account tom find the name on the pay-roll and as tom could not remember how the name get there he at first think the pay-roll be be stuff anyway he order the beggar 's name stricken off the roster and the elevator man be instruct to enforce the edict against beggar not be allow to see he man the beggar write he letter -- denunciatory scandalous abusive threatening finally the beggar lay the matter before a obese limb o ' the law jagger of the firm of jaggers & jaggers who take the case on a contingent fee the case come to trial and jagger prove he case se offendendo -- argal : it be show by the defendant 's book that he bacterium have be on the pay-roll and he name have be stricken off without suggestion request cause reason or fault of he own he crabship prove the contract and tom get it in the mazzard judgment for plaintiff with cost the beggar get the money and minneapoli tom get the experience tom say the man would lose the money but he himself have get the part that will be he for ninety-nine year surely the spirit of justice do not sleep and there be a beneficent and wise providence that watch over magnate work and waste these truth i hold to be self-evident : that man be make to be happy that happiness be only attainable through useful effort that the very best way to help ourselves be to help other and often the best way to help other be to mind we own business that useful effort mean the proper exercise of all we faculty that we grow only through exercise that education should continue through life and the joy of mental endeavor should be especially the solace of the old that where man alternate work play and study in right proportion the organ of the mind be the last to fail and death for such have no terror that the possession of wealth can never make a man exempt from useful manual labor that if all would work a little no one would then be overwork that if no one waste all would have enough that if none be overf none would be underfed that the rich and educate need education quite as much as the poor and illiterate that the presence of a serve class be a indictment and a disgrace to we civilization that the disadvantage of have a serve class fall most upon those who be serve and not upon those who serve -- just as the real curse of slavery fall upon the slave-owner that people who be wait on by a serve class can not have a right consideration for the rights of other and they waste both time and substance both of which be lose forever and can only seemingly be make good by additional human effort that the person who live on the labor of other not give himself in return to the best of he ability be really a consumer of human life and therefore must be consider no better than a cannibal that each one living naturally will do the thing he can do best but that in useful service there be no high nor low that to set apart one day in seven as holy be really absurd and serve only to loosen we grasp on the tangible present that all duty office and thing which be useful and necessary to humanity be sacred and that nothing else be or can be sacred the law of obedience the very first item in the creed of common sense be _ obedience _ perform you work with a whole heart revolt may be sometimes necessary but the man who try to mix revolt and obedience be doom to disappoint himself and everybody with whom he have dealings to flavor work with protest be to fail absolutely when you revolt why revolt -- climb hike get out defy -- tell everybody and everything to go to hade that dispose of the case you thus separate yourself entirely from those you have serve -- no one misunderstand you -- you have declare yourself the man who quit in disgust when order to perform a task which he consider menial or unjust may be a pretty good fellow but in the wrong environment but the malcontent who take you order with a smile and then secretly disobey be a dangerous proposition to pretend to obey and yet carry in you heart the spirit of revolt be to do half-hearted slipshod work if revolt and obedience be equal in power you engine will then stop on the center and you benefit no one not even yourself the spirit of obedience be the control impulse that dominate the receptive mind and the hospitable heart there be boat that mind the helm and there be boat that do not those that do not get hole knock in they sooner or later to keep off the rock obey the rudder obedience be not to slavishly obey this man or that but it be that cheerful mental state which respond to the necessity of the case and do the thing without any back talk -- unuttered or express obedience to the institution -- loyalty the man who have not learn to obey have trouble ahead of he every step of the way the world have it in for he continually because he have it in for the world the man who do not know how to receive order be not fit to issue they to other but the individual who know how to execute the order give he be prepare the way to issue order and better still -- to have they obey society 's savior all adown the age society have make the mistake of nail its savior to the cross between thief that be to say society have recognize in the savior a very dangerous quality -- something about he akin to a thief and he career have be suddenly cut short we have telephone and trolly car yet we have not travel far into the realm of spirit and we x-ray have give we no insight into the heart of thing society be so dull and dense so lack in spiritual vision so dumb and so beast-like that it do not know the difference between a thief and the only begotten son in a frantic effort to forget its hollowness it take to ping-pong parchesus and progressive euchre and seek to lose itself and find solace and consolation in tiddle-dy-wink we be tell in glare head-line and accurate photographic reproduction of a conference hold by leader in society to settle a matter of grave import be it to build technical school and provide a means for practical and useful education be it a plan of building modern tenement house along scientific and sanitary line be it call to provide fund for scientific research of various kind that would add to human knowledge and prove a benefit to mankind no it be none of these this body meet to determine whether the crook in a certain bulldog 's tail be natural or have be produce artificially should the savior come to-day and preach the same gospel that he teach before society would see that he experience be repeat now and then it blink stupidly and cry away with he or it stop its game long enough to pass gall and vinegar on a spear to one it have thrust beyond the pale for the woman who have love much society have but one verdict : crucify she the best and the worst be hang on one tree in the abandon of a great love there exist a godlike quality which place a woman very close to the holy of holy yet such a one not have comply with the edict of society be thrust unceremoniously forth and society pilate-like wash its hand in innocency prepare for old age socrate be once ask by a pupil this question : what kind of people shall we be when we reach elysium and the answer be this : we shall be the same kind of people that we be here if there be a life after this we be prepare for it now just as i be to-day prepare for my life to-morrow what kind of a man shall i be to-morrow oh about the same kind of a man that i be now the kind of a man that i shall be next month depend upon the kind of a man that i have be this month if i be miserable to-day it be not within the round of probability that i shall be supremely happy to-morrow heaven be a habit and if we be go to heaven we would better be get use to it life be a preparation for the future and the best preparation for the future be to live as if there be none we be prepare all the time for old age the two thing that make old age beautiful be resignation and a just consideration for the rights of other in the play of _ ivan the terrible _ the interest center around one man the czar ivan if anybody but richard mansfield play the part there would be nothing in it we simply get a glimpse into the life of a tyrant who have run the full gamut of goosedom grumpiness selfishness and grouch incidentally this man have the power to put other man to death and this he do and have do as he whim and temper might dictate he have be vindictive cruel quarrelsome tyrannical and terrible now that he feel the approach of death he would make he peace with god but he have delay that matter too long he do not realize in youth and middle life that he be then prepare for old age man be the result of cause and effect and the cause be to a degree in we hand life be a fluid and well have it be call the stream of life -- we be go flow somewhere strip _ ivan _ of he robe and crown and he might be a old farmer and live in ebenezer every town and village have its ivan to be a ivan just turn you temper loose and practice cruelty on any person or thing within you reach and the result will be a sure preparation for a querulous quarrelsome pickety snipity fussy and foolish old age accent with many outburst of wrath that be terrible in they futility and ineffectiveness babyhood have no monopoly on the tantrum the character of _ king lear _ and _ ivan the terrible _ have much in common one might almost believe that the writer of _ ivan _ have feel the incompleteness of _ lear _ and have see the absurdity of make a melodramatic bid for sympathy in behalf of this old man thrust out by he daughter lear the troublesome lear to whose limber tongue there be constantly leap word unprintable and name of tar deserve no soft pity at we hand all he life he have be train he three daughter for exactly the treatment he be to receive all he life lear have be lubricate the chute that be to give he a quick ride out into that black midnight storm oh how sharper than a serpent 's tooth it be to have a thankless child he cry there be something quite as bad as a thankless child and that be a thankless parent -- a irate irascible parent who possess a underground vocabulary and a disposition to use it the false note in _ lear _ lie in give to he a daughter like _ cordelium _ tolstoy and mansfield ring true and _ ivan the terrible _ be what he be without apology excuse or explanation take it or leave it -- if you do not like play of this kind go to see vaudeville mansfield 's _ ivan _ be terrible the czar be not old in year -- not over seventy -- but you can see that death be sniff close upon he track _ ivan _ have lose the power of repose he can not listen weigh and decide -- he have no thought or consideration for any man or thing -- this be he habit of life he bony hand be never still -- the finger open and shut and pick at thing eternally he fumble the cross on he breast adjust he jewel scratch he cosmos play the devil 's tattoo get up nervously and look behind the throne hold he breath to listen when people address he he damn they savagely if they kneel and if they stand upright he accuse they of lack of respect he ask that he be relieve from the care of state and then tremble for fear he people will take he at he word when ask to remain ruler of russium he proceed to curse he councilor and accuse they of load he with burden that they themselves would not endeavor to bear he be a victim of amor senilis and right here if mansfield take one step more he realism would be appalling but he stop in time and suggest what he dare not express this totter doddering slobbering sniffle old man be in love -- he be about to wed a young beautiful girl he select jewel for she -- he make remark about what would become she beauty jeer and laugh in crack falsetto in the animality of youth there be something pleasing -- it be natural -- but the vice of a old man when they have become only mental be most revolting the people about _ ivan _ be in mortal terror of he for he be still the absolute monarch -- he have the power to promote or disgrace to take they life or let they go free they laugh when he laugh cry when he do and watch he fleeting mood with thump heart he be intensely religious and affect the robe and cowl of a priest around he neck hang the crucifix he fear be that he will die with no opportunity of confession and absolution he pray to high heaven every moment kiss the cross and he toothless old mouth interject prayer to god and curse on man in the same breath if any one be talk to he he look the other way slip down until he shoulder occupy the throne scratch he leg and keep up a run comment of insult -- aye oh of course certainly ugh listen to he now there be a comedy side to all this which relieve the tragedy and keep the play from become disgusting glimpse of _ ivan 's _ past be give in he jerky confession -- he be the most miserable and unhappy of man and you behold that he be reap as he have sow all he life he have be prepare for this each day have be a preparation for the next _ ivan _ die in a fit of wrath hurl curse on he family and court -- die in a fit of wrath into which he have be purposely taunt by a man who know that the outburst be certain to kill the weakened monarch where do _ ivan the terrible _ go when death close he eye i know not but this i believe : no confessional can absolve he -- no priest benefit he -- no god forgive he he have damned himself and he begin the work in youth he be get ready all he life for this old age and this old age be get ready for the fifth act the playwright do not say so mansfield do not say so but this be the lesson : hate be a poison -- wrath be a toxin -- sensuality lead to death -- clutch selfishness be a lighting of the fire of hell it be all a preparation -- cause and effect if you be ever absolved you must absolve yourself for no one else can and the sooner you begin the better we often hear of the beauty of old age but the only old age that be beautiful be the one the man have long be prepare for by live a beautiful life every one of we be right now prepare for old age there may be a substitute somewhere in the world for good nature but i do not know where it can be find the secret of salvation be this : keep sweet a alliance with nature my father be a doctor who have practice medicine for sixty-five year and be still practise i be a doctor myself i be fifty year old my father be eighty-five we live in the same house and daily we ride horseback together or tramp thru the field and wood to-day we do we little jaunt of five mile and back ` cross country i have never be ill a day -- never consult a physician in a professional way and in fact never miss a meal through inability to eat as for the author of the author of _ a message to garcia _ he hold esoterically to the idea that the hot pedaluvium and small dose of hop tea will cure most ailment that be curable and so far all of he own ail have be curable -- a point he can prove the value of the pedaluvium lie in the fact that it tend to equalize circulation not to mention the little matter of sanitation and the efficacy of the hop lie largely in the fact that they be bitter and disagreeable to take both of these prescription give the patient the soothing thought that something be be do for he and at the very worst can never do he serious harm my father and i be not fully agree on all of life 's theme so existence for we never resolve itself into a dull neutral gray he be a baptist and i be a vegetarian occasionally he refer to I as callow and we have daily resort to logic to prove prejudice and history be search to bolster the preconceived but on the follow important point we stand together solid as one man : first ninety-nine people out of a hundred who go to a physician have no organic disease but be merely suffer from some symptom of they own indiscretion second individual who have disease nine time out of ten be suffer only from the accumulate evil effect of medication third hence we get the proposition : most disease be the result of medication which have be prescribe to relieve and take away a beneficent and warn symptom on the part of wise nature most of the work of doctor in the past have be to prescribe for symptom the difference between actual disease and a symptom be something that the average man do not even yet know and the curious part be that on these point all physician among themselves be fully agree what i say here be merely truism triteness and commonplace last week in talk with a eminent surgeon in buffalo he say i have perform over a thousand operation of laparotomy and my record show that in every instance excepting in case of accident the individual be give to what you call the ` beecham habit ' the people you see wait in the lobby of doctor ' office be in a vast majority of case suffer thru poisoning cause by a excess of food couple with this go the bad result of imperfect breathing irregular sleep lack of exercise and improper use of stimulant or hold the thought of fear jealousy and hate all of these thing or any one of they will in very many person cause fever chill cold foot congestion and faulty elimination to administer drug to a man suffering from malnutrition cause by a desire to get even and a lack of fresh air be simply to compound he trouble shuffle he malady and get he ripe for the ether-cone and scalpel nature be forever try to keep people well and most so-called disease which word mean merely lack of ease be self-limiting and tend to cure itself if you have appetite do not eat too much if you have no appetite do not eat at all be moderate in the use of all thing save fresh air and sunshine the one theme of _ ecclesiaste _ be moderation buddha write it down that the greatest word in any language be equanimity william morri say that the finest blessing of life be systematic useful work saint paul declare that the greatest thing in the world be love moderation equanimity work and love -- you need no other physician in so state i lay down a proposition agree to by all physician which be express by hippocrate the father of medicine and then repeat in better phrase by epictetus the slave to he pupil the great roman emperor marcus aurelius and which have be know to every thinking man and woman since : moderation equanimity work and love the ex question word sometimes become tainted and fall into bad repute and be discard until the day of elizabeth fry on the official record in england appear the word mad-house then it be wipe out and the word asylum substitute within twenty year ' time in several state in america we have discard the word asylum and have substitute the word hospital in jeffersonville indiana there be locate a reformatory which some year ago be know as a penitentiary the word prison have a depressing effect and penitentiary throw a theological shadow and so the word will have to go as we idea of the criminal change we change we vocabulary a few year ago we talk about asylum for the deaf and dumb -- the word dumb have now be stricken from every official document in every state in the union because we have discover with the assistance of gardner g hubbard that deaf people be not dumb and not be defective they certainly do not need a asylum they need school however and so everywhere we have establish school for the deaf deaf people be just as capable be just as competent just as well able to earn a honest living as be the average man who can hear the indeterminate sentence be one of the wisest expedient ever bring to bear in penology and it be to this generation alone that the honor of first use it must be give the offender be sentence for say from one to eight year this mean that if the prisoner behave himself obey the rule show a desire to be useful he will be parole and give he freedom at the end of one year if he misbehave and do not prove he fitness for freedom he will be keep two or three year and he may possibly have to serve the whole eight year how long be you in for i ask a convict at jeffersonville who be care for the flower in front of the wall I oh i be in for two year with the privilege of fourteen be the man 's answer give with a grin the old plan of short time allow two or three month off from every year for good behavior be a move in the right direction but the indeterminate sentence will soon be the rule everywhere for first offender the indeterminate sentence throw upon the man himself the responsibility for the length of he confinement and tend to relieve prison life of its horror by hold out hope the man have the short time constantly in mind and usually be very careful not to do anything to imperil it insurrection and a attempt to escape may mean that every day of the whole long sentence will have to be serve so even the dullest of mind and the most calloused realize that it pay to do what be right -- the lesson be press home upon they in a way it have never be before the old-time prejudice of business man against the man who have do time be chiefly on account of he incompetence and not he record the prison method that turn out a hateful depressed and frightened man who have be suppress by the silent system and deform by the lock-step callouse by brutal treatment and the constant thought hold over he that he be a criminal be a bad thing for the prisoner for the keeper and for society even a upright man would be undo by such treatment and in a year be transform into a sly secretive and morally sick man the man just out of prison be unable to do anything -- they need constant supervision and attention and so of course we do not care to hire they the ex now be a totally different man from the ex just out of he striped suit in the seventy thanks to that much defame man brockway and a few other we may have to restrain man for the good of themselves and the good of society but we do not punish the restraint be punishment enough we believe man be punish by they sin not for they when man be send to reform school now the endeavor and the hope be to give back to society a better man than we take judge lindsey send boy to the reform school without officer or guard the boy go of they own accord carry they own commitment papers they pound on the gate demand admittance in the name of the law the boy believe that judge lindsey be he friend and that the reason he be send to the reform school be that he may reap a betterment which he full freedom can not possibly offer when he take he commitment papers he be no longer at war with society and the keeper of the law he believe that what be be do for he be do for the best and so he go to prison which be really not a prison at the last for it be a school where the lad be teach to economize both time and money and to make himself useful other people work for we and we must work for they this be the supreme lesson that the boy learn you can only help yourself by help other now here be a proposition : if a boy or a man take he commitment papers go to prison alone and unattended be it necessary that he should be there lock up enclose in a corral and be look after by guard arm with death-dealing implement superintendent whittaker of the institution at jeffersonville indiana say no he believe that within ten year ' time we will do away with the high wall and will keep we loaded gun out of sight to a great degree also we will take the bar from the window of the prison just as we have take they away from the window of the hospital for the insane at the reform school it may be necessary to have a guard-house for some year to come but the high wall must go just as we have send the lock-step and the silent system and the striped suit of disgrace into the ragbag of time -- lose in the memory of thing that be four man out of five in the reformatory at jeffersonville need no coercion they would not run away if the wall be raze and the door leave unlock one young man i see there refuse the offer parole -- he want to stay until he learn he trade he be not the only one with a like mental attitude the quality of man in the average prison be about the same as that of the man who be in the united state army the man who enlist be a prisoner for he to run away be a very serious offense and yet he be not lock up at night nor be he surround by a high wall the george junior republic be simply a farm unfenced and unpatroled excepting by the boy who be in the republic and yet it be a penal institution the prison of the future will not be unlike a young lady ' board school where even yet the practice prevail of take the inmate out all together with a guard and allow no one to leave without a write permit as society change so change the so-called criminal in any event i know this -- that max nordau do not make out he case there be no criminal class or for that matter we be all criminal i have in I the capacity for every crime say emerson the man or woman who go wrong be a victim of unkind environment booker washington say that when the negro have something that we want or can perform a task that we want do we waive the color line and the race problem then cease to be a problem so it be with the ex question when the ex-convict be able to show that he be useful to the world the world will cease to shun he when superintendent whittaker graduate a man it be pretty good evidence that the man be able and willing to render a service to society the only place where the ex-convict get the icy mitt be pink tea and prayer meeting a ex-convict should work all day and then spend he evening at the library feed he mind -- then he be safe if i be a ex-convict i would fight shy of all refuge shelter arm saint andrew 's society and the philanthropic college settlement i would never go to those good professional people or professional good people who patronize the poor and spit upon the alleged wrongdoer and who draw sharp line of demarcation in distinguish between the good and the bad if you can work and be willing to work business man will not draw the line on you get a job and then hold it down hard by make yourself necessary employer of labor and the ex-convict themselves be fast settle this ex question with the help of the advanced type of the reform school where the inmate be be teach to be useful and be not punish nor patronize but be simply give a chance my heart go out in sympathy to the man who give a poor devil a chance i myself be a poor devil the sergeant a colonel in the united state army tell I the other day something like this : the most valuable officer the one who have the greatest responsibility be the sergeant the true sergeant be bear not make -- he be the priceless gift of the god he be so highly prize that when find he be never promote nor be he allow to resign if he be dissatisfy with he pay captain lieutenant and colonel chip in -- they can not afford to lose he he be a rara avi -- the apple of they eye he first requirement be that he must be able to lick any man in the company a drunken private may damn a captain upside down and wrong-side out and the captain be not allow to reply he can neither strike with he fist nor engage in a cuss match but you able sergeant be a adept in both of these polite accomplishment even if a private strike a officer the officer be not allow to strike back perhaps the man who abuse he could easily beat he in a rough-and-tumble fight and then it be quite a sufficient reason to keep one 's clothes clean we say the revolver equalize all man but it do not it be disagreeable to shoot a man it scatter brain and blood all over the sidewalk attract a crowd require a deal of explanation afterward and may cost a officer he stripe no good officer ever hear anything say about he by a private the sergeant hear everything and he reply to backslack be a straight-arm jab in the jaw the sergeant be responsible only to he captain and no good captain will ever know anything about what a sergeant do and he will not believe it when tell if a fight occur between two private the sergeant jump in bump they head together and lick they both if a man feign sick or be drunk the sergeant chuck he under the pump the regulation do not call for any such treatment but the sergeant do not know anything about the regulation -- he get the thing do the sergeant may be twenty year old or sixty -- age do not count the sergeant be a father to he man -- he regard they all as child -- bad boy -- and he business be to make they brave honorable and dutiful soldier the sergeant be always the first man up in the morning the last man to go to bed at night he know where he man be every minute of the day or night if they be actually sick he be both nurse and physician and dictate gently to the surgeon what should be do he be also the undertaker and the digging of ditch and lay out of latrine all fall to he lot unlike the higher officer he do not have to dress smart and he be very apt to discard he uniform and go clothe like a civilian teamster except on special occasion when necessity demand braid and button he know everything and nothing no wild escapade of a higher officer pass by he yet he never tell now one might suppose that he be a absolute tyrant but a good sergeant be a beneficent tyrant at the right time to break the spirit of he man will not do -- it would unfit they for service -- so what he seek to do be merely to bend they mind so as to match he own gradually they grow to both love and fear he in time of actual fight he transform coward into hero he hold he man up to the scratch in battle there be often certain officer mark for death -- they be to be shoot by they own man it be a time of get even -- and in the hurly-burly and excitement there be no witness the sergeant be ever on the lookout for such mutiny and he revolver often send to the dust the head revolutionary before the dastardly plot can be carry out in war-time all execution be not judicial in actual truth the sergeant be the only real sure-enough fighting man in the army he be as rare as bird ' tooth and every officer anxiously scan he recruit in search of good sergeant timber in business life the man with the sergeant instinct be even more valuable than in the army the business sergeant be the man not in evidence -- who ask for no compliment or bouquet -- who know where thing be -- who have no outside ambition and no desire save to do he work if he be too smart he will lay plot and plan for he own promotion and thereby he be pretty sure to defeat himself as a individual the average soldier be a sneak a shirk a failure a coward he be only valuable as he be lick into shape it be pretty much the same in business it seem hard to say it but the average employe in factory shop or store put the face of the clock to shame look at it he be think of he pay envelope and he intent be to keep the boss located and to do as little work as possible in many case the tyranny of the employer be to blame for the condition but more often it be the native outcrop of suspicion that prompt the seller to give no more than he can help and here the sergeant come in and with watchful eye and tireless nerve hold the recreant to they task if he be too severe he will fix in the shirk more firmly the shirk microbe but if he be of better fiber he may supply a little more will to those who lack it and gradually create a atmosphere of right intent so that the only disgrace will consist in they wear the face off the regulator and keep one ear cock to catch the come footstep of the boss there be not the slightest danger that there will ever be a overplus of sergeant let the sergeant keep out of strike plot feud hold he temper and show what be what and he can name he own salary and keep he place for ninety-nine year without have a contract the spirit of the age four hundred and twenty-five year before the birth of the nazarene socrate say the god be on high olympus but you and i be here and for this -- and a few other similar observation -- be be compel to drink a substitute for coffee -- he be a infidel within the last thirty year the church of christendom have in the main adopt the socratic proposition that you and i be here that be we have make progress by get away from narrow theology and recognize humanity we do not know anything about either olympus or elysium but we do know something about athen athen be here athens need we -- the greek be at the door let the god run elysium and we 'll devote ourselves to athen this be the prevail spirit in the church of america to-day we religion be humanitarian not theological a like evolution have come about in medicine the materium medica of twenty-five year ago be now obsolete no good doctor now treat symptom -- he neither give you something to relieve you headache nor to settle you stomach these be but timely ting-a-ling -- nature 's warning -- look out and the doctor tell you so and charge you a fee sufficient to impress you with the fact that he be no fool but that you be the lawyer who now get the largest fee be never see in a court-room litigation be now largely give over to damage suit -- carry on by client who want something for nothing and little lawyer shark-like and hungry who work on contingent fee three-fourth of the time of all superior and supreme court be take up by he effluvium who bring suit thru he bacterium with he crabship as chief witness for damages not due either in justice or fact how to get rid of this burden bring upon we by man who have nothing to lose be a question too big for the average legislator it can only be solve by heroic measure carry out by lawyer who be out of politics and have a complete indifference for cheap popularity here be opportunity for man of courage and ability but the point be this wise business man keep out of court they arbitrate they difference -- compromise -- they can not afford to quit they work for the sake of get even as for make money they know a better way in theology we be waive distinction and devote ourselves to the divine spirit only as it manifest itself in humanity -- we be talk less and less about another world and take more notice of the one we inhabit of course we occasionally have heresy trial and picture of the offender and the fat bishop adorn the first page but heresy trial not accompany by the scaffold or the faggot be innocuous and exceedingly tame in medicine we have more faith in ourselves and less in prescription in pedagogy we be teach more and more by the natural method -- learning by do -- and less and less by means of injunction and precept in penology we seek to educate and reform not to suppress repress and punish that be to say the god be on high olympus -- let they stay there athen be here the grammarian the best way to learn to write be to write herbert spencer never study grammar until he have learn to write he take he grammar at sixty which be a good age for one to begin this most interesting study as by the time you have reach that age you have largely lose you capacity to sin man who can swim exceedingly well be not those who have take course in the theory of swimming at natatorium from professor of the amphibian art -- they be just boy who jump into the ol' swimmin ' hole and come home with shirt on wrong-side out and a tell-tale dampness in they hair correspondence school for the tame of broncho be as naught and treatise on the gentle art of woo be of no avail -- follow nature 's lead grammar be the appendenda vermiformi of the science of pedagogic : it be as useless as the letter q in the alphabet or the proverbial two tail to a cat which no cat ever have and the finest cat in the world the manx cat have no tail at all the literary style of most university man be commonplace when not positively bad write herbert spencer in he old age educate englishman all write alike say taine that be to say educate man who have be drill to write by certain fix and unchangeable rule of rhetoric and grammar will produce similar composition they have no literary style for style be individuality and character -- the style be the man and grammar tend to obliterate individuality no study be so irksome to everybody except the sciolist who teach it as grammar it remain forever a bad taste in the mouth of the man of idea and have wean bright mind innumerable from a desire to express themselves through the write word grammar be the etiquette of word and the man who do not know how to properly salute he grandmother on the street until he have consult a book be always so troubled about the tense that he fancy break thru language and escape the grammarian be one whose whole thought be to string word accord to a set formulum the substance itself that he wish to convey be of secondary importance orator who keep they thought upon the proper way to gesticulate in curve impress nobody if it be a sin against decency or a attempt to poison the mind of the people for a person to be ungrammatical it might be wise enough to hire man to protect the well of english from defilement but a stationary language be a dead one -- move water only be pure -- and the well that be not feed by spring be sure to be a breeding-place for disease let man express themselves in they own way and if they express themselves poorly look you they punishment will be that no one will read they literary effusion oblivion with she smother-blanket lie in wait for the writer who have nothing to say and say it faultlessly in the

to fricassee it the best religion a religion of just be kind would be a pretty good religion do not you think so but a religion of kindness and useful effort be nearly a perfect religion we use to think it be a man 's belief concern a dogma that would fix he place in eternity this be because we believe that god be a grumpy grouchy old gentleman stupid touchy and dictatorial a really good man would not damn you even if you do not like he but a bad man would as we idea of god change we ourselves change for the better or as we think better of ourselves we think better of god it will be character that locate we place in another world if there be one just as it be we character that fix we place here we be weave character every day and the way to weave the best character be to be kind
