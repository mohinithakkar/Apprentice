produce by suzanne shell dave morgan and pg distribute proofreader gunman 's reckoning by max brand 1921 gunman 's reckoning 1 the fifty empty freight dance and roll and rattle on the rough road bed and fill jericho pass with thunder the big engine be labor and grunt at the grade but five car back the noise of the locomotive be lose yet there be a way to talk above the noise of a freight train just as there be a way to whistle into the tooth of a stiff wind this freight-car talk be pitch just above the ordinary tone -- it be a overtone of conversation one might say -- and it be distinctly nasal the brakie could talk above the racket and so of course could lefty joe they sit about in the center of the train on the forward end of one of the car no matter how the train lurch and stagger over that fearful road bed these two sway in they place as easily and as safely as bird on swing perch the brakie have touch lefty joe for two dollar he have secure fifty cent and since the vigor of lefty 's oath have convince he that this be all the money the tramp have the two now sit elbow to elbow and kill the distance with they talk it be like old time to have you here say the brakie you use to play this line when you jump from coast to coast sure say lefty joe and he scowl at the mountain on either side of the pass the train be gather speed and the peak lurch eastward in a confused ragged procession and a durned hard ride it be be many a time kind of queer to see you continue the brakie hear you be rise in the world he catch the face of the other with a rapid side glance but lefty joe be sufficiently conceal by the dark hear you be the main guy with a whole crowd behind you go on the brakie yeh sure hear you be ride the cushion and all that yeh but i guess it be all bunk

road do not know nothin ' else he be like a jumpin tornado hit every ten mile and do not bend a blade of grass in between take I about five minute to tell suds about donnegan then sud let out a grunt

mighty hot scrapper from a knife to a toenail they be nothing that levine could not use in a fight suds send he out to cross donnegan 's trail he cross it well enough suds get a telegram a couple day later say that levine have run into a wild cat and be considerable chawed and would suds send he a stake to pay the doctor well after that suds get sort of nervous do not take no interest in he work no more keep a weather eye out watch for the come of donnegan and pretty soon he up and clean out of camp next day sure enough along come donnegan and ask for suds we keep still -- all but kennebec lou kennebec be some fighter himself two hundred pound of mule muscle with the brain of a devil to tell what to do -- yes you can lay it ten to one that kennebec be some fighter that day he have a good edge from a bottle of rye he be try for a friend he do not need to go far to find trouble in donnegan a wink and a grin be all they need for a password and then they go at each other 's throat kennebec make the first pass and hit thin air and before he get back on he heel donnegan have hit he four time then kennebec jump back and take a fresh start with a knife here lefty joe pause and sigh he continue after a long interval : five minute later we be all busy tyin ' up what be leave of kennebec donnegan be down the road whistlin ' like a bird and that be the end of my gang what with kennebec lou and suds both go what chance do i have to hold the boy together 2 the brakie hear this recital with the keenest interest nod from time to time what beat I lefty he say at the end of the story be why you do not knife into the fight yourself and take a hand with donnegan at this lefty be silent it be rather the silence of one which can not tell whether or not it be worth while to speak than it be the silence of one who need time for thought i 'll tell you why bo it be because when i take a trail like that it only have one end i be go to bump off the other bird or he be go to bump off I the brakie clear he throat look here he say look to I like a queer thing that you be on this train do it query lefty softly why because donnegan be two car back asleep the devil you say the brakie break into laughter do not kid yourself along he warn do not do it it be not wise -- with I what you mean come on lefty come clean you better do a fade off this train why you fool -- it do not work joe why the minute i see you i know why you be here i know you mean to croak donnegan I croak he why should i croak he because you be trail he two thousand mile because you be not get the nerve to meet he face to face and you get to sneak in and take a crack at he while he be lie asleep that be you lefty joe he see lefty sway toward he but all story aside it be a very bold tramp that care for argument of a serious nature with a brakie and even lefty joe be deter from violent action in the darkness he upper lip twitch but he carefully smooth he voice you do not know nothing pal he declare do not i nothing repeat lefty he reach into he clothes and produce something which rustle in the rush of wind he fumble and finally pass a scrap of the paper into the hand of the brakie my heaven drawl the latter d'you think you can fix I with a buck for a job like this you can not bribe I to stand around while you bump off donnegan can not be do lefty one buck do you say lefty joe expertly light a match in spite of the roar wind and by this wild light the brakie read the denomination of the bill with a gasp he roll up he face and be in time to catch the sneer on the face of lefty before a gust snatch away the light of the match they have top the highest point in jericho pass and now the long train drop into the down grade with terrific speed the wind become a hurricane but to the brakie all this be no more than a calm night he thought be rage in he and if he look back far enough he remember the dollar which donnegan have give he and how he have promise donnegan to give the warning before anything go wrong he think of this but rustling against the palm of he right hand be the bill whose denomination he have read and that figure eat into he memory eat into he brain after all what be donnegan to he what be donnegan but a worthless tramp without any answer to that last monosyllabic query the brakie hunch forward and begin to work he way up the train the tramp watch he go with laughter it be silent laughter in the most quiet room it would not have sound louder than a continual light hissing noise then he in turn move from he place and work he way along the train in the opposite direction to that in which the brakie have disappear he go expertly swing from car to car with apelike clumsiness -- and surety two car back it be not so easy to reach the slide side door of that empty car consider the fact that it be night that the train be buck furiously over the old roadbed lefty have a not altogether simple task before he but he manage it with the same apelike adroitness he could climb with he foot as well as he hand he would trust a ledge as well as he would trust the ring of a ladder under he discreet manipulation from above the door loosen and it become possible to work it back but even this the tramp do with considerable care he take advantage of the lurch of the train and every time the car jerk he force the door to roll a little so that it might seem for all the world as though the motion of the train alone be operate it for suppose that donnegan waken out of he sound sleep and observe the motion of the door he would be suspicious if the door open in a single continued motion but if it work in these degree he would be hypersuspicious if he dream of danger so the tramp give five whole minute to that work when it be do he wait for a time another five minute perhaps to see if the door would be move back and when it be not disturbed but allow to stand open he know that donnegan still sleep it be time then for action and lefty joe prepare for the descent into the home of the enemy let it not be think that he approach this moment with a fall heart and with a cringe snaky feeling as a man might be expect to feel when he approach to murder a sleep foeman for that be not lefty 's emotion at all rather he be overcome by a tremendous happiness he could have sing with joy at the thought that he be about to rid himself of this pest true the gang be break up but it might rise again donnegan have fall upon it like a blight but with donnegan out of the way would not sud come back to he instantly and would not kennebec lou himself return in admiration of a man who have do what he kennebec could not do with those two as a nucleus how greatly might he not build justice must be do to lefty joe he approach this murder as a statesman approach the removal of a foe from the path of public prosperity there be no more rancor in he attitude it be rather the blissful largeness of the heart that come to the politician when he unearth the scandal which will blight the race of he rival with the peaceful smile of a child therefore lefty joe lay stretch at full length along the top of the car and make he choice of weapon on the whole he usual preference day or night be for a revolver give he a gat and lefty be at home in any company but he have reason for transfer he alliance on this occasion in the first place a box car which be reel and pitch to and fro from side to side be not a very good shooting platform -- even for a snapshot like lefty joe also the pitch darkness in the car would be a further annoyance to good aim and in the third and most decisive place if he be to miss he first shot he would not be extremely apt to place he second bullet for donnegan have a reputation with he own revolver indeed it be say that he rarely carry the weapon because when he do he be always tempt too strongly to use it so that the chance be large that donnegan would not have the gun now yet if he do have it -- if he lefty do miss he first shot -- then the story would be brief and bitter indeed on the other hand a knife offer advantage almost too numerous to be list it give one the deadly assurance which only come with the knowledge of a edge of steel in one 's hand and when the knife reach its mark it end a battle at a stroke of course these doubt and consideration pro and con go through the mind of the tramp in about the same space of time that it require for a dog to waken snap at a fly and drowse again eventually he take out he knife it be a sheath knife which he wear from a noose of silk around he throat and it always lay closest to he heart the blade of the knife be of the finest spanish steel in the day when spanish smith know how to draw out steel to a streak of light the handle of the knife be from milan on the whole it be a delicate and beautiful weapon -- and it have the durable suppleness of -- say -- hatred itself lefty joe like a pirate in a tale take this weapon between he tooth allow he squat heavy bulk to swing down and dangle at arm 's length for a instant and then he swing himself a little and land softly on the floor of the car who have not hear snow drop from the branch upon other snow beneath that be the way lefty joe drop to the floor of the car he remain as he have fall crouch alert with one hand spread out on the board to balance he and give he a leverage and a start in case he should wish to spring in any direction then he begin to probe the darkness in every direction with every glance he allow he head to dart out a little the movement be like a chicken pecking at imaginary grain of corn but eventually he satisfy himself that he quarry lay in the forward end of the car that he be prone that he lefty have accomplish nine-tenth of he purpose by enter the place of he enemy unobserved 3 but even though this major step be accomplish successfully lefty joe be not the man to abandon caution in the midst of a enterprise the roar of the train would have cover sound ten time as loud as those of he snaky approach yet he glide forward with as much care as though he be step on old stair in a silent house he could see a vague shadow -- donnegan but chiefly he work by that peculiar sense of direction which some people possess in a dim light the blind of course have that sense in a high degree of sensitiveness but even those who be not blind may learn to trust the peculiar and inverted sense of direction with this to aid he lefty joe go steadily slowly across the first and most dangerous stage of he journey that be he get away from the square of the open door where the faint starlight might vaguely serve to silhouette he body after this it be easier work of course when he alight on the floor of the car the knife have be transfer from he tooth to he left hand and all during he progress forward the knife be be balanced delicately as though he be not yet quite sure of the weight of the weapon just as a prize fighter keep he deadly poise hand in play move they as though he fear to lose he intimate touch with they this stalk have occupy a matter of split seconds now lefty joe rise slowly he be lean very far forward and he ward against the roll of the car by spread out he right hand close to the floor he left hand he poise with the knife and he begin to gather he muscle for the leap he have already take the last preliminary movement -- he have swing himself to the right side a little and lighten he left foot have throw all he weight upon the right -- in fact he body be literally suspend in the instant of spring catlike when the shadow which be donnegan come to life the shadow convulse as shadow be apt to swirl in a green pool when a stone be drop into it and a bit of board two foot long and some eight inch wide crack against the shin of lefty joe it be about the least dramatic weapon that could have be choose under those circumstance but certainly no other defense could have frustrate lefty 's spring so completely instead of launch out in a compact mass whose point of contact be the reach knife lefty crawl stupidly forward upon he knee and have to throw out he knife hand to save he balance it be a singular thing to note how important balance be to man animal fight as a rule just as well on they back as they do on they foot they can lie on they side and bite they can swing they claw even while they be drop through the air but man need poise and balance before he can act what be speed in a fighter it be not so much a affair of the muscle as it be the power of the brain to adapt itself instantly to each new move and put the body in a state of balance in the prize ring speed do not mean the ability to strike one lightning blow but rather that have finish one drive the fighter be in position to hit again and then again so that no matter where the impetus of he last lunge have place he he be ready and poise to shoot all he weight behind he fist again and drive it accurately at a vulnerable spot individually the action may be slow but the series of effort seem rapid that be why a superior boxer seem to hypnotize he antagonist with movement which to the spectator seem perfectly easy slow and sure but if lefty lack much in agility he have a animallike sense of balance sprawl helpless he see the convulse shadow that be donnegan take form as a straight shooting body that plunge through the air above he lefty joe dig he left elbow into the floor of the car and whirl back upon he shoulder bunch he knee high over he stomach nine chance out of ten if donnegan have fall flatwise upon this alert enemy he would have receive those knee in the pit of he own stomach and instantly be paralyzed but in the jump rattle car even donnegan be capable of make mistake he mistake in this instance save he life for spring too far he come down not in reach distance of lefty 's throat but with he chest on the knee of the older tramp as a result donnegan be promptly kick head over heel and tumble the length of the car lefty be on he foot and plunge after the tumble form in the twinkling of a eye literally speak and he be only keep from bury he knife in the flesh of he foe by a sway of the car that stagger he in the act of striking donnegan the next instant be beyond reach he have strike the end of the car and rebound like a ball of rubber at a tangent he slide into the shadow and lefty put he own shoulder to the wall feel for he revolver and know that he be lose he have fail in he first surprise attack and without surprise to help he now he be go he weigh he revolver decide that it would be madness to use it for if he miss donnegan would instantly be guide by the flash to shoot he full of hole something slip by the open door -- something that glimmer faintly and lefty joe know that it be the red head of donnegan donnegan soft-footed as a shadow among shadow donnegan on a blood trail it lower the heartbeat of lefty joe to a tremendous slow pulse in that moment he give up hope and resign himself to die determine to fight to the last gasp as become one of he reputation and national celebrity on the road yet lefty joe be no common man and no common fighter no let the shade of rusty dick whom lefty meet and beat in he glorious prime -- let this shade arise and speak for the prowess of lefty joe in fact it be because he be such a good fighter himself that he recognize he helplessness in the hand of donnegan the faint glimmer of color have pass the door it be dissolve in deeper shadow at once and soundlessly lefty know that donnegan be closer and closer of one thing he feel more and more confident that donnegan do not have he revolver with he otherwise he would have use it before for what be darkness to this devil donnegan he walk like a cat and most likely he could see like a cat in the dark instinctively the older tramp brace himself with he right hand hold at a guard before he breast and the knife poise in he left just as a man would prepare to meet the attack of a panther he even take to probe the darkness in a strange hope to catch the glimmer of the eye of donnegan as he move to the attack if there be a hair 's breadth of light then donnegan himself must go down a single blow would do it but the devil have instruct he favorite donnegan how to fight he do not come lunge through the shadow to meet the point of that knife instead he have work a snaky way along the floor and now he leap in and up at lefty take he under the arm a dozen hand it seem lay hold on lefty he fight like a demon and tear himself away but the multitude of hand pursue he they be small hand where they close they tear the clothes and bit into he very flesh once a hand have he by the throat and when lefty jerk himself away it be with a feeling that he flesh have be sear by five point of red-hot iron all this time he knife be dart once it rip through cloth but never once do it find the target and half a second later donnegan get he hold the flash of the knife as lefty raise it must have guide the other he shoot he right hand up behind the left shoulder of the other and imprison the wrist not only do it make the knife hand helpless but by bear down with he own weight donnegan could put he enemy in most exquisite torture for a instant they whirl then they go down and lefty be on top only for a moment the impetus which have send he to the floor be use by donnegan to turn they over and once fairly on top he left hand be instantly at the throat of lefty twice lefty make enormous effort but then he be do about he body the limb of donnegan be twist tighten with incredible force just as hot iron band sink resistlessly into place the strangle-hold cut away life at its source once he strive to bury he tooth in the arm of donnegan once as the horror catch at he he strive to shriek for help all he succeed in do be in raise a awful sob whisper then look death in the face lefty plunge into the great darkness 4 when he waken he jump at a stride into the full possession of he faculty he have be place near the open door and the rush of night air have do its work in revive he but lefty draw back to life feel only a vague wonder that he life have not be take perhaps he be be reserve by the victor for a indian death of torment he feel cautiously and find that not only be he hand free but he revolver have not be take from he a familiar weight be on he chest -- the very knife have be return to its sheath have donnegan return these thing to show how perfectly he despise he enemy he be go groan the tramp sit up quickly he be here say a voice that cut easily through the roar of the train wait for you lefty the tramp be stagger again but then who have ever be able to fathom the way of donnegan donnegan he cry with a sudden recklessness yes you be a fool yes for not finish the job donnegan begin to laugh in the uproar of the train it be impossible really to hear the sound but lefty catch the pulse of it he finger he bruised throat swallow be a painful effort and a indescribable feeling come over he as he realize that he sit arm to the tooth within a yard of the man he want to kill and yet he be as effectively render helpless as though iron shackle have be lock on he wrist and leg the night light come through the doorway and he could make out the slender outline of donnegan and again he catch the faint luster of that red hair and out of the shadowy form a singular power emanate and sap he strength at the root yet he go on viciously : sooner or later donnegan i 'll get you the red head of donnegan move and lefty joe know that the younger man be laugh again why be you after I he ask at length it be another blow in the face of lefty he sit for a time blinking with owlish stupidity why he echo and he speak he astonishment from the heart why be i after you he say again why confound you be not you donnegan yes do not the whole road know that i be after you and you after I the whole road be crazy i be not after you lefty choke maybe i be dream maybe you do not bust up the gang maybe you do not clean up on suds and kennebec suds kennebec i sort of remember meet they you sort of -- the devil lefty joe sputter the word and after you clean up my crowd be not it natural and good sense for you to go on and try to clean up on I sound like it but i figure to beat you to it i cut in on you trail donnegan and before i leave it you 'll know a lot more about I you be warn I ahead of time you have play this game square with I i 'll play square with you next time there 'll be no slip donnegan i dunno why you should of pick on I though just the natural devil in you i have not pick on you say donnegan what i 'll give you my word a tingle run through the blood of lefty joe somewhere he have hear in rumor that the word of donnegan be as good as gold he recall that rumor now and something of dignity in the manner with which donnegan make he announcement carry a heavy weight as a rule the tramp vow with many oath here be one of the night of the road who make he bare word sufficient and lefty joe hear with great wonder all i ask he say be why you hound my gang if you be not after I i do not hound they i run into suds by accident we have trouble then levine then kennebec lou try to take a fall out of I a note of whimsical protest creep into the voice of donnegan somehow there be always a fight wherever i go he say fight just sort of grow up around I lefty joe snarl you do not mean nothing by just ` happen ' to run into three of my boy one after another not a thing lefty rock himself back and forth in a ecstasy of impatience why do not you stay put he complain why do not you stake out you own ground and stay put in it you cut in on every guy 's territory there be not any privacy any more since you hit the road what you get a rove commission donnegan wait for a moment before he answer and when he speak he voice have alter indeed he have remarkable ability to pitch he voice into the roar of the freight train and above or beneath it and give it a quality such as he please i be follow a trail but not yours he admit at length i be follow a trail i have be at it these two year and nothing have come of it who you after a man with red hair that tell I a lot donnegan refuse to explain what you get against he -- the color of he hair and lefty roar contentedly at he own stale jest it be no good reply donnegan i 'll never get on the trail lefty break in : you mean to say you have be work two solid year and all on a trail that you be not even find the silence answer he in the affirmative be not nobody be able to tip you off to he go on lefty intensely interested nobody you see he be a hard sort to describe red hair that be all there be about he for a clue but if any one ever see he strip they would remember he by a big blotchy birthmark on he left shoulder eh grunt lefty joe he add : what be he name do not know he change moniker when he take to the road what be he to you a man i be go to find no matter where the trail take you no matter where at this lefty be seize with unaccountable laughter he literally strain he lung with that homeric outburst when he wipe the tear from he eye at length the shadow on the opposite side of the doorway have disappear he find he companion lean over he and this time he could catch the dull glint of starlight on both hair and eye what d'you know ask donnegan how do you stand toward this bird with the birthmark and the red hair query lefty with caution what d'you know insist donnegan all at once passion shake he he fasten he grip in the shoulder of the larger man and he fingertip work toward the bone what do you know he repeat for the third time and now there be no hint of laughter in the hard voice of lefty you fool if you follow that trail you 'll go to the devil it be rusty dick and he be dead he triumphant laughter come again but donnegan cut into it rusty dick be the one you -- kill sure what of it we fight fair and square then rusty be not the man i want the man i want would of eat two like you lefty what about the birthmark it sure be on he shoulder donnegan heaven whisper donnegan what be the matter rusty dick gasp donnegan yes it must have be he sure it be what do you have against he it be a matter of blood -- between we stammer donnegan he voice rise in a peculiar manner so that lefty shrink involuntarily you kill rusty ask any of the boy but between you and I it be the booze that lick rusty dick i just finish up the job and surprised everybody the train be out of the mountain and in a country of scatter hill but here it strike a steep grade and settle down to a grind of slow labor the rail hum and suspense fill the freight car hey cry lefty suddenly you fool you 'll do a flop out the door in about a minute he even reach out to steady the topple figure but donnegan pitch straight out into the night lefty crane he neck from the door study the roadbed but at that moment the locomotive top the little rise and the whole train lurch forward after all murmured lefty joe it sound like donnegan hate a guy so bad that he have not any use for livin ' when he hear the other guy be dead but i be never goin ' to cross he path again i hope 5 but donnegan have leap clear of the roadbed and he strike almost to the knee in a drift of sand otherwise he might well have break he leg with that foolhardy chance as it be the fall whirl he over and over and by the time he have pick himself up the light caboose of the train be rock past he donnegan watch it grow small in the distance and then when it be only a red uncertain star far down the track he turn to the vast country around he the mountain be to he right not far away but catch up behind the shadow so that it seem a great distance like all huge half-seen thing they seem in motion toward he for the rest he be in bare rolling country the sky line everywhere be clean there be hardly a sign of a tree he know by a little reflection that this must be cattle country for the brakie have intimate as much in they talk just before dusk now it be early night and a wind begin to rise blow down the valley with a keen motion and a rapidly lessen temperature so that donnegan see he must get to a shelter he could if necessary endure any privation but he taste be for luxurious comfort accordingly he consider the landscape with gloomy disapproval he be almost incline to regret he plunge from the lumber freight train two thing have govern he in make that move first when he discover that the long trail he follow be definitely fruitless he be fill with a great desire to cut himself away from he past and make a new start secondly when he learn that rusty dick have be kill by joe he want desperately to get the throttle of the latter under he thumb if ever a man risk he life to avoid a sin it be donnegan jump from the train to keep from murder he stoop to sight along the ground for this be the best way at night and often horizon light be reveal in this manner but now donnegan saw nothing to serve as a guide he therefore draw in he belt until it fit snug about he gaunt waist settle he cap firmly and head straight into the wind nothing could have show he character more distinctly when in doubt head into the wind with a jaunty swinging step he saunter along and this time at least he tactic find a early reward top the first large rise of ground he see in the hollow beneath he the outline of a large building and as he approach it the wind clear a high blowing mist from the star he see a jumble of outlying house shed barn corral -- it be the nucleus of a big ranch it be a maxim that if you wish to know a man look at he library and if you wish to know a rancher look at he barn donnegan make a small detour to the left and head for the largest of the barn he enter it by the big slide door which stand open he look up and see the star shine through a gap in the roof and then he stand quietly for a time listen to the voice of the wind in the ruin oddly enough it be pleasant to donnegan he own trouble and sorrow have pour upon he so thickly in the past hour or so that it be soothing to find evidence of the distress of other but perhaps this mean that the entire establishment be desert he leave the barn and go toward the house not until he be close under its wall do he come to appreciate its size it be one of those great rambling two-storied structure which the cattle king of the past generation be fond of build standing close to it he hear none of the intimate sound of the storm blow through crack and broken wall no matter into what disrepair the barn have fall the house be still solid only about the edge of the build the storm keep murmur yet there be not a light neither above nor below he come to the front of the house still no sign of life he stand at the door and knock loudly upon it and though when he try the knob he find that the door be latch yet no one come in response he knock again and put he ear close he hear the echo walk through the interior of the building after this the wind rise in sudden strength and deafen he with rattling above he a shutter be swing open and then crash to so that the opening of the door be a shock of surprise to donnegan a dim light from a source which he could not direct suffused the interior of the hall the door itself be work open a matter of inch and donnegan be aware of two keen old eye glitter out at he beyond this he could distinguish nothing who be you ask a woman 's voice and what do you want i be a stranger and i want something to eat and a place to sleep this house look as if it might have spare room where d'you come from yonder say donnegan with a sufficiently noncommittal gesture what be you name donnegan i do not know you be off with you mr donnegan he insert he foot in the closing crack of the door tell I where i be to go he persist at this she voice rise in pitch with squeaky rage i 'll raise the house on you raise 'em call down the man of the house i can talk to he better than i can to you but i will not walk off like this if you can feed I i 'll pay you for what i eat a shrill cackling -- he could not make out the word and since patience be not the first of donnegan 's virtue he seize on the knob of the door and deliberately press it wide standing in the hall now and close the door slowly behind he he see a woman with old keen eye shrink away toward the staircase she be evidently in great fear but there be something infinitely malicious in the manner in which she keep work she lip soundlessly she be shrink and half turn away yet there be a suggestion that in a instant she might whirl and fly at he face the door now click and with the windstorm shut away donnegan have a queer feeling of be trap now call the man of the house he repeat see if i can not come to term with he he would make short work of you if he come she reply she break into a shrill laughter and donnegan think he have never see a face so ugly if he come she say you would rue the day well i 'll talk to you then i be not ask charity i want to pay for what i get this be not a hotel you go on down the road inside eight mile you 'll come to the town eight mile that be nothing for a man to ride not at all if i have something to ride you be not get a horse no then how do you come here i walk if this sharpen she suspicion it sharpen she fear also she put one foot on the lowest step of the stair be off with you mr donnegally or whatever you outlandish name be you 'll get nothing here what bring you -- a door close and a footstep sound lightly on the floor above and donnegan already alert in the strange atmosphere of this house give back a pace so as to get a honest wall behind he he note that the step be quick and small and prepare himself to meet a wisp of manhood -- which for that matter be the type he be most inclined to fear -- donnegan keep a corner glance upon the old woman at the foot of the stair and steadily survey the shadow at the head of the rise out of that darkness a foot slip not even a boy 's foot -- a very child 's the shock of it make donnegan relax he caution for a instant and in that instant she come into the reach of the light it be a wretched light at best for it come from a lamp with smoky chimney which the old hag carry and at the raising and lowering of she hand the flame jump and die in the throat of the chimney and set the hall awash with shadow fall away to a point of yellow the lamp allow the hall to assume a certain indefinite dignity of height and breadth and calm proportion but when the flame rise donnegan could see the broken baluster of the balustrade the carpet fade past any design and worn to rattiness wall paper which have rot or dry away and hang in crisp tatters here and there and on the ceiling a irregular patch from which the plaster have fall and expose the lathwork but at the come of the girl the old woman have turn and as she do the flame toss up in the lamp and donnegan could see the newcomer distinctly once before he heart have rise as it rise now it have be the fag end of a long party and donnegan rousing from a drunken sleep stagger to the window lean there to get the freshness of the night air against he hot face he have look up and see the white face of the moon go up the sky and a sudden sense of the blackness and loathing against the city have come upon donnegan and the murky color of he own life and when he turn away from the window he be sober and so it be that he now stare up at the girl at she breast she hold a cloak together with one hand and the other hand touch the railing of the stair he see one foot suspend for the next step as though the sight of he keep she back in fear to the miserable soul of donnegan she seem all that be lovely young and pure and she hair old gold in the shadow and pale gold where the lamp strike it be to donnegan like a miraculous light about she face indeed that little pause be a great and awful moment for consider that donnegan who have go through he whole life with he eye ready either to mock or hate and who have rarely use he hand except to make a fist of it donnegan who have never so far as be know have a companion who have ask the world for action not kindness this donnegan now stand straight with he back against the wall and pour out the story of he wayward life to a mere slip of a girl 6 even the old woman whose eye be sharpen by she habit of look constantly for the weakness and vice of man could not guess what be go on behind the thin rather ugly face of donnegan the girl perhaps may have see more for she catch the glitter of he active eye even at that distance the hag begin to explain with vicious gesture that set the light flare up and down he be not come from nowhere lou she say he be not go nowhere he want to stay here for the night the foot which have be suspend to take the next step be now withdraw donnegan remember at last whip off he cap and at once the light flare and burn upon he hair it be a wonderful red it shine and it have a terrible blood tinge so that he face seem pale beneath it there be three thing that make up the peculiar dominance of donnegan 's countenance the three thing be the hair the uneasy bright eye and the rather thin compress lip when donnegan sleep he seem about to waken from a vigorous dream when he sit down he seem about to leap to he foot and when he be stand he give that impression of a poise which be ready for anything it be no wonder that the girl see that face and that alert aggressive body shrink a little on the stair donnegan that instant know that these two woman be really alone in the house as far as fight man be concerned and the fact disturb he more than a level gun would have do he go to the foot of the stair even past the old woman and raise he head he speak to the girl my name 's donnegan i come over from the railroad -- walk i do not want to walk that other eight mile unless there be a real need for it i -- why do he pause i 'll pay for anything i get here he voice be not too certain behind he tooth there be knock a desire to cry out to she the truth i be donnegan donnegan the tramp donnegan the shiftless donnegan the fighter donnegan the killer donnegan the penniless worthless but for heaven 's sake let I stay until morning and let I look at you -- from a distance but after all perhaps he do not need to say all these thing he clothes be rag upon he face there be a stubble of unshaven red which make the pallor about he eye more pronounced if the girl have be half blind she must have feel that here be a man of fire he see she gather the wrap a little closer about she shoulder and that sign of fear make he sick at heart mr donnegan say the girl i be sorry we can not take you into the house eight mile -- do she expect to turn a sinner from the gate of heaven with a mere phrase he cast out he hand and she wince as though he have shake he fist at she be you afraid cry donnegan i do not control the house he pause not that she reply have baffle he but the mere pleasure of hear she speak account for it it be one of those low light voice which be apt to have very little range or volume and which break and tremble absurdly under any stress of emotion and often they become shrill in a higher register but inside conversational limit if such a term may be use there be no fiber so delightful so purely musical suppose the word velvet apply to a sound that voice come soothingly and delightfully upon the ear of donnegan from which the roar and rattle of the empty freight train have not quite depart he smile at she but he protest this be west of the rocky -- and i do not see any other way out the girl all this time be study he intently a little sadly he think now she shake she head but there be more warmth in she voice i be sorry i can not ask you to stay without first consulting my father go ahead ask he she raise she hand a little the thought seem to bring she to the verge of tremble as though he be ask a sacrilege why not he urge she do not answer but instead she eye seek the old woman as if to gain she interposition she burst instantly into speech which there be no good talk any more declare the ancient vixen be you want to make trouble for she with the colonel be off young man it be not the first time i have tell you you would get nowhere in this house there be no possible answer leave to donnegan and he do as usual the surprising thing he break into laughter of such clear and ring tone -- such infectious laughter -- that the old woman blink in the midst of she wrath as though she be see a new man and he see the lip of the girl part in wonder my father be a invalid say the girl and he live by strict rule i could not break in on he at this time of the evening if that be all -- donnegan actually begin to mount the step -- i 'll go in and talk to you father myself she have retire one pace as he begin advance but as the import of what he say become clear to she she be root to one position by astonishment colonel macon -- my father -- she begin then : do you really wish to see he the hushed voice make donnegan smile -- it be such a voice as one boy use when he ask the other if he really dare enter the pasture of the red bull he chuckle again and this time she smile and she eye be widen partly by fear of he purpose and partly from he nearness they seem to be suddenly closer together as though they be on one side against a common enemy and that enemy be she father the old woman be cackle sharply from the bottom of the stair and then bob in pursuit and call on donnegan to come back at length the girl raise she hand and silence she with a gesture donnegan be now hardly a pace away and he see that she live up to all the promise of that first glance yet still she seem unreal there be a quality of the unearthly about a girl 's beauty it be after all only a gay moment between the formlessness of childhood and the hardness of middle age this girl be pale donnegan saw and yet she have color she have the luster say of a white rose and the same bloom lou the old woman have call she and macon be she father 's name lou macon -- the name fit she donnegan thought for that matter if she name have be sally smith donnegan would probably have think it beautiful the keener a man 's mind be and the more he know about man and woman and the way of the world the more apt he be to be intoxicate by a touch of grace and thoughtfulness and all these age-long seconds the perfume of girlhood have be strike up to donnegan 's brain she brush she timidity away and with the same gesture accept donnegan as something more than a dangerous vagrant she take the lamp from the hand of the crone and send she about she business disregard the muttering and the warning which trail behind the depart form now she face donnegan screen the light from she eye with a cupped hand and by the same device focus it upon the face of donnegan he mutely note the small maneuver and give she credit but for the pleasure of see the white of she finger and the way they taper to a pink transparency at the tip he forget the poor figure he must make with he soil ragged shirt he unshaven face he gaunt cheek indeed he look so straight at she that in spite of she advantage with the light she have to avoid he glance i be sorry say lou macon and ashamed because we can not take you in the only house on the range where you would not be welcome i know but my father lead a very close life he have set way the way of a invalid mr donnegan and you be bother about speak to he of I i be almost afraid of let you go in yourself let I take the risk she consider he again for a moment and then turn with a nod and he follow she up the stair into the upper hall the moment they step into it he hear she clothes flutter and a small gale pour on they it be criminal to allow such a building to fall into this ruinous condition and a gloomy picture rise in donnegan 's mind of the invalid thin-faced sallow-eyed white-haired lie in he bed listen to the storm and silently gather bitterness out of the pain of live lou macon pause again in the hall close to a door on the right i be go to send you in to speak to my father she say gravely first i have to tell you that he be different donnegan reply by look straight at she and this time she do not wince from the glance indeed she seem to be probe he search with a peculiar hope what could she expect to find in he what that be useful to she not once in all he life have such a sense of impotence descend upon donnegan she father bah invalid or no invalid he would handle that fellow and if the old man have a acrid temper donnegan at will could file he own speech to a point but the girl in the meager hand which hold the lamp there be a power which all the muscle of donnegan could not compass and in he weakness he look wistfully at she i hope you talk will be pleasant i hope so she lay she hand on the knob of the door and withdraw it hastily then summon great resolution she open the door and show donnegan in father she say this be mr donnegan he wish to speak to you the door close behind donnegan and hearing that whishing sound which the door of a heavy safe will make he look down at this and see that it be actually inch thick once more the sense of be in a trap descend upon he 7 he find himself in a large room which before he could examine a single feature of it be effectively curtain from he sight straight into he face shoot a current of violent white light that make he blink there be the natural recoil but in donnegan recoil be generally protect by several stratum of willpower and seldom show in any physical action on the present occasion he first dismay be swiftly overwhelm by a cold anger at the insulting trick this be not the trick of a helpless invalid donnegan could not see a single thing before he but he obey a very deep instinct and advance straight into the current of light he be glad to see the light switch away the comparative darkness wash across he eye in a pleasant wave and he be now able to distinguish a few thing in the room it be as he have first surmise quite large the ceiling be high the proportion comfortably spacious but what astounded donnegan be the real elegance of the furnishings there be no mistake the deep silken texture of the rug upon which he step the glow of light barely reach the wall and there show faintly in streak along yellowish hanging beside a table which support a big reading lamp -- gasoline no doubt from the intensity of its light -- sit colonel macon with a large volume spread across he knee donnegan see two highlight -- fine silver hair that cover the head of the invalid and a pair of white hand fall idly upon the surface of the big book for if the silver hair suggest age the smoothly finish hand suggest perennial youth they be strong carefully tend complacent hand they suggest to donnegan a man sufficient unto himself mr donnegan i be sorry that i can not rise to receive you now what pleasant accident have bring I the favor of this call donnegan be take aback again and this time more strongly than by the flare of light against he eye for in the voice he recognize the quality of the girl -- the same softness the same velvety richness though the pitch be a bass in the voice of this man there be the same suggestion that the tone would crack if it be force either up or down with this great difference one could hardly conceive of a situation which would push that man 's voice beyond its monotone it flow with deadly all-embracing softness it cling about one it fascinate and baffle the mind of the listener but donnegan be not in the habit of be baffle by voice neither be he a lover of formality he look about for a place to sit down and immediately discover that while the invalid sit in a enormous easy-chair border by shelf and supply with wheel for raise and lower the back and for propel the chair about the room on its rubber tire it be the only chair in the room which could make any pretension toward comfort as a matter of fact aside from this one immense chair devote to the pleasure of the invalid there be nothing in the room for he visitor to sit upon except two or three miserable backless stool but donnegan be not long take aback he tuck he cap under he arm bow profoundly in honor of the colonel 's compliment and bring one of the stool to a place where it be no nearer the rather ominous circle of the lamplight than be the invalid himself with he eye accustom to the new light donnegan could now take better stock of he host he see a rather handsome face with eye exceedingly blue young and active but the feature of macon as well as he body be blur and obscure by a great fatness he be truly a prodigious man and one could understand the stoutness with which the invalid chair be make he great wrist dimple like the wrist of a healthy baby and he face be so enlarged with superfluous flesh that the lower part of it quite dwarf the upper he seem at first glance a man with a low forehead and bright careless eye and a body make immobile by flesh and sickness a man whose spirit despise and defy pain yet a second glance show that the forehead be after all a nobly proportion one and for all the bulk of that figure for all the cripple-chair donnegan would not have be surprise to see the bulk spring lightly out of the chair to meet he for he own part sit back on the stool with he cap tuck under he arm and he hand fold about one knee he meet the faint cold smile of the colonel with a broad grin of he own i can put it in a nutshell say donnegan i be tired dead beat need a handout and rap at you door along come a mystery in the shape of a ugly-looking woman and open the door to I try to shut I out i decide to come in she insist on keep I outside all at once i see that i have to get into the house i be bring in you daughter try to steer I off see that the job be more than she can get away with and shelf I off upon you and that colonel macon be the pleasant accident which bring you the favor of this call it would have be a speech both stupid and pert in the mouth of another but donnegan know how to flavor word with a touch of mockery of himself as well as another there be two manners in which this speech could have be receive -- with a wink or with a smile but it would have be impossible to hear it and grow frigid as for the colonel he smile it be a tricky smile however as donnegan feel it spread easily upon that vast face and again go out and leave all to the dominion of the cold bright eye a case of curiosity comment the colonel a case of hunger say donnegan my dear mr donnegan put it that way if you wish and a case of blanket need for one night really have you venture into such a country as this without any equipment outside of my purse my equipment be of the invisible kind wit suggest the colonel thank you not at all you hint at it yourself however a hint be harder to take than to make the colonel raise he faultless right hand -- and oddly enough he great corpulence do not extend in the slightest degree to he hand but stop short at the wrist -- and stroke he immense chin he skin be like lou macon 's except that in place of the white-flower bloom he be a parchment dead pallor he lower he hand with the same slow precision and fold it with the other all the time probe donnegan with he difficult eye unfortunately -- most unfortunately it be impossible for I to accommodate you mr donnegan the reply be not flippant but quick not at all i be the easiest person in the world to accommodate the big man smile sadly my fortune have fall upon evil day sir it be no longer what it be there be in this house three habitable room this one my daughter 's apartment the kitchen where old haggie sleep otherwise you be in a rat trap of a place he shake he head a slow decisive motion a spare blanket say donnegan will be enough there be another sigh and another shake of the head even a corner of a rug to roll up in will do perfectly you see it be impossible for I to entertain you bare board will do well enough for I colonel macon and if i have a piece of bread a plate of cold bean -- anything -- i can entertain myself i be sorry to see you so compliant mr donnegan because that make my refusal seem the more unkind but i can not have you sleep on the bare floor not on such a night pneumonia come on one like a cat in the dark in such weather it be really impossible to keep you here sir h be - m say donnegan he begin to feel that he be stump and it be a most unusual feeling for he besides for a young fellow like you with you agility what be eight mile walk down the road and you will come to a place where you will be make at home and feed like a king eight mile that be not much but on such a night as this there be a faint glint in the eye of the colonel be he not sharpen he wit for he contest of word and enjoy it the wind will be at you back and buoy you step it will shorten the eight mile to four very definitely donnegan feel that the other be read he what be it that he see as he turn the page there be one thing you fail to take into you accounting ah i have a irresistible aversion to walk ah repeat macon or exercise in any form then you be unfortunate to be in this country without a horse unfortunate perhaps but the fact be that i be here very sorry to trouble you though colonel i be rarely trouble say the colonel coldly and since i have no means of accommodation the law of hospitality rest light on my shoulder yet i have a odd thought reply donnegan well you have express a number already it seem to I it be this : that you have already make up you mind to keep I here 8 the colonel stiffen in he chair and under he bulk even those ponderous timber quake a little once more donnegan gain a impression of chained activity ready to rise to any emergency the colonel 's jaw set and the last vestige of the smile leave he eye yet it be not anger that show in its place instead it be rather a hungry search he look keenly into the face and the soul of donnegan as a searchlight sweep over water by night you be a mind reader mr donnegan no more of a mind reader than a chinaman be ah they be great reader of mind my friend donnegan grin and at this the colonel frown a great and mysterious people sir i keep evidence of they always about I look he sweep the shaft of the reading light up and it fall upon a red vase against the yellow hanging even donnegan 's inexperienced eye read a price into that shimmering vase queer color he say dusty claret ah they have the only name for they color think peach bloom -- liquid dawn -- ripe cherry -- oil green -- green of powdered tea -- blue of the sky after rain -- what name for color what other land possess such a tongue that go straight to the heart the colonel wave he faultless hand and then drop they back upon the book with the tenderness of a benediction and they term for texture -- pear 's rind -- lime peel -- millet seed do not scoff at china mr donnegan she be the fairy godmother and we be the poor child he change the direction of the light donnegan watch he fascinate but what convinced you that i wish to keep you here to amuse you colonel macon the colonel expose gleam white tooth and laugh in that soft smooth-flowing voice amuse I for fifteen year i have sit in this room and amuse myself by take in what i would and shut out the rest of the world i have make the wall thick and pad they to keep out all sound you observe that there be no evidence here of the storm that be go on tonight amuse I indeed and donnegan thought of lou macon in she old drab dress huddle the poor cloak around she shoulder to keep out the cold while she father lounge here in luxury he could gladly have bury he lean finger in that fat throat from the first he have have a aversion to this man very well i shall go it have be a pleasant chat colonel very pleasant and thank you but before you go taste this whisky it will help you when you enter the wind he open a cabinet in the side of the chair and bring out a black bottle and a pair of glass and put they on the broad arm of the chair donnegan saunter back you see he murmur you will not let I go at this the colonel raise he head suddenly and glare into the eye of he guest and yet so perfect be he muscular and nerve control that he do not interrupt the thin stream of amber which trickle into one of the glass look down again he finish pour the drink they pledge each other with a motion and drink it be very old very oily and donnegan smile as he put down the empty glass sit down say the colonel in a new voice donnegan obey fate go on the colonel rule we life we give we honest endeavor but the decide touch be the hand of fate he garnish this absurd truism with a wave of he hand so solemn that donnegan be chill as though the fat man be actually conversant with the three sister fate have bring you to I therefore i intend to keep you here in my service i be about to place a great mission and a great trust in you hand in the hand of a man you know nothing about i know you as if i have raise you donnegan smile and shake he head the red hair flash and shimmer as long as there be no work attach to the mission it may be agreeable to I but there be work then the contract be break before it be make you be rash but i have rather begin with a dissent and then work upward donnegan wait to balance against work -- excuse I nothing balance against work for I to balance against work continue the colonel raise a white hand and by that gesture crush the protest of donnegan there be a great reward colonel macon i have never work for money before and i shall not work for it now you trouble I with interruption who mention money you shall not have a penny no the reward shall grow out of the work and the work be fight at this donnegan narrow he eye and search the fat man thoroughly it sound like the talk of a charlatan and yet there be a crispness to these sentence that make he suspect something underneath for that matter in certain district he name and he career be know he have never dream that that reputation could have come within a thousand mile of this part of the mountain desert you should have tell I in the first place he say with some anger that you know I mr donnegan upon my honor i never hear you name before my daughter utter it donnegan wait soberly i despise charlatanry as much as the next man you shall see the step by which i judge you when you enter the room i throw a strong light upon you you do not blanch you immediately walk straight into the shaft of light although you could not see a foot before you and that prove a combative instinct and coolness not the sort of brute vindictiveness that fight for a rage for a cool-minded love of conflict be that clear donnegan shrug he shoulder and above all i need a fighter then i watch you eye and you hand the first be direct and yet they be alert and you hand be perfectly steady qualification for a fighter eh do you wish further proof well what of the fight to the death which you go through this same night donnegan start it be a small movement that flinching and he cover it by continue the upward gesture of he hand to he coat he draw out tobacco and cigarette papers and commence to roll he smoke look up he see that the eye of colonel macon be smile although he face be grave a glint of understand pass between the two man but not a speak word i assure you there be no death tonight say donnegan at length tush of course not but the tear on the shoulder of you coat -- ah that be too smooth edge for a tear too long for the bite of a scissors be i right tush not a word the colonel beam with a almost tender pride and donnegan know that the fat man look upon he as a murderer newly come from a death consider the beam face and think many thing in silence so it be easy to see that in coolness courage fight instinct skill you be probably what i want yet something more than all these qualification be necessary for the task which lie ahead of you you pile up the bad feature eh to entice you donnegan for one man paint a rosy beginning and once under way he will manage the hard part for you show you the hard shell and you will trust it contain the choice flesh i be say that i wait to see other quality in you quality of the judgment and suddenly you flash upon I a single glance i feel it clash against my willpower i feel you look go past my guard like a rapier slip around my blade i colonel macon be for the first time outfaced out-maneuvered i admit it for i rejoice in meeting such a man and the next instant you tell I that i should keep you here out of my own wish admirable the admiration of the colonel indeed almost overwhelmed donnegan but he see that in spite of the genial smile the face suffuse with warmth the colonel be watch he every instant flinty-eyed donnegan do as he have do on the stair he burst into laughter when he have do the colonel be lean forward in he chair with he finger interlace examine he guest from beneath somber brow as he sit lurch forward he give a terrible impression of that reserved energy which donnegan have sense before donnegan say the colonel i shall talk no more nonsense to you you be a terrible fellow and donnegan know that for the first time in the colonel 's life he be meet another man upon equal ground 9 in a way it be a awful tribute for one great fact grow upon he : that the colonel represent almost perfectly the power of absolute evil donnegan be not a squeamish sort but the fat smile face of macon fill he with unutterable aversion a dozen time he would have leave the room but a silken thread hold he back the thought of lou i shall be terse and entirely frank say the colonel and at once donnegan rear triple guard and balanced himself for attack or defense between you and I go on the fat man deceptive word be folly a waste of energy he flush a little you be i believe the first man who have ever laugh at I the click of he tooth as he snap they on this sentence seem to promise that he should also be the last so i tear away the veil which make I ridiculous i grant you donnegan we have meet each other just in time true say donnegan you have a task for I that promise a lot of fight and in return i get lodgings for the night wrong wrong i offer you much more i offer you a career of action in which you may forget the great sorrow which have fall upon you : and in the battle which lie before you you will find oblivion for the sad past which lie behind you here donnegan spring to he foot with he hand catch at he breast and he stand quiver in a agony pain work he as anger would do and he slender frame swell he muscle taut he stand like a panther endure the torture because know it be folly to attempt to escape you be a human devil donnegan say at last and sink back upon he stool for a moment he be overcome he head fall upon he breast and even when he look up he face be terribly pale and he eye dull he expression however clear swiftly and aside from the perspiration which shine on he forehead it would have be impossible ten seconds later to discover that the blow of the colonel have fall upon he all of this the colonel have observe and note with grim satisfaction not once do he speak until he see that all be well i be sorry he say at length in a voice almost as delicate as the voice of lou macon i be sorry but you force I to say more than i wish to say donnegan brush the apology aside he voice become low and hurry let we get on in the matter i be eager to learn from you colonel very well since it seem that there be a place for both we interest in this matter i shall run on in my tale and make it as i promise you before absolutely frank and curt i shall not descend into small detail i shall give you a main sketch of the high point for all man of mind be apt to be confuse by the face of a thing whereas the heart of it be perfectly clear to they he settle into he narrative you have hear of the corner no well that be not strange but a few week ago gold be find in the sand where the valley of young muddy and christobel river join the corner be a long wide triangle of sand and the sand be fill with a gold deposit bring down from the headwater of both river and precipitate here where one current meet the other and reduce the resultant stream to sluggishness the sand be rich -- very rich he have become a trifle flush as he talk and now perhaps to cover he emotion he carefully select a cigarette from the humidor beside he and light it without haste before he speak another word long ago i prospect over that valley a few week ago it be bring to my attention again i determine to stake some claim and work they but i could not go myself i have to send a trustworthy man whom should i select there be only one possible jack landi be my ward a dozen year ago he parent die and they send he to my care for my fortune be then comfortable i raise he with as much tenderness as i could have show my own son i lavish on he the affection and -- here donnegan cough lightly the fat man pause and observe that this hypocrisy do not draw the veil over the bright eye of he guest he continue : in a word i make he one of my family and when the need for a man come i turn to he he be young strong active able to take care of himself at this donnegan prick he ear he go accordingly to the corner and stake the claim and file they as i direct i be right there be gold much gold it pan out in nugget he make a indescribable gesture and through he strong finger donnegan have a vision of yellow gold pour but there be seldom a discovery of importance claim by one man alone this be no exception a villain name william lester know as a scoundrel over the length and breadth of the cattle country claim that he have make the discovery first he even go so far as to claim that i have obtain my information from he and he try to jump the claim stake by jack landi whereupon jack very properly shoot lester down not dead unfortunately but slightly wound in the meantime the rush for the corner start in a week there be a village in a fortnight there be a town in a month the corner have become the talk of the range jack landi find in the claim a mint he send I back a mere souvenir the fat man produce from he vest pocket a little chunk of yellow and with a dexterous motion whip it at donnegan it be do so suddenly so unexpectedly that the wanderer be well-nigh take by surprise but he hand flash up and catch the metal before it strike he face he find in the palm of he hand a nugget weigh perhaps five ounce and he flick it back to the colonel he send I the souvenir but that be all since that time i have wait nothing have come i send for word and i learn that jack landi have betray he trust fall in love with some undesirable woman of the mining camp deny my claim to any of the gold to which i have send he unpleasant news yes ungrateful boy yes but my mind be harden against adversity yet this blow strike I close to the heart because landi be engage to marry my daughter lou at first i could hardly believe in he disaffection but the truth have at length be bear home to I the scoundrel have abandon both lou and I donnegan repeat slowly : you daughter love this chap the colonel allow he glance to narrow and he could do this the more safely because at this moment donnegan 's eye be wander into the distance in that unguarded second donnegan be defenseless and the colonel read something that set he beam she love he of course he say and he be break she heart with he selfishness he be break she heart echo donnegan the colonel raise he hand and stroke he enormous chin decidedly he believe that thing be get on very well this be the position he declare jack landi be threaten by the wretch lester and shoot he down but lester be not single-handed he belong to a wild crew lead by a mysterious fellow of whom no one know very much a deadly fighter it be say and a keen organizer and handler of man red-haired wild smooth a bundle of contradiction they call he lord nick because he have the pride of a nobleman and the cunning of the devil he have gather a few choose spirit and cool fighter -- the pedlar joe rix harry master -- all celebrate name in the cattle country they worship lord nick partly because he be a genius of crime and partly because he understand how to guide they so that they may rob and even kill with impunity he peculiarity be he ability to keep within the bound of the law if he commit a robbery he always first establish marvelous alibi and throw the blame toward someone else if it be the case of a kill it be always the other man who be the aggressor he have be before a jury half a dozen time but the devil know the law and plead he own case with a tongue that twist the heart out of the stupid juror you see no common man and this be the leader of the group of which lester be one of the most debased member he have no sooner be shoot than lord nick himself appear he have he follower with he he see jack landi threaten he with death and make jack swear that he would hand over half of the profit of the mine to the gang -- of which i suppose lester get he due proportion at the same time lord nick attempt to persuade jack that i he adopt father you might say be really in the wrong and that i have steal the claim from this wretched lester he wave this disgusting accusation into a mist and laugh with hateful softness the result be this : jack landi draw a vast revenue from the mine half of it he turn over to lord nick and lord nick in return give he absolute freedom and backing in the camp where he be and probably will continue the dominant factor as for the other half landi spend it on this woman with whom he have become infatuated and not a penny come through to I colonel macon lean back in he chair and he eye become fix upon a great distance he smile and the blood turn cold in the vein of donnegan of course this adventuress this nelly lebrun play hand in glove with lord nick and he troupe unquestionably she share she spoil so that nine-tenth of the revenue from the mine be really flow back through the hand of lord nick and jack landi have become a silly figurehead he strut about the street of the corner as a great mine owner and with the power of lord nick behind he not one of the people of the gambling house and dance hall dare cross he so that jack have come to consider himself a great man be it clear donnegan have not yet draw he gaze entirely back from the distance this be the possible solution go on the colonel jack landi must be draw away from the influence of this nelly lebrun he must be bring back to we and show he folly both as regard the adventuress and lord nick for so long as nelly have a hold on he just so long lord nick will have he hand in jack 's pocket you see how beautifully they plan and they work dovetail how therefore be i to draw he from nelly there be only one way : send my daughter to the camp -- send lou to the corner and let one glimpse of she beauty turn the shabby prettiness of this woman to a shadow lou be my last hope at this donnegan waken he sneer be not a pleasant thing to see send she to a new mining camp colonel macon you have the gambling spirit you be willing to take great chance so so murmur the colonel a little take aback but i should never send she except with a adequate protector a adequate protector even against these celebrated gunman who run the camp as you have already admit a adequate protector -- you be the man donnegan shiver i i take you daughter to the camp and play she against nelly lebrun to win back jack landi be that the scheme it be ah murmured donnegan and he get up and begin to walk the room white-face the colonel watch he in a silent agony of anxiety she truly love this landi ask donnegan swallow a love that have grow out of they long intimacy together since they be child bah calf love let the fellow go and she will forget he heart be not break in these day by disappointment in love affair the colonel writhe in he chair but lou -- you do not know she heart he suggest if you look closely at she you would have see that she be pale she do not suspect the truth but i think she be waste away because jack have not write for week he see donnegan wince under the whip it be true murmur the wanderer she be not like other heaven know he turn and what if i fail to bring over jack landi with the sight of lou the colonel relax the great crisis be past and donnegan would undertake the journey in that case my dear lad there be a expedient so simple that you astonish I by not perceive it if there be no way to wean landi away from the woman then get he alone and shoot he through the heart in that way you remove from the life of lou a man unworthy of she and you also make the mine come to the heir of jack landi -- namely myself and in the latter case mr donnegan be sure -- oh be sure that i should not forget who bring the mine into my hand 10 fifty mile over any sort of go be a stiff march fifty mile uphill and down and mostly over district where there be only a rough cow path in lieu of a road make a prodigious day 's work and certainly it be a almost incredible feat for one who profess to hate work with a consuming passion and who have look upon a eight-mile jaunt the night before as a insuperable burden yet such be the distance which donnegan have cover and now he drive the pack mule out on the shoulder of the hill in full view of the corner with the triangle of the young muddy and christobel river embrace the little town even the gaunt leggy mule be tire to the drop point and the tough buckskin which trail up behind go with downward head when louise macon turn to he he have reach the point where he swing he head around first and then grudgingly follow the movement with he body the girl be tired also in spite of the fact that she have cover every inch of the distance in the saddle there be that violet shade of weariness under she eye and she shoulder slump forward only donnegan the hater of labor be fresh they have start in the first dusk of the coming day it be now the yellow time of the slant afternoon sunlight between these two point there have be a body of steady plod the girl have look askance at that gaunt form of donnegan 's when they begin but before three hour see that the spring never leave he step nor the swing rhythm he stride she begin to wonder this afternoon nothing he do could have surprise she from the moment he enter the house the night before he have be a mystery till she death day she would not forget the fire with which he have stare up at she from the foot of the stair but when he come out of she father 's room -- not cow and whip as most man leave it -- he have look at she with a veil glance and since that moment there have always be a mist of indifference over he eye when he look at she in the beginning of that day 's march all she know be that she father trust she to this stranger donnegan to take she to the corner where he be to find jack landi and bring jack back to he old allegiance and find what he be do with he time and he money it be a quite natural proceeding for jack be a wild sort and he be probably gamble away all the gold that be dig in he mine it be perfectly natural throughout except that she should have be trust so entirely to a stranger that be a remarkable thing but then she father be a remarkable man and it be not the first time that he action have be inscrutable whether concern she or the affair of other people she have hear man come into they house cursing colonel macon with death in they face she have see they sneak out after a soft-voiced interview and never appear again in she eye she father be invincible all-powerful when she think of superlative she think of he she conception of mystery be the smile of the colonel and she conception of tenderness be bound by the gentle voice of the same man therefore it be entirely sufficient to she that the colonel have say : go and trust everything to donnegan he have the power to command you and you must obey -- until jack come back to you that be odd for as far as she know jack have never leave she but she have early discard any will to question she father curiosity be a thing which the fat man hate above all else therefore it be really not strange to she that throughout the journey she guide do not speak half a dozen word to she once or twice when she attempt to open the conversation he have reply with crush monosyllable and there be a end for the rest he be always swing down the trail ahead of she at a steady unchanging rapid stride uphill and down it never vary and so they come out upon the shoulder of the hill and see the storm center of the corner they be in the hill behind the town two mile would bring they into it and now donnegan come back to she from the mule he take off he hat and shake the dust away he brush a hand across he face he be still unshaven the red stubble make he hideous and the dust and perspiration cover he face as with a mask only he eye be rim with white skin you would better get off the horse here say donnegan he hold she stirrup and she obey without a word sit down she sit down on the flat-topped boulder which he designate and look up observe the first sign of emotion in he face he be frown and he face be draw a little you be tire he state a little you be tire say the wanderer in a tone that imply dislike of any denial therefore she make no answer i be go down into the town to look thing over i do not want to parade you through the street until i know where landi be to be find and how he 'll receive you the corner be a wild town you understand yes she say blankly and note nervously that the reply do not please he he actually scowl at she you 'll be all right here i 'll leave the pack mule with you if anything should happen -- but nothing be go to happen i 'll be back in a hour or so there be a pool of water you can get a cold drink there and wash up if you want to while i be go but do not go to sleep why not a place like this be sure to have a lot of straggler hunting around it bad character you understand she could not understand why he should make a mystery of it but then he be almost as strange as she father he careful english and he ragged clothes be typical of he inside and out you have a gun there in you holster can you use it yes try it it be a thirty-two a woman 's light weapon she take it out and balanced it in she hand the blue rock down the hillside let I see you chip it she hand go up and without pause to sight along the barrel she fire fire fly from the rock and there appear a white small scar donnegan sigh with relief if you squeeze the butt rather than pull the trigger he comment you would have make a bull 's - eye that time now i do not mean that in any likelihood you 'll have to defend yourself i simply want you to be aware that there be plenty of trouble around the corner yes say the girl you be not afraid oh no donnegan settle he hat a little more firmly upon he head he have be on the verge of attribute she gentleness to a blank stupid mind he begin to realize that there be metal under the surface he feel that some of the quality of the father be echo faintly and at a distance in the child in a way she make he think of a unawakened creature when she be rouse if the time ever come it might be that she eye could become a thing alternately of fire and ice and she voice might carry with a ring this business have to be get through quickly he go on one meeting with jack landi will be enough she wonder why he set he jaw when he say this but he be wonder how deeply the colonel 's ward have fall into the clutch of nelly lebrun if that first meeting do not bring landi to he sens what follow one of two thing either the girl must stay on in the corner and try she hand with she fianc again or else the final brutal suggestion of the colonel must be follow he must kill landi it be a cold-blooded suggestion but donnegan be a cold-blooded man as he look at the girl where she sit on the boulder he know definitely first and last that he love she and that he would never again love any other woman every instinct draw he toward the necessity of destroy landi there be he stumbling block but what if she truly love landi he would have to wait in order to find that out and as he stand there with the sun shine on the red stubble on he face he make a resolution the more profound because it be form in silence : if she truly love landi he would serve she hand and foot until she have she will but all he say be simply : i shall be back before it be dark i shall be comfortable here reply the girl and smile farewell at he and while donnegan go down the slope full of darkness he think of that smile the corner spread more clearly before he with every step he make it be a type of the gold-rush town of course most of the dwelling be tent -- dog tent many of they but there be a surprising sprinkling of wooden shack some of they of considerable size begin at the very edge of the town and spread over the sand flat be the mine and the black sprinkling of laborer and the town itself be roughly jumble around one street over to the leave the main road into the corner cross the wide shallow ford of the young muddy river and up this road he see half a dozen wagon come wagon of all size but nothing go out of the corner people who come stay there it seem he drop over the lower hill and the voice of the gold town rise to he it be a murmur like that of a army prepare for battle now and then a blast explode for what purpose he could not imagine in this school of mining but as a rule the sound be subdue by the distance he catch the muttering of many voice in which laughter and shout be bring to the level of a whisper at close hand and through all this there be a persistent clangor of metallic sound no doubt from the blacksmith shop where pick and other implement be make or sharpen and all sort of repair carry on but the predominant tone of the voice of the corner be this persistent ringing of metal it suggest to donnegan that here be a town fill with man of iron and all the gentler part of they nature forget a odd place to bring such a woman as lou macon surely he reach the level and enter the town 11 hunting for news he go naturally to the news emporium which take the place of the daily paper -- namely he go to the saloon but on the way he run through a liberal cross-section of the corner 's populace first of all the tent and the ruder shack he see little sheet-iron stove with the tin dish pile unwashed upon the top of they when the miner rush back to they work broken handle of pick and shovel worn-out shirt and overalls lay where they have be toss here be a flat strip of canvas support by four four-foot pole and without shelter at the side and the belongings of one careless miner tumble beneath this miserable shelter another man have strive for some semblance of a home and he have frame a five-foot walk lead up to the closed flap of he tent with stone of a regular size but nowhere be there a sign of life and would not be until semidarkness bring the unwilling worker back to the tent out of this district he pass quickly onto the main street and here there be a different atmosphere the first thing he see be a man dress as a cowpuncher from belt to spur -- spur on a miner -- but above the waist he blossom in a frock coat and a silk hat around the coat he have fasten he belt and the shirt beneath the coat be common flannel open at the throat he walk or rather stagger on the arm of a equally strange companion who be array in a white silk shirt white flannel trousers white dancing pump and a vast sombrero but as if this be not sufficient protection for he head he carry a parasol of the most brilliant green silk and twirl it above he head the two hold a waver course and go blindly past donnegan it be sufficiently clear that the storekeeper have follow the gold he note a cowboy sit in he saddle while he roll a cigarette obviously he have come in to look thing over rather than to share in the mining and he make the one sane critical note in the carnival of noise and color donnegan begin to pass store there be the jeweler 's the gent 's furnish a real estate office -- what could real estate be do on the young muddy 's desert here be the pawnshop the window of which be already pack the blacksmith have a great establishment and the roar of the anvil never die away feed and grain and a dozen lunch-counter restaurant all this have come to the corner within six week liquor seem to be plentiful too in the entire length of the street he hardly see a sober man except the cowboy half a dozen in one group pitch silver dollar at a mark but he be in the saloon district now and dominant among the rest be the big unpainted front of a building before which hang a enormous sign : lebrun 's joy emporium donnegan turn in under the sign it be one big room the bar stretch completely around two side of it the floor be dirt but pack to the hardness of wood the low roof be support by a scattering of wooden pillar and across the floor the gaming table be spread at that vast bar not ten man be drink now at the crowd table there be not half a dozen player yet behind the bar stand a dozen tender ready to meet the evening rush from the mine and at the table wait a equal number of the professional gambler of the house from the door donnegan observe these thing with one sweeping glance and then proceed to transform himself one jerk at the visor of he cap bring it down over he eye and cover he face with shadow a single shrug bunch the ragged coat high around he shoulder and the shoulder themselves he allow to drop forward with he hand in he pocket he glide slowly across the room toward the bar for all the world a picture of the guttersnipe who have be kick from pillar to post until self-respect be dead in he and pause in he advance he lean against one of the pillar and look hungrily toward the bar he be immediately hail from behind the bar with : hey you no tramp in here pay and stay in lebrun 's the command bring a immediate protest a big fellow step from the bar he sombrero push to the back of he head he shirt sleeve roll to the elbow away from vast hairy forearm one of he long arm sweep out and bring donnegan to the bar i be not no prophet declare the giant but i can spot a man that be dry what 'll you have bud and to the bartender he add : leave he be pardner unless you be all set for considerable noise in here long as he drink be pay for mutter the bartender here he stay but these floater do make I tired he jab the bottle across the bar at donnegan and spin a glass noisily at he and the floater observe the angry bartender with a frightened side glance and then pour he drink gingerly when the glass be half full he hesitate and seek the face of the bartender again for permission to go on fill she up command the giant fill she up lad and drink hearty i never yet observe the bartender darkly see a beggar that be not a hog at this donnegan 's protector shift he belt so that the holster come a little more forward on he thigh son he say how long you be in these part long enough declare the other and lower he black brow long enough to be sick of it maybe maybe return the cowpuncher-miner meantime you tie to this we get queer way out here when a gent drink with we he be we friend this lad here be my pardner just now if i be he i would of knock you head off before now for what you have say -- i do not want no trouble donnegan say whiningly at this the bartender chuckle and the miner show he tooth in he disgust every gent have get he own way he say sourly but while you drink with hal stern you drink with you chin up bud and do not forget it and they that try to run over you get to run over I say this he lay he large left hand on the bar and lean a little toward the bartender but he right hand remain hang loosely at he side it be near the holster as donnegan notice and the bartender have meet the boring glance of the big man for a moment turn surlily away the giant look to donnegan and observe : know a good definition of the word skunk nope say donnegan brighten now that the stern eye of the bartender be turn away here be one that might do a skunk be a critter that bite when you back be turn and run when you look it in the eye here be how he drain he own glass and donnegan dexterously follow the example and what might you be do around these part ask the big man veil he contempt under a mild geniality I oh nothing look for a job eh donnegan shrug work be not my line he confide h be - m-m say hal stern well you do not make no bone about it but just now continue donnegan i think maybe i would pick up some sort of a job for a while he look ruefully at the palm of he hand which be as tender as the hand of a woman hear a fellow say that jack landi be a good sort to work for -- do not rush he man none they say i might find he here the big man grunt too early for he he do not circulate around much till the sun go down kind of hard on he skin the sun maybe so you be go to work for he i be figure on it well tie to this bud if you work for he you will not have he over you no no you 'll have -- he glance a little uneasily around he -- lord nick who be he who be he the big man start in astonishment sufferin ' catamount who be he he laugh in a disagreeable manner well son you 'll find out right enough the way you talk he do not sound none too good hal stern grow anxious the way i talk have i say anything agin ' he not a word he be -- he be -- well there be not ever be trouble between we and there never be not go to be he flush and look steadily at donnegan maybe he send you to talk to I he ask coldly but donnegan 's eye take on a childish wideness why i never see he he declare hall stern allow the muscle of he face to relax all right he say they be no harm do but lord nick be a name that be not handle none too free in these here part remember that but how pondered donnegan can i be work for lord nick when i sign up to work under jack landi i 'll tell you how nick and lebrun work together split profit and nelly lebrun work landi for he dust so the stuff go in a circle -- landi to nelly to lebrun to nick that clear i do not quite see it murmured donnegan i do not think you would declare the other and snort he disgust but that be all i be go to say here come the boy -- and dead dry for the afternoon be verge upon evening and the first drift of laborer from the mine be pour into the corner one thing at least be clear to donnegan : that everyone know how infatuate landi have become with nelly lebrun and that landi have not build up a extraordinarily good name for himself 12 by the time absolute darkness have set in donnegan in the new role of lady 's chaperon sit before a die fire with louise macon beside he he have easily see from he talk with stern that landi be a public figure whether from the richness of he claim or he relation with lord nick and lebrun or because of all these thing but as a public figure it would be impossible to see he alone in he own tent and unless louise could meet he alone half she power over he -- suppose that she still retain any -- would be lose better by far that landi should come to she than that she should come to he so donnegan have rent two tent by the day at a outrageous figure from the enterprising real estate company of the corner and to this new home he bring the girl she accept the arrangement with surprising equanimity it seem that she father 's training have eliminate from she mind any question of the motive of other she become even cheerful as she set about arrange the pack which donnegan put in she tent afterward she cook they supper over the fire which he build for she never be there such a quick house-settling and by the time it be absolutely dark they have wash the dish and sit before lou 's tent look over the night light of the corner and hear the voice of its great white way open she have not even ask why he do not bring she straight to jack landi she have look into donnegan 's tent furnish with a single blanket and he canvas kit and have offer to share she pack with he and now they sit side by side before the tent and still she ask no question about what be to come she silence be to donnegan the drop of the water upon the hard rock he be crumble under it and a wild hatred for the colonel rise in he no doubt that spirit of evil have foresee all this and he know that every moment spend with the girl would drive donnegan on closer to the accomplishment of the colonel 's great purpose -- the death of jack landi for the colonel as jack 's next of kin would take over all he mining interest and free they at a stroke from the silent partnership which apparently exist with lord nick and lester one bullet would do all this : and with jack dead who else stand close to the girl it be only necessary that she should not know who speed the bullet home a horrible fancy grow up in donnegan as he sit there that between he and the girl lay a dead body he be glad when the time come and he could tell she that he be go down to the corner to find jack landi and bring he to she she rise to watch he go and he hear she say come soon it shock donnegan into realization that for all she calm exterior she be perfectly aware of the danger of she position in the wild mining camp she must know also that she reputation would be compromise yet never once have she wince and donnegan be fill with wonder as he go down the hill toward the camp which be spread beneath he for they tent be a little detach from the main body of the town behind she gentle eye he now feel and under the softness of she voice there be the same iron nerve that be in she father she hatred could be a deathless passion and she love also and the great question to be answer now be do she truly love jack landi the corner at night be like a scene at a circus there be the same rush of people the same irregular flush of light the same glimmer of lantern through canvas the same air of impermanence once in one of those hush which will fall upon every crowd he hear a coyote wail sharply and far away as though the desert have send out this voice to mock at the corner and all it contain he have only to ask once to discover where landi be : milligan 's dance hall before milligan 's place a bonfire burn from the beginning of dusk to the come of day and until the time when that fire be quench with bucket of water it be a sign to all that the merriment be under way in the dance hall if lebrun 's be the sun of the amusement world in the corner milligan 's be the moon everybody who have money to lose go to lebrun 's every one who be out for gayety go to milligan 's milligan be a plunger he have bring up a orchestra which demand fifteen dollar a day and he pay they that and more he not only be able to do this but he establish a bar at the entrance from which all who enter be serve with a free drink the entrance also be not subject to charge the initial drink at the door be spice to encourage thirst so milligan make money as fast and far more easily than if he have be digging it out of the ground to the door of this pleasure emporium come donnegan he have transform himself into the ragged hobo by the jerk down of he cap again and the hunching of he shoulder and shrink past the bar with a hungry sidewise glance as one who do not dare present himself for free liquor he enter milligan 's that be he have put he foot across the threshold when he be catch roughly by the shoulder and drag to one side he find himself look up into the face of a strapping fellow who serve milligan as bouncer milligan have a eye for color andy lewi be tolerably well know as a fight man of part who not only wear two gun but could use they both at once which be much more difficult than be generally understand but far more than for he fight part milligan hire he bouncer for the sake of he face it be a countenance make to discourage trouble maker a mule have kick lewi in the chin and a great white welt deform he lower lip scar of smallpox add to he decorative effect and he have those extremely bushy brow which for some reason be generally consider to denote ferocity now donnegan be not above middle height at best and in he present shrink attitude he find himself look up a full head into the formidable face of the bouncer and what be you do in here ask the genial andy do not you know this joint be for white folk i be not color murmured donnegan you take considerable yaller to I declare lewi he straightway chuckle and he own keen appreciation of he wit soften he expression what you want donnegan shiver under he rag i want to see jack landi he say it have a wonderful effect upon the doorkeeper donnegan find that the very name of landi be a charm of power in the corner you want to see he he query in amazement you he look donnegan over again and then grin broadly as if in anticipation well go ahead there he sit -- no he be dance the music be in full swing it be chiefly brass but now and then in softer moment one could hear a violin squeak uncertainly at least it go along with a marked regular rhythm and the dancer swirl industriously around the floor a very gay crowd color be apparently appreciate in the corner and donnegan standing modestly out of sight behind a pillar until the dance end note twenty phase of life in twenty face and donnegan see the flush of liquor and hear the loud voice of happy fellow who have make they strike but in all that brilliant crew he have no trouble in pick out jack landi and nelly lebrun they dance together and where they pass the other steer a little off so as to give they room on the dance floor as if the man fear that they might cross the formidable landi and as if the woman fear to be bring into too close comparison with nelly lebrun she be indeed a brilliant figure she have eye of the creole duskiness a delicate olive skin with a pastel color the hand on the shoulder of landi be a thing of fairy beauty and she eye have that peculiar quality of seem to see everything and rest on every face particularly so that as she whirl toward donnegan he wince feeling that she have find he out among the shadow she have a glorious partner to set she off and donnegan saw bitterly why lou macon could love he height without clumsiness bulk and a light foot at once a fine head well poise blond hair and a grecian profile -- such be jack landi he wear a vest of fawn skin he boot be black in the foot and finish with the softest red leather for the leg and he have yellow buckskin trousers lace in a mexican fashion with silver at the side a narrow belt a long red silk handkerchief fly from behind he neck in cowboy fashion so much flash splendor even in that gay assembly would have be childishly conspicuous on another man but in big jack landi there be patently a great deal of the unaffected child he be have a glorious time on this evening and he eye rove the room challenging admiration in a manner that be amusing rather than offensive he be so overflowingly proud of have the prettiest girl in the corner upon he arm and so conscious of be himself probably the finest-looking man that he escape conceit it might almost be say by he very excess of it upon this splendid individual then the obscure donnegan bent he gaze he see the dancer pause and scatter as the music end see they drift to the table along the edge of the room see the scurry of waiter hurry drink up in the interval see nelly lebrun sip a lemonade see jack landi toss off something stronger and then donnegan skirt around the room and come to the table of jack landi at the very moment when the latter be toss a gold piece to the waiter and give a new order prodigal son in the distance of thought be apt to be both silly : and disgusting but at close hand they usually dazzle the eye even the cold brain of donnegan be daunt a little as he draw near he come behind the chair of the tall master of the corner and while nelly lebrun stop she glass halfway to she lip and stare at the ragged stranger donnegan be whisper in the ear of jack landi : i have get to see you alone landi turn he head slowly and he eye darken a little as he meet the reddish unshaven face of the stranger then with a careless shrug of distaste he draw out a few coin and pour they into donnegan 's palm the latter pocket they lou macon say donnegan jack landi rise from he chair and it be not until he stand so close to donnegan that the latter realize the truly herculean proportion of the young fellow he bow he excuse to nelly lebrun not without grace of manner and then huddle donnegan into a corner with a wave of he vast arm now what do you want who be you who put that name in you mouth she be in the corner say donnegan and he dwell upon the face of jack landi with feverish suspense a moment later a great weight have slip from he heart if lou macon love landi it be beyond peradventure that landi be not break he heart because of the girl for at she name he flush darkly and then that rush of color fading he be leave with a white spot in the center of each cheek 13 first he glance plunge into vacancy then it flick over he shoulder at nelly lebrun and he bite he lip plainly it be not the most welcome news that jack landi have ever hear where be she he ask nervously of donnegan and he look over the ragged fellow again i 'll take you to she the big man sway back and forth from foot to foot balancing in he hesitation wait a moment he stride to nelly lebrun and bent over she donnegan see she eye flash up -- oh heart of the south what eye of shadow and fire jack landi tremble under the glance yes he be deeply in love with the girl and donnegan watch she face shade with suspicion stiffen with cold anger warm and soften again under the explanation of jack landi donnegan look from the distance could read everything it be nearness that bewitch a man when he talk to a woman when odysseus talk to circe no doubt he stand on the farther side of the room when landi come again he be perspire from the trial of fire through which he have just pass come he order and set out at a sweeping stride plainly he be anxious to get this matter do with as soon as possible as for donnegan he see a man whom landi have summon to take he place sit down at the table with nelly lebrun she be laugh with the newcomer as though nothing trouble she at all but over he shoulder she glance probe the distance and follow jack landi she want to see the messenger again the man who have call she companion away but in this it be fox challenging fox donnegan take note and be careful to place between he and the girl every pillar and every group of people as far as he be concern she first glance must do to read and judge and remember he by outside landi shoot several question at he in swift succession he want to know how the girl have happen to make the trip above all what the colonel be think and do and if the colonel himself have come but donnegan reply with monosyllable and landi apparently reconcile himself to the fact that the messenger be a fool cease he question they keep close to a run all the way out of the camp and up the hillside to the two detach tent where donnegan and the girl sleep that night a lantern burn in both the tent she have make thing ready for I think donnegan he heart open she have keep house for I he point out lou 's tent to he companion and the big man with a single low word of warn throw open the flap of the tent and stride in there be only the split part of a second between the rise and the fall of the canvas but in that swift interval donnegan see the girl start up to receive landi she calm be break at last she cheek be flush she eye be starry with what expectancy love it stop donnegan like a blow in the face and turn he heart to lead and then shamelessly he glide around the tent and drop down beside it to eavesdrop after all there be some excuse if she love the man he donnegan would let he live if she do not love he he donnegan would kill he like a worthless rat under heel that be if he could no wonder that the wanderer listen with heart and soul he miss the first greet it be only a jumble of exclamation but now he hear : but lou what a wild idea across the mountain -- with whom the man who bring you here who be he i do not know you do not know he look like a shifty little rat to I he be big enough jack such small praise be enough to set donnegan 's heart thump besides father tell I to go with he to trust he ah there be a abrupt chill and lower of landi ' voice the colonel know he he be one of the colonel 's man plainly the colonel be to he as the rod to the child why do not you come directly to I we think it would be better not to h be - m you guide -- well what be the colonel 's idea in send you here heaven above do not he know that a mining camp be no place for a young girl and you have not a sign of a chaperon lou what the devil can i do what be in he mind you have not write for a long time good lord write letter do he think i have time for letter the lie come smoothly enough work day and night donnegan smooth he whisker and grin into the night landi might prove better game than he have anticipate he worry say the girl and she voice be as even as ever he worry and send I to find out if anything be wrong then : nonsense what be there to worry about lou i be half inclined to think that the colonel do not trust I she do not answer be she read beneath the boisterous assurance of landi one thing be clear to I -- and to you too i hope the first thing be to send you back in a hurry still no answer lou do you distrust I at length she manage to speak but it be with some difficulty : there be another reason for send I tell I can not you guess jack i be not a mind reader the cad say donnegan through he tooth it be the old reason money yes a shadow sweep across the side of the tent it be landis wave he arm carelessly if that be all i can fix you up and send you back with enough to carry the colonel along look here -- why i have five hundred with I take it lou there be more behind it but the colonel must not think that there be as much money in the mine as people say no idea how much live cost up here heaven no and the price for labor and then they shirk the job from dawn to dark i have to watch 'em every minute i tell you he sigh noisily but the end of it be dear -- how that small word tear into the heart of donnegan who crouch outside -- that you must go back tomorrow morning i would send you tonight if i could as a matter of fact i do not trust the red-haired rat who -- the girl interrupted while donnegan still have control of he hair-trigger temper you forget jack father send I here but he do not tell I to come back at this jack landi burst into a enormous laughter you do not mean lou that you actually intend to stay on what else can i mean of course it make it awkward if the colonel do not expressly tell you just what to do i suppose he leave it to my discretion and i decide definitely that you must go back at once i can not do it lou do not you hear I say that i 'll take the responsibility if you father blame you let he tell I -- he break down in the middle of he sentence and another of those uncomfortable little pause ensue donnegan know that they eye be miserably upon each other the man tongue-tie by he guilt the girl wretchedly guess at the thing which lay behind she fianc 's word i be sorry you do not want I here it be not that but -- he apparently expect to be interrupted but she wait coolly for he to finish the sentence and of course he could not after all for a helpless girl she have a devilish effective way of muzzling landi donnegan chuckle softly in admiration all at once she break through the scene she voice do not rise or harden but it be fill with finality as though she be weary of the interview i be tire out it be be a hard ride jack you go home now and look I up again any time tomorrow i -- lou -- i feel mighty bad about have you up here in this infernal tent when the camp be full and -- : you can not lie across the entrance to my tent and guard I jack besides i do not need you for that the man who be with I will protect I he do not look capable of protect a cat my father say that in any circumstance he would be able to take care of I this reply seem to overwhelm landi the colonel trust he as far as all that he mutter then i suppose you be safe enough but what about comfort lou i have do without comfort all my life run along jack and take this money with you i can not have it but do not the colonel send -- you can express it through to he to I it be -- not pleasant to take it why lou you do not mean -- good night jack i do not mean anything except that i be tire the shadow sweep along the wall of the tent again donnegan with a shake pulse see the profile of the girl and the man approach as he strive to take she in he arm and kiss she good night and then one slender bar of shadow check landi not tonight lou you be not angry with I no but you know i have queer way just put this down as one of they i can not explain there be a muffle exclamation and landi go from the tent and stride down the hill he be instantly lose in the night but donnegan turn to the entrance flap call softly he be bid to come in and when he raise the flap he see she sit with she hand clasp loosely and rest upon she knee she lip be a little parted and colorless she eye be dull with a mist and though she rally herself a little the wanderer could see that she be only half-aware of he the face which he see be a milestone in he life for he have love she jealously fiercely before but see she now daze hurt and uncomplaining tenderness come into donnegan it spread to he heart with a strange pain and make he hand tremble all that he say be : be there anything you need nothing she reply and he back out and away but in that small interval he have turn out of the course of he gay selfish life if jack landi have hurt she like this -- if she love he so truly -- then jack landi she should have there be a odd mixture of emotion in donnegan but he feel most nearly like the poor man from whose hand he daughter tug back and look wistfully hopelessly into the bright window at all the toy what pain be there greater than the pain that come to the poor man in such a time he huddle he coat about he for he heart be as cold as a christmas day and if it would make he child happy he would pour out he heart 's blood on the snow such be the grief of donnegan as he back slowly out into the night though jack landi be fix as high as the moon he would tear he out of he place and give he to the girl 14 the lantern go out in the tent she be asleep and when he know that donnegan go down into the corner he have be try to think out a plan of action and finding nothing better than to thrust a gun stupidly under landi ' nose and make he mark time donnegan go into lebrun 's place as if he hope the bustle there would supply he with idea lebrun 's be go full blast it be not fill with the shrill mirth of milligan 's instead all voice be subdue to a point here the pitch be never raise if a man laugh he might show he tooth but he take good care that he do not break into the atmosphere of the room for there be a deadly undercurrent of silence which would not tolerate more than murmur on the part of other man sit grim-faced over the card the man who be win with he cold eager eye the chronic loser of the night with he iron smile the professional ever debonair with the dull eye which come from look too often and too closely into the terrible face of chance a very keen observer might have observe a resemblance between those man and donnegan donnegan rove swiftly here and there the calm eye and the smooth play of a obvious professional in a linen suit keep he for a moment at one table look on then he go to the game and after change the gold which jack landi have give as alms so silver dollar he lose it with precision upon the wheel he go on from table to table from group to group in lebrun 's he clothes be not notice it be no matter whether he play or do not play whether he win or lose they be too busy to notice but he come back at length to the man who wear the linen coat and who win so easily something in he method of deal appear to interest donnegan greatly it be jackpot the chip be pile high and the man in the linen coat be deal again how deftly he mix the card indeed all about he be elegant from the turn of he black cravat to the cut of the coat a inebriate pass shouldered and disturbed he chair and rise to put it straight again the gambler be see to be about the height and build of donnegan donnegan study he with the interest of a artist here be a man hark back to nelly lebrun and she love of brilliance who would probably win she preference over jack landi for the simple reason that he be different that be there be more in he cravat to attract astonished attention in the corner than there be in all the silver lace of landi and he be a man 's man no doubt of that on the inebriate he have flash one glance of fire and he lean hand have stir uneasily toward the breast of he coat donnegan who miss nothing saw and understand interested he be fascinate by this man because he recognize the kinship which exist between they they might almost have be blood brother except for difference in the face he know for instance just what each glance of the man in the linen coat mean and how he be weigh he antagonist as for the other they be cool player themselves but here they have meet they master it be the difference between the amateur and the professional they play good chancey poker but the man in the linen coat do more -- he stack the card for the first moment donnegan be not sure it be not until there be a slight falter in the deal -- a infinitely small hesitation which only a practice eye like that of donnegan 's could have notice -- that he be sure the winner be crooked yet the hand be interesting for all that he have do the master trick not only give himself the win hand but also give each of the other a fine set of card and the bet be wild on that historic pot to begin with the smallest hand be three of a kind and after the draw the weakest be a straight and they bet furiously the stranger have pique they with he consistent victory now they be out for blood chip have be exhaust solid gold be pile up on the table -- a small fortune the man in the linen coat in the middle of the hand call for drink they drink they go on with the bet and then at last come the call donnegan could have clap he hand to applaud the smooth rascal it be not a affair of break the other who sit in they be all prosperous mine owner and probably they have be carefully select accord to the size of purse in preparation for the sacrifice but the stake be sweep into the arm and then the canvas bag of the winner if it be not enough to ruin the miner it be at least enough to clean they out of ready cash and discontinue the game on that basis they rise they go to the bar for a drink but while the winner lead the way two of the loser drop back a trifle and fall into earnest conversation frown donnegan know perfectly what the trouble be they have notice that slight falter in the deal they be put they mental note on the game together but the winner apparently unconscious of suspicion line up he victim at the bar the first drink go hastily down the second be on the way -- it be stand on the bar and here he excuse himself he break off in the very middle of a story and tell they that he would be back any moment step into a crowd of newcomer the moment he disappear donnegan see the other four put they head close together and see a sudden darkening of face but as for the genial winner he have no sooner pass to the other side of the crowd and out of view than he turn directly toward the door he careless saunter be exchange for a brisk walk and donnegan without make himself conspicuous be hard press to follow that pace at the door he find that the gambler with he canvas sack under he arm have turn to the right toward the line of saddle horse which stand in the shadow and no sooner do he reach the gloom at the side of the building than he break into a soft swift run he dart down the line of horse until he come to one which be already mount this donnegan see as he follow somewhat more leisurely and closer to the horse to avoid observance he make out that the man already on horseback be a big negro and that he have turn he own mount and a neighboring horse out from the rest of the horse so that they be both point down the street of the corner donnegan see the negro throw the line of he lead horse into the air in exchange he catch the sack which the runner toss to he and then the gambler leap into he saddle it be a simple but effective plan suppose he be catch in the midst of a cheat he play would be to break away to the outside of the building shooting out the light if possible -- trust to the confusion to help he -- and there he would find he horse hold ready for he at a time when a second might be priceless on this occasion no doubt the clever rascal have sense the suspicion of the other at any rate he lose no time he wait neither to find he stirrup nor grip the rein firmly but the same athletic leap which carry he into the saddle set the horse in motion and from a standing start the animal break into a headlong gallop he receive however a additional burden at once for donnegan from the second time he see the man of the linen coat have be revolve a daring plan and during the poker game the plan have slowly mature the moment he make sure that the gambler be head for a horse he increase he own speed ordinarily he would have be note but now no doubt the gambler fear no pursuit except one accompany by a hue and cry he do not hear the shadow-footed donnegan racing over the soft ground behind he but when he have gain the saddle donnegan be close behind with the impetus of he run to aid he it be comparatively simple therefore to spring high in the air and he strike fairly and squarely behind the saddle of the man in the linen coat when he land he revolver be in he hand and the muzzle jab into the back of the gambler the other make one frantic effort to twist around then recognize the pressure of the revolver and be still the horse check they gallop in unison be softly dog-trotting down the street call off you man warn donnegan for the big negro have rein back the gun already gleam in he hand a gesture from the gambler send the gun into obscurity yet still the fellow continue to fall back tell he to ride ahead keep in front george and not too far very well and now we 'll talk later go straight on george to the clump of tree beyond the end of the street and ride straight no dodge it be a good hand you play continue donnegan take note that of the many people who be now pass they none pay the slightest attention to two man ride on one horse and chat together as they ride it be a good hand but a bad deal you thumb slip on the card eh you see eh mutter the other and two of the other see it but they be not sure till afterward i know the blockhead but i spoil they game for they be you one of we pal but donnegan smile to himself for once at least the appeal of gambler to gambler should fail keep straight on he say we 'll talk later on 15 before donnegan give the signal to halt in a clear space where the starlight be least indistinct they reach the center of the tree now george he say drop you gun to the ground there be a flash and faint thud now the other gun they be not any more sir you other gun repeat donnegan a little pause do what he tell you george say the gambler at length and a second weapon fall now keep on you horse and keep a little off to the side go on donnegan and remember that if you try to give I the jump i might miss you in this light but i would be sure to hit you horse so do not take chance george now sir just hold you hand over you head and then dismount he have already go through the gambler and take he weapon he be now obey the man of the linen coat toss up he arm fling he right leg over the horn of the saddle and slip to the ground donnegan join he captive i warn you first he say gently that i be quite expert with a revolver and that it will be highly dangerous to attempt to trick I lower you arm if you wish but please be careful of what you do with you hand there be such thing as knife throw i know but it take a fast wrist to flip a knife faster than a bullet we understand each other perfectly agree the other by the way my name be godwin and suppose we become frank you be in temporary distress it be impossible for you to make a loan at the moment and you be drive to this force -- touch now if half -- hush say donnegan you be too generous but the present question be not one of money i have long since pass over that the money be now mine steady this to george who lurch in the saddle but godwin be calm as stone it be not the question of the money that trouble I but the question of the man i could easily handle one of you but i fear to allow both of you to go free you would return on my trail there be such thing as waylaying by night eh and so mr godwin i think my best way out be to shoot you through the head when you body be find it will be take for grant that the servant kill the master for the sake of the money which he win by crooked card play i think that be simple put you hand up george or by heck i 'll let the starlight shine through you the huge arm of george be raise above he head godwin in the meantime have not speak i almost think you mean it he say after a short pause good say donnegan i do not wish to kill you unprepared there be a strangle sound deep in the throat of godwin then he be able to speak again but now he voice be make into a horrible jumble by fear pal he say you be dead wrong george here -- he be a devil if you let he live he 'll kill you -- as sure as you be stand here you do not know he he be george green he be get a record as long as my arm and as bad as the devil 's name he -- he be the man to get rid of I why man you and i could team it together but george -- not -- donnegan begin to laugh and the gambler stammer to a halt i know you when i lay eye on you for the first time say donnegan you have the hand of a craftsman but you eye be put too close together a coward 's eye -- a cur 's face godwin but you george -- have you hear what he say no answer from george but a snarl it sound logical what he say eh george dead silence but say donnegan there be flaw in the plan godwin get out of you clothes the other fall on he knee for heaven 's sake he plead shut up command donnegan i be not go to shoot you i never intend to you fool but i want to see if you be worth splitting the coin with you be not now get out of you clothes he be obey in fumble haste and while that operation go on he succeed in jump out of he own rag and still keep the two fairly steadily under the nose of he gun he toss this bundle to godwin who accept it with a faint oath and donnegan step calmly and swiftly into the clothes of he victim a perfect fit he say at length and to show that i be pleased here 's you purse back must be close to two hundred in that from the weight godwin mutter some unintelligible curse tush now get out if you show you face in the corner again some of those miner will spot you and they 'll dress you in tar and feather you fool if they see you in my clothes they 'll never see these after tonight probably you have other clothes in you pack godwin lot of 'em you be the sort who know how to dress and i 'll borrow you outfit get out the other make no reply a weight seem to have fall upon he along with he new outfit and he slink into the darkness george make a move to follow there be a muffle shriek from godwin who flee headlong and then a sharp command from donnegan stop the big man come here say donnegan george washington green ride slowly closer if i let you go what would you do there be a glint of tooth i would find he and break he in two eh instead i be go to take you home where you 'll have a chance of break I in two instead there be something about the cut of you shoulder and you head that i like green and if you do not murder I in the first hour or so i think we 'll get on very well together you hear the silence of george washington green be a tremendous thing now ride ahead of I i 'll direct you how to go he go first straight back through the town and up the hill to the two tent he make george go before he into the tent and take up the roll of bedding and then with george and the bedding lead the way and donnegan lead the two horse behind they go across the hillside to a shack which he have see vacate that evening it certainly could not be rent again before morning and in the meantime donnegan would be in possession which be a large part of the law in the corner as he know a little lean-to against the main shack serve as a stable the creek down the hillside be the watering trough and donnegan stand by while the big negro silently tend to the horse -- remove the pack and prepare they for the night still in silence he produce a small lantern and light it it show he face for the first time -- the skin ebony black and polish over the cheekbone but the rest of the face almost handsome except that the slight flare of he nostril give he a cast of inhuman ferocity and the fierceness be give point by a pair of arm of gorilla length broad shoulder pad with roll muscle and the neck of a bull on the whole donnegan a connoisseur of fight man have never see such promise of strength at he gesture george lead the way into the house it be more commodious than most of the shack of the corner in place of a single room this have two compartment -- one for the kitchen and another for the living room in vacate the hut the last occupant have leave some of the furnishings behind they there be a mirror for instance in the corner and beneath the mirror a cheap table in whose open drawer appear a tumble of papers donnegan drop the heavy sack of godwin 's winnings to the floor and while george hang the lantern on a nail on the wall donnegan cross to the table and appear to run through the papers he be hum carelessly while he do it but all the time he watch with catlike intensity the reflection of george in the mirror above he he see -- rather dimly for the cheap glass show all its image in wave -- that george turn abruptly after hang up the lantern pause and then whip a hand into he coat pocket and out again donnegan leap lightly to one side and the knife hiss past he head bury itself in the wall and its vibration set up a vicious hum as for donnegan the leap that carry he to one side whirl he about also he face the big man who be now crouch in the very act of follow the knife cast with the lunge of he powerful body there be no weapon in donnegan 's hand and yet george hesitated balanced -- and then slowly draw himself erect he be puzzle a outburst of oath the flash of a gun and he would have be at home in the brawl but the silence the smile of donnegan and the steady glance be too much for he he moisten he lip and yet he could not speak and donnegan know that what paralyze george be the manner in which he have receive warn evidently the simple explanation of the mirror do not occur to the fellow and the whole incident take on supernatural coloring a phrase of explanation and donnegan would become again a ordinary human being but while the small link be a mystery the brain and body of george be numb it be necessary above all to continue inexplicable donnegan turn draw the knife from the wall with a jerk half the length of the keen blade have sink into the wood -- a mute tribute to the force and speed of george 's hand -- and now donnegan take the bright little weapon by the point and give it back to the other if you throw for the body instead of the head say donnegan you have a better chance of send the point home he turn he back again upon the gaping giant and draw up a broken box before the open door he sit down to contemplate the night not a sound behind he it might be that the big fellow have regain he nerve and be steal up for a second attempt but donnegan would have wager he soul that george washington green have he first and last lesson and that he would rather play with bare lightning than ever again cross he new master at length : when you make down the bunk say donnegan put mine farthest from the kitchen you have better do that first yes -- sir come the deep bass murmur behind he and the heart of donnegan stir for that sir mean many thing presently george cross the floor with a burden there be the whish of the blanket be unrolled -- and then a slight pause it seem to he that he could hear a heavier breathing why and search swiftly back through he memory he recall that he other gun a stub-nosed thirty-eight be in the center of he blanket roll and he know that george have the weapon in he big hand one pressure of the trigger would put a end to donnegan one bullet would give george the canvas sack and its small treasure when you clean my gun say donnegan take the action to piece and go over every part he could actually feel the start of george then : yes sir in a subdue whisper if the escape from the knife have startle george this second incident have convince he that he new master possess eye in the back of he head and donnegan pay no further heed to he look steadily across the hillside to the white tent of lou macon fifty yard away 16 he plan grow to full stature so swiftly and spring out of nothing well nigh have come out of he first determination to bring jack landi back to lou macon for he could interpret those blank misty eye with which she have sit after the departure of landi in only one way yet to rule even the hand of big jack landi would be hard enough and to rule he heart be quite another story remember nelly lebrun he see clearly that the only way in which he could be bring back to lou be first to remove nelly as a possibility in he eye but how remove nelly as long as it be she cue from she father to play landi for he money how remove she unless it be possible to sweep nelly off she foot with another man she might indeed be take by storm and if she once slight landi for the sake of another he boyish pride would probably do the rest and he next step would be to return to lou macon all this seem logical but where find the man to storm the heart of nelly and dazzle she bright clever eye he own rag have make he shrug he shoulder and it be the thought of clothes which have make he fasten he attention so closely on the man of the linen suit in lebrun 's donnegan with money with well-fitted clothes and with a few notorious escapade behind he -- yes donnegan with such a fly start might flutter the heart of nelly lebrun for a moment but he must have the money the clothes and then he must deliberately set out to startle the corner make himself a public figure talk of pointed at known fear respect and even love by at least a few he must accomplish all these thing begin at a literal zero it be the impossible nature of this that tempt donnegan but the paradoxical picture of the ragged skulker in milligan 's actually sit at the same table with nelly lebrun and receive she smile stay with he he intend to rise literally phoenixlike out of ash and the next morning in the red time of the dawn he sit drink the coffee which george washington green have make for he and consider the detail of the problem clothes which have be a main obstacle be now account for since as he have suspect the pack of godwin contain a luxurious wardrobe of considerable compass at that moment for instance donnegan be wrap in a dress gown of padded silk and he foot be encase in slipper but clothes be the least part of he worry to startle the corner and thereby make himself attractive in the eye of nelly lebrun overshadow jack landi -- that be the thing but to startle the corner where gold strike be event of every twenty-four hour just now -- where robbery be common gossip and where the killing now average nearly three a day -- to startle the corner be like try to startle the theatrical world with a sensational play indeed this parallel could have be pursue for donnegan be the nameless actor and the mountain desert be the stage on which he intend to become a headliner no wonder then that he lean face be compress in thought yet no one could have guess it by he conversation at the moment he be interrupted he talk run somewhat as follow george godwin teach you how to make coffee yes sir from george since the night before he have appear totally subdue never once do he venture a comment and ever donnegan be conscious of big bright eye watch he in a reverent fear not untinged by superstition once in the middle of the night he have waken and see the vast shadow of george 's form lean over the sack of money murder by stealth in the dark have be in the giant 's mind no doubt but when after that he come and lean over donnegan 's bunk the master close he eye and keep on breathing regularly and finally george return to he own place -- softly as a gigantic cat even in the master 's sleep he find something to be dread and donnegan know that he could now trust the fellow through anything in the morning at the first touch of light he have go to the store and collect provision and a comfortable breakfast follow godwin resume donnegan be talent in many way the big man show he tooth in silence for since godwin propose the sacrifice of the servant to preserve himself george have apparently alter he opinion of the gambler a talented man george but he know nothing about coffee it should never boil it should only begin to cream through the crust let that happen take the pot from the fire put it back and let the surface cream again do this three time and then pour the liquid from the grounds and you have the right strength and the right heating you understand yes sir and concern the fry of bacon -- at this point the interruption come in the shape of four man at the open door and one of these donnegan recognize as the real estate dealer who have shrewdly set up tent and shack on every favorable spot in the corner and be now reap a rich harvest gloster be he name it be patent that he do not see in the man in the silk dress robe the unshaven miscreant of the day before who have rent the two tent how ` dee he say standing on the threshold with the other three in the background donnegan look at he and through he my name be gloster i own this shack and i have come to find out why you be in it george say donnegan speak to he tel he that i know house be scarce in the corner that i find this place by accident vacant that i intend to stay in it on purpose george washington green instantly rise to the situation he swallow a vast grin and stride to the door and though mr gloster 's face crimson with rage at such treatment he control he voice in the corner manhood be apt to be reckon by the pound and george be a giant i hear what you boss say buddie say gloster but i have rent this cabin and the next one to these three gent and they party and they want a home nothing to do but vacate which speed be the thing i want thirty minute will -- thirty minute do not change nothing declare george in he deep soft voice the real estate man choke then : you tell you boss that jump a cabin be like jump a claim they be a law in the corner for gent like he george make a gesture of helplessness but gloster turn to the three both shack or none at all say the spokesman one be not big enough to do we any good but if this bird will not vamoose -- he be a tolerably rough-appearing sort and he be back by two of a kind no doubt dangerous action would have follow have not george show himself capable of rise to a height he step from the door he approach gloster and say in a confidential whisper that reach easily to the other three : they be not any call for a quick play mister watch yo ` self maybe you do not know who the boss be and what be more i do not care say gloster defiantly but with he voice instinctively lower he stare past george and behold the man in the dress gown still sit in quiet and sip he coffee it be donnegan whisper george don -- who be he you do not know donnegan the mingled contempt and astonishment of george would have move a thing of stone it certainly trouble gloster and he turn to the three gent he say they 's two thing we can do try the law -- and law 's a lame lady in these part -- or throw he out say which the three look from gloster to the shack from the shack to donnegan absently sip he coffee from donnegan to george who stand exhibit a broad grin of anticipated delight the contrast be too much for they there be one great and deep-seated terror in the mountain desert and that be for the man who may be other than he seem the giant with the rough voice and the boisterous way be generally due for a stormy passage west of the rocky but the silent man with the gentle manners receive respect tradition live of desperado with exterior of womanish calm and the action of devil and donnegan sip he morning coffee fit into the picture which rumor have paint the three look at one another declare that they have not come to fight for a house but to rent one that the real estate agent could go to the devil for all of they and that they be bind elsewhere so they depart and leave gloster both relieved and gloomy now say donnegan to george tell he that we 'll take both the shack and he can add fifty per cent to he old price the bargain be conclude on the spot the money be pay by george gloster go down the hill to tell the corner that a mystery have hit the town and george bring the canvas bag back to donnegan with the top still untie -- as though to let it be see that he have not pocket any of the gold i do not want to count it say donnegan keep the bag george keep money in you pocket treat both of we well and when that be go i 'll get more if the manner in which donnegan have handle the renting of the cabin have charm george he be wholly entranced by this last touch of free spending to serve a man who be he master be one thing to serve one who trust he so completely be quite another to live under the same roof with a man who be a riddle be sufficiently delightful but to be allow actually to share in the mystery be a superhappiness he be singing when he start to wash the dish and donnegan go across the hill to the tent of lou macon she be lay the fire before the tent and the morning freshness have clear from she face any vestige of the trouble of the night before and in the slant light she hair be glorious all ruffle gold semitransparent she do not smile at he but she could give the effect of smile while she face remain grave it be she inward calm content of which people be aware you miss I yes you be worry no he feel himself put quietly at a distance so he take she up the hill to she new home -- the shack beside he own and george cook she breakfast when she have be serve donnegan draw the big man to one side she be you mistress say donnegan everything you do for she be worth two thing you do for I watch she as if she be in you eye and if a hair of she head be ever harm -- you see that fire burning yonder -- the bed of coal sir i 'll catch you and make a fire like that and feed you into it -- by inch and the pale face of donnegan become for a instant the face of a demon george washington green saw and never forget afterward in order that he might think donnegan get on one of the horse he have take from godwin and ride over the hill they be both leggy chestnut with surprising sign of blood ' and all the earmark of sprinter but in godwin 's trade sharp getaway be probably often necessary the pleasure he take in the action of the animal keep he from get into he problem how to startle the corner how follow up the opening gun which he have fire at the expense of gloster and the three miner he break off later in the day to write a letter to colonel macon inform he that jack landi be tie hard and fast by nelly lebrun and that for the present nothing could be do except wait unless the colonel have suggestion to offer the thought of the colonel however stimulate donnegan and before midafternoon he have think of a thing to do 17 the bar in milligan 's be not nearly so pretentious a affair as the bar in lebrun 's but it be of a far higher class milligan have even manage to bring in a few bottle of wine and he have dispense cheap claret at two dollar a glass when the miner wish to celebrate a rare occasion there be complaint not of the taste but of the lack of strength so milligan fortify he liquor with pure alcohol and after that the claret go like a sweet song in the corner among other thing he sell mint julep and it be the memory of the big sign proclaim this fact that furnished donnegan with he idea he have george washington green put on he town clothes -- a ride suit in which godwin have have he dress for the sake of formal occasion resplendent in black boot yellow ride breeches and blue silk shirt the big man come before donnegan for instruction go down to milligan 's say the master they do not allow color people to enter the door but you go to the door and start for the bar they will not let you go very far when they stop you tell they you come from donnegan and that you have to get I some mint for a julep insist the bouncer will start to throw you out george show he tooth no fighting back do not lift you hand when you find that you can not get in come back here now ride so george mount the horse and go straight to milligan 's he ride and dismount and half of the corner 's scant daytime population come into the street to see the brilliant horseman pass scar-faced lewi meet the big man at the door and size mean little to andy except a easier target well confound my soul say lewi block the way a negro in milligan 's get out big george do not move i be send mister he say mildly i be send for enough mint to make a julep you be send to the wrong place declare andy hitch at he cartridge belt be not you see that sign and he point to the one which eliminate color patron sign do not mean nothin ' to my boss say george who be he donnegan and who be donnegan it puzzle george he scratch he head in bewilderment seek for a explanation donnegan be -- donnegan he explain i hear gloster talk about he offer someone in the rapidly grow group he be the gent that rent the two place on the hill tell he to come himse ' f say andy lewi we do not play no favorite at milligan 's mister say big george i do not want to bring no trouble on this heah place but -- do not make I go back and bring donnegan even andy lewi be stagger by this assurance rule be rule he finally decide and out you go big george step from the doorway and mount he horse i call on all you gen ` leman he say to the assemble group to say that i do try my best to do this peaceable it be not I that be send for donnegan it be he he ride away leave scar-faced lewi bite he long mustach in anxiety he be not exactly afraid but he wait in the suspense which come before a battle moreover a audience be gather the word go about as only a rumor of mischief can travel new man have gather the few day gambler tumble out of lebrun 's across the street to watch the fun the storekeeper be in they door lebrun himself wither and dark and yellow of eye come to watch and here and there through the crowd there be a spot of color where the woman of the town appear and among other nelly lebrun with jack landi beside she on the whole it be not a large crowd but what it lack in size it make up in intense interest for though the corner have have its share of trouble of fist and gun most of they be entirely impromptu affair here be a fight in the offing for which the stage be set the actor set in full view of a conveniently post audience and all the suspense of a curtain rise the wait bear in upon andy lewi without a doubt he intend to kill he man neatly and with dispatch but the possibility of miss before such a crowd as this send a chill up and down he spine if he fail now he name would be a sign for laughter ever after in the corner a hum pass down the street it rise to a chuckle and then fall away to sudden silence for donnegan be come he come on a prance chestnut horse which sidle uneasily on a weave course as though it wish to show off for the benefit of the rider and the crowd at once it be a hot afternoon and donnegan 's linen ride suit shine a immaculate white he come straight down the street as unaware of the audience which await he as though he ride in a park where crowd be the common thing behind he come george green just a careful length back rumor go before the two with a whisper on either side that be donnegan there he come who be donnegan gloster 's man the one who bluff out gloster and three other he pull he shooting iron and trim the whisker of one of 'em with a chunk of lead d'you mean that what be that kind of a gent do in the corner come to buy i guess he look like money look like a confound dude we 'll see he hand in a minute donnegan be now opposite the dance hall and andy lewi have he hand touch the butt of he gun but though donnegan be look straight at he he keep he rein in one hand and he heavy ride crop in the other and without a move toward he own gun he ride straight up to the door of the dance hall with andy in front of it george draw rein behind he and turn upon the crowd one broad superior grin as who should say : i promise you lightning now watch it strike if the crowd have be expectant before it be now reduce to wire-drawn tenseness be you the fellow who turn back my man ask donnegan he quiet voice fall coldly upon the soul of andy he strive to warm himself by a outbreak of temper they be not any poor fool dude can call I a fellow he shout the crowd blink but when it open its eye the gunplay have not occur the hand of andy be relax from the butt of he gun and a expression of astonishment and contempt be grow upon he face i have not come to curse you say the rider still occupy he hand with crop and rein i have come to ask you a question and get a answer be you the fellow who turn back my man i guess you be not the kind i be expectin ' to call on I drawl andy he fear go and he wink at the crowd but the other be not yet ready to laugh something about the calm face of donnegan have impress they sure i be the one that kick he out he be not allow in there it be the last of my thought to break in upon a convention in you city reply the grave rider but my man be send on a errand and therefore he have a right to expect courtesy george get off you horse and go into milligan 's place i want that mint for a moment andy be too stunned to answer then he voice come harshly and he sway from side to side gathering and summon he wrath keep out boy keep out or you be buzzard meat i be warnin ' -- for the first time he glance leave the rider to find george and that instant be fatal the hand of donnegan lick out as the snake 's tongue dart -- the loaded quirt slip over in he hand and hold it by the lash he bring the butt of it thud on the head of andy even then the instinct to fight remain in the stunned man while he fall he be draw the revolver he lay in a crumple heap at the foot of donnegan 's horse with the revolver shove muzzle first into the sand donnegan 's voice do not rise go in and get that mint george he order and hurry this rascal have keep I wait until i be thirsty big george hesitate only one instant -- it be to sweep the crowd for the second time with he confident grin -- and he stride through the door of the dance hall as for donnegan he only movement be to swing he horse around and shift ride crop and rein into the grip of he left hand he other hand be drop carelessly upon he hip now both these thing be very simple maneuver but the corner note that he change of face have enable donnegan to bring the crowd under he eye and that he right hand be now ready for a more serious bit of work if need be moreover he be probe face with he glance and every armed man in that group feel that the eye of the rider be direct particularly toward he there have be one brief murmur then the silence lay heavily again for it be see that andy have be only slightly stunned -- knock out as a boxer might be now he sturdy brain be clear he body stiffen into a human semblance once more he fumble find the butt of he gun with he first move he push he hat straight : and so do he rake the welt which the blow have leave on he head the pain finish clear the mist from he mind in a instant he be on he foot madden with shame he see the semicircle of white face and the whole episode flash back on he he have be knock down like a dog for a moment he look into the blank face of the crowd someone note that there be no gun strap at the side of donnegan a voice shout a warn stop lewi the dude be not get a gun it be murder it be now that lewi saw donnegan sit the saddle directly behind he and he whirl with a moan of fury it be a twist of he body -- in he eagerness -- rather than a turn upon he foot and he be half around before the rider move then he conjure a gun from somewhere in he clothes there be the flash of the steel a explosion and scar-faced lewi be on he knee with a scream of pain hold he right forearm with he left hand the crowd hesitate still for a second as though it fear to interfere but donnegan have already put up he weapon a wave of the curious spectator rush across the street and gather around the injured man they find that he have be shoot through the fleshy part of the thumb and the bullet range down the arm have slice a furrow to the bone all the way to the elbow it be a grisly wound big george washington green come run to the door of the dance hall with a sprig of something green in he hand one glance assure he that all be well and once more that wide confident grin spread upon he face he come to the master and offer the mint and donnegan raise it to he face inhale the scent deeply good he say and now for a julep george let 's go home across the street a dark-eyed girl have clasp the arm of she companion in hysterical excitement do you see she ask of she tall companion i see a murderer shoot down a man he ought to be hang for it but the mint do you see he smile over it oh what a devil he be and what a man jack landi flash a glance of suspicion down at she but she dancing eye have quite forget he they be follow the progress of donnegan down the street he ride slowly and george keep that formal distance just a length behind 18 before milligan 's the crowd begin to buzz like murmur hornet around a nest that have be tap when they pour out and can not find the disturber it be a rather helpless milling around the wounded man and nelly lebrun be the one who work she way through the crowd and come to andy lewi she do not like andy she have be know to refer to he as a cowardly hawk of a man but now she bully the crowd in a shrill voice and make they bring water and cloth then she cleanse and bandage the wound in andy lewi ' arm and have some of they take he away by this time the outskirts of the crowd have melt away but those who have really see all part of the little drama remain to talk the subject be a real one have donnegan aim at the hand of andy and risk he own life on he ability to disable the other without kill he or have he fire at lewi ' body and strike the hand and arm only by a random lucky chance if the second be the case he be only a fair shot with plenty of nerve and a great deal of luck if the first be true then this be a nerve of ice-tempered steel a eye vulture-sharp and a hand miraculous fast and certain to strike that swing hand with a snap shot when a miss mean a bullet fire at he own body at deadly short range -- truly it would take a credulous man to believe that donnegan have coldly plan to disable he man without kill he a murderer by intention exclaim milligan he have hunt long and hard before he find a man with a face like that of lewi capable of maintain order by a glance now he want revenge a murder by intention he cry to the crowd standing beside the place where the imprint of andy 's knee be still in the sand and like a murderer he ought to be treat he aim to kill andy he have luck and only break he hand now boy i say it be not so much what he be do as the way he be do it he be give we the laugh he be come in here in he dude clothes and try to walk over we but it do not work not in the corner if andy be dead i would say lynch the dude but he be not and all i say be : run he out of town here there be a brief outburst of applause but when it end it be observe that there be a low soft laughter the crowd give way between milligan and the mocker it be see that he who laugh be old lebrun rub he olive-skinned hand together and show he tooth in he mirth there be no love lose between lebrun and milligan even if nelly be often in the dance hall and the center of its merriment it take a thief to catch a thief say lebrun enigmatically when he see that he have the ear of the crowd and it take a man to catch a man what the devil do you mean by that a dozen voice ask i mean that if you get man enough to run out this man donnegan the corner be a better town than i think it bring a growl but no answer lebrun have never be see to lift he hand but he be more dreaded than a rattler we 'll try say milligan dryly i be not much of a man myself -- there be dark rumor about milligan 's past and the crowd chuckle at this modesty -- but i 'll try my hand agin ' he with a bit of backing and first i want to tell you boy that they be not any danger of he have aim at andy 's hand i tell you it be not possible hardly for he to have plan to hit a swingin ' target like that maybe some could do it i dunno how about lord nick sure lord nick might do anything but donnegan be not lord nick not by twenty pound and three inch this bring a laugh and by comparison with the terrible and familiar name of lord nick donnegan become a smaller danger besides as milligan say it be undoubtedly luck and when he call for volunteer three or four step up at once the other make a general milling as though each be try to get forward and each be prevent by the crowd in front but in the background big jack landi be seriously try to get to the firing line he be encumber with the clinging weight of nelly lebrun do not go jack she plead please please be sensible for my sake she back this appeal with a lifting of she eye and a parting of she lip and jack landi pause you will not go dear jack now jack know perfectly well that the girl be only half sincere it be the peculiar fate of man that they always know when a woman be play with they but from samson down they always go to the slaughter with open eye hope each moment that the girl have be seriously impressed at last as for jack landi he slow mind do not readily get under the surface of the art of nelly but he know that there be at least a tinge of real concern in the girl 's desire to keep he from the posse which milligan be raise but they be something about he that i do not like nelly something sort of familiar that i do not like for naturally enough he do not recognize the transform donnegan and the name he have never hear before a gunfighter that be what he be why jack sometimes they call you the same thing say that you hunt for trouble now and then do they say that ask the young chap quickly flush with vanity oh i aim to take care of myself and i would like to take a hand with this murder donnegan jack listen do not go keep away from he why do you look like that as if i be a dead one already i tell you jack he would kill you something in she terrible assurance whiten the cheek of landi but he be also anger when a very young man become both afraid and angry he be apt to be dangerous what do you know of he he ask suspiciously you silly but i see he face when he lift that mint he have already forget about the man he have just shoot down he be think of nothing but the scent of the mint and do you notice he giant servant he never have a moment 's doubt of donnegan 's ability to handle the entire crowd i tell you it give I a chill of ghost to see the big black fellow 's eye he know that donnegan would win and donnegan win jack you be a big man and a strong man and a brave man and we all know it but do not be foolish stay away from donnegan he waver just a instant if she could have sustain she plead gaze a moment longer she would have win he but at the critical instant she gaze become distant she be see the calm face of donnegan as he raise the mint and as though he understand jack landi harden i be glad you do not want I shoot up nelly he say coldly mighty good of you to watch out for I but -- i be go to run this donnegan out of town he be never harm you why -- i do not like he look for a man like I that be enough and he stride away toward milligan he be greet by a cheer just as the girl reach the side of she father jack be go she say make he come back but the old man be still rub he hand there seem to be a perpetual chill in the tip of the finger he be a jackass the moment i first see he face i know that he be mean for gun fodder -- buzzard food let he go bah the girl shiver and then the mine she ask change she tactic ah yes the mine but leave that to lord nick he 'll handle it well enough so jack landi stride up the hill first and foremost of the six stalwart man who wish to correct the stranger 's apparent misunderstanding of the status of the corner they be each arm to the tooth and each provide with enough bullet to disturb a small city all this in honor of donnegan they find the shack wrap in the warm mellow light of the late afternoon and on a flat-topped rock outside it big george sit whittle a stick into a grotesque imitation of a snake coil he do not rise when the posse approach he merely rock back upon the rock embrace he knee in both of he enormous arm and in a word transform himself into a round ball of mirth but have hug away he laughter he be able to convert he joy into a vast grin that smile stop the posse when a mob start for a scene of violence the least exhibition of fear incense it but mockery be apt to pour water on its flame of anger decidedly the fury of the posse be chill by the grin of george milligan who have live south of the mason-dixon line step up to impress george properly boy he say frown go in and tell you man that we have come for he tell he to step right out here and get ready to talk we do not mean he no harm less 'n he can not explain one or two thing hop along the boy do not stir only he shift he eye from face to face and he grin broaden ripple of mirth wave along he chest and convulse he face but still he do not laugh go in and tell they thing to donnegan he say but do not ask I to wake he up he be sleepin ' soun ' a ' fa ' like a baby mostly he sleep every day to get rest up for the night now can not you-all wait till donnegan wake up tonight no then step right in gen ` leman but if you-all be set on wakin ' he up now george will jus ' step over the hill because he do not want to be near the explosion at this he allow he mirth free rein he laughter shake up to he throat to he enormous mouth it roll and bellow across the hillside and the posse stand each man in he place and look frigidly upon one another but have be laugh at they feel it necessary to go on and do or die so they stride across the hill and be almost to the door when another phenomenon occur a girl in a cheap calico dress of blue be see to run out of a neighbor shack and spring up before the door of donnegan 's hut when she face the crowd it stop again the soft wind be blow the blue dress into lovely long curving line about she throat a white collar of some sheer stuff be be lift into wave or curl against she cheek and the golden hair in disorder be tousle low upon she forehead whirling thus upon the crowd she shock they to a pause with she parted lip she flare of delicate color have you come here she cry for -- for donnegan lady begin someone and then look about for jack landi who be consider quite a hand with the lady but jack landi be discover fading out of view down the hillside one glance at that blue dress have quite route he for now he remember the red-haired man who have escort lou macon to the corner -- and the colonel 's singular trust in this fellow it explain much and he flee before he should be notice before the spokesman could continue he speech the girl have whip inside the door and the posse be dumbfounded milligan saw that the advance be ruin boy he say we come to fight a man not to storm a house with a woman in it let 's go back we 'll tend to donnegan later on we 'll drill he clean mutter the other furiously and straightway the posse depart down the hill but inside the girl have find to she astonishment that donnegan be stretch upon he bunk wrap again in the silken dress gown and with a smile upon he lip he look much younger as he sleep and perhaps it be this that make the girl steal forward upon tiptoe and touch he shoulder so gently he be up on he foot in a instant alas vanity vanity donnegan in shoe be one thing for he shoe be of a particular kind but donnegan in he slipper be a full two inch shorter he be hardly taller than the girl he be if the bitter truth must be know almost a small man and donnegan be furious at have be find by she in such careless attire -- and without those dignity-building shoe first he want to cut the throat of big george what have you do what have you do cry the girl in one of those heart-piercing whisper of fear they have come for you -- a whole crowd -- of armed man -- they be outside the door what have you do it be something do for I i know donnegan suddenly transfer he wrath from big george to the mob outside my door he ask and as he speak he slip on a belt at which a heavy holster tug down on one side and buckle it around he oh no no no she plead and catch he in she arm donnegan allow she to stop he with that soft power for a moment until he face go white -- as if with pain then he adroitly gather both she wrist into one of he bony hand and have render she powerless he slip by she and cast open the door it be a empty scene upon which they look with big george rock back and forth upon a rock convulse with silent laughter donnegan look sternly at the girl and swallow he be fearfully susceptible to mockery there seem to have be a jest he say but she lift he a happy tearful face ah thank heaven she cry gently oddly enough donnegan at this set he tooth and turn upon he heel and the girl steal out the door again and close it softly behind she as a matter of fact not even the terrible colonel inspire in she quite the fear which donnegan instil 19 big landi lose he nerve and sidestep at the last minute and then the whole gang fade that be the way the rumor of the affair always end at each repetition in lebrun 's and milligan 's that night the corner have have many thing to talk about during its brief existence but nothing to compare with a man who enter a shooting scrape with such a fellow as scar-faced lewi all for the sake of a spray of mint and the main topic of conversation be : do donnegan aim at the body or the hand of the bouncer on the whole it be a excellent thing for milligan 's the place be fairly well crowd with a few vacant table for everyone want to hear milligan 's version of the affair he have a short and vigorous one trim with neat oath it be all the girl in the blue calico dress accord to he the posse could not storm a house with a woman in it or even conduct a proper lynching in she presence and no one be able to smile when milligan say this neither be anyone nervy enough to question the courage of landi it look strange that sudden flight of he but then he be a proven man everyone remember the affair of lester it have be a clean-cut fight and jack landi have win cleanly on he merit nevertheless some of the whisper have not fail to come to the big man and he brow be black the most terribly heartless and selfish passion of all be shame in a young man to repay the sidelong glance which he meet on every side jack landi would have willingly crowd every living soul in the corner into one house and touch a match to it and chiefly because he feel the injustice of the suspicion he have no fear of donnegan he have a theory that little man have little soul not that he ever formulate the theory in word but he vaguely feel it and adhere to it he have more fear of one man of six two than a dozen under five ten he reserve in he heart of heart a place of awe for one man whom he have never see that be for lord nick for that celebrated character be say to be as tall and as finely build as jack landi himself but as for donnegan -- landi wish there be three donnegan instead of one tonight he cue be surly silence for nelly lebrun have be warn by she father and she be make desperate effort to recover any ground she might have lose besides to lose jack landi would be to lose the most spectacular fellow in the corner to say nothing of the one who hold the largest and the choicest of the mine the blond good look of landi make a perfect background for she dark beauty with all these stake to play for nelly outdo herself if she be attractive enough ordinarily when she exert herself to fascinate nelly be intoxicate what chance have poor jack landi against she he do not call for she that night but go to play gloomily at lebrun 's until nelly walk into lebrun 's and draw he away from a table half a hour later she have he whirling through a dance in milligan 's and have dance the gloom out of he mind for the moment before the evening be well under way landi be make love to she openly and nelly be in the position of one who have rouse the bear it be a dangerous flirtation and it be grow clumsy in any place other than the corner it would have be embarrassing long ago and when jack landi after a dance put he one big hand over both of nelly 's and hold she moveless while he pour out a passionate declaration nelly realize that something must be do just what she could not tell and it be at this very moment that a wave of silence beginning at the door rush across milligan 's dance floor it stop the bartender in the act of mix drink it put the musician out of key and in the midst of a waltz phrase they break down and come to a discordant pause what be it the man face the door wonder and then the swift rumor pass from lip to lip -- almost from eye to eye so rapidly it speed -- donnegan be come donnegan and big george with he someone tell milligan but milligan have already hear he be back of the bar give direction gun be actually unlimber what would happen shall i get you out of this landi ask the girl leave now she laugh fiercely and silently i be just begin to live miss donnegan in action no sir she would have give a good deal to retract that sentence for it wash the face of landi white with jealousy surely donnegan have build greater than he know and suddenly he be there in the midst of the house no one have stop he -- at least no one have interfere with he servant big george have on a white suit and a dappled green necktie he stand directly behind he master and make he look like a small boy for donnegan be in black and he have a white neckcloth wrap as high and stiffly as a old-fashioned stock altogether he be a queer drab figure compare with the brilliant donnegan of that afternoon he look older more weary he lean face be pale and he hair flame with redoubled ardor on that account never be hair as red as that not even the hair of lord nick say the people in milligan 's this night he be perfectly calm even in the midst of that deadly silence he stand look about he he see gloster the real estate man and bow to he deliberately for some reason that draw a gasp then he observe a table which be apparently to he fancy and cross the floor with a light noiseless step big george padding heavily behind he at the little round table he wait until george have draw out the chair for he and then he sit down he fold he arm lightly upon he breast and once more survey the scene and big george draw himself up behind donnegan just once he eye roll and flash savagely in delight at the sensation that they be make then the face of george be once again impassive if donnegan have not carry it off with a certain air the whole entrance would have seem decidedly stagey but the corner as it be find much to wonder at and little to criticize and in the west grow man be as shrewd judge of affectation as child be in other place put on a lot of style eh say jack landi and with fierce intensity he watch the face of nelly lebrun for once she be unguarded he be superb she exclaim the big fellow be go to bring a drink for he she look up surprise by the silence of landi and find that he face be actually yellow i 'll tell you something do you remember the little red-headed tramp who come in here the other night and speak to I very well you seem to be bother maybe i dunno but that be the man -- the one who be sit over there now all dress up -- the man the corner be talk about -- donnegan a tramp she catch she breath be that the one a pause well i believe it he be capable of anything i think you like he all the better for know that jack you be angry why should i be i hate to see you fool by the bluff of a tramp though tush do you think i be fool by it but it be a interesting bluff jack do not you think nelly he be interesting enough to make you blush by heaven the hound be lookin ' right at you now nelly he have press she suddenly against the wall and she strike back desperately in self-defense by the way what do he want to see you about it spike the gun of landi for the time be at least and the girl follow by strive to prove that she interest in donnegan be purely impersonal he be clever she run on not daring to look at the set face of she companion see how he fail to notice that he be make a sensation you would think he be in a big restaurant in a city he take the drink off the tray from that fellow as if it be a common thing to be wait on by a body-servant in the corner jack i 'll wager that there be something crooked about he a professional gambler say jack landi thaw a little under this careless chatter he still do not quite trust she do you know what they be whisper that i be afraid to face he she tilted she head back so that the light gleam on she young throat and she break into laughter why jack that be foolish you prove yourself when you first come to the corner maybe some of the newcomer may have say something but all the old-timer know you have some different reason for leave the rest of they by the way what be the reason she send a keen little glance at he from the corner of she eye but the moment she see that he be embarrassed and at sea because of the query she instantly slip into a fresh tide of careless chatter and cover up he confusion for he see how the girl be make eye at he i 'll tell you why jack reply a girl like to be with the man who be make the town talk he add pointedly : oh i have find that out she shrug that comment away he be not pay the slightest attention to any of they she murmur he be queer have he just come here hunting trouble 20 it should be understand that before this the man in milligan 's have reach a subtly unspoken agreement that red-haired donnegan be not one of they in a word they do not like he because he make a mystery of himself and also because he be different yet there be a grow feeling that the shooting of lewi through the hand have not be a accident for the whole demeanor of donnegan compose the action of a man who be a professional trouble maker there be no reason why he should go to milligan 's and take he servant with he unless he wish a fight and why a man should wish to fight the entire corner be something no one could guess that he should have do all this merely to focus all eye upon he and particularly the eye of a girl do not occur to anyone it look rather like the bravado of a man who live for the sake of fight now man who hunt trouble in the mountain desert generally find all that they may desire but for the time be everyone hold back wolfishly wait for another to take the first step toward donnegan indeed there be a unspoken conviction that the man who take the first step would probably not live to take another in the meantime both man and woman give donnegan the lion 's share of they attention there be only one who be clever enough to conceal it and that one be the pair of eye to which the red-haired man be play -- nelly lebrun she confine herself strictly to jack landi so it be that when milligan announce a tag dance and the couple swirl onto the floor gayly donnegan decide to take matter into he own hand and offer the first overt act it be clumsy he do not like it but he hate this delay and he know that every moment he stay on there with big george behind he chair be another red rag flaunt in the face of the corner he see the man who have no girl with they brighten at the announcement of the tag dance and when the dance begin he see the prettiest girl tag quickly one after the other all except nelly lebrun she swing securely around the circle in the big arm of jack landi she seem to be set apart and protect from the common touch by he size and by he formidable challenging eye donnegan feel as never before the unassailable position of this fellow not only from he own fighting quality but because he have behind he the whole unfathomable power of lord nick and he gang nelly approach in the arm of landi in make the first circle of the dance floor she eye grow dull as she surrender herself wholly to the rhythm of the waltz see nothing they be blank as unlighted charcoal she come opposite donnegan she back be toward he she swing in the arm of landi and then past the shoulder of she partner she flash a glance at donnegan the spark have fall on the charcoal and she eye be aflame aflame to donnegan the next instant the veil have drop across she face once more she be carry on leave donnegan tingle a wise man upon whom that look have fall might have see not nelly lebrun in the cheap dance hall but helen of sparta and all troy 's dead but donnegan be clever not wise and he see only nelly lebrun and the broad shoulder of jack landi let the critic deal gently with donnegan he love lou macon with all he heart and he soul and yet because another beautiful girl have look at he there he sit at he table with he jaw set and the devil in he eye and while she and landi be whirling through the next circumference of the room donnegan be see all side of the problem if he tag landi it would be cast the glove in the face of the big man -- and in the face of old lebrun -- and in the face of that mysterious and evil power lord nick himself and consider that besides these he have already insult all of the corner why not let thing go on as they be suppose he be to allow landi to plunge deeper into he infatuation suppose he be to bring lou macon to this place and let she see landi sit with nelly make love to she with every tone in he voice every light in he eye would not that cure lou and would not that open the door to donnegan and remember in consider how donnegan be tempt that he be not a conscientious man he be in fact what he seem to be -- a wanderer a careless vagrant living by he wit for all this he have be touch by the divine fire -- a love that be greater than self and the more deeply he hate landi the more profoundly he determine that he should be discard by nelly and force back to lou macon in the meantime nelly and jack be come again they be close they be pass and this time she eye have no spark for donnegan yet he rise from he table reach the floor with a few step and touch landi lightly on the shoulder the challenge be pass landi stop abruptly and turn he head he face show merely dull astonishment the current of dancer split and wash past on either side of the motionless trio and on every face there be a glittering curiosity what would landi do nothing he be too stupefy to act he jack landi have actually be tag while he be dance with the woman which all the corner know to be he girl and before he befogged sens clear the girl be in the arm of the red-haired man and be lose in the crowd what a buzz go around the room for a moment landi could no more move than he could think then he send a sullen glance toward the girl and retreat to they table a childish sullenness cloud he face while he sit there only one decision come clearly to he : he must kill donnegan in the meantime people note two thing the first be that donnegan dance very well with nelly lebrun and he red hair beside the silken black of the girl 's be a startling contrast it be not a common red it flame as though with phosphoric property of its own but they dance well and the eye of both of they be gleam another thing : man do not tag donnegan any more than they have offer to tag landi one or two slip out from the outskirts of the floor but something in the face of donnegan discourage they and make they turn elsewhere as though they have never start for nelly lebrun in the first place indeed to a two-year-old child it would have be apparent that nelly and the red-headed chap be interested in each other as a matter of fact they do not speak a single syllable until they have go around the floor one complete turn and the dance be come toward a end it be he who speak first gloomily : i should not have do it i should not have tag he at this she draw back a little so that she could meet he eye why not the whole crew will be on my trail what crew beginning with lord nick this shake she completely out of the thrall of the dance lord nick what make you think that i know he be thick with landi it 'll mean trouble he be so simple about it that she begin to laugh it be not such a voice as lou macon 's it be high and light and one could suspect that it might become shrill under a stress and yet it look as though you have be hunting trouble she say i could not help it say donnegan navely it be a very subtle flattery this frankness from a man who have puzzle all the corner nelly lebrun feel that she be about to look behind the scene and she tingle with delight tell I she say why not well say donnegan i have to make a noise because i want to be notice she glance about she every eye be upon they you have make you point she murmur the whole town be talk of nothing else i do not care a ounce of lead about the rest of the town then -- she stop abruptly see toward what he be tend and the heart of nelly lebrun flutter for the first time in many a month she believe he implicitly it be for she sake that he have make all this commotion to draw she attention for every lovely girl no matter how cool-headed have a foolish belief in the power of she beauty as a matter of fact donnegan have tell she the truth it have all be to win she attention from the fight for the mint to the tag for the dance how could she dream that it spring out of anything other than a wild devotion to she and while donnegan coldly calculate every effect nelly lebrun begin to see in he the man of a dream a spirit out of a dead age a soul of knightly reckless chivalry in that small confession he cast a halo about himself which no other hand could ever remove entirely so far as nelly lebrun be concern you understand he be say quietly she counter with a question as direct as he confession what be you mr donnegan a wanderer say donnegan instantly and a avoider of work at that they laugh together the strain be break and in its place there be a mutual excitement she see landi in the distance watch they laughter with a face contorted with anger but it only increase she unreasoning happiness mr donnegan let I give you friendly advice i like you : i know you have courage and i saw you meet scar-faced lewi but if i be you i would leave the corner tonight and never come back you have set every man against you you have step on the toe of landi and he be a big man here and even if you be to prove too much for jack you would come against lord nick as you say yourself do you know nick no then mr donnegan leave the corner the music end leave they face to face as he drop he arm from about she and she could appreciate now for the first time that he be smaller than he have seem at a distance or while he be dance he seem a frail figure indeed to face the entire band corner -- and lord nick do not you see say donnegan that i can not stop now there be a double meaning that send she color flare he add in a low tense voice i have go too far besides i be begin to hope she pause then make a little gesture of abandon then stay stay she whisper with eye on fire and good luck to you mr donnegan 21 as they go back toward nelly 's table where jack landi be try to appear carelessly at ease the face of donnegan be pale one might have think that excitement and fear cause he pallor but as a matter of fact it be in he a unfailing sign of happiness and success landi have manners enough to rise as they approach he find himself be present to the smaller man he hear the cool precise voice of donnegan acknowledge the introduction and then the red-headed man go back to he table and jack landi be alone with nelly lebrun again he scowl at she and she try to look repentant but since she could not keep the dancing light out of she eye she compromise by look steadfastly down at the table which convinced landi that she be think of she late partner he make a great effort swallow and be able to speak smoothly enough look as if you be have a pretty good time with that -- tramp the color in she cheek be anger landi take it for shame he dance beautifully she reply yeh he be pretty smooth take a gent like that it be hard for a girl to see through he let 's not talk about he jack all right be he go to dance with you again i promise he the third dance after this for a time landi could not trust he voice then : kind of sorry about that because i 'll be go home before then at this she raise she eye for the first time he be astonished and a little horrified to see that she be not in the least flustered but very angry you 'll go home before i have a chance for that dance she ask you be act like a two-year-old jack you be he flush burn would be too easy a death for donnegan he be make a laughingstock out of I look around the room nobody 's think about you at all jack you be just self-conscious of course it be pour acid upon a open wound but she be past the point of caution maybe they be not say landi control he rage i do not figure that i amount to much but i rate myself as high as a skunk like he it may have be a smile that she give he at any rate he catch the glint of tooth and she eye be as cold as steel point if she have actually defend the stranger she would not have infuriate landi so much well what do he say about himself he say frankly that he be a vagrant and you do not believe he she do not speak makin ' a play for sympathy confound a man like that i say still she do not answer and now landi become alarmed d'you really like he nelly i like he well enough to introduce he to you jack i be sorry i talk so plain if you put it that way he admit heavily i do not know you pick up friend so fast as all that he could not avoid add this last touch of the poison point he back be to donnegan and consequently the girl face he could look straight across the room at the red-headed man she allow herself one brief glance and she see that he be sit with he elbow on the table he chin in he hand look fixedly at she it be the gaze of one who forget all else and wrap himself in a dream other people in the room be note that changeless stare and the whisper buzz more and more loudly but donnegan have forget the rest of the world it seem it be a very cunning piece of act not too much overdo and once more the heart of nelly lebrun flutter she remember that in spite of he frankness he have not talk with insolent presumption to she he have merely answer she individual question with a astonishing childlike frankness he have lay he heart before she it seem and now he sit at a distance look at she with the white intense face of one who see a dream nelly lebrun be recall by the heavy breathing of jack landi and she discover that she have allow she eye to rest too long on the red-headed stranger she have forget she eye have widen and even jack landi be able to look into she mind and see thing that startle he for the first time he sense that this be more than a careless flirtation and he sit stiffly at the table look at she and through she with a fix smile nelly horrify strove to cover she track you be right jack she say i -- i think there be something brazen in the way he tag you and -- let 's go home together too late the mind of landi be not oversharp but now jealousy give it a point he nod he assent and they get up but there be no increase in he color she read as plain as day in he face that he intend murder this night and nelly be truly frighten so she try different tactic all the way to the substantial little house which lebrun have build at a little distance from the gambling hall she keep up a run fire of steady conversation but when she say good night to he he face be still set she have not deceive he when he turn she see he go back into the night with long stride and within half a hour she know as clearly as if she be remember the picture instead of foresee it that jack and donnegan would face each other gun in hand on the floor of milligan 's dance hall still she be not foolish enough to run after jack take he arm and make a direct appeal it would be too much like beg for donnegan and even if jack forgive she for this interest in he rival she have sense enough to feel that donnegan himself never would something however must be do to prevent the fight and she take the straightest course she go as fast as a run would carry she straight behind the intervene house and come to the back entrance to the gaming hall there she enter and step into the little office of she father black lebrun be not there she do not want he in he place there sit the pedlar and joe rix they be member of lord nick 's choose crew and since nick 's temporary alliance with lebrun for the sake of plunder jack landi nick 's man be nelly 's man indeed this be a formidable pair they be the kind of man about whom many whisper and no fact circulate : and yet the fact be far worse than the whisper it be say that joe rix who be a fat little man with a great aversion to a razor and a pair of shallow pale blue eye be in reality a merciless fiend he be and he be more than that if there be a stronger superlative if lord nick have dirty work to be do there be the man who do it with a relish the pedlar on the other hand be a exact opposite he be long lean raw-boned and prodigiously strong in spite of he lack of flesh he have vast hand all loose skin and outstanding tendon he have a fleshless face over which he smile be capable of extend limitlessly he be the sort of a man from whom one would expect shrewdness some cunning stubbornness a dry humor and many principle all of which except the last be true of the pedlar there be this peculiarity about the pedlar in spite of he broad grin and he wise bright eye none even of lord nick 's gang extend a friendship or familiarity toward he when they speak of the pedlar they never use he name they refer to he as he or they indicate he with gesture if he have a fondness for any live creature it be for fat joe rix yet on see this ominous pair nelly lebrun cry out softly in delight she run to they and drop a hand on the bony shoulder of the pedlar and one on the plump shoulder of joe rix whose loose flesh roll under she finger tip it be jack landi she cry he be go to milligan 's to fight the new man stop he donnegan say joe and do not rise he say the pedlar and moisten he broad lip like one on the verge of starvation be you go to sit here she cry what will lord nick say if he find out you have let jack get into a fight we be not nursin ' mother declare the pedlar but i would kind of like to look on and he rise unkinking joint after joint straighten he leg he back he shoulder he neck he soar up and up until he stand a prodigious height the girl control a shudder of disgust joe she appeal you want we to clean up donnegan he ask rise but without interest in he voice to he surprise she slip back to the door and block it with she outcast arm not a hair of he head she say fiercely swear that you will not harm he boy what the devil ejaculate joe who be a blunt man in spite of he fat you want we to keep jack from fightin ' but you do not want we to hurt the other gent what you want hogtie 'em both yes yes keep jack out of milligan 's but for heaven 's sake do not try to put a hand on donnegan why not for you sake he would kill you joe at this they both gape in unison and as one man they drawl in vast admiration : good heaven but go go go cry the girl and she shove they through the door and into the night 22 to the people in milligan 's it have be most incredible that jack landi should withdraw from a competition of any sort and though the girl be able to understand he motive in take nelly lebrun away they be not able to explain this fully to they man companion for one and all they admit that jack be imperil he hold on the girl in question if he allow she to stay near this red-headed fiend but one and all they swear that jack landi have ruin himself with she by take she away and this be a paradox which make masculine head in the corner spin the main point be that jack landi have back down before a rival and this fact be stunning enough donnegan however be not confuse he send big george to ask milligan to come to he for a moment milligan at this cursed george but he be draw by curiosity to consent a moment later he be seat at donnegan 's table drinking he own liquor as it be serve to he from the hand of big george if the first emotion of the dance-hall proprietor be anger and intense curiosity he second emotion be that never-failing surprise which all who come close to the wanderer feel for he have that rare faculty of seem larger when in action even when actually near much bigger man only when one come close to donnegan one step as it be through a veil and see the almost fragile reality when milligan have catch he breath and adjust himself he begin as follow : now bud he say you have make a pretty play not bad at all but no more bluff in milligan 's bluff donnegan repeat gently about you servant i let it pass for one night but not for another my dear mr milligan however -- change the subject easily -- what i wish to speak to you about be a bit of trouble which i foresee i think sir that jack landi be come back what make you think that it be a feeling i have i have queer premonition mr milligan i be sure he be come and i be sure he be go to attempt a murder milligan 's thick lip frame he question but he do not speak : fear make he face ludicrous right here yes a shootin ' scrape here you he have I in mind that be why i be speak to you do not wait to speak to I about it get up and get out mr milligan you be wrong i be go to stay here and you be go to protect I well confound you soul they be not much nerve about you be there you run a public place you have to protect you patron from insult and who begin it then who start walkin ' on jack 's toe now you come whinin ' to I by heck i hope jack get you you be a genial soul say donnegan here be to you but something in he smile as he sip he liquor make milligan sit straighter in he chair as for donnegan he be think hard and fast if there be a shooting affair and he win he would nevertheless run a close chance of be hang by a mob he must dispose that mob to look upon he as the defendant and landi as the aggressor he have not foresee the crisis until it be fairly upon he he have think of nelly playing landi along more gradually and carefully so that while he be slowly learn that she be grow cold to he he would have a chance to grow fond of lou macon once more but even across the width of the room he have see the girl fire up and from that moment he know the result landi already suspect he landi with the feeling that he have be rob would do he best to kill the thief he might take a chance with landi if it come to a fight just as he have take a chance with lewi but how different this case would be landi be no dull-nerved ruffian and drunkard he be a keen boy with a hair-trigger balance and in a gunplay he would be apt to beat the best of they all of all this donnegan be fully aware either he must place he own life in terrible hazard or else he must shoot to kill and if he kill what of lou macon while he smile into the face of milligan perspiration be burst out under he armpit mr milligan i implore you to give I you aid what be the difference milligan ask in a changed tone if he do not fight you here he 'll fight you later you be wrong mr milligan he be not the sort to hold malice he 'll come here tonight and try to get at I like a bulldog strain on a leash if he be keep away he 'll get over he bad temper milligan push back he chair you have try to force yourself down the throat of the corner he say and now you yell for help when you see the tooth he have raise he voice now he get up and stride noisily away donnegan wait until he be halfway across the dance floor and then rise in turn gentleman he say the quiet voice cut into every conversation the musician lower the instrument i have just tell mr milligan that i be sure jack landi be come back here to try to kill I i have ask for he protection he have refuse it i intend to stay here and wait for he jack landi in the meantime i ask any able-bodied man who will do so to try to stop landi when he enter he sit down raise he glass and sip the drink two hundred pair of eye be fasten with hawklike intensity upon he and they could perceive no quiver of he hand the sip of he liquor be not a affectation for he be drink at incredible cost liquor from milligan 's store of rarety the effect of donnegan 's announcement be first a silence then a hum then loud voice of protest curiosity -- and finally a scurry toward the door yet really very few leave the rest value a chance to see the fight beyond the fear of random slug of lead which might fly they way besides where such man as donnegan and big jack landi be concern there be not apt to be much wild shooting the dancing stop of course the music be order by milligan to play in a frantic endeavor to rouse custom again but the music of its own accord fall away in the middle of the piece for the musician could not watch the note and the door at the same time as for donnegan he find that it be one thing to wait and another to be wait for he too wish to turn and watch that door until it should be fill by the bulk of jack landi yet he fight the desire and in the midst of this torture suspense a idea come to he and at the same instant jack landi enter the doorway he stand there look vast against the night one glance around be sufficient to teach he the meaning of the silence the stage be set and the way open to donnegan without a word big george steal to one side straight to the middle of the dance floor go jack landi red-faced with long heavy step he face donnegan you skunk shout landi i have come for you and he go for he gun donnegan too stir but when the revolver leap into the hand of landi it be see that the hand of donnegan rise past the line of he waist past he shoulder and presently lock easily behind he head a terrible chance for landi have come within a breath of shooting so great be the impulse that as he check the pressure of he forefinger he stumble a whole pace forward he walk on you need cause to fight he cry striking donnegan across the face with the back of he left hand jerk up the muzzle of the gun in he right now a dark trickle be see to come from the broken lip of donnegan yet he be smile faintly jack landi mutter a curse and say sneeringly : be you afraid there be sick face in that room man turn they head for nothing be so ghastly as the sight of a man who be take water hush say donnegan i be go to kill you jack but i want to kill you fairly and squarely there be no pleasure you see in beat a youngster like you to the draw i want to give you a fight chance besides -- he remove one hand from behind he head and wave it carelessly to where the man of the corner crouch in the shadow -- you people have see I drill one chap already and i would like to shoot you in a new way be that agreeable two terrible known figure detach themselves from the gloom near the door hark to this gent sing say one and he name be the pedlar hark to he sing jack and we 'll see that you get fair play good say he friend joe rix let he take he try jack as a matter of fact have donnegan reach for a gun he would have be shoot before even landi could bring out a weapon for the steady eye of joe rix hide behind the pedlar have be look down a revolver barrel at the forehead of donnegan wait for that first move but something about the coolness of donnegan fascinate they do not shoot joe the pedlar have say that bird be the chief over again do not plug he and that be why donnegan live 23 if he have take the eye of the harden rix and the still harder pedlar he have stun the man of the corner and breathlessly they wait for he proposal to jack landi he speak with he hand behind he head again after he have slowly take out a handkerchief and wipe he chin i be a methodical fellow landi he say i hate to do a untidy piece of work i have be disgust with myself since my little fall out with lewi i intend to shoot he cleanly through the hand but instead of that i tear up he whole forearm sloppy work landi i do not like it now in meeting you i want to do a clean neat precise job one that i 'll be proud of a moan voice be hear faintly in the distance it be the pedlar who have wrap himself in he gaunt arm and be croon softly with unspeakable joy : hark to he sing hark to he sing a ringer for the chief why should we be in such a hurry continue donnegan you see that clock in the corner tut tut turn you head and look do you think i 'll drop you while you look around landi fling one glance over he shoulder at the big clock whose pendulum work solemnly back and forth in five minute say donnegan it will be eleven o'clock and when it be eleven o'clock the clock will chime now landi you and i shall sit down here like gentleman and drink we liquor and think we last thought heaven man be there anything more disagreeable than be hurry out of life but when the clock chime we draw we gun and shoot each other through the heart -- the brain -- wherever we have choose but landi if one of we should inadvertently -- or through nervousness -- beat the clock 's chime by the split part of a second the good people of the corner will fill that one of we promptly full of lead he turn to the crowd gentleman be it a good plan as well as a roman crowd if it want to see a gladiator die the fray nerve of the corner respond to the stimulus of this delightful entertainment there be a joyous chorus of approval when the clock strike then say landi and fling himself down in a chair set he tooth over he rage donnegan smile benevolently upon he then he turn again and beckon to george the big man stride closer and lean george he say i be not go to kill this fellow no sir certainly sir whisper the other george can kill he for you sir donnegan smile wanly i be not go to kill he george on account of the girl on the hill you know and the reason be that she be fond of the lubber i 'll try to break he nerve george and drill he through the arm say no i can not take chance like that but if i have he shake in time i 'll shoot he through the right shoulder george but if i miss and he get I instead mind you never raise a hand against he if you so much as touch he skin i 'll rise out of my grave and haunt you you hear good-by george but big george withdraw without a word and the reason for he speechlessness be the glistening of he eye if i live say donnegan i 'll show that george that i appreciate he he go on aloud to landi : so glum my boy tush we have still four minute leave be you go to spend you last four minute hate I he turn : another liqueur george two of they the big man bring the drink and have put one on the table of donnegan he be direct to take the other to landi it be really good stuff say donnegan i be not a expert on these matter but i like the taste will you try it it seem that landi dare not trust himself to speech as though a vast and deadly hatred be gather in he and he fear lest it should escape in word the first time he part he tooth he take the glass of liqueur and slowly pour it upon the floor from the crowd there be a deep murmur of disapproval and landi feeling that he have advance the wrong foot in the matter glower scornfully about he and then stare once more at donnegan just as you please say donnegan sip he glass but remember this my young friend that a fool be a fool drunk or sober landi show he tooth but make no other answer and donnegan anxiously flash a glance at the clock he still have three minute three minute in which he must reduce this stalwart fellow to a tremble nervous wreck otherwise he must shoot to kill or else sit there and become a certain sacrifice for the sake of lou macon yet he control the muscle of he face and be still able to smile as he turn again to landi three minute leave he say three minute for you to compose yourself landis think of it man all the good life behind you have you nothing to remember nothing to soften you mind why die landi with a curse in you heart and a scowl on you lip once more landis stir he lip but there be only the flash of he tooth he maintain he resolute silence ah murmur donnegan i be sorry to see this and before all you admirer landi before all you friend look at they scatter there under the light and in the shadow no farewell word for they nothing kindly to say be you go to leave they without a syllable of goodfellowship confound you mutter landi there be another hum from the crowd it be partly wonder partly anger plainly they be not please with jack landi on this day donnegan shake he head sadly i hope he say that i could teach you how to die but i fail and yet you should be grateful to I for one thing jack i have keep you from be a murderer in cold blood i keep you from kill a defenseless man as you intend to do when you walk up to I a moment ago he smile genially in mockery and there be a scowl on the face of landi two minute say donnegan lean back in he chair he yawn for a whole minute he do not stir one minute he murmur inquisitively and there be a convulsive shudder through the limb of landi it be the first sign that he be break down under the strain there remain only one minute in which to reduce he to a nervous wreck the strain be tell in other place donnegan turn and see in the shadow and about the edge of the room a host of draw tense face and burn eye never while they live would they forget that scene and now that the time be close say donnegan i must look to my gun he make a gesture how it be no one be swift enough of eye to tell but a gun appear in he hand at the flash of it landi ' weapon leap up to the mark and he face convulse but donnegan calmly spin the cylinder of he revolver and hold it toward landi dangle from he forefinger under the guard you see he say to landi clean as a whistle and easy as a girl 's smile i hate a stiff action jack and landi slowly allow the muzzle of he own gun to sink for the first time he eye leave the eye of donnegan and sink inch by inch stare fascinate at the gun in the hand of the enemy thirty seconds say donnegan by way of conversation landi jerk up he head and he eye once more meet the eye of donnegan but this time they be wide and the pointed glance of donnegan sink into they the lip of landi part he tongue tremblingly moisten they keep you nerve say donnegan in a undertone you hound gasp landi i know it say donnegan sadly you 'll die with a curse on you lip he add : ten seconds landi and then he achieve he third step toward victory for landi jerk he head around see the minute hand almost upon its mark and swing back with a shudder toward donnegan from the crowd there be a deep breath and then landi be see to raise the muzzle of he gun again and crouch over it level it straight at donnegan he at least would send he bullet straight to the mark when that first chime go hum through the big room but donnegan he make he last play to shatter the nerve of landi with the minute hand on the very mark he turn carelessly the revolver still dangling by the trigger guard and laugh toward the crowd and out of the crowd there come a deep sob breath of heartbreaking suspense it tell on landi out of the corner of he eye donnegan see the muscle of the man 's face sag and tremble see he allow he gun to fall in imitation of donnegan to he side and see the long arm quiver and then the chime ring with a metallic sharp click and then a long and reverberant clang with a gasp landi whip up he gun and fire once twice again the weapon crash and to the eternal wonder of all who see it at a distance of five pace landi three time miss he man but donnegan sit back with a smile raise he own gun almost with leisure unhurried drop it upon the mark and send a forty-five slug through the right shoulder of jack landi the blow of the slug like the punch of a strong man 's fist knock the victim out of he chair to the floor he lay clutch at he shoulder gentleman say donnegan rise be there a doctor here 24 that be the signal for the rush that sweep across the floor and leave a flood of marvel man around the fall landi on the outskirts of this tide donnegan step up to two man joe rix and the pedlar they greet he with expectant glance gentleman say donnegan will you step aside they follow he to a distance from the clamor group i have to thank you say donnegan for what for change you mind say donnegan and leave they and afterward the pedlar murmur with a oddly twisted face : cat-eye joe he can see in the dark but i tell you he be worth savin ' speakin ' in general say joe which you be not hardly ever wrong when you get stir up about a thing he be something new the pedlar say wisely ay he be rare but talkin ' aside suppose he be to meet up with lord nick the smile of joe rix be marvelously evil you get a great mind for great thing he declare you ought to of be in politics in the meantime the doctor have be find the wound have be cleanse it be a cruel one for the bullet have tear its way through flesh and sinew and for many a week the fight arm of jack landi would be useless it have moreover carry a quantity of cloth into the wound and it be almost impossible to cleanse the hole satisfactorily as for the bullet itself it have whip cleanly through at that short distance make nothing of its target a door be knock off its hinge but before the wounded man be place upon it lebrun appear at the door into milligan 's he be never a very cheery fellow in appearance and now he look like a demoniac he go straight to joe rix and the skeleton form of the pedlar he raise one finger as he look at they i have hear say lebrun lord nick likewise shall hear joe rix change color he bustle about together with the pedlar and lend a hand in carry the wounded man to the house of lebrun for nelly lebrun be to be the nurse of landi in the meantime donnegan go up the hill with big george behind he already he be a sinisterly marked man work through the crowd near lebrun 's gambling hall a drunkard in the midst of a song stumble against he but the sight of the man with whom he have collide sober he as swiftly as the lash of a whip across he face it be impossible for he in that condition to grow pale but he turn a vivid purple sorry mr donnegan donnegan with a shrug of he shoulder pass on the crowd split before he for they have hear he name there be brave man he know among they man who would fight to the last drop of blood rather than be shame but they shrink from donnegan without shame as they would have shrink from the come of a rattler have they foot be bare so he go easily through the crowd with big george in he wake walk proudly for george have stand to one side and watch donnegan indomitably beat down the will of jack landi and the sight would live in he mind forever indeed if donnegan have bid the sun to stand in the heaven the big man would have look for obedience that the forbearance of donnegan should have be base on a desire to serve a girl certainly upset the mind of george but it teach he a amazing thing -- that donnegan be capable of affection the terrible donnegan go on in he wake the crowd close slowly for many have pause to look after the little man until they come to the outskirts of the town and climb the hill toward the two shack the one be of course dark but the shack in which lou macon live burst with light donnegan pause to consider this miracle he listen and he hear voice -- the voice of a man laugh loudly think something be wrong he hurry forward and call loudly what he see when he be admit make he speechless colonel macon ensconce in he invalid chair face the door and near he be lou macon lou rise half-frightened by the unexpected interruption but the liquid laughter of the colonel set all to rights at once come in donnegan come in lad say the colonel i hear a man 's voice donnegan say half apologetically the sick color begin to leave he face and relief sweep over it slowly i think something might be wrong i do not think of you and look down as all man will in moment of relaxation from a strain he do not see the eye of lou macon grow softly luminous as they dwell upon he come in george go on the colonel and make yourself comfortable in the kitchen close the door sit down donnegan when you letter come i see that i be need here lou have you look into we friend 's cabin no nothing like a woman 's touch to give a man the feeling of homeliness lou step over to donnegan 's cabin and put it to rights yes i know that george take care of it but george be one thing and you care will be another besides i must be alone with he for a moment man talk confuse a girl lou you should not listen to it she withdraw with that faint dreamy smile with which she so often hear the instruction of she father as though she be only listen with half of she mind when she be go though the door to the kitchen stand wide open and big george be in it the colonel lower he bass voice so successfully that it be as safe as be alone with donnegan and now for fact he begin but say donnegan how -- that chair -- how in the world have you come here the colonel shake he head my dear boy you grieve and disappoint I the manner in which a thing be do be not important mystery be usually simply explain as for my small mystery -- a neighbor on the way to the corner with a wagon stop in and i ask he to take I along so here i be but now for you work here lad bad say donnegan i gather you have be unfortunate and now you have be fight you have hear i see it in you eye donnegan when a man have be look fear in the face for a time a image of it remain in he eye they be wider glaze with the other thing it be force on I say donnegan i have shoot landi he be amaze to see the colonel be vitally affect he lip remain part over he next word and one eyelid twitch violently but the spasm pass over quickly when he raise he perfect hand and press they together just under he chin he smile in a most winning manner that make the blood of donnegan run cold donnegan he say softly i see that i have misjudge you i underestimate you i think indeed that you rare quality be qualify by painful weakness but now i see that you be a man and from this moment we shall act together with open mind so you have do it tush then i need not have take my trip the work be do the mine come to I as the heir of jack and yet poor boy i pity he he misjudge I he should not have venture to this deal with lord nick and he compatriot wait exclaimed donnegan you be wrong landi be not dead once more the colonel be check but this time the alteration in he face be no more than a comma 's pause in a long balanced sentence it be impossible to obtain more than one show of emotion from he in a single conversation not dead well donnegan that be unfortunate and after you have puncture he you have no chance to send home the finish shot donnegan merely watch the colonel and tap he bony finger against the point of he chin ah murmur the colonel i see another possibility it be almost as good -- it may even be better than he death you have disabled he and have do this you at once take he to a place where he shall be under you surveillance -- this in fact be a very comfortable outlook -- for I and my interest but for you donnegan how the devil do you benefit by have jack flat on he back sick helpless and in a perfect position to excite all the sympathy of lou now donnegan have know cold-blooded man in he day but that there exist such a man as the colonel have never come into he mind he look upon the colonel therefore with neither disgust nor anger but with a distant and almost admire wonder for perfect evil always win something akin to admiration from more common people well continue the colonel a little uneasy under this silent scrutiny -- silence be almost the only thing in the world that could trouble he -- well donnegan my lad this be you plan be it not to shoot down landi then take possession of he and while i nurse he back to health hold a gun -- metaphorically speak -- to he head and make he do as i please : sign some lease say of the mine to you the colonel shift himself to a more comfortable position in he chair bring the tip of he finger together under he vast chin and smile benevolently upon donnegan it be as i think he murmur donnegan you be rare you be exquisite and you say donnegan be a scoundrel exactly i be very base the colonel laugh you and i alone can speak with intimate knowledge of I he chuckle shake all he body and set the fold of he face quiver he mirth die away when he see donnegan come to he foot eh he call good-by say donnegan but where -- landi -- donnegan what devil be in you eye a foolish devil colonel macon i surrender the benefit of all my work for you and go to make sure that you do not lay you hand upon jack landi the colonel open and close he lip foolishly like a fish gasp silently out of water it be rare indeed for the colonel to appear foolish in heaven 's name donnegan the little man smile he have a marvelously wicked smile which come from the fact that he lip could curve while he eye remain bright and straight and malevolently unwrinkled he lay he hand on the knob of the door donnegan cry the colonel gray of face give I one minute 25 donnegan step to a chair and sit down he take out he watch and hold it in he hand study the dial and the colonel know that he time limit be take literally i swear to you he say that if you can help I to the possession of landi while he be ill i shall not lay a finger upon he or harm he in any way you swear say donnegan with that ugly smile my dear boy do you think i be reckless enough to break a promise i have give to you the cynical glance of donnegan probe the colonel to the heart but the eye of the fat man do not wince neither do he speak again but the two calmly stare at each other at the end of the minute donnegan slip the watch into he pocket i be ready to listen to reason he say and the colonel pass one of he strong hand across he forehead now and he sigh i feel that the crisis be pass with a man of you caliber donnegan i fear a snap judgment above all thing since you give I a chance to appeal to you reason i feel safe as from the first i shall lay my card upon the table you be fond of lou i take it for grant that you would welcome a chance to brush landi out of you path it appear that i be wrong i admit my error only fool cling to conviction wise man be ready to meet new viewpoint very well you wish to spare landi for reason of you own which i do not pretend to fathom perhaps you pity he i can not tell now you wonder why i wish to have landi in my care if i do not intend to put a end to he and thereby become owner of he mine i shall tell you frankly i intend to own the mine if not through the death of jack then through a legal act sign by the hand of jack a willing signature ask donnegan calmly a shadow come and go across the face of the colonel and donnegan catch he breath there be time when he feel that if the colonel possess strength of body as well as strength of mind even he donnegan would be afraid of the fat man willing or unwilling say the colonel he shall do as i direct without force listen to I say the colonel you and i be not child and therefore we know that ordinary man be command rather by fear of what may happen to they than by be confront with a actual danger i have tell you that i shall not so much as raise the weight of a finger against jack landi i shall not but a whisper adroitly put in he ear may accomplish the same end he add with a smile personally i dislike physical violence in that mr donnegan we belong to opposite school of action the picture come to donnegan of landi lie in the cabin of the colonel he childish mind work upon by the devilish insinuation of the colonel truly if jack do not go mad under the strain he would be very apt to do as the colonel wish i have make a mess of this from the beginning say donnegan quietly in the first place i intend to play the role of the self-sacrificing you do not understand i do not expect that you would in short i intend to send landi back to lou by make a flash that would dazzle the corner and dazzle nelly lebrun as well -- win she away from landi you see but the fool as soon as he see that i be flirt with the girl lower he head and charge at I like a bull i have to strike he down in self-defense but now you ask I to put he wholly in you possession colonel you omit one link in you chain of reasoning the link be important -- to I what be i to gain by place he within the range of you whispering tush do i need to tell you i still presume you be interested in lou though you attempt to do so much to give landi back to she well donnegan you must know that when she learn it be a bullet from you gun that strike down landi she 'll hate you my boy as if you be a snake but if she know that after all you be force into the fight and that you take the first opportunity to bring jack into my -- er -- paternal care -- she sentiment may change no they will change donnegan leave he chair and begin to pace the floor he be no more self-conscious in the presence of the colonel than a man might be in the presence of he own evil instinct and it be typical of the colonel 's insight that he make no attempt to influence the decision of donnegan after this point be reach he allow he to work out the matter in he own way at length donnegan pause what be the next step he ask the colonel sigh and by that sigh he admit more than word could tell a reasonable man he say be the delight of my heart the next step donnegan be to bring jack landi to this house tush say donnegan bring he away from lebrun bring he away from the tiger of lord nick 's gang i see they at milligan 's place tonight a bad set colonel macon a set you can handle say the colonel calmly ah the danger will in itself be the thing that tempt you he go on to go among those fellow wild as they be and bring jack landi away to this house bring he here say donnegan with indescribable bitterness so that she may pity he wound bring he here where she may think of he and tend he and grow to hate I grow to fear you say the colonel a excellent thing to accomplish say donnegan coldly i have find it so remark the colonel and light a cigarette he draw the smoke so deep that when it issue again from between he lip it be a most transparent bluish vapor fear come upon donnegan not fear surely of the fat man helpless in he invalid 's chair but fear of the mind work ceaselessly behind those hazy eye he turn without a word and go to the door the moment it open under he hand he feel a hysterical impulse to leap out of the room swiftly and slam the door behind he -- to put a bar between he and the eye of the colonel just as a child leap from the dark room into the light and close the door quickly to keep out the follow night he have to compel himself to move with proper dignity when outside he sigh the quiet of the night be like a blessing compare with the ordeal of the colonel 's devilish coldness macon 's advice have seem almost logical the moment before win lou macon by the power of fear well enough for be not fear the thing which she have follow all she life be it not through fear that the colonel himself have reduce she to such abject unquestioning obedience he go thoughtfully to he own cabin and down-head in he musing he become aware with a start of lou macon in the hut she have change the room as she father have bid she to do just wherein the difference lay donnegan could not tell there be a touch of evergreen in one corner she have lay a strip of bright cloth over the rickety little table and in ten minute she have give the hut a semblance of permanent livableness donnegan see she now with some vestige of the smile of she art upon she face but she immediately smooth it to perfect gravity he have never see such perfect self-command in a woman be there anything more that i can do she ask move toward the door nothing good night wait she still seem to be under the authority which the colonel have delegate to donnegan when they start for the corner she turn and without a word come back to he and a pang strike through donnegan what would he not have give if she have come at he call not with these dumb eye but with a spark of kindliness instead she obey he as a soldier obey a commander there have be trouble say donnegan yes she say but there be no change in she face it be force upon I then he add : it amount to a shooting affair there be a change in she face now indeed a glint come in she eye and the suggestion of the colonel which he have once or twice before sense in she now become more vivid than ever before the same contemptuous heartlessness which be the colonel 's most habitual expression now look at donnegan out of the lovely face of the girl they be fool to press you to the wall she say i have no pity for they for a moment donnegan only stare at she on what do she base she confidence in he prowess as a fight man it be only one man he say huskily ah there he have strike she home as though the word be a burden she shrink from he then she slip suddenly close to he and catch both he hand she head be raise far back she have press close to he she seem in every line of she body to plead with he against himself and all the veil which have curtain she mind from he drop away he find himself look down into eye full of fire and shadow and eager lip and the fiber of she voice make she whole body tremble it be not jack she plead it be not jack that you have fight with and he say to himself : she love he with all she heart and soul it be he say donnegan in a agony pain may be like a fire that temper some strong man and now donnegan because he be in torment smile and he eye be as cold as steel the girl fling away he hand you buy murderer she cry at he he be not dead but you shoot he down he attack I it be self-defense she break into a low-pitched mirthless laughter where be the filmy-eyed girl he have know the laughter break off short -- like a sob do not you suppose i have know she say that i have read my father that i know he be send a bloodhound when he send you but oh i think you have a touch of the other thing he cringe under she tone i 'll bring he to you say donnegan desperately i 'll bring he here so that you can take care of he you 'll take he away from lord nick -- and lebrun -- and the rest and it be the cold smile of she father with which she mock he i 'll do it you play a deep game say the girl bitterly why would you do it because say donnegan faintly i love you she hand have be on the knob of the door now she twitch it open and be go and the last that donnegan saw be the width of the startled eye as if i be a leper muttered donnegan by heaven she look at I as if i be unclean but once outside the door the girl stand with both hand press to she face stun when she drop they they fold against she breast and she face tip up even by starlight have donnegan be there to look he would have see the divinity which come in the face of a woman when she love 26 have he be there to see even in the darkness he would have know and he could have cross the distance between they life with a single step and take she into he heart but he do not see he have throw himself upon he bunk and lay face down he arm stretch rigidly out before he he tooth set he eye close for what donnegan have want in the world he have take by force when he could by subtlety when he must and now what he want most of all be go from he he feel forever there be no power in he arm to take that part of she which he want he have no craft which could encompass she big george steal into the room wonder at the lithe slender form of the man in the bed see he thus it seem that with the power of one hand george could crush he but george would as soon have close he finger over a rattler he slip away into the kitchen and sit with he arm wrap around he body as frightened as though he have see a ghost but donnegan lay on the bed without move for hour and hour until big george who sit wakeful and terrify all that time be sure that he sleep then he steal in and cover donnegan with a blanket for it be the chill gray time of the night but donnegan be not asleep and when george rise in the morning he find the master sit at the table with he arm fold tightly across he breast and he eye burn into vacancy he spend the day in that chair it be the middle of the afternoon when george come with a scared face and a message that a gen ` leman who look rile sir want to see he there be no answer and george perforce take the silence as acquiescence so he open the door and announce : mr lester to see you sir into the fiery haze of donnegan 's vision step a raw-boned fellow with sandy hair and a disagreeably strong jaw you be the gent that be here with the colonel be not you say lester donnegan do not reply you be the gent that clean up on landi be not you continue the sandy-haired man there be still the same silence and lester burst out : it do not work donnegan you have show you be man-sized several way since you be in the corner now i come to tell you to get out from under colonel macon why because he be crooked because we know he be crooked because he play crooked with I you hear I talk still donnegan consider he without a word we be goin ' to run he out donnegan we want you on we side if we can get you if we can not get you then we 'll run you out along with the colonel he begin to talk with difficulty as though donnegan 's stare unnerved he he even take a step back toward the door you can not bluff I out donnegan i be not alone they 's other behind I i do not need to name no name here 's another thing : you be not alone yourself you get a woman and a cripple on you hand now donnegan you be a fast man with a gun and you be a fast man at thinkin ' but i ask you personal : have you get a chance runnin ' under that weight he add fiercely : i be through now talk turkey donnegan or you be do for the first time donnegan move it be to make to big george a significant signal with he thumb indicate the visitor however lester do not wait to be throw bodily from the cabin one enormous oath explode from he lip and he back sullenly through the door and slam it after he it kind of look say big george like a war sir and still donnegan do not speak until the afternoon be go and the evening and the full black of the night have swallow up the hill around the corner then he leave the chair shave and dress carefully look to he revolver stow it carefully and invisibly away among he clothes and walk leisurely down the hill a outbreak of cursing stamp hair-tearing shooting could not have affect big george as this quiet departure do he follow unordered but as he step across the threshold of the hut he roll up he eye to the star oh heaven above muttered george have mercy on mr donnegan he be not happy and he go down the hill make sure that he be fit for battle with knife and gun he have sense donnegan 's mental condition accurately enough the heart of the little man be swell to the point of break a twenty-hour vigil have whiten he face draw in he cheek and paint he eye with shadow and now he want action he want excitement strife competition something to fill he mind and naturally enough he have two place in mind -- lebrun 's and milligan 's it be hard to relate the state of donnegan 's mind at this time chiefly he be conscious of a peculiar and cruel pain that make he hollow it be like homesickness raise to the nth degree vaguely he realize that in some way somehow he must fulfill he promise to the girl and bring jack landi home the colonel dare not harm the boy for fear of donnegan and the girl would be happy for that very reason donnegan want to tear landi to shred it be not extremely heroic for a man torment with sorrow to go to a gambling hall and then to a dance hall to seek relief but donnegan be not a hero he be only a man and since he heart be empty he want something that might fill it indeed like most man suffer make he a good deal of a boy so the high heel of donnegan tap across the floor of lebrun 's a murmur go before he whenever he appear now and a way open for he at the roulette wheel he stop place fifty on red and watch it double three time george at a signal from the master rake in the winnings and donnegan sit at a faro table and win again and again rise disconsolately and go on for when man do not care how luck run it never fail to favor they the devotee of fortune be the one she punish in the meantime the whisper run swiftly through the corner donnegan be out hunting trouble about the good that be in man rumor often make mistake but for evil she have a infallible eye and at once set all of she thousand tongue wag indeed any man with half a eye could not fail to get the meaning of he fixed glance he hard set jaw and the straightness of he mouth if he have be a ghost man could not have avoid he more sedulously and the giant servant who stalk at he back not that the corner be people with coward the true westerner avoid trouble but corner he will fight like a wildcat so people watch from the corner of they eye as donnegan pass he leave lebrun 's there be no competition luck blindly favor he and donnegan want contest excitement he cross to milligan 's rumor be there before he a whisper convey to a pair of mighty-limbed cow-puncher that they be sit at the table which donnegan have occupy the night before and they wisely rise without further hint and seek other chair milligan anxious-eyed hurry to the orchestra and with a blast of sound they seek to cover up the entry of the gunman as a matter of fact that blare of horn only serve to announce he something be about to happen the eye of man grow shadowy the eye of woman brighten and then donnegan appear with george behind he and cross the floor straight to he table of the night before not that he have forethought in go toward it but he be move absent-mindedly indeed he have half forget that he be a public figure in the corner and sit sip the cordial which big george bring he at once he let he glance rove swiftly around the room the eye of more than one brave man sink under that glance the eye of more than one woman smile back at he but where the survey of donnegan halted be on the face of nelly lebrun she be cross the farther side of the floor alone unescorted except for the whisper about she but see donnegan she stop abruptly donnegan instantly rise she would have go on again in a flurry but that would have be too point a moment later donnegan be thread he way across the dance floor to nelly lebrun with all eye turn in he direction he have he hat under he arm and in he black clothes with he white stock he make a old-fashioned figure as he bow before the girl and straighten again do you send for I donnegan inquire nelly lebrun be frankly afraid and she be also delighted she feel that she have be draw into the circle of intense public interest which surround the red-headed stranger she remember on the other hand that she father would be furious if she exchange two word with the man and for that very reason she be intrigue donnegan be forbid fruit be irresistible so she let the smile come to she lip and eye and then laugh outright in she excitement no she say with she lip while she eye say other thing i have come to ask a favor : to talk with you one minute if i should -- what would people say let 's find out it would be -- daring say nelly lebrun after last night it would be delightful say donnegan here be a table ready for we she go a pace closer to it with he i think you have frighten the poor people away from it i must not sit down with you mr donnegan and she immediately slip into the chair 27 she qualify she surrender of course by sit on the very edge of the chair she have on a wine-colored dress and with the excitement whipping color into she cheek and she eye dance nelly lebrun be a lovely picture i must go at once say nelly of course i can not expect you to stay she drop one hand on the edge of the table one would have think that she be in the very act of rise do you know that you frighten I i say donnegan with appropriate inflection as if i be a man and you be angry but you see and he make a gesture with both of he palm turn up people have slander I i be harmless the minute be up mr donnegan what be it you wish another minute now you laugh at I no no and in the next minute i hope to persuade you to stay till the third minute of course i can not i know it be impossible quite she settle into the chair see how people stare at I they remember poor jack landi and they think -- the whole crowd -- a crowd be always foolish in the meantime i be happy you to be here to sit close to you to watch you she glance be like the tip of a rapier search he through for some iota of seriousness under this banter ah and nelly lebrun laugh do not you see that i mean it you can watch I from a distance mr donnegan may i say a bold thing you have say several no one can really watch you from a distance she cant she head a little to one side such a encounter of personal quip be a seventh heaven to she that be a riddle mr donnegan a simple one the answer be because there be too much to watch he join she when she laugh but the laughter of donnegan make not a sound and he break in on she mirth suddenly ah do not you see i be serious she glance flick on either side as though she fear someone might have read he lip not a soul can hear I murmured donnegan and i be go to be bolder still and tell you the truth it be the last thing i dare stay to hear you be too lovely to watch from a distance nelly lebrun he be so direct that even nelly lebrun expert in flirtation be give pause and become sober she shake she head and raise a caution finger but donnegan be not shake because there be a glamour about a beautiful girl he say gravely one have to step into the halo to see she to know she be you contented to look at a flower from a distance that be a old comparison be not it but there be something like a fragrance about you nelly lebrun do not be afraid no one can hear no one shall ever dream i have say such bold thing to you in the meantime we have a truth party there be a fragrance i say it must be breathe there be a glow which must touch one as it touch I now you see indeed there be a faint color in he cheek and the girl flush more deeply she eye be still bright but they no longer sharpen to such a penetrate point she be believe at least a little part of what he say and she disbelief only heighten she joy in what be real in this strangest of lovemaking i shall stay here to learn one thing she say what deviltry be behind all this talk mr donnegan be that fair to I besides i only follow a beaten trail in the corner and that toward nelly lebrun a beaten trail you she cry with just a touch of anger i be not a child mr donnegan you be not and that be why i be frank you have do all these thing -- follow this trail you speak of remember say donnegan soberly what have i do shoot down two man play like a actor on a stage a couple of time at least if i must be blunt hunt danger like -- like a reckless madman dare all the corner to cross you flaunt the red rag in the face of the bull those be a few thing you have do sir and all on one trail that trail you speak of nelly lebrun -- i be listen and do you know i be persuade myself to believe you it be because you feel the truth before i speak it truth speak for itself you know i have close my eye -- you see i have step into a masquerade now you can talk masquerade be exciting murmured donnegan and they be sometimes beautiful but this sober truth of mine -- well i come here unknown -- and i saw you nelly lebrun he pause she be look a little past he i come in rag no friend no following and i see that i should have to make you notice I and why no i should not have ask that you should not ask that agree donnegan but i see you the queen of the corner worship by all man what could i do i be not rich i be not big you see he draw she attention to he smallness with a flush which never fail to touch the face of donnegan when he think of he size and he seem to swell and grow greater in the very instant she glance at he what could i do one thing fight i have fight i fight to get the eye of the corner but most of all to attract you attention i come closer to you i see that one man block the way -- mostly i decide to brush he aside how by fight she have not be carry away by he argument she be watch he like a lynx every moment not by that by bluff you see i be not fool enough to think that you would -- particularly notice a fight bully he lay he open hand on the table it be like expose both strength and weakness and into such a trap it would have be a singularly hard-minded woman who might not have step nelly lebrun lean a little closer she forget to criticize it be bluff i see that landi be big and good-looking and what be i beside he nothing i could only hope that he be hollow yellow -- you see so i try the bluff you know about it the clock and all that claptrap but landi be not yellow he do not crumble he last long enough to call my bluff and i have to shoot in self-defense and then when he lay on the floor i see that i have fail fail he lower he eye for fear that she would catch the glitter of they i know that you would hate I for what i have do because i have only prove that landi be a brave youngster with enough nerve for nine out of ten and i come tonight -- to ask you to forgive I no not that -- only to ask you to understand do you he raise he glance suddenly at that and they eye meet with one of these electric shock which will go tingle through two people and when the lip of nelly lebrun part a little he know that she be in the trap he close he hand that lay on the table -- curl the finger slowly in that way he express all he exultation there be something wrong say the girl in a tone of one who argue with herself it be all too logical to be real ah be that you only reason for fight jack landi do i have to confess even that she smile in the triumph of she penetration but it be a brief unhappy smile one might have think that she would have be glad to be deceive i come to serve a girl who be unhappy say donnegan she fianc have leave she she fianc be jack landi and she be now in a hut up the hill wait for he and i think that if i ruin he in you eye he would go back to a girl who would not care so much about bravery who have forgive he for have leave she but you see what a fool i be and how clumsily i work my bluff fail and i only wound he put he in you house under you care where he 'll be happiest and where there 'll never be a chance for this girl to get he back nelly lebrun with she fold hand under she chin study he mr donnegan she say i wish i know whether you be the most chivalrous self-sacrificing of man or simply the most gorgeous liar in the desert and it be hardly fair say donnegan to expect I to tell you that 28 it give they both a welcome opportunity to laugh welcome to the girl because it break into a excitement which be rapidly tell upon she and welcome to donnegan because the strain of so many distortion of the truth be tell upon he as well they laugh together one hasty glance tell donnegan that half the couple in the room be whisper about donnegan and nelly lebrun but when he look across the table he see that nelly lebrun have not a thought for what might be go on in the mind of other she be quite content and the girl she say donnegan rest he forehead upon he hand in think he dare not let nelly see he face at this moment for the mention of lou macon have pour the old flood of sorrow back upon he and therefore when he look up he be sneer you know these blond pretty girl he say oh they be adorable with dull eye say donnegan coldly and a twinkle come into the responsive eye of nelly lebrun the sort of a girl who see a hero in such a fellow as jack landi and jack be brave i should not have say that never mind brave but such a boy be you serious she look questioningly at donnegan and they smile together slowly i -- i be glad it be that way and donnegan sigh and do you really think it could be any other way i do not know i be afraid i be blind but the poor girl on the hill i wish i could see she she be watch donnegan very sharply again a good idea why do not you you seem to like she yes say donnegan judiciously she have a appealing way i be very sorry for she but i have do my best i can not help she be not there some way of what of help she donnegan laugh go to you father and persuade he to send landi back to she she shake she head of course that would not do there be business mix up in all this you know business well i guess at that my part in it be not very pleasant she remark sadly donnegan be discreetly silent know that silence extract secret they make I -- flirt with poor jack i really like he how much the past tense may mean poor fellow murmur the sympathetic donnegan but why with gathering heat could not you help I to do the thing i can not do alone why could not you get he away from the house with joe rix and the pedlar guard he they 'll be asleep in the middle of the night but jack would wake up and make a noise there be thing that would make he sleep through anything but how could he be move on a horse litter keep ready outside and how carry to the litter i would carry he the girl look at he with a question and then with a faint smile begin easily say donnegan stiffen in he chair very easily it please she to find this weakness in the pride of the invincible donnegan it give she a secure feeling of mastery so she control she smile and look with a sort of superior kindliness upon the red-headed little man it be no good nelly lebrun say with a sigh even if he be take away -- and then it would get you into a bad mess would it worse than i be in hush lord nick be come to the corner and no matter what you have do so far -- i think i could quiet he but if you be to take landi away -- then nothing could stop he donnegan sneer i begin to think lord nick be a bogie he say everyone whisper when they speak of he he lean forward i should like to meet he nelly lebrun it staggered nelly do you mean that she cry softly i do she catch she breath and then a spark of deviltry gleam i wonder say nelly lebrun and she glance weigh donnegan all i ask be a fair chance he say he be a big man say the girl maliciously the never-failing blush burn in the face of donnegan a large target be more easily hit he say through he tooth she thought play back and forth in she eye i can not do it she say donnegan play a random card i be mistaken he say darkly jack be not the man i should have face lord nick no no no mr donnegan you can not persuade I well i be a fool not to guess it i really think say the girl gloomily that as soon as lord nick come you 'll hunt he out he bow to she with cold politeness in spite of he size say donnegan through he tooth once more and at this the girl 's face soften and grow merry i be go to help you to take jack away she say on one condition and that that you will not make a step toward lord nick when he come i shall not avoid he say donnegan you be unreasonable well not avoid he but simply not provoke he i 'll arrange it so that lord nick will not come hunting trouble and he 'll let jack stay with the girl and she father perhaps he 'll persuade they to let he go of they own free will donnegan thought of the colonel and smile in that case of course i should not care at all he add : but do you mean all this you shall see they talk only a moment longer and then donnegan leave the hall with the girl on he arm certainly the thought of all in milligan 's follow that pair and it be see that donnegan take she to the door of she house and then go away through the town and up the hill and big george follow he like a shadow cast from a lantern behind a man walk in a fog in the hut on the hill donnegan put george quickly to work and with a door and some bedding a litter be hastily construct and swing between the two horse in the meantime donnegan climb higher up the hill and watch steadily over the town until in a house beneath he two light be show he come back at that and hurry down the hill with george behind and around the house until they come to the pretentious cabin of the gambler lebrun once there donnegan go straight to a unlighted window tap and it be open from within softly nelly lebrun stand within it be do she say joe and the pedlar be sound asleep they drink too much you father have not come home and jack landi no matter what you do he will not wake up but be careful of he shoulder it be badly tear how can you carry he she could not see donnegan 's flush but she hear he tooth grit and he slip through the window gesture to george to come close it be still darker inside the room -- far darker than the starlit night outside and the one path of lighter gray be the bed of jack landi he heavy breathing be the only sound donnegan kneel beside he and work he arm under the limp figure and while he kneel there a door in the house be open and close softly donnegan stand up be the door lock no whisper the girl quick too late it be father and he would hear the turning of the key they wait while the light quick step come down the hall of the cabin it come to the door it go past and then the step retrace and the door be open gently there be a light in the hall the form of lebrun be outline black and distinct jack he whisper no sound he make as if to enter and then he hear the heavy breathing of the sleeper apparently asleep poor fool murmur the gambler and close the door the door be no sooner closed than donnegan have raise the body of the sleeper once as he rise strain it nearly slip from he arm and when he stand erect he stagger but once he have gain he equilibrium he carry the wounded man easily enough to the window through which george reach he long arm and lift out the burden you see say donnegan panting to the girl yes it be really wonderful you be laugh now i but hurry my father have a fox 's ear for noise he will not hear this i think there be a swift scuffle very soft of movement nelly call a far-off voice hurry hurry do not you hear you forgive I no -- yes -- but hurry you will remember I mr donnegan adieu she catch a picture of he sit in the window for the split part of a second with he hat off bow to she then he be go and she go into the hall pant with excitement heaven nelly lebrun murmured i feel as if i have be hunt and i must look it what if he -- whatever the thought be she do not complete it it may have be for the best add nelly lebrun 29 it be you phlegmatic person who can waken easily in the morning but a active mind readjust itself slowly to the day so nelly lebrun rouse herself with a effort and scowl toward the door at which the hand be still rap yes she call drowsily this be nick may i come in this be who the name have bring she instantly into complete wakefulness she be out of the bed have slip she foot into she slipper and whip a dress gown around she while she be ask the question it be a luxurious little boudoir which she have manage to equip skin of the lynx cunningly match have be sew together to make she a rug and the soft fur of the wildcat be the outer covering of she bed she throw back the tumbled bedclothes toss half a dozen pillow into place transform it into a day couch and run to the mirror and in the meantime the deep voice outside the door be say : yes nick may i come in she give a little ecstatic cry but while it be still tingle on she lip she be wind she hair into shape with lightning speed have dip the tip of she finger in cold water and rub she eye awake and brilliant and with one circular rub have bring the color into she cheek scarcely ten seconds from the time when she first answer the knock nelly be open the door and peep out into the hall the rest be do by the man without he cast the door open with the pressure of he foot catch the girl in he arm and kiss she and while he close the door the girl slip back and stand with one hand press against she face and she face hold that delightful expression halfway between laughter and embarrassment as for lord nick he do not even smile he be not in fact a man who be prone to gentle expression but have be frame by nature for a strong dominance over all around he he habitual expression be a proud self-containment it would have be insolence in another man in lord nick it be rather leonine he be fully as tall as jack landi but he carry he height easily and be so perfectly proportion that unless he be see beside another man he do not look large the breadth of he shoulder be conceal by the depth of he chest and the girth of he throat be make to appear quite normal by the lordly size of the head it support to crown and set off he magnificent body there be a handsome face and he have the combination of active eye and red hair which be noticeable in donnegan too in fact there be a certain resemblance between the two man in the set of the jaw for instance in the gleam of the eye and above all in a indescribable ardor of spirit which exude from they both except of course that in donnegan one be conscious of all spirit and very little body but in lord nick hand and eye be terribly mate look upon so splendid a figure it be no wonder that the mountain desert have forgive the crime of lord nick because of the careless insolence with which he treat the law it require a exceptional man to make a legal life attractive and respect it take a genius to make law-breaking glorious no wonder that nelly lebrun stand with she hand against she cheek look he over smile happily at he and question he about he immediate past all in the same glance he wave she back to she couch and she hesitate then as though she remember that she now have to do with lord nick in person she obediently curl up on the lounge and wait expectantly i hear you have be raise the devil say this singularly frank admirer the girl merely look at he well he insist i have not do a thing protest nelly rather childishly no one feel that he could have crush she with evidence to the contrary but that he be restrain himself -- it be not worthwhile to bother with such a girl seriously thing have fall into a tangle since i leave old satan macon be on the spot and you rat of a father have let landi get away what have you be do nelly while all this be go on sit with you eye close he take a chair and lounge back in it gracefully how could i help it i be not a watchdog he be silent for a time well he say if you tell I the truth i suppose i should not love you my girl but this time i be in earnest landi be a mint silly child if we let he go we lose the mint i suppose you 'll get he back first i want to find out how he get away i know how ah donnegan donnegan donnegan donnegan burst out lord nick and though he do not raise the pitch of he voice he allow its volume to swell softly so that it fill the room like the humming of a great angry tiger nobody say three word without put in the name of donnegan as one of they you too she shrug she shoulder donnegan thrill the corner go on the big man in the same terrible voice donnegan wear queer clothes donnegan shoot scar-faced lewi donnegan pump the nerve out of poor jack landi and then drill he why nelly it look as though i 'll have to kill this intrude fool she blanch at this but do not appear to notice it be a long time since you have kill a man be not it she ask coldly it be a awful business declare lord nick always complication have to throw the blame on the other fellow and even these blockhead be begin to get tired of my self-defense plea well murmur the girl do not cross that bridge until you come to it and you 'll never come to it never because i do not want he kill ah lord nick murmur and why because he be in love -- with I tush say lord nick i see you my dear donnegan seem to be a rare fellow but he could not have get landi out of this house without help rix and the pedlar may have be a bit sleepy but donnegan have to find out when they fall asleep he have a confederate who not rix not the pedlar not lebrun they all know I it have to be someone who do not fear I who only one person in the world nelly you be the one she hesitate a breathless instant yes she say i be she add as he stare calmly at she consider : there be a girl in the case she come up here to get landi seem he be in love with she once and i pity she i send he back to she suppose he be a mint have not we coin enough money out of he besides i could not have keep on with it no he be get violent and he talk marriage all day every day i have not any nerve you say but he begin to put I on edge so i get rid of he nelly be you grow a conscience she flush and then set she tooth but i 'll have to teach you business method my dear i have to bring he back you 'll have to go through donnegan to do it i suppose so you do not understand nick he be different eh he be like you what be you drive at nick i tell you upon my word of honor no matter what a terrible fighter you may be donnegan will give you trouble he have you hair and you eye and he move like a cat i have never see such a man -- except you i would rather see you fight the plague than fight donnegan for the first time lord nick show real emotion he lean a little forward just what do he mean to you he ask i have stand for a good deal nelly i have give you absolute freedom but if i ever suspect you -- the lion be up in he unmistakably now and the girl shrink if it be serious do you suppose i would talk like this i do not know you be a clever little devil nell but i be clever too and i begin to see through you do you still want to save donnegan for you own sake he stand up i be go up the hill today if donnegan 's there i 'll go through he but i be go to have landi back she also rise there be only one way out and i 'll take that way i 'll get donnegan to leave the house i do not care what you do about that and if he be not there will you give I you word that you will not hunt he out afterward i never make promise nell but i 'll trust you nick very well i start up the hill in a hour you have that long 30 the air be thin and chilly snow have fall in the mountain to the north and the wind be bring the cold down to the corner nelly lebrun note this as she dress and make up she mind accordingly she send out two message : one to the cook to send breakfast to she room which she eat while she finish dress with care and the other to the gambling house summon one of the waiter when he come she give he a note for donnegan the fellow flash a glance at she as he take the envelope there be no need to give that name and address in the corner and the girl tingle under the glance she finish she breakfast and then concentrate in polish up she appearance from all of which it may be gather that nelly lebrun be in love with donnegan but she really be not but he have touch in she that cord of romance which run through every woman whenever it be touch the vibration be music and nelly be fill with the sound of it and except for lord nick there be no doubt that she would have really lose she head for she keep see the face of donnegan as he have lean toward she across the little table in milligan 's and that as anyone may know be a dangerous symptom she glance be alternate between she mirror and she watch and the hand of the latter pointed to the fact that fifty minute of she hour have elapse when a message come up that she be wait for in the street below so nelly lebrun go down in she ride costume the corduroy swishing at each step and tap she shine boot with the ride crop she own horse she find at the hitch rack and beside it donnegan be on he chestnut horse it be a tall horse and he look more diminutive than ever before pitch so high in the saddle he be on the ground in a flash with the rein tuck under one arm and he hat under the other she become aware of glove and white-linen stock and pale narrow face truly donnegan make a natty appearance there be no day like a cool day for ride she say and i think you might agree with I he untether she horse while he murmur a answer but for he attitude she care little so long as she have he ride away from that house on the hill where lord nick in all he terror would appear in some few minute besides as they swing up the road -- the chestnut at a long-strided canter and nelly 's black at a soft and choppy pace -- the wind of the gallop strike into she face nelly be make to enjoy thing one by one and not two by two they hit over the hill and when the first impulse of the ride be do they be a mile or more away from the corner -- and lord nick the resemblance between the two man be less striking now that she have donnegan beside she he seem more wizened paler and intense as a violin string screw to the snap point there be none of the lordly tolerance of nick about he he be like a bull terrier compare with a stag hound and only the color of he eye and he hair make she make the comparison at all what could be better she say when they check they horse on a hilltop to look over a gradual fall of the ground below what could be better the wind flatten a loose curl of hair against she cheek and overhead the wild goose be fly and cry small and far away one thing better say donnegan and that be to sit in a chair and see this she frown at such frankness it be almost blunt discourtesy you see i be a lazy man how long have it be the girl ask sharply since you have sleep two day i think what be wrong he lift he eye slowly from a glitter distant rock and bring he glance toward she by degree he have a way of exciting people even in the most commonplace conversation and the girl feel a thrill under he look that say donnegan be a dangerous question and he allow such hunger to come into he eye that she catch she breath the imp of perversity make she go on and why dangerous it be a excellent excuse for a outpouring of the heart from donnegan but instead he eye twinkle at she you be not frank he remark she could not help laughing and she laughter trail away musically in she excitement have once let down the bar i can not keep you at arm 's length after last night i suppose i should never have let you see I for -- day and day that be why i be curious say donnegan and not flattered i be try to find what purpose you have in take I ride i wonder she say thoughtfully if you will and since such fencing with the wit delight she she let all she delight come with a sparkle in she eye i have one clue yes and that be that you may have the old-woman curiosity to find out how many way a man can tell she that he be fond of she though she flush a little she keep she poise admirably i suppose that be part of my interest she admit i can think of a great many way of say it say donnegan i be the dry desert you be the rain and yet i remain dry and produce no grass a very pretty comparison say the girl with a smile a very green one and donnegan smile i be the wind and you be the wild goose and yet i keep on blow after you be go and do not carry away a feather of you pretty again and silly but really you be very kind to I and i shall try not to take too much advantage of it will you answer a question i have rather ask one : but go on what make you so dry a desert mr donnegan there be a very leading question again i do not mean it that way for you have the same sad hungered look the first time i see you -- when you come into milligan 's in that beggarly disguise i shall confess one thing it be not a disguise it be the fact of I i be a beggarly person nonsense i be not witless mr donnegan you talk well you have a education in fact i have a educate taste i disapprove of myself you see and long ago learn not to take myself too seriously which lead to -- the reason why i have wander so much like a hunter on a trail hunting for what a chance to sit in a saddle -- or a chair -- and talk as we be talk which seem to be idly oh you mistake I under the surface i be as serious as fire or ice at the random hit he glance sharply at she but she be look a little past he think i have try to get at the reason behind all you reason she say you come on I in a haphazard fashion and yet you be not a haphazard sort do you see nothing serious about I i see that you be unhappy say the girl gently and i be sorry once again donnegan be jar and he come within a ace of open he mind to she of pour out the truth about lou macon love be a talk madness in all man and he come within a ace of confess he trouble let 's go on she say loosen she rein why not cut back in a semicircle toward the corner toward the corner no no there be a brighten of he eye as he note she shudder of distaste or fear and she strive to cover she trace i be sick of the place she say eagerly let 's get as far from it as we may but yonder be a very good trail lead past it of course we 'll ride that way if you wish but i would rather go straight ahead if she have insist stubbornly he would have think nothing but the moment she become politic he be on he guard you dislike something in the corner he say think carelessly and aloud you be afraid of something back there but what could you be afraid of then you may be afraid of something for I ah i have it they have decide to ` get ' I for take jack landi away joe rix and the pedlar be wait for I to come back he look steadily and she attempt to laugh joe rix and the pedlar i would not stack ten like they against you then it be someone else i have not say so of course there be no one she shake she rein again but donnegan sit still in he saddle and look fixedly at she that be why you bring I out here he announce oh nelly lebrun what be behind you mind who be it by heaven it be this lord nick mr donnegan you be let you imagination run wild it be go straight to the point but i be not angry i think i may get back in time he turn he horse and the girl swing hers beside he and catch he arm do not go she plead you be right it be nick and it be suicide to face he the face of donnegan set cruelly the main obstacle he say come and watch I handle it but she drop she head and bury she face in she hand and sit there for a long time she hear he careless whistle blow back to she as he gallop toward the corner 31 if nelly lebrun have consign he mentally to the worm that think make not the slightest impression upon donnegan a chance for action be open before he and above all a chance of action in the eye of lou macon and he welcome with open arm the thought that he would have a opportunity to strike for she and keep landi with she he go arrowy straight and arrowy fast to the cabin on the hill and he find ample evidence that it have become a center of attention in the corner there be a scattering of people in the distance apparently loitering with no particular purpose but undoubtedly because they await a explosion of some sort he go by a group at which the chestnut shy and as donnegan straighten out the horse again he catch a look of both interest and pity on the face of the man do they give he up so soon as it be know that lord nick have enter the list against he have all he display in the corner go for nothing as against the repute of this terrible mystery man he vanity make he set he tooth again dismount before the cabin of the colonel he find that worthy in he invalid chair enjoy a sun bath in front of he house but there be no sign of lord nick -- no sign of lou a grim fear come to donnegan that he might have to attack nick in he own stronghold for jack landi might already have be take away to the lebrun house so he go straight to the colonel and when he come close he see that the fat man be apparently in the grip of a chill he have gather a vast blanket about he shoulder and keep draw it tighter beneath he eye which look down to the ground there be violet shadow i have lose say donnegan through he tooth lord nick have be here the invalid lift he eye and donnegan see a terrible thing -- that the nerve of the fat man have be crush the fold of he face quiver as he answer huskily : he have be here and landi be go no not go then -- nick have go to get a horse litter he come up just to clear the way when he come back he 'll find I the glance of the colonel clear long enough to survey donnegan slowly from head to foot and he amusement send the familiar hot flush over the face of the little man he straighten to he full height which in he high heel be not insignificant but the colonel be apparently so desperate that he be willing to throw caution away compare with lord nick donnegan he say you do not look half a man -- even with those heel and he smile calmly at donnegan in the manner of one who have escape the lightning bolt itself do not fear mere thunder there be no fool like a fat fool say donnegan with childish viciousness what do lord nick as you call he do to you he be bring out the yellow my friend the colonel accept the insult without the quiver of a eyelid throughout he seem to be look expectantly beyond donnegan my young friend he say you have be very useful to I but i must confess that you be no longer a tool equal to the task i dismiss you i thank you cordially for you effort they be worthless you see that crowd gathering yonder they have come to see lord nick prepare you for a hole in the ground and make no mistake : if you be here when he return that hole will have to be dig -- unless they throw you out for the claw of the buzzard in the meantime we effort have be waste completely i have not enough time i have throw the fear of sudden death into landi and in another hour he would have sign away he soul to I for fear of poison the colonel pause to chuckle at some enjoyable memory then nick come you see i know all about nick and nick know all about you for a moment the agate catlike eye of the colonel cloud and clear again in they unfathomable manner at moment donnegan he say you have rare perception that be exactly it -- nick know just about everything concern I and so -- roll you pack and climb on you horse and get away i think you may have another five minute before he come donnegan turn on he heel he go to the door of the hut and throw it open lou sit beside landi hold he hand and the murmur of she voice be still pleasant as a echo through the room when she look and see donnegan at that she rise and she face harden as she look at he landi also lift he head and he face be convulse with hatred so donnegan close the door and go softly away to he own shack she hate he even as landi hate he it seem he should have know that he would not be thank for bring back she lover to she with a bullet through he shoulder sit in he cabin he take he head between he hand and thought of life and death and make up he mind he be afraid if lord nick have be the devil himself donnegan could not have be more afraid but if the big stranger have be ten devil instead of one donnegan would not have find it in he soul to run away nothing remain for he in the corner it seem except he position as a man of power -- a dangerous fighter it be a less than worthless position and yet once have take it up he could not abandon it more than one gunfighter have be in the same place force to act as a public menace long after he have cease to feel any desire to fight of selfish motive there remain not a scruple to he but there be still the happiness of lou macon if the boy be take back to lebrun 's it would be fatal to she for even if nelly wish she could not teach she eye new habit and she would ceaselessly play on the heart of the wounded man it be the cessation of all talk from the gathering crowd outside that make donnegan lift he head at length and know that lord nick have come but before he have time to prepare himself the door be cast open and into it fill it from side to side step lord nick there be no need of a introduction donnegan know he by the aptness with which the name fit that glorious figure of a man and by the calm confident eye which now be look he slowly over from head to foot lord nick close the door carefully behind he the colonel tell I he say in he deep smooth voice that you be wait for I here and donnegan recognize the snakelike malice of the fat man in draw he into the fight but he dismiss that quickly from he mind he be stare fascinate into the face of the other he be a reader of man be donnegan he be a reader of mind too in he life of battle he have learn to judge the prowess of other at a glance just as a musician can tell the quality of a violin by the first note he hear play upon it so donnegan judge the quality of fight man and look into the face of lord nick he know that he have meet he equal at last it be a great and a bitter moment to he the sense of physical smallness he have banish a thousand time by the recollection of he speed of hand and he surety with weapon he have look at man muscularly great and despise they in the knowledge that a gun or a knife would make he they master but in lord nick he recognize he own nerveless speed of hand he own hair-trigger balance he own deadly seriousness and contempt of life the experience in battle be there too and he begin to feel that the size of the other crushed he to the floor and make he hopeless it be unnatural it be wrong that this giant in the body should be a giant in adroitness also already donnegan have die one death before he rise from he chair and stand to the full of he height ready to die again and summon he nervous force to meet the enemy he have see that the big man have follow he own example and have measure he at a glance indeed the history of some life of action hold less than the concentrated silence of these two man during that second 's space and now donnegan feel the cold eye of the other eat into he own strive to beat he down break he nerve for a instant panic get hold on donnegan he himself have break the nerve of other man by the weight of he unaided eye have he not reduce poor jack landi to a tremble wreck by five minute of silence and have he not see other brave man become tremble coward unable to face the light and all because of that terrible power which lie in the eye of some he fight away the panic though perspiration be pour out upon he forehead and beneath he armpit the colonel be very kind say donnegan and that moment he send up a prayer of thankfulness that he voice be smooth as silk and that he be able to smile into the face of lord nick the brow of the other clouded and then smooth itself deftly perhaps he too recognize the clang of steel upon steel and know the metal of he enemy and therefore say lord nick since most of the corner expect business from we it seem much as if one of we must kill the other before we part as a matter of fact say donnegan i have be keep that in mind he add with that deadly smile of he that never reach he eye : i never disappoint the public when it be possible to satisfy they no and lord nick nod you seem to have most of the habit of a actor -- include a inclination to make up for you part donnegan bit he lip until it bleed and then smile i have be play to fool he say now i shall enjoy a discriminate critic yes remark lord nick actor generally desire a intelligent audience for the death scene i applaud you penetration and i shall speak well of you when this disagreeable duty be finish come and lord nick smile genially you be a game little cock the telltale flush crimsoned donnegan 's face and if the fight have begin at that moment no power under heaven could have save lord nick from the frenzy of the little man my size keep I from stoop say donnegan i shall look up to you sir until the moment you fall well hit again you be also a wit i see donnegan i be almost sorry for the necessity of this meeting and if it be not for the audience -- say no more say donnegan bowing i read you heart and appreciate all you intend he have touch he stock as he bow and now he turn to the mirror and carefully adjust it for it be a little awry from the ride but in reality he use that moment to examine he own face and the set of he jaw and the clearness of he eye reassure he turn again he surprise a glint of admiration in the glance of lord nick we be at one sir it appear he say and there be no other way out of this disagreeable necessity unfortunately not i have a certain position in these part people be apt to expect a good deal of I and for my part i see no way out except a gunplay -- no way out between the devil and the moon astonishment sweep suddenly across the face of the big man for donnegan turn white as death shrink toward the wall as though he have that moment receive cold steel in he body say that again say donnegan hoarsely i say there be no way out repeat lord nick and though he keep he right hand in readiness he pass he leave through he red hair and stare at donnegan with a tinge of contempt he have see man buckle like this at the last moment when they back be to the wall between -- repeat donnegan the devil and the moon do you see a way yourself he be astonished again to see donnegan wince as if from a blow he lip be tremble and they writhe stiffly over he word who teach you that expression say donnegan a gentleman say lord nick ah my father sir oh heaven moan donnegan catch he hand to he breast oh heaven forgive we what the devil be in you ask lord nick the little man stand erect again and he eye be now on fire you be henry nichola reardon he say lord nick set he tooth now he say it be certain that you must die but donnegan cast out he arm and break into a wild laughter oh you fool you fool he cry do not you know I i be the cripple 32 the big man cross the floor with one vast stride and seize donnegan by both shoulder drag he under the full light of the window and still the crazy laughter shake donnegan and make he helpless they tie I to a board -- like a papoose say donnegan and they straighten my back -- but they leave I this way -- wizen up he be stammer hysterical and the word tumble from he lip in a jumble that be a month after you run away from home i be go to find you get bigger take the road keep hunting then i meet a yegg who tell about rusty dick -- describe he like you -- i think -- i think you be dead and the tear roll down he face he sob like a woman a strange thing happen then lord nick lift the little man in he arm as if he be a child and literally carry he in that fashion to the bunk he put he down tenderly still with one mighty arm around he back you be garry you garrison donnegan reardon aye that be what i be henry do not say that you do not know I but -- you back -- i think -- i know -- hopeless they say i be but they bring in a young doctor now look at I little i never grow big -- but hard henry as leather and he spring to he foot and know that donnegan have begin life as a cripple it be easy to appreciate certain thing about he expression -- a cold wistfulness and he manner of read the mind of man lord nick be like a man in a dream he drag donnegan back to the bunk and force he to sit down with the weight of he arm and he could not keep he hand from he younger brother as though he be blind and have to use the sense of touch to reassure he i hear lie they say everybody be dead i think -- the fever kill they all except I uncle toby take I in he be a devil help I along but i leave he when i could and -- do not tell I any more all that matter be that i have you at last garry heaven know it be a horrible thing to be kithless and kinless but i have you now ah lad but the old pain have leave its mark on you poor garry donnegan shudder i have forget it do not bring it back i keep feeling that you should be in that chair i know but i be not i be hard as nail i tell you he leap to he foot again and not so small as you might think henry oh big enough garry big enough to paralyze the corner from what i have hear i have be play a game with 'em henry and now -- if one of we could clear the road what will we do together eh the smile of lord nick show he tooth have not i be hungry all my life for a man like you lad somebody to stand and guard my back while i face the rest of the world and i 'll do my share of the face too you will garry but i be you elder man man nobody 's my elder except one that be spend half he life -- as i have do we 'll teach you to forget the pain i 'll make life rose for you garry and the fool outside think -- donnegan break into a soundless laughter and run to the door open it a fraction of a inch and peep out they be stand about in a circle i can see 'em gaping even from here what will they think henry lord nick ground he tooth they 'll think i have back down from you he say gloomily they 'll think i have take water for the first time why confound 'em the first man that open he head -- i know i know you would fill he mouth with lead and so would

eat he up he measure he up and down see that he be a fight wildcat in spite of he size and decide to back out and donnegan be willing they could not come out without a story of some kind -- with the whole world expect a death in that cabin -- so they frame a crazy cock-and-bull story about be brother ' i can hear they say that donnegan and it make I wild do you call I donnegan say donnegan sadly

you unman I i 'll be weep like a woman in a minute but now sit down we still have some thing to talk over and we 'll get to a quick conclusion ah yes say donnegan and at the emotion which have come in the face of lord nick he own expression soften wonderfully a light seem to stand in he face we 'll brush over the incidental and everything be incidental aside from the fact that we be together again they can chisel iron chain apart but we 'll never be separate again god willing he look up as he speak and he face be for the moment as pure as the face of a child -- donnegan the thief the beggar the liar by gift and the man-killer by trade and artistry but lord nick in the meantime be look down to the floor and muster he thought the main thing be entirely simple he say you 'll make one concession to my pride garry boy can you ask I say donnegan softly and he cast out he hand in a gesture that offer he heart and he soul can you ask I anything i have be yours do not say that answer lord nick tenderly but this small thing -- my pride you know -- i despise myself for care what people think but i be weak i admit it but i can not help it talk out man you 'll see if there be a bottom to thing that i can give well it be this everyone know that i come up here to get young jack landi and bring he back to lebrun 's -- from which you steal he you clever young devil well i 'll simply take he back there garry and then i 'll never have to ask another favor of you he be astonish by a sudden silence and look up again he see that donnegan sit with he hand at he breast it be a singularly feminine gesture to which he resort it be a habit which have come to he in he youth in the invalid chair when the ceaseless torment of he cripple back become too great for he to bear and clearly indeed those day be bring home to lord nick as he glance up for donnegan be stare at he in the same old familiar agony mute and helpless 33 at this lord nick very frankly frown in turn and when he frown he face grow marvelously dark like some wrathful god for there be a noble a grecian purity to the profile of henry nichola reardon and when he frown he seem to be scorn from a distance ignoble earthly thing which trouble he i know it be not exactly easy for you garry he admit you have you own pride you have you own position here in the corner but i want you to notice that mine be different you have spend a day for what you have in the corner here i have spend ten year you have play a prank act a part and cast a jest for what you have but for the place which i hold brother mine i have scheme with my wit play fast and loose and kill man do you hear i have buy it with blood and thing you buy at such a price ought to stick eh he banish he frown the smile play suddenly across he feature why i be argue with myself but that look you give I a minute ago have I worried for a little while at this donnegan who have allow he head to fall so that he seem to be nod in acquiescence now raise he face and lord nick perceive the same white pain upon it the same look which have be on the face of the cripple so often in the other day henry say the younger brother i give you my oath that my pride have nothing to do with this i would let you drive I barefoot before you through the street yonder i would let every soul in the corner know that i have no pride where you be concerned i 'll do whatever you wish -- with one exception -- and that one be the unlucky thing you ask pardner you must not ask for jack landi anything else i 'll work like a slave to get for you : i 'll fight you battle i 'll serve you in any way you name : but do not take landi back he have talk eagerly the word come with a rush and he find at the end that lord nick be look at he in bewilderment when a man be condemn to death say lord nick slowly suppose somebody offer he anything in the world that he want -- palace riches power -- everything except he life what would the condemn man say to a friend who make such a offer he have laugh at he and then call he a traitor eh but i do not laugh at you garry i simply explain to you why i have to have landi back listen he count off he point upon the tip of he finger in the confident manner of a teacher who deal with a stupid child wait patiently for the young mind to comprehend we have be bleed jack landi do you know why because it be lester who make the strike up here he start out to file he claim he stop at the house of colonel macon that old devil learn the location learn everything detain lester with a trick and rush young landi away to file the claim for himself then when lester come up here he find that he claim have be jump and when he go to the law there be no law that could help he he have nothing but he naked word for what he have discover and naturally the word of a ruffian like lester have no weight against the word of landi and you see landi think that he be entirely in the right lester try the other way try to jump the claim and be shoot down by landi so lester send for I what be i to do kill landi the mine would go to he heir i try a different way -- bleed he of he profit after i would explain to he that he be in the wrong he half admit that but he naturally would not give up the mine even after we have almost prove to he that lester have the first right so landi have be mine the gold and we have be draw it away from he it look tricky but really it be only just and lester and lebrun split with I but i tell you garry that i would give up everything without a afterthought i 'll give up the money and i 'll make lebrun and lester shut up without a word i 'll make they play square and not try to knife landi in the back i 'll do all that willingly -- for you but garry i can not give up take landi back to lebrun 's and keep he there until he be well why man i see he in the hut just now he want to go he be afraid of the old colonel as if he be poison -- and i think he be wise in be afraid the colonel will not touch he say donnegan no no i have tell he what would happen if he do tush garry colonel macon be the coldest-blooded murderer i have ever know but come out in the open lad you see that i be ready to listen to reason -- except on one point tell I why you be so set on this keep of landi here against my will and even against the lad 's own will i be reasonable garry do you doubt that explain he own mildness the voice of lord nick swell again and fill the room and he frown on he brother but donnegan look on he sadly there be a girl -- he begin why do not i guess it exclaim lord nick if ever you find a man unreasonable stubborn and foolish you 'll always find a woman behind it all this trouble because of a piece of calico he lean back laugh thunderously in he relief come come i be prepare for a tragedy now tell I about this girl who and what be she the daughter of the colonel you be in love with she i be glad to hear it garry as a matter of fact i have be afraid that you be hunting in my own preserve but if it be the colonel 's daughter you be welcome to she so you love the girl she be pretty lad i love she say donnegan in a indescribably tender voice i love she who be i to love she a thief a man-killer a miserable play actor a gambler a drunkard i love she bah if there be one quality of the mind with which lord nick be less familiar than with all other it be humbleness of spirit he now abase he magnificent head and rest he chin in the mighty palm of he hand he stare with astonishment and commiseration into the face of donnegan he seem to be learn new thing every moment about he brother leave I out of the question say donnegan can not be do if i leave you out dear boy there be not one of they that i care a hang about i would ride roughshod over the whole lot i have do it before to better man than these then you 'll change i know this be the fact of the matter she love landi and if you take landi away where will you put he where he be steal away in lebrun 's and what will be in lebrun 's joe rix to guard he and the old negress to nurse he ' no no nelly lebrun will be there eh be you glance at she now henry you yourself know that landi be mad about that girl oh she be flirt a bit with he turn the fool 's head he 'll come out of it safe she will not break he heart i have see she work on other he chuckle at the memory what do i care about landi say donnegan with unutterable scorn it be the girl you 'll break she heart henry and if you do i 'll never forgive you steady lad this be a good deal like a threat no no no not a threat heaven know by heaven exclaim lord nick i begin to be irritated to see you stick on a silly point like this listen to I lad do you mean to say that you be make all this trouble about a slip of a girl the heart of a girl say donnegan calmly let landi go then take she in you arm and kiss she worry away i warrant you can do it i gather from nell that you be not tongue-tied around woman i echo donnegan turn pale do not jest at this henry i be as serious as death she be the type of woman make to love one man and one man only landi may be common as dirt but she do not see it she be fasten she heart on he i look in on she a little while ago she turn white when she see I i bring landi to she but she hate I because i have to shoot he down garry say the big man with a twinkle in he eye you be in love it shake donnegan to the core but he reply instantly if i be in love do not you suppose that i would have shoot to kill when i meet landi at this he brother blink frowned and shake he head the point be apparently plain to he and wipe out he previous conviction also it ease he mind then you do not love the girl i either way my hand be clear of the worry if you want she let I take landi if you do not want she what difference do it make to you except silly sentiment donnegan make no answer if she come to lebrun 's house i 'll see that nell do not bother he too much can you control she if she want to see this fool can you keep she away and if she go to he can you control she smile certainly say lord nick but he flush heavily donnegan smile she be a devil of a girl admit henry reardon but this be beside the point : which be that you be stick on a matter that mean everything to I and which be only a secondhand interest to you -- a point of sentiment you pity the girl what be pity bah i pity a dog in the street but would i cross you garry lad to save the dog sentiment i say silly sentiment donnegan rise it be a silly sentiment he say hoarsely that put I on the road follow you henry it be a silly sentiment that turn I into a wastrel a wanderer a man without a home and without friend it be wrong to throw that in my face mutter lord nick it be and i be sorry for it but i want you to see that matter of sentiment may be matter of life and death with I aye if it be for you it would be different i might see my way clear -- but for a girl you have only a distant interest in -- it be a matter of whether or not she heart shall be break come come let 's talk man talk besides girl ' heart do not break in this country you be old-fashioned i tell you the question of she happiness be worth more than a dozen life like yours and mine there have be a gathering impatience in lord nick now he also leap to he foot a giant tell I in one word : you stick on this point in one word -- yes then you deny I garry you set I aside for a silly purpose of you own -- a matter that really do not mean much to you it show I where i stand in you eye -- and nothing between the devil and the moon shall make I sidestep they remain silent stare at each other lord nick stand with a flush of anger grow donnegan become whiter than ever and he stiffen himself to he full height which in all who know he well be the danger signal you take landi he say softly i do not say donnegan while i live you mean -- cry lord nick i mean it they have be sweep back to the point at which that strangest of scene begin but this time there be a add element -- horror you would fight to the death henry garry if one of we should kill the other he would be curse forever i know it and she be worth even this a thousand time more what be we dust in the wind dust in the wind but a woman like that be divine henry lord nick sway a little setting himself in balance like a animal prepare for the leap if it come to the pinch it be you who will die he say you have no chance against I garry and i swear to you that i will not weaken you prove that you do not care for I you put another above I it be my pride my life that you would sacrifice to the whim of a girl he passion choke he be you ready say donnegan yes move first i have never form the habit nor i you fool take what little advantage you can because it will not help you in the end you shall see i have a second sight henry and it show I you dead on the floor there look bigger than ever and i see the gun smoking in my hand and my heart as dead as ash oh henry if there be only some other way they be both pale now aye murmured lord nick if we could find a judge my hand turn to lead when i think of fight you garry perspiration stand on the face of donnegan name a judge i 'll abide by the decision some man -- no no what man could understand I a woman henry nell lebrun the girl who love you you want I to plead before she put she on she honor and she 'll be as straight as a string with both of we for a moment donnegan consider and at length : she love you henry you have that advantage you have only to let she know that this be a vital matter to you and she 'll speak as you wish she to speak nonsense you do not know she you have see yourself that no man can control she absolutely make a concession a thousand garry dear boy if they 'll get we clear from this horrible mess only this leave the corner for a few hour give I until -- tonight let I see nelly during that time you have have year to work on she i want only this time to put my own case before she thank heaven that we be come to see light and a way out aye henry the big man wipe he forehead and sigh in he relief a minute ago i be ready -- but we 'll forget all this what will you do how will you persuade nelly i almost think that you intend to make love to she garry the little man turn paler still it be exactly what i intend he say quietly the brow of lord nick darken solemnly and then he force a laugh she 'll be afraid to turn I down garry but try you own way he bite he lip why if you influence she that way -- do it what be a fickle jade to I nothing however i do it you 'll stick by she judgment henry the perspiration have start on lord nick 's forehead again doubt sway he but pride force he on i 'll come again tonight he say gloomily i 'll meet you in -- milligan 's in milligan 's then lord nick without a word of farewell stamp across the hut and out as for donnegan he step backward he leg buckle beneath he and when big george enter with a scared face he find the little man half sit on the bunk half lie against the wall with the face and the stare eye of a dead man 34 it be a long time before donnegan leave the hut and when he come out the crowd which have gather to watch the fight or at least to mark the report of the gun when those two terrible warrior meet be scatter there remain before donnegan only the colonel in he invalid 's chair even from the distance one could see that he expression be change and when the little red-headed man come near the colonel look up to he with something akin to humility donnegan he say stop the other as donnegan head for the door of the hut donnegan do not go in there just now donnegan turn and come slowly toward he the reason say the colonel be that you probably will not receive a very cheery reception unfortunate -- very unfortunate lou have turn wrong-headed for the first time in she life and she will not listen to reason he chuckle softly i never dream there be so much of my metal in she blood will tell my boy blood will tell and when you finally get she you 'll find that she be worth wait for let I tell you a secret say donnegan dryly i be no longer wait for she ah smile the colonel of course not this bringing of landi to she -- it be all pure self-sacrifice it be not a attempt to soften she heart it be not a cunning maneuver tush of course not i be about to make a profound remark say donnegan carelessly by all means you read the mind of other people through a color glass colonel you see yourself everywhere in other word i put my own motive into the action and behind the action of people perhaps i be full of weakness very full in the meantime let I tell you one important thing -- if you have not make the heart of lou tender toward you you have at least frightened she the jaw on donnegan set excellent he say huskily perhaps better than you think and to keep you abreast with the time you must know another thing lou have a silly idea that you be a lose soul donnegan but she attribute you fall entirely to my weakness nothing can convince she that you do not intend to kill landi nothing can convince she that you do not act on my inspiration i have try argue bah she overwhelm I with she scorn you be a villain say lou and i have make you one and for the first time in my memory of she she eye fill with tear tear upon my honor and when a girl begin to weep about a man i do not need to say he be close to she heart you be full of maxim colonel macon as a nut be full of meat old experience you know in the meantime lou be perfectly certain that i intend to make away with landi ha ha ha the laughter of the colonel be a cheery thunder and soft as with distance landi be equally convinced he beg lou not to fall asleep lest i should steal in on he she hardly dare leave he to cook he food i actually think she would have be glad to see that fiend lord nick take landi away donnegan smile wanly but could he tell she poor girl the story of nelly lebrun landi in fear of he life be no doubt at this moment pour out protestation of deathless affection and they both consider you a archdemon for keep lord nick away again donnegan wince and cough behind he hand to cover it however go on the colonel when it come to matter with the heart of woman i trust to time time alone will show she that landi be a puppy in the meantime colonel she keep you from come near landi not at all you fail to understand I and my method dear boy i have only to roll my chair into the room and sit and smile at jack in order to send he into a hysteria of terror it be amusing to watch and i can be there while lou be in the room and through a few careful innuendo convey to landi my undying determination to either remove he from my path and automatically become he heir or else secure from he a legal transfer of he rights to the mine i have learn say donnegan that landi have not the slightest claim to they himself and that you set he on the trail of the claim by trickery the colonel do not wince of course not say the fat trickster not the slightest right my claim be a claim of superior wit you see and in the end all you labor shall be reward for my share will go to lou and through she it shall come to you no quite logical the colonel disregard the other 's smile but i have a painful confession to make well i misjudged you donnegan a moment since when i be nearly distraught with disappointment i say some most unpleasant thing to you i have forget they but the colonel raise he strong forefinger and shake he head smile no no donnegan if you deny it i shall know that you be harbor the most undying grudge against I as a matter of fact i have just have a interview with lord nick and the curse fellow put my nerve on edge the colonel make a wry face and when you come i see no manner in which you could possibly thwart he he eye grow wistful between friend -- as a son to he future father he say softly can not you tell I what the charm be that you use on nick to send he away i watch he come out of the shack he be in a fury i could see that by the way he head thrust out between he big shoulder and when he go down the hill he be stride like a giant but every now and then he would stop short and he head would go up as if he be tempt to turn around and go back but do not quite have the nerve donnegan tell I the trick of it willingly i appeal to he gamble instinct which leave I as much in the dark as ever but donnegan smile in he own peculiar and mirthless manner and he go on to the hut not that he expect a cheery greet from lou macon but he be draw by the same perverse instinct which tempt a man to throw himself from a great height at the door he pause a moment he could distinguish no word but he catch the murmur of lou 's voice as she talk to jack landi and it have that infinitely gentle quality which only a woman 's voice can have and only when she nurse the sick it be a pleasant torture to donnegan to hear it at length he summon he resolution and tap at the door the voice of lou macon stop he hear a hurry and whisper consultation what do they expect then swift foot-fall on the floor and she open the door there be a smile of expectancy on she lip she eye be bright but when she see donnegan she lip pinch in she stare at he as if he be a ghost i know i know she say piteously fall back a step but still keep she hand upon the knob of the door as if to block the way to donnegan oh jack he have kill lord nick and now he be here -- to do what to kill landi in turn she horrified eye imply as much he see landi in the distance raise himself upon one elbow and he face be gray not with pain but with dread it can not be groan landi lord nick be alive say donnegan and i have not come here to torment you i have only come to ask that you let I speak with you alone for a moment lou he watch she face intently all the cabin be in deep shadow but the golden hair of the girl glow as if with a inherent light of its own and the same light touch she face jack landi be stricken with panic : he stammer in a dreadful eagerness of fear do not leave I lou you know what it mean he want to get you out of the way so that the colonel can be alone with I do not go lou do not go as though she see how hopeless it be to try to bar donnegan by close the door against he she fall back to the bed she keep she eye on the little man as if to watch against a surprise attack and fumble behind she she hand find the hand of landi and close over it with the reassurance of a mother do not be afraid jack i will not leave you not unless they carry I away by force i give you my solemn word say donnegan in torment that the colonel shall not come near landi while you be away with I you word murmur the girl with a sort of horrified wonder you word and donnegan bow he head but all at once she cast out she free hand toward he while the other still cherish the weakness of jack landi oh give they up she cry give up my father and all he wicked plan there be something good in you give he up come with we stand for we : and we shall be grateful all we life the little man have remove he hat so that the sunshine burn brightly on he red hair indeed there be always a flamelike quality about he in inaction he seem femininely frail and pale but when he spirit be rouse he eye blaze as he hair burn in the sunlight you shall learn in the end he say to the girl that everything i do i do for you she cry out as if he have strike she it be not worthy of you she say bitterly you be keep jack here -- in peril -- for my sake for you sake say donnegan she look at he with a queer pain in she eye to keep you from needless lie she say let I tell you that jack have tell I everything i be not angry because you come and pretend that you do all these horrible thing for my sake i know my father have tempt you with a promise of a great deal of money but in the end you will get nothing no he will twist everything away from you and leave you nothing but as for I -- i know everything jack tell I he have tell you what what about the woman you love the woman i love echo donnegan stupefy it seem that lou macon could only name she with a effort that leave she tremble the lebrun woman she say jack have tell I do you tell she that he ask landis the whole town know it stammer the wounded man the cunning hypocrisy spur donnegan he put he foot on the threshold of the shack and at this the girl cry out and shrink from he but landi be too paralyzed to stir or speak for a moment donnegan be wildly tempt to pour he torrent of contempt and accusation upon landi to what end to prove to the girl that the big fellow have coolly trick she that it be to be near nelly lebrun as much as to be away from the colonel that he wish so ardently to leave the shack after all lou macon be make happy by a illusion let she keep it he look at she sadly again she stand defiant over landi ready to protect the helpless bulk of the man so donnegan close the door softly and turn away with ash in he heart 35 when nelly lebrun raise she head from she hand donnegan be a far figure yet even in the distance she could catch the lilt and easy sway of he body he ride as he walk lightly he foot in the stirrup half take he weight in a semi-english fashion for a moment she be on the verge of spur after he but she keep the rein taut and merely stare until he dip away among the hill for one thing she be quite assure that she could not overtake that hard rider and again she feel that it be useless to interfere to step between lord nick and one of he purpose would have be like step before a avalanche and command it to halt with a raise hand she watch miserably until even the dust cloud dissolve and the bare brown hill alone remain before she then she turn away and hour after hour let she black jog on to nelly lebrun this day be one of those still time which come over the life of a person and in which they see themselves in relation to the rest of the world clearly it would not be true to say that nelly love donnegan certainly not as yet for the familiar figure of lord nick fill she imagination but the little man be different lord nick command respect admiration obedience but there be about donnegan something which touch she in a intimate and disturbing manner she have feel the will-o ' - the-wisp flame which burn in he in he great moment it be possible for she to smile at donnegan it be possible even to pity he for he fragility he touchy pride about he size to criticize he fondness for take the center of the stage even in a cheap little mining camp like this and strut about the center of all attention yet there be quality in he which escape she a possibility of metallic hardness a pitiless fire of purpose to lord nick he be as the bull terrier to the mastiff but above all she could not dislodge the memory of he strange talk with she at lebrun 's not that she do not season the odd avowal of donnegan with a grain of salt but even when she have discount all that he say she retain a quiver interest somewhere beneath he word she sense reality somewhere beneath he action she feel a selfless willingness to throw himself away as she ride she be compare he steadily with lord nick and as she make the comparison she feel more and more assure that she could pick and choose between the two they love she both of they with nick it be a old story with donnegan it might be equally true in spite of its newness and nelly lebrun feel rich not that she would have be willing to give up lord nick by no means but neither be she willing to throw away donnegan diamond in one hand and pearl in the other which handful must she discard she remain ride a unconscionable length of time and when she draw rein again before she father 's house the black be fleck with foam from he clamp bit and there be a thick lather under the stirrup leather she throw the rein to the servant who answer she call and go slowly into the house donnegan by this time be dead she begin to feel that it would be hard to look lord nick in the face again he other killing have often seem to she glorious she have rejoice in the invincibility of she lover now he suddenly take on the aspect of a murderer she find the house hushed perhaps everyone be at the gaming house for now it be midafternoon but when she open the door to the apartment which they use as a living room she find joe rix and the pedlar and lester sit side by side silent there be no whisky in sight there be no card to be see marvel of marvel these three man be spend they time in solemn think a sudden thought rush over she and she cry tell where she heart really lay at least at this time lord nick -- have he be -- the pedlar lift he gaunt head and stare at she without expression it be joe rix who answer nick 's upstairs safe not a scratch she sink into a chair with a sigh but be instantly on edge again with the second thought donnegan she whisper safe and sound say lester coldly she could not gather the truth of the statement then nick get landi back before donnegan return no like any other girl nelly lebrun hate a puzzle above all thing in the world at least a puzzle which affect she new friend lester what be happen she demand at this lester who have be brood upon the floor raise he eye and then switch one leg over the other he be a typical cowman be lester from he crimson handkerchief knot around he throat to he shop-made boot which fit slenderly about he instep with the care of a gloved hand i dunno what happen say lester which look like what count be the thing that do not happen landi be still with that devil macon donnegan be loose without a scratch and lord nick be in he room with a face as black as a cloudy night and briefly he describe how lord nick have go up the hill see the colonel come back take a horse litter and go up the hill again while the populace of the corner wait for a crash for donnegan have arrive in the meantime and how nick have go into the cabin remain a singularly long time and then come out with a face half white and half red and a eye that dare anyone to ask question he have stride straight home to lebrun 's and go to he room and there he remain never make a sound but i 'll give you my way of readin ' the sign on that trail say lester nick go up the hill to clean up on donnegan he see he they size each other up in a flash they figure that if they be a gun it mean a double killin ' -- and they simply haul off and say a perlite fare-thee-well the girl pay no attention to these remark she be sink in a brown study there be something behind it all she say more to herself than to the man nick be proud as the devil himself and i can not imagine why he would let donnegan go oh it might have be do if they would meet alone in the desert but with the whole town look on and wait for nick to clean up on donnegan -- no it be not possible there must have be a showdown of some kind there be a grim little silence after this maybe there be say the pedlar dryly maybe there be a showdown -- and the wind-up of it be that nick come home meek as a six-year-old break down in front she stare at he first astonish and then almost frightened you mean that nick may have take water the three as one man shrug they shoulder and meet she glance with cold eye you fool cry the girl spring to she foot he would rather die joe rix lean forward and to emphasize he point he stab one dirty forefinger into the fat palm of he other hand you just start thinkin ' back he say solemnly and you 'll remember that donnegan have do some pretty slick thing lester add with a touch of contempt : like shootin ' down landi one day and then sittin ' down and havin ' a nice long chat with you the next i dunno how he do it that hunch of yours say the girl fiercely ought to be rope and brand -- lie lester do not look at I like that and if you think nick have lose he grip on thing you be dead wrong step light lester -- and the rest of you or nick may hear you walk -- and think she fling out of the room and race up the stair to lord nick 's room there be a interval without response after she first knock but when she rap again he call out to know who be there at she answer she hear he heavy stride cross the room and the door open slowly he face as she look up to it be so change that she hardly know he he hair be unkempt on end where he have sit with he finger thrust into it bury in thought and the mark of he palm be red upon he forehead nick she whisper frightened what be it he look down half fiercely half sadly at she and though he lip part they close again before he speak fear jump coldly in nelly lebrun do donnegan -- she plead white-faced do he -- do he bluff I out finish nick no he do not that be what everybody 'll say i know it do not i and that be why i be stay here by myself because the first fool that look at I with a question in he face why -- i 'll break he in two she press close to he more frightened than before that lord nick should have be drive to defend himself with word be almost too much for credence you know i do not believe it nick you know that i be not doubt you but he brush she hand roughly away you want to know what it be all about then go over to -- well to milligan 's donnegan will be there he 'll explain thing to you i guess he want to see you and maybe i 'll come over later and join you see lord nick before she so shake so gray of face so dull of eye she picture donnegan as a devil in human form cunning resistless nick dear -- she plead he close the door in she face and she hear he heavy step go back across the room in some mysterious manner she feel the promethean fire have be steal from lord nick and donnegan 's be the hand that have rob he of it 36 it be fear that nelly lebrun feel first of all it be fear because the impossible have happen and the immovable object have be at last move go back to she own room the record of lord nick flash across she mind one long series of thrilling deed he have be a great and widely known figure on the mountain desert while she herself be no more than a girl when she first meet he she have be prepare for the sight of a firebreathing monster and she have never quite recover from the first thrill of find he not devil but man quite oddly now that there seem another man as powerful as lord nick or even more terrible she feel for the big man more tenderly than ever for like all woman there be a corner of she heart into which she wish to receive a thing she could cherish and protect lord nick the invincible have seem without any real need of other human being he love for she have seem unreal because he need of she seem a superficial thing now that he be in sorrow and defeat she suddenly visualize a lord nick to whom she could truly be a helpmate tear come to she eye at the thought yet very contradictorily and very humanly the moment she be in she room she begin prepare she toilet for that evening at lebrun 's let no one think that she be already prepare to cast lord nick away and turn to the new star in the sky of the mountain desert by no means no doubt she own heart be not quite clear to nelly indeed she put on she most lovely gown with a desire for revenge if lord nick have be humble by this singular donnegan would it not be a perfect revenge to bring donnegan himself to she foot would it not be a joy to see he turn pale under she smile and then when he be well-nigh on he knee spurn the love which he offer she she set she tooth and she eye gleam with the thought but nevertheless she go on lavish care in the preparation for that night as she vision the scene the many curious eye that watch she with donnegan the keen envy in the face of the woman the cold watchfulness of the man be what she picture in a way she almost regret that she be admire by such fight man landi lord nick and now donnegan who frighten away the rank and file of other would-be admirer but it be a pang which she could readily control and subdue to tell the truth the rest of the day drag through a weary length at the dinner table she father lean to she and talk in he usual murmur voice which could reach she own ear and no other by any chance nelly there be go to be the devil to pay around the corner you know why now be a good girl and wise girl and play you card donnegan be lose he head he be lose it over you so play you card turn down nick and take up donnegan she ask coldly i have say enough already say she father and would not speak again but it be easy to see that he already feel lord nick 's star to be past its full glory afterward lebrun himself take he daughter over to milligan 's and leave she under the care of the dance-hall proprietor i be wait for someone say nelly and milligan sit willingly at she table and make talk he be like the rest of the corner -- full of the subject of the strange encounter between lord nick and donnegan what have donnegan do to the big man nelly merely smile and say they would all know in time : one thing be certain -- lord nick have not take water but at this milligan smile behind he hand ten minute later there be that stir which announce the arrival of some public figure and donnegan with big george behind he come into the room this evening he go straight to the table to nelly lebrun milligan a little uneasy rose but donnegan be gravely polite and regret that he have interrupted i have only come to ask you for five minute of you time he say to the girl she be about to put he off merely to make sure of she hold over he but something she see in he face fascinate she she could not play she game milligan have slip away before she know it and donnegan be in he place at the table he be as much change as lord nick she think not that he clothes be less carefully arrange than ever but in the compression of he lip and something behind he eye she feel the difference she would have give a great deal indeed to have learn what go on behind the door of donnegan 's shack when lord nick be there last time you ask for one minute and stay half a hour she say this time it be five minute no matter what be on he mind he be able to answer fully as lightly when i talk about myself i be always long-winded tonight it be someone else yes she be be a woman intensely disappointed but she smile be as bright as ever of course i be listen you remember what i tell you of landi and the girl on the hill she seem to stick in you thought mr donnegan yes she be a lovely child and by he frankness he very cunningly disarm she even if he have hesitate a instant she would have be on the track of the truth but he have foresee the question and he reply come back instantly he add : also what i say have to do with lord nick ah say the girl a little coldly donnegan go on he have choose frankness to be he role and he play it to the full it be a rather wonderful story he go on you know that lord nick go up the hill for landi and the corner be stand around wait for he to bring the youngster down of course there be only one obstacle -- which you have so kindly remove -- myself for you own sake mr donnegan ah do not you suppose that i know and he voice touch she he come to kill I and no doubt he could have do so such frankness shock she into a new attention perhaps donnegan overdo he part a little at this point for in she heart of heart she know that the little man would a thousand time rather die than give way to any living man but i throw my case bodily before he -- the girl -- she love for landi -- and the fear which revolve around you own unruly eye you know if he be send back to you father 's house i place it all before he at first he be for fight at once but the story appeal to he he pity the girl and in the end he decide to let the matter be judge by a third person he suggest a man but i know that a man would see in my attitude nothing but foolishness no man could have appreciate the position of that girl on the hill i myself name another referee -- yourself she gasp and so i have come to place the question before you because i know that you will decide honestly then i shall be honest say the girl she be think : why not have landi back it would keep the three man revolve around she landi on he foot and well would have be nothing either of these man would have kill he but landi sick she might balance in turn against they both nelly have the instinct of a fencer she love balance but donnegan be heap up he effect for by the shadow in she eye he well know what be pass through she mind and he dare not let she speak too quickly there be more hanging upon it in the first place if landi be leave with the girl it give the colonel a chance to work on he and like as not the colonel will get the young fool to sign away the mine to he -- frighten he you see though i have make sure that the colonel will not actually harm he how have you make sure they say the colonel be a devil i have speak with he the colonel be not altogether without sensibility to fear she catch the glint in the little man 's eye and she believe so much for that landi be safe but he money may not be another thing still hang upon you decision lord nick want to know why i trust to you because i feel you be honest why do i feel that there be nothing to do besides how could i conceal myself from such a man i speak frankly and tell he that i trust you because i love you she close she hand hard on the edge of the table to steady herself and he make no move at you he restrain himself lord nick gasp the incredulous girl he be a gentleman say donnegan with a singular pride which she could not understand he go on : and unfortunately i fear that if you decide in favor of my side of the argument i fear that lord nick will feel that you -- that you -- he be apparently unable to complete he sentence he will feel that you no longer care for he say donnegan at length the girl ponder he with cloudy eye what be behind all this frankness she ask coldly i shall tell you hopelessness be behind it last night i pour my heart at you foot and i have hope today i have see lord nick and i no longer hope ah he be worthy of a lovely woman 's affection and i -- he call she attention to himself with a deprecatory gesture do you ask I to hurt he like this say the girl he pride be the pride of the fiend love I he would hate I it might be true still i know you would risk it because -- he pause well ask the girl whisper in she excitement because you be a lady he bow to she because you be fair because you be honest nelly lebrun personally i think that you can win lord nick back with one minute of smile but you might not you might alienate he forever it will be clumsy to explain to he that you be influence not by I but by justice he will make it a personal matter whereas you and i know that it be only the right that you be see she prop she chin on the tip of she finger and she arm be a thing of grace for the last moment that cloud expression have not clear if i only could read you mind she murmur now there be something behind it all i shall tell you what it be it be the restraint that have fall upon I it be because i wish to lean closer to you across the table and speak to you of thing which be at the other end of the world from landi and the other girl it be because i have to keep my hand grip hard to control myself because though i have give up hope i would follow a forlorn chance a lose cause and tell you again and again that i love you nelly lebrun he have half lower he eye as he speak he have call up a vision and the face of lou macon hover dimly between he and nelly lebrun if all that he speak be a lie let he be forgive for it it be the golden-haired girl whom he address and it be she who give the tremor and the fiber to he voice and after all be he not plead for she happiness as he believe he cover he eye with he hand but when he look up again she could see the shadow of the pain which be slowly pass she have never see such emotion in any man 's face and if it be for another how could she guess it she blood be singing in she vein and the old old question be fly back and forth through she brain like a shuttle through a loom : which shall it be she call up the picture of lord nick half-broken but still terrible she well know she pity he but when do pity wholly rule the heart of a woman and as for nelly lebrun she have the ambition of a young caesar she could not fill a second place he who love she must stand first and she see donnegan as the invincible man she have not believe half of he explanation no he be shield lord nick behind that shield the truth be that the big man have quail before the small of course she see that donnegan pretend to be constrain by he agreement with lord nick be in reality cunningly plead he own cause but he passion excuse he when have a woman condemn a man for love she beyond the rule of fair play whatever you may decide donnegan be say i shall be prepare to stand by it without a murmur send landi back to you father 's house and i submit : i leave the corner and say farewell but now think quickly for lord nick be come to receive you answer 37 if the meeting between lord nick and donnegan earlier that day have work up the nerve of the corner to the point of hysteria if the singular end of that meeting have pile mystery upon excitement if the appearance of donnegan sit calmly at the table of the girl who be know to be engage to nick have further stimulate public curiosity the appearance of lord nick be now a crowning burden under which the corner stagger yet not a man or a woman stir from he chair for everyone know that if the long-delayed battle between these two gunfighter be at length to take place neither bullet be apt to fly astray but what happen complete the wreck of the corner 's nerve for lord nick walk quietly across the floor and sit down with nelly lebrun and he somber rival oddly enough he look at donnegan not at the girl and this token of the beaten man decide she well say lord nick i have decide say the girl landi should stay where he be neither of the two man stir hand or eye but lord nick turn gray at length he rise and ask donnegan quietly to step aside with he see they together the difference between they size be more apparent : donnegan seem hardly larger than a child beside the splendid bulk of lord nick but she could not overhear they talk you have win say lord nick both landi and nelly and -- wait break in donnegan eagerly henry i have persuade nelly to see my side of the case but that do not mean that she have turn from you to -- stop put in lord nick between he tooth i have not come to argue with you or ask advice or opinion i have come to state fact you have crawl in between I and nelly like a snake in the grass very well you be my brother that keep I from handle you you have break my reputation just as i say you would do the bouncer at the door look I in the eye and smile when i come in he have to pause a little breathing heavily and avoid donnegan 's eye finally he be able to continue i be go to roll my blanket and leave the corner and everything i have in it you 'll get my share of most thing it seem he smile after a ghastly mirthless fashion i give you a free road i surrender everything to you donnegan but there be two thing i want to warn you about it may be that my man will not agree with I it may be that they 'll want to put up a fight for the mine they can not get at it without get at macon they can not get at he without remove you and they 'll probably try it i warn you now another thing : from this moment there be no blood tie between we i have find a brother and lose he in the same day and if i ever cross you again donnegan i 'll shoot you on sight remember i be not threatening i simply warn you in advance if i be you i would get out of the country avoid I donnegan as you would avoid the devil and he turn on he heel he feel the eye of the people in the room follow he by jerk dwelling on every one of he step near the door step aside to avoid a group of people come in he half turn and he could not avoid the sight of donnegan and nelly lebrun at the other end of the room he be lean across the table talk with a smile on he lip -- at that distance he could not mark the pallor of the little man 's face -- and nelly lebrun be laugh laughing already and oblivious of the rest of the world lord nick turn a blur come before he eye and make blindly for the door a body collide with he without a word he draw back he massive right fist and knock the man down the stunned body strike against the wall and collapse along the floor lord nick feel a great madness swell in he heart yet he set he tooth control himself and go on toward the house of lebrun he have come within a eyelash of run amuck and the quiver hunger for action be still swell and ebb in he when he reach the gambler 's house lebrun be not in the gaming house no doubt at this time of night -- but the rest of nick 's choose man be there they stand up as he enter the room -- harry master newly arrive -- the pedlar -- joe rix -- three name famous in the mountain desert for deed which be not altogether a pleasant aroma in the nostril of the law-abiding but whose sin have be deftly cover from legal proof by the cunning of nick and whose bravery itself have half redeem they they rise now as three wolf rise at the come of the leader but this time there be a question behind they eye and he read it in gloomy silence well ask harry master in the old day not one of they would have dare to voice the question but now thing be change and well lord nick could read the change and its cause be you talk to I ask nick and he look straight between the eye of master the glance of the other do not falter and it madden nick i be talk to you say master coolly enough what happen between you and donnegan what should happen ask lord nick maybe all this be a joke say master bitterly he be a square-built man with a square face and a wrinkled fleshy forehead in intelligence nick rank he first among the man and if a new leader be to be choose there be no doubt as to where the choice of the man would fall no doubt that be why master put himself forward now ready to brave the wrath of the chief maybe we be fool go on master maybe they be not any call for you to fall out with donnegan maybe there be a call to find out this answer lord nick why do you leave the mine what be you do up here the other swallow so hard that he blink i leave the mine he declare through he set tooth because i be run off 'em ah say lord nick for the devil be rise in he i always have a idea that you might be yellow master the right hand of master sway toward he gun hesitate and then poise idly you hear I talk persist lord nick brutally i call you yellow why do not you draw on I i call you yellow you swine and i call the rest of you yellow you think you have I down why curse you if there be thirty of you cut i would say the same to you there be a quick shift the three man face lord nick but each from a different angle and oppose they he stand superbly indifferent he arm fold he foot brace he arm be fold but each hand for all they know might be grasp the butt of a gun hide away in he clothes once they flash a glance from face to face but there be no action they be remember only too well some of the wild deed of this giant you think i be through go on lord nick maybe i be -- through with you you hear I talk one by one he eye dare they and one by one they take up the challenge struggle and lower they glance he be still they master and in that mute moment the three admit it the pedlar last of all master see fit to fall back on the last remark i have swallow a lot from you nick he say gravely maybe there 'll be a end to what we take one of these day but now i 'll tell you how yellow i be a couple of gent come to I and tell I i be through at the mine i tell they they be crazy they say old colonel macon have send they down to take charge i laugh at 'em they go away and come back who with with the sheriff and he flash a paper on I it be all draw up clean as a whistle trim up with a lot of ` wherease ' and ` as hereinbefore mention ' and such like thing but the sheriff just gimme a look and then he tell I what it be about jack landi have sign over all the mine to the colonel and the colonel have take possession as he stop a growl come from the other lester be the man that have the complaint say lord nick where do the rest of you figure in it lester have the mine he lose 'em because he could not drop landi with he gun he have never have have a smell of the gold if i have not come in who make landi see light i do who work it so that every nickel that come out of the mine go through the finger of landi and come back to we i do but i be through with you you can hunt for yourselve now i have keep you together to guard one another 's back i have keep the law off you trail you master you would have swing for kill the mckay brother who save you who be it bribe the jury that try you for the shooting up of derbyville pedlar who take the marshal off you trail after you would knife lefty waller joe rix i have save you all a dozen time now you whine at I i be through with you forever stop he glare about he he knuckle sting from the impact of the blow he have deliver in milligan 's place he hunger to have one of these three stir a hand and get into action and they know it all at once they crumble and become clay in he hand chief say joe rix the smoothest speak of the lot and one who be suppose to stand specially well with lord nick on account of he ability to bake bean spanish chief you have say a whole pile you be worth more 'n the rest of we all roll together sure we know that there be not any argument but here 's just one little point that i want to make we be do fine the gold be run fine and free along come this donnegan he bust up we good time he fork in on you girl -- a convulsion of the chief 's face make rix waver in he speech and then he go on : he shoot landi and when he miss kill he -- by some accident he come down here and grab he out of lebrun 's own house smooth eh then he make landi sign that deed to the mine oh very nice work i say too nice ` now speakin ' man to man they be not any doubt that you would like to get rid of donnegan why do not you because everybody have a jinx and he be yours i be not easy scared maybe but i know a albino with white eye once and just to look at he make I some sick well chief they be not nobody can say that you ever take water or ever will but maybe the fact that this donnegan have hair just as plumb red as yours may sort of get you off you feed i be just suggest now what i say be let the rest of we take a crack at donnegan and you sit back and come in on the result when we have clean up d'you give we a free road how much go through the brain of lord nick but in the end he give he brother up to death for he remember how nelly lebrun have sit in milligan 's laughing do what you want he say suddenly but i want to know none of you plan -- and the man that tell I donnegan be dead get pay -- in lead 38 the smile of joe rix be the smile of a diplomat it could be maintain upon he face as unwaveringly as if it be work out of marble while joe hear insult and lie as a matter of fact joe have smile in the face of death more than once and this be a school through which even diplomat rarely pass yet it be with a effort that he maintain the characteristic good-natured expression when the door to donnegan 's shack open and he see big george and beyond he donnegan himself booze say joe rix to himself instantly for donnegan be a wreck the unshaven beard -- it be the middle of morning -- be a reddish mist over he face he eye be sunken in shadow he hair be uncombed he sit with he shoulder hunch up like one who suffer from cold altogether he appearance be that of one whose energy have be utterly sap the top of the morning mr donnegan say joe rix and put he foot on the threshold but since big george do not move it be impossible to enter who be there ask donnegan it be a strange question to ask for by raise he eye he could have see but donnegan be stare down at the floor even he voice be a weak murmur what a party what a party he be have think joe rix and after all there be cause for a celebration have not the little man in almost one stroke win the heart of the prettiest girl in the corner and also do he not probably have a work share in the richest of the digging i be joe rix he say joe rix murmur donnegan softly then you be one of lord nick 's man i be say joe rix sort of attach to he maybe perhaps this pointed remark win the interest of donnegan he raise he eye and joe rix behold the most unhappy face he have ever see a bad hangover he decide and that make it bad for I come in say donnegan in the same monotonous lifeless voice big george reluctantly it seem withdraw to one side and rix be instantly in the room and draw out a chair so that he could face donnegan i be he proceed sort of tie up with lord nick but -- and here he wink broadly -- it be not much of a secret that nick be not altogether a lord any more nope seem he turn out sort of common they say what fool murmur donnegan have tell you that what ass have tell you that lord nick be a common sort it shock joe rix but be a diplomat he avoid friction by change he tactic between you and I he say calmly enough i take what i hear with a grain of salt there be something about nick that be not common no matter what they say besides they be some man that nobody but a fool would stand up to it be not hardly a shame for a man to back down from 'em he point this remark with a nod to donnegan i 'll give you a bit of free information say the little man with he weary eye light a little there be no man on the face of the earth who could make lord nick back down once more joe rix be shock to the verge of gaping but again he exercise a power of marvelous self control about that he remark as pointedly as before i get my doubt because there be some thing that any gent with sense will always clear away from maybe not one man -- but say a bunch of all standin ' together donnegan lean back in he chair and wait both of he hand remain droop from the edge of the table and the tired eye drift slowly across the face of joe rix it be obviously not the aftereffect of liquor the astonishing possibility occur to joe rix that this seem to be a man with a broken spirit and a great sorrow he blink that absurdity away come to case he go on there be yourself mr donnegan now you be the sort of a man that do not sidestep nobody too proud to do it but even you i guess would step careful if there be a whole bunch agin ' you no doubt remark donnegan i do not mean any ordinary bunch explain joe rix but a lot of hard fellow gent that handle they gun like they be bear with a holster on the hip fellow like nick 's crowd suggest donnegan quietly at this thrust the eye of joe narrow a little yes he admit i see you get my drift i think so two hard fighter would give the best man that ever pull a gun a lot of trouble eh no doubt and three man -- they be not any question mr donnegan -- would get he ready for a hole in the ground i suppose so and four man would make it no fight -- jest a plain butchery yes now i do not mean that nick 's crowd have any hard feeling about you mr donnegan i be glad to hear that i know you would be that be why i have come all friendly to talk thing over suppose you look at it this way -- joe rix break in donnegan sighing i be very tired will not you cut this short tell I in ten word just how you stand joe rix blink once more catch he breath and fire he volley short talk be straight talk mostly he declare this be what lester and the rest of we want -- the mine ah macon steal 'em we get 'em back through landi now we have get to get 'em back through the colonel himself but we can not get at the colonel while you be around in short you be go to start out to get I i expect it but it be kind of you to warn I wait wait wait do not rush along to conclusion we be not so much in a hurry we do not want you out of the way we just want you on we side shoot I up and then bring I back to life eh mr donnegan say the other spread out he hand solemnly on the table you be not doin ' we justice we do not hanker none for trouble with you any way it come a fight with you mean somebody dead besides you we would get you four to one be too much for any man but one or two of we might go down who would it be maybe the pedlar maybe harry master maybe lester maybe I oh we know all that no gunplay if we can keep away from it you have leave out the name of lord nick say donnegan joe rix wink seem like you tend to he once and for all when you get he alone in this cabin must have throw a mighty big scare into he he will not lift a hand agin ' you now no murmured donnegan hoarsely not he but that leave four of we and four be plenty eh perhaps but i be not here to insist on that point no we put a value on keepin ' up good feeling between we and you mr donnegan we be not fool we know a man when we see he -- and the fastest gunman that ever slide a gun out of leather be not the sort of a man that I and the rest of the boy pass over lightly not we we know you mr donnegan we respect you we want you with we we be go to have you with we you flatter I and i thank you but i be glad to see that you be at last come to the point i be and the point be five thousand dollar that be tie behind the hoss that stand outside you door he push he fat hand a little way across the table as though the gold even then be rest in it a yellow tide of fortune for which say donnegan i be to step aside and let you at the colonel right donnegan smile wait say joe rix i be makin ' a first offer to see how you stand but you be right five thousand be not enough and we be not cheapskate not we mr donnegan they be ten thousand cold iron man behind that saddle out there and every cent of it belong to you when you come over on we side but donnegan merely drop he chin upon he hand and smile mirthlessly at joe rix a wild thought come to the other man both of donnegan 's hand be far from he weapon why not a quick draw a snap shot and then the glory of have kill this manslayer in single battle for joe rix the thought rush red across he brain and then fade slowly something keep he back perhaps it be the singular calm of donnegan no matter how quiet he sit he suggest the sleep cat which can leap out of dead sleep into fight action at a touch by the time a second thought have come to joe rix the idea of a attack be like a idea of suicide be that final he ask though donnegan have not say a word it be joe rix stand up you put it to we kind of hard but we want you mr donnegan and here be the whole thing in a nutshell come over to we we 'll stand behind you lord nick be slip we 'll put you in he place you will not even have to face he we 'll get rid of he you 'll kill he and give he place to I ask donnegan we will and when you be with we you cut in on the whole amount of coin that the mine turn out -- and it 'll be something tidy and right now to show where we stand and how high we put you i 'll let you in on the rock-bottom truth mr donnegan out there tie behind my saddle there be thirty thousand dollar in pure gold you can take it in here and weigh it out he step back to watch this blow take effect to he unutterable astonishment the little man have not move he chin still rest upon the back of he hand and the smile which be on the lip and not in the eye of donnegan remain there fix donnegan mutter joe rix if we can not get you we 'll get rid of you you understand but the other continue to smile it give joe rix a shudder feeling that someone be steal behind he to block he way to the door he cast one swift glance over he shoulder and then see that the way be clear he slink back always keep he face to the red-headed man but when he come to the doorway he nerve collapse he whirl cover the rest of the distance with a leap and emerge from the cabin in a fashion ludicrously like one who have be kick through a door he nerve return as soon as the sunlight fall warmly upon he again and he look around hastily to see if anyone have observe he flight there be no one on the whole hillside except colonel macon in the invalid chair and the colonel be smile broadly beneficently he have he perfect hand fold across he breast and seem to cast a prayer of peace and goodwill upon joe rix 39 nelly lebrun smell danger she sense it as plainly as the deer when the puma come between she and the wind the many token that something be wrong come to she by small hint which have to be put together before they assume any importance first of all she father who should have burst out at she in a tirade for have leave lord nick for donnegan say nothing at all but keep a dark smile on he face when she be near he he even insinuate that nick 's time be do and that another be due to supersede he in the second place she have pass into a room where master joe rix and the pedlar sit cheek by jowl in close conference with a hum of deep voice but at she appearance all talk be break off it be not strange that they should not invite she into they confidence if they have some dark work ahead of they but it be exceedingly suspicious that joe rix attempt to pass off they whisper by immediately break off the soft talk and spring into the midst of a full-fledged jest also it be strangest of all that when the jest end even the pedlar who rarely smile now laugh uproariously and smite joe soundingly upon the back even a child could have string these incident into a chain of evidence which point toward danger obviously the danger be not directly hers but then it must be direct at some one near to she she father no he be more apt to be the mainspring of they action lord nick there be nothing to gain by attack he who be leave donnegan as the realization come upon she it take she breath away for a moment donnegan be the man at breakfast everyone have be talk about he lebrun have remark that he have a face for the card -- emotionless joe rix have comment upon he speed of hand and the pedlar have compliment the little man on he dress but at lunch not a word be speak about donnegan even after she have dexterously introduce the subject twice why the sudden silence between morning and noon donnegan must have grievously offend they fear for he sake stimulate she but above and beyond this indeed there be a mighty feminine curiosity she smell the secret it reek through the house and she be devour by eagerness to know she handpick lord nick 's gang in the hope of find a weakness among they some weakness upon which she could play in one of they and draw out what they be all conceal the pedlar be as unapproachable as a crag on a mountaintop master be wise as a outlaw broncho lester be probably not even in the confidence of the other because since the affair with landi he nerve have be shatter to bit and the other secretly despise he for be beat by the youngster at the draw there remain therefore only joe rix but joe rix be a fox of the first quality he lie with the smoothness of silk he could show a dozen color in as many moment come to the windward of joe rix it be a delicate business but since there be nothing else to do she fix she mind upon it work out this puzzle joe rix wish to destroy donnegan for reason that be evidently connect with the mine and she must step into he confidence to discover he plan how should it be do and there be a vital need for speed for they might be within a step of execute whatever mischief it be that they be plan she go down from she room they be there still only joe rix be not with they she go to the apartment where he and the other three of nick 's gang sleep and rap at the door he maintain he smile when he see she but there be a uncertain quiver of he eyebrow that tell she much plainly he be ill at ease suspicious ay there be always cloud of suspicion drift over the red round face of joe rix she put a tremor of excitement and trouble in she voice come into my room joe where we will not be interrupted he follow she without a word and since she lead the way she be able to relax she expression for a necessary moment when she close the door behind he and face joe again she be once more ready to step into she part she do not ask he to sit down she remain for a moment with she hand on the knob and search the face of joe rix eagerly do you think he can hear she whisper gesture over she shoulder who who but lord nick she exclaim softly the bewilderment of joe cloud he face a second and then he be able to smooth it away what on earth be the reason of she concern about lord nick he be obviously wonder i 'll tell you why she say answer the unspoken question at once he be as jealous as the devil joe the fat little man sigh as he look at she he can not hear not through that log wall but we 'll talk soft if you want yes yes keep you voice down he be already jealous of you joe of I he know i like you that i trust you and just now he be on edge about everyone i look at the surprising news which the first part of this sentence contain cause joe to gape and the girl look away in concern enable he to control he expression for she know well enough that man hate to appear foolishly surprised and particularly a fox like joe rix but what be the trouble nelly he add with a touch of venom : i think everything be go smoothly with you and i think you be not worry much about what lord nick have in he mind she stare at he as though astonish do you think just the same as the rest of they she ask sadly do you mean

that you would see through it joe she cry softly you see what a awful mess i have get into he pass a hurry hand across he forehead and then look at she searchingly but he could not penetrate she pretense of concern no matter what i think say joe rix you come out with it frankly i 'll listen as a friend joe she manage to throw a plea into she voice that make joe sigh sure you have already say that i be you friend and you be right i be in terrible terrible trouble you know how it happen i be a fool i try to play with lord nick and now he think i be in earnest as though the strength of he leg have give way joe rix slip down into a chair go on he say huskily you be play with lord nick can not you put yourself in my place joe it be always be take for grant that i be to marry nick and the moment he come around everybody else avoid I as if i be poison i be sick of it and when he show up this time it be the same old story a man would as soon sign he own death warrant as ask I for a dance you know how it be he nod still at sea but with a light begin to dawn in he little eye i be only a girl joe i have all the weakness of other girl i do not want to be lock up in a cage just because i -- love one man the avowal make joe blink it be the second time that day that he have be place in a astonishing scene but some of he old cunning remain to he nell he say suddenly rise from he chair and go to she what be you try to do to I pull the wool over my eye it be too much for nelly lebrun she know that she could not face he without betray she guilt and therefore she do not attempt it she whirl and fling herself on she bed face down and begin to sob violently suppress the sound and so she wait presently a hand touch she shoulder lightly go away cry nelly in a choke voice i hate you joe rix you be like all the rest he knee strike the floor with a soft thud come on nell do not be hard on I i think you be string I a little but if you be play straight tell I what you want at that she bounce upright on the bed and before he could rise she catch he by both shoulder i want donnegan she say fiercely what i want he dead joe rix gasp here be the cause of all my trouble just because i flirt with he once or twice nick thought i be in earnest and now he be sulk and donnegan put on air and act as if i belong to he i hate he joe and if he be go nick will come back to I he 'll come back to I joe and i want he so she find that joe rix be stare straight into she eye strive to probe she soul to its depths and by a great effort she be enable to meet that gaze finally the fat little man rise slowly to he foot she hand trail from he shoulder as he stand up and fall helplessly upon she lap well i 'll be hang nell exclaim joe rix what do you mean you be not act a part no i can see you mean it but what a cold-blooded little -- he check himself he face be suddenly jubilant then we have get he nell we have get he if you be with we we have he anyway but we 'll make sure of he if you be with we look at this you see I put a paper in my pocket when i open the door of my room here it be he display before the astonished eye of nelly lebrun a paper cover with a exact duplicate of she own swift dainty script and she read : nick be terribly angry and be make trouble i have to get away it be not safe for I to stay here will you help I will you meet I at the shack by donnell 's ford tomorrow morning at ten o'clock but i do not write it cry nelly lebrun bewildered nelly joe rix chuckle flush with pleasure you do not it be I i kind of have a idea that you want to get rid of this donnegan and i be go to do it for you and then surprise you with the good news joe you forge it do not bother sayin ' pretty thing about I and my pen say rix modestly this be nothin ' but if you want to help I nelly -- he voice fade partly out of she consciousness as she fight against a tigerish desire to spring at the throat of the little fat man but gradually it dawn on she that he be ask she to write out that note herself why because it be possible that donnegan might have see she handwriting and in that case though the imitation have be good enough to deceive nelly herself it probably would not for a moment fool the keen eye of donnegan but if she herself write out the note donnegan be already as good as dead that be conclude joe rix if he really love you nell the fool cry nelly he worship the ground i walk on joe and i hate he for it even joe rix shiver for he see the hate in she eye and could not dream that he himself be the cause and the object of it there be a red haze of horror and confusion in front of she eye and yet she be able to smile while she copy the note for joe rix but how be you go to work it she ask how be you go to kill he joe do not bother you pretty head say the fat man smile just wait till we bring you the good news but be you sure she ask eagerly see what he be do already he be take landi away from we he be baffle nick himself in some manner and he be gather the mine away from all of we he be a devil joe and if you want to get he you would better take ten man for the job you hate he nell do not you query joe rix and he voice be both hard and curious but how have he harm you have not he take nick away from I be not that enough the fat man shiver again all right i 'll tell you how it work now listen and he begin to check off the detail of he plan 40 the day pass and the night but how very slowly for nelly lebrun she go up to she room early for she could no longer bear the meaning glance which joe rix cast at she from time to time but once in she room it be still harder to bear the suspense as she wait for the noise to die away in the house midnight and half a hour more go by and then at last the murmur and the laughter stop she alone be wakeful in lebrun 's and when that time come she catch a scarf around she hair and she shoulder make of a filmy material which would veil she face but through which she could see and venture out of she room and down the hall there be no particular need for such caution however it seem nothing stir and presently she be outside the house and hurry behind the house and up the hill still she meet nothing if the corner live tonight its life be confine to milligan 's and the gambling house she find donnegan 's shack and the one next to it which the terrible colonel occupy entirely dark but only a moment after she tap at the door it be open donnegan fully dress stand in the entrance outline blackly by the light which come faintly from the hooded lantern hang on the wall be he sit up all the night unable to sleep because he wait breathlessly for that false tryst on the morrow a great tenderness come over the heart of nelly lebrun it be i she whisper there be a soft exclamation then she be draw into the room be there anyone here only big george but he be in the kitchen and he will not hear he never hear anything except what be mean for he ear take this chair he be put a blanket over the rough wood to make it more comfortable and she submit dumbly to he ministration it seem terrible and strange to she that one so gentle should be the object of so much hate -- such deadly hate as the member of nick 's gang feel for he and now that he be sit before she she could see that he have indeed be wakeful for a long time he face be grimly waste the lip be compress as one who have endure long pain and he eye gleam at she out of a profound shadow he remain in the gloom the light from the lantern fall brightly upon he hand alone -- meager fleshless hand which seem to represent hardly more strength than that of a child truly this man be all a creature of spirit and nerve therein lay he strength as also he weakness and again the cherish instinct grow strong and sweep over she there be no one near he say except the colonel and he daughter they be up the hillside somewhere do you see they no what in the world be they out for at this time of night because the colonel only wake up when the sun go down and now he be out there hum to himself and never speak a word to the girl but they will not be far away they 'll stay close to see that no one come near the cabin to get at landi he add : they must have see you come into my cabin and he lip set even harder than before be it fear because of she they may have see I enter but they will not know who it be you have the note from I yes it be a lie it be a ruse i be force to write it to save you for they be plan to murder you oh my dear hush hush murder i have be nearly hysterical all day and all the night but thank heaven i be here to warn you in time you must not go you must not go who be it he have draw he chair closer : he have take she hand and she note that he own be icy cold but steady as a rock they pressure soothe she infinitely joe rix the pedlar harry master they 'll be at the shack at ten o'clock but not i murder but a very clumsy scheme three man leave town and commit a murder and then expect to go undetected not even in the mountain desert but you do not understand you do not understand they be wise as fox they 'll take no risk they do not even leave town together or travel by the same route harry master start first he ride out at eight o'clock in the morning and take the north trail he ride down the gulch and wind out of it and strike for the shack at the ford at half past eight the pedlar start he go past sandy 's place and then over the trail through the marsh you know it yes last of all joe rix start at nine o'clock half a hour between they how do he go to the shack by the south trail he take the ridge of the hill but they 'll all be at the shack long before you and they 'll shoot you down from a distance as you come up to it plain murder but even for cowardly murder they dare not face you except three to one he be thoughtful suppose they be to be meet on the way you be mad to think of it but if they fail this time they 'll try again they must be teach a lesson three man oh my dear my dear promise very well i shall do nothing rash and i shall never forget that you have come to tell I this and be in peril nell for if they find you have come to I -- the pedlar would cut my throat i know he ah but now you must go i 'll take you down the hill dear no no it be much easier to get back alone my face will be cover but there be no way you could be disguise you have a way of walk -- good night -- and god bless you she be in he arm strain he to she and then she slip out the door and sure enough there be the colonel in he chair not fifty foot away with a girl push he the moonlight be too dim for nelly lebrun to make out the face of lou macon but even the light which escape through the filter of cloud be enough to set she golden hair glowing the color be not apparent but its luster be soft silver in the night there be a murmur of the colonel 's voice as nelly come out of the cabin and then from the girl a low cry it bring the blood to the cheek of nelly as she hurry down the hill for she recognize the pain that be in it and it occur to she that if the girl be in love with jack landi she be strangely interested in donnegan also the thought come so sharply home to she that she pause abruptly on the way down the hill after all this macon girl would be a very strange sort if she be not impress by the little red-headed man with he gentle voice and he fiery way and he easy way of make himself a brilliant spectacle whenever he appear in public and nelly remember also with the keen suspicion of a woman in love how weakly donnegan have respond to she embrace this night how absent-mindedly he arm have hold she and how numbly they have fall away when she turn at the door but she shake she head and make the suspicion shudder its way out of she lou macon she decide be just the sort of girl who would think jack landi a ideal besides she have never have a opportunity to see donnegan in he full glory at milligan 's and as for donnegan he be weary out he nerve relax and for the deed with which he have startle the corner and win she own heart he be now pay the penalty in the shape of ruin nerve pity again swell in she heart and a consuming hatred for the three murderer who live in she father 's house and when she reach she room again she heart be fill with a singing happiness and a glorious knowledge that she have save the man she love and donnegan himself he have see lou and she father : he have hear that low cry of pain and now he sit bow again over he table he face in he hand and a rage devil in he heart 41 there be one complication which nelly lebrun might have foresee after she pretended change of heart and she simulated confession to joe rix that she still love the lionlike lord nick but strangely enough she do not think of this phase : and even when she father the next morning approach she in the hall and tap she arm whisper : good girl nick have just hear and he be hunting for you now even then the full meaning do not come home to she it be not until she see the great form of lord nick stalk swiftly down the hall that she know he come with a glory in he face which the last day have grave with unfamiliar line and when he see she he throw up he hand so that it almost brush the ceiling and cry out what could she do try to push he away to explain there be nothing to be do she have to submit when he sweep she into he arm rix have tell I rix have tell I ah nell you little fox tell you what nick be he too a party to the murderous plan but he allow himself to be push away i have go through something in the last few day why do you do it girl she see suddenly that she must continue to play she part some day i 'll tell you why it be that i give you up so easily nell you think i be afraid of donnegan he grind he tooth and turn pale at the thought but that be not it some day i can tell you but after this the first man who come between we -- donnegan or any other -- i 'll turn he into powder -- under my heel he grind it into the floor as he speak she decide that she would see how much he know it will never be donnegan at least she say he be do for today and i be almost sorry for he in spite of all that he be do he become suddenly grave what be you say nell why joe tell you do not he they have draw donnegan out of town and now they be lie in wait for he yes they must have he by this time it be ten o'clock a strangely tense exclamation break from lord nick they have go for donnegan yes be you angry the big man stagger one would have say that he have be stun with a blow garry he whisper what be you say nell he mutter hoarsely do you know about it but i do it for you nick i know you hate -- no no do not say it he add bitterly after a moment this be for my sin and then to she : but you know about it and do not warn he you hate he all the time you be laugh with he and smile at he oh nell what a merciless witch of a woman you be for the rest of they -- i 'll wait till they come back what be you go to do nick i tell they i would pay the man who kill donnegan -- with lead do the fool think i do not mean it truly no matter what shadow have pass over the big man he be the lion again and nell shrink from he we 'll wait for they he say we 'll wait for they here and they sit down together in the room she attempt to speak once in a shake voice but he silence she with a gesture and after that she sit and watch in quiet the singular play of vary expression across he face grief rage tenderness murderous hate -- they follow like a puppet play what be donnegan to he and then there be a tremor of fear would the three suspect when they reach the shack by the ford and no donnegan come to they the moment steal on then the soft beat of a gallop horse in the sand the horse stop presently they see joe rix and harry master pass in front of the window and they look as though a cyclone have catch they up juggle they a dizzy distance in the air and then fling they down carelessly upon bruise rock they hat be go and the clothes of burly harry master be literally tear from he back joe rix be evidently far more terribly hurt for he lean on the arm of master and they come on together stagger they have do the business exclaim lord nick and now curse they i 'll do theirs but the girl could not speak a black haze cross before she eye have donnegan go out madly to fight the three man in spite of she warn the door open they stand in the doorway and if they have seem a horrible sight pass the window they be a deadly picture at close range and opposite they stand lord nick in spite of they wound there be murder in he face and he revolver be out you have meet he you have meet donnegan he ask angrily master literally carry joe rix to a chair and place he in it he have be shoot through both shoulder and though tight bandage have stanch the wound he be still in agony then master raise he head we have meet he he say what happen but master in spite of the naked gun in the hand of lord nick be look straight at nelly lebrun we fight he then say you prayer master say prayer for the pedlar you fool say master bitterly he be dead and donnegan 's still live there be a faint cry from nelly lebrun she sink into she chair again we have be double-cross say master still look at the girl i be go down the gulch the way we plan i come to the narrow place where the cliff almost touch and right off the wall above I drop a wildcat i think it be a cat at first and then i find it be donnegan the way he hit I from above knock I off the horse then we hit the ground i start for my gun he get it out of my hand i pull my knife he get that away too he finger work with steel spring and act like a cat 's claw then we fight barehand he do not say a word but keep snarl in he throat always like a cat and he face be devilish make I sick inside pretty soon he dive under my arm get I up in the air i come down on my head of course i go out cold when i come to there be still a mist in front of my eye and this lump on the back of my head he have figure that my head be crack and that i be dead that be the only reason he leave I later i climb on my hoss and fed he the spur but i be too late i take the straight cut for the ford and when i get there i find that donnegan have be there before I joe rix be lyin ' on the floor when he get to the shack donnegan be waitin ' for he they go for they gun and donnegan beat he to it the hound do not shoot to kill he plug he through both shoulder and leave he lyin ' helpless but i get a couple of bandage on he and save he then we cut back for home and cross the marsh and there we find the pedlar too late to help he maybe donnegan know that the pedlar be something of a flash with a gun himself and he do not take any chance he would meet he face to face the same way he meet joe rix and kill he shoot he clean between the eye think of shooting for the head with a snap shot that be what he do and joe do not have time to think twice after that slug hit he he gun be not even fire he be beat so bad on the draw so joe and I come back home and we come full of question let I tell you something mutter lord nick put up the weapon which he have keep expose during all of the recital you have get what be come to you if donnegan have not clean up on you you would have have to talk turkey with I understand wait a minute protest harry master and joe rix almost too far go for speech set he tooth over a groan and cast a look of hatred at the girl wait a minute chief there be one thing we all get to get straight somebody have tip off donnegan about we whole plan be it the pedlar or rix or I i guess good sense 'll tell a man that it be not none of we eh then who be it the only other person that know about the plan -- nell -- nell the crooked witch -- and it be she that murder the pedlar -- curse she he thrust out he bulky arm as he speak she that lie she way into we confidence with a lot of talk about you nick then what do she do she go runnin ' to the gent that she say she hate do not you see she play she make fool of we -- she make a fool out of you she dare not meet the glance of lord nick even now she might have act out she part and fill in with lie but she be totally unnerved get rix to bed be all he say and he do not even glance at nelly lebrun master glower at he and then silently obey lifting joe as a helpless bulk for the fat man be nearly faint with pain not until they have go and he have close the door after they and upon the murmur of the servant in the hall do lord nick turn to nelly be it true he ask shortly between relief and terror she mind be whirling be what true you have not even sense enough to lie nell eh it be all true then and last night after you would worm it out of joe you go to donnegan she could only stare miserably at he and that be why you push I away when i kissed you a little while ago once more she be dumb but she be begin to be afraid not for herself but for donnegan nell i tell you i would never let another man come between we again i mean it i know you be treacherous now but that do not keep I from want you it be donnegan again -- donnegan still nell you have kill he as sure as if you own finger pull the trigger when i shoot he he be a dead one and you have do it if word would only come but she throat be stiff and cold and ache she could not speak you have do more than kill he say lord nick you have put a curse on I as well and afterward i be go to even up with you you hear I nell when i shoot donnegan i be do a thing worse than if he be a girl -- or a baby you can not understand that i do not want you to know but some time when you be happy again and you be through grieve for donnegan i 'll tell you the truth and make you heart black for the rest of you life still word would not come she strive to cling to he and stop he but he cast she away with a single gesture and stride out the door 42 there be no crowd to block the hill at this second meeting of donnegan and lord nick there be a blank stretch of brown hillside with the wind whisper stealthily through the dead grass when lord nick thrust open the door of donnegan 's shack and enter the little man have just finish shaving and be get back into he coat while george carry out the basin of water and donnegan as he button the coat be nod slightly to the rhythm of a song which come from the cabin of the colonel near by it be a clear high music and though the voice be light it carry the sound far donnegan look up to lord nick but still he keep the beat of the music he seem even more fragile this morning than ever before yet lord nick be fresh from the sight of the tear body of the two fight man whom this fellow have strike and leave for dead or die as he think dismiss you servant say lord nick george you may go out and keep he out do not come back until i call for you big george disappear into the kitchen and the outside door be close yet even with all the door close the singing of lou macon keep run through the cabin in a sweet and continuous thread what make the ball so fine robin adair what make the assembly shine robin adair and no matter what lord nick could say it seem that with half he mind donnegan be listen to the song of the girl first say the big man i have break my word donnegan wave he hand and dismiss the charge he point to a chair but lord nick pay no heed i have break my word he go on i promise that i would give you a clear road to win over nelly lebrun i give you the road and you have win she but now i be take she back ah henry say donnegan and a flash of eagerness come in he eye you be a thousand time welcome to she lord nick quiver do you mean it henry do not you see that i be only play for a purpose all the time and if you have open the eye of nelly to the fact that you truly love she and i have be only act out of a heartless sham -- why i be glad of it -- i rejoice henry i swear i do he come forward smile and hold out he hand lord nick strike it down and donnegan shrink back hold he wrist tight in the finger of he other hand be it possible murmured henry reardon be it possible that she love a man who despise she not that if any other man say this to I i would call for a explanation of he meaning henry no no i honor and respect she i tell you by heaven nick she have a thread of pure generous gold in she nature ah she have save my life no longer ago than this morning it be perfect say lord nick and he writhe under a torment i be discard for the sake of a man who despise she donnegan frown with thought watch he older brother and still the thin singing enter the room that matchless old melody of robin adair the day shall never come when that song do not go straight from heart to heart but because donnegan still listen to it lord nick feel that he be contemptuously receive and a fresh spur be drive into he tender pride donnegan he say sharply donnegan raise he hand slowly do you call I by that name aye you have cease to be a brother there be no blood tie between we now as i warn you before donnegan very white move back toward the wall and rest he shoulder lightly against it as though he need the support he make no answer i warn you not to cross I again exclaim lord nick i have not donnegan you have murder my man murder i have meet they fairly not murder henry leave out that name i say if you wish say donnegan very faintly the sight of he resistlessness seem to madden lord nick he make one of he huge stride and come to the center of the room and dominate all that be in it include he brother you murder my man repeat lord nick you turn my girl against I with you lie love-making and turn she into a spy you make she set the trap and then you see that it be work you show she how she could wind I around she finger again will you let I speak aye but be short i swear to you henry that i have never influence she to act against you except to win she away for just one little time and she will return to you again it be only a fancy that make she interested in I look at we how could any woman in she sens prefer I be you do no no i have more to say : i have a thousand thing i shall not hear they henry there be a black devil in you face beware of it who put it there it be not i what power then something over which i have no control be you try to mystify I listen and as donnegan raise he hand the singing pour clear and small into the room that be the power say donnegan you be talk gibberish ' exclaim the other pettishly i suppose i should not expect you to understand on the other hand what i have to say be short and to the point a child could comprehend it you have steal the girl i try to let she go i can not i have to have she willing or unwilling she have to belong to I donnegan if you wish i shall promise that i shall never see she again or speak to she you fool ' will not she find you out do you think i could trust you only in one place -- underground donnegan have clasp he hand upon he breast and he eye be wide what be it you mean henry i 'll trust you -- dead henry that name mean nothing to I i have forget it the world have forget it henry i implore you to keep cool -- to give I five minute for talk -- no not one i know you cunning tongue for the sake of the day when you love I my brother for the sake of the day when you use to wheel my chair and be kind to I you be waste you time you be torture we both for nothing donnegan my will be a rock it will not change and draw closer he right hand grip he gun and the tremble passion of the gunfighter set he shudder you be armed garry go for you gun no no then i 'll give you cause to fight and as he speak he draw back he massive arm and with he open hand smote donnegan heavily across the face the weight of that blow crush the little man against the wall you gun cry lord nick sway from side to side as the passion choke he donnegan fall upon he knee and raise he arm god have mercy on I and on yourself at that the blackness clear slowly on the face of the big man he thrust he revolver into the holster this time he say there be no death but sooner or later we meet donnegan and then i swear by all that live i 'll shoot you down -- without mercy -- like a mad dog you have rob I you have hound I : you have kill my man : you have take the heart of the woman i love and now nothing can save you from the end he turn on he heel and leave the room and donnegan remain kneel hold a stain handkerchief to he face all at once he strength seem to desert he like a tree chop at the root and he wilt down against the wall with closed eye but the music still come out of the throat and the heart of lou and it enter the room and come into the ear of donnegan he become aware that there be a strength beyond himself which have sustain he and then he know it have be the singing of lou from first to last which have keep the murder out of he own heart and restrain the hand of lord nick perhaps of all donnegan 's life this be the first moment of true humility 43 one thing be now clear he must not remain in the corner unless he be prepare for lord nick again : and in a third meeting gun must be draw from that greater sin he shrink and prepare to leave he order to george make the big man 's eye widen but george have long since pass the point where he care to question the decision of he master he begin to build the pack as for donnegan he could see that there be little to be win by remain that would save landi to lou macon to be sure but after all he be begin to wonder if it be not better to let the big fellow go back to he own kind -- lebrun and the rest for if it need compulsion to keep he with lou now might it not be the same story hereafter indeed donnegan begin to feel that all he labor in the corner have be run on a treadmill it have all be group about the main purpose which be to keep landi with the girl to do that now he must be prepare to face nick again and to face nick mean the bringing of the guilt of fratricide upon the head of one of they there only remain flight he see at last that he have be fight blindly from the first he have win a girl whom he do not love -- though doubtless she liking be only the most fickle fancy and she for whom he would have die he have teach to hate he it be a grim sum up donnegan walk the room whistle softly to himself as he check up he account one thing at least he have do he have take the joy out of he life forever and here answer a rap at the door he open it upon lou macon she wear a dress of some very soft material it be a pale blue -- fade no doubt -- but the color blended exquisitely with she hair and with the flush of she face it come to donnegan that it be a unnecessary cruelty of chance that make he see the girl lovelier than he have ever see she before at the very moment when he be surrender the last shadow of a claim upon she and it hurt he also to see the freshness of she face the clear eye and to hear she smooth untroubled voice she have live untouched by anything save the sunshine in the corner she glance flick across he face and then flutter down and she color increase guiltily i have come to ask you a favor she say step in say donnegan recover he poise at length at this she look past he and she eye widen a little there be a imperceptible shrug of she shoulder as though the very think of enter this cabin horrify she and donnegan have to bear that look as well i 'll stay here i have not much to say it be a small thing large or small say donnegan eagerly tell I my father have ask I to take a letter for he down to the town and mail it i -- i understand that it would be dangerous for I to go alone will you walk with I and donnegan turn cold go down into the corner where by five chance out of ten he must meet he brother in the street i can do better still he say smile i 'll have george take the letter down for you thank you but you see father would not trust it to anyone save I i ask he he be very firm about it tush i would trust george with my life yes yes it be not what i wish -- but my father rarely change he mind perspiration bead the forehead of donnegan be there no way to evade this easy request you see he falter i should be glad to go -- she raise she eye slowly but i be terribly busy this morning she do not answer but half of she color leave she face upon my word of honor there be no danger to a woman in the town but some of the ruffian of lord nick -- if they dare to even raise they voice at you they would hear from he in a manner that they would never forget then you do not wish to go she be very pale now and to donnegan it be more terrible than the gun in the hand of lord nick even if she think he be slight she why should she take it so mortally to heart for donnegan who see all thing be blind to read the face of this girl it do not really matter she murmur and turn away a gentle motion but it wrench the heart of donnegan he be instantly before she wait here a moment i 'll be ready to go down immediately no i can not take you from you -- work what work do she assign to he in she imagination endless planning of deviltry no doubt i shall go with you say donnegan at first -- i do not dream it could be so important let I get my hat he leave she and leap back into the cabin i be go down into the corner for a moment he say over he shoulder to george as he take he belt down from the wall the big man stride to the wall and take he hat from a nail i shall not need you george but george merely grin and he big tooth flash at the master and in the second place he take up a gun from the drawer and offer it to donnegan the gun in that holster be not load he say donnegan consider he soberly i know it there 'll be no need for a loaded gun but once more george grin all at once donnegan turn pale you dog he whisper do you listen at the door when nick be here I murmur george no i just be think and so it be that while donnegan go down the hill with
