and light it cynthium on the other hand begin to sob prettily and not in a noisy fashion yet evidently head towards a bout of grief moreover no sooner have the first sound of lamentation escape from she lip than the door be open smartly and a buxom girl in lady 's maid uniform rush in dart across the room and knelt by cynthium sobbing also and exclaim oh my poor mee cynthia mary smile in a humorous contempt stop this she command rather brusquely you have not be deceive too have you jeanne I madame no my poor mee -- leave you poor mee to I she take a paper bag from the mantelpiece go and eat chocolate fix with a firm and decidedly professional glance jeanne stop sob and rise slowly to she foot do not listen outside the door you must have be listen wait till you be ring for miss

protest the description of the weather do not sound attractive yes yes now off with both of you here take the chocolate jeanne and try to remember that it might have be worse jeanne 's brown eye be eloquent of reproach captain cranster might have be find out too late -- after the wedding mary explain with a smile try to look at it like that five minute to get ready cynthium she be ready for the weather herself in the stout coat and skirt and weather-proof hat in which she have drive the two-seater on she round that morning the disconsolate pair drift ruefully from the room though jeanne do recollect to take the chocolate doctor mary stand look down at the fire she lip still shape in that firm wise and philosophical smile with which doctor and nurse -- and indeed sometimes anybody who happen to be feel pretty well himself -- console or exasperate suffer humanity a very good thing the poor silly child do come to I that be the form she thought take for although dr mary arkroyd be and know herself to be no dazzling genius at she profession -- in moment of candor she would speak of have scrape through she qualify examination -- she have a high opinion of she own common sense and she power of guide weaker mortal for all that jeanne 's cheek bulge with a chocolate there be open resentment on she full pouting lip and a hint of the same feeling in cynthium 's still liquid eye when mistress and maid come downstairs again without heed these sign mary draw on she gauntlet take she walking-stick and fling the hall door open a rush of cold wind fill the little hall jeanne shiver ostentatiously cynthia sigh and muffle herself deeper in she fur collar a good walking day say mary decisively up to now inkston have not impressed cynthium walford very favorably it be indeed a mixed kind of a place like many village which lie near to london and have be make by modern development more accessible than once they be it show chronological stratum in its building down by the station all be new red suburban mount the tar road the wayfarer bear slightly to the right along the original village street bate the aggressive front of one or two commercial innovator this be old calm serene gray in tone and restful ornamented by three or four good class georgian house one quite fine with well work iron gate -lrb- this be dr irechester 's -rrb- turn to the right again but more sharply the wayfarer find himself once more in villadom but a villadom more ornate more costly with garden to be measure in acre -- or nearly this be hinton avenue -lrb- hinton because it be the maiden name of the builder 's wife avenue because avenue be genteel -rrb- here mary dwelt but by good luck she predecessor dr christian evan have seize upon a survive old cottage at the end of the avenue and indeed of inkston village itself beyond it stretch meadow while the road turn again run across a open heath and pursue its way to sprotsfield four mile distant a place of greater size where all amenity could be find it be along this road that the friend now walk mary set a brisk pace when once you have turn you back on the avenue it be heap better she say might be real country look this way might not it except the naylor ' place -- oh and tower cottage -- there be no house between this and sprotsfield the wind blow shrewdly with a occasional spatter of rain the withered bracken lay like a vast carpet of dull copper-color under the cloudy sky scatter fir-tree make fantastic shape in the early gloom of a December day a somber scene yet want only sunshine to make it flash in a richness of color even to-day its quiet and spaciousness its melancholy and monotony seem to bid a sympathetic and soothing welcome to ache and fret heart it really be rather nice out here cynthium admit i come almost every afternoon oh i have plenty of time my round in the morning generally see I through -- except for emergency birth and death and so on you see my predecessor poor christian evan never have more than the leavings and that be all i have get i believe the real doctor the old-established one dr irechester be angry at first with dr evan for come he do not want a rival but christian be such a meek mild simple little welshman not the least push or ambitious and very soon dr irechester who be quite well off be glad to leave he the dirty work i mean -lrb- she explain smile -rrb- the cottage and the panel work national insurance you know and so on well as you know i come down as _ locum _ for christian he be a fellow-student of mine and when the dear little man be kill in france dr irechester himself suggest that i should stay on he be rather nice he say ` we all start to laugh at you at first but we do not laugh now anyhow only my wife do so if you stay on i do not doubt we shall work very well together my dear colleague ' be not that rather nice of he cynthia yes dear say cynthium in a voice that sound a good many mile away mary laugh i be bind to be interested in you but i suppose you be not bind to be interested in I she observe resignedly all the same i make a sensation at inkston just at first and they be even more astonished when it turn out that i could dance and play lawn tennis that be a funny little place say cynthium point to the left side of the road tower cottage that be call but what a funny place cynthium insist a round tower like a martello tower only smaller of course and what look just like a ordinary cottage or small farm-house join on to it what could the tower have be for i be sure i do not know origin lose in the mist of antiquity a old gentleman name saffron life there now a patient of yours mary oh no he be well off rich i believe so he belong to dr irechester but i often meet he along the road lately there be always be a younger man with he a companion or secretary or something of that sort i hear he be there be two man come along the road now yes that be they the old man and he friend he be rather striking to look at which of they the old man of course i have not look at the secretary cynthium i believe you be begin to feel a little better oh no i be not i be afraid i be not really but there have be a cheerfully roguish little smile on she face it vanish very promptly when observe the two man approach they on they way no doubt to tower cottage the old man be not above middle height indeed scarcely reach it but he make the most of he inch carry himself very upright with a air of high dignity close-cut white hair show under a old-fashioned peaked cap he wear a plaid shawl swathe round he he left arm be envelop in its fold he right rest in the arm of he companion who be taller than he lean and loose-built clothe in a almost white -lrb- and very unseasonable look -rrb- suit of some homespun material he wear no cover on he head a thick crop of curly hair -lrb- of a color indistinguishable in the dim light -rrb- presumably afford such protection as he need he face be turn down towards the old man who be look up at he and apparently talk to he though in so low a tone that no sound reach mary and cynthium as they pass by neither man give any sign of notice they presence mr saffron you say rather a queer name but he look a nice old man patriarchal you know what be the name of the other one i do hear somebody mention he at the naylor ' -- somebody who have hear something about he in france what be the name it be something queer too i think they have get queer name and they live in a queer house cynthium actually give a little laugh but be you go to walk all night mary dear oh poor thing i forget you you be tire we 'll turn back they retrace they step again pass tower cottage into which its occupant must have go for they be no longer to be see that name 's on the tip of my tongue say mary in amuse vexation i shall get it in a moment cynthium have relapse into gloom it do not matter in the least she murmur it be beaumaroy say mary in triumph i do not wonder you could not remember that chapter ii the general remember amongst other various and no doubt useful function miss delium wall perform that of gossip and news agent-general to the village of inkston a hard-featured swarthy spinster of forty with a rove inquisitive yet not unkindly eye she perambulate -- or rather percycle -- the district take stock of every incident not a cat could kitten or a dog have the mange without she privity critic of she mental activity go near to insinuate connivance naturally therefore she be well acquaint with the new development at tower cottage although the isolate position of that dwelling make thorough observation piquantly difficult she lay she information before a attentive if not very respectful audience gather round the tea-table at old place the naylor ' handsome house on the outskirts of sprotsfield and on the far side of the heath from inkston she be enjoy herself although she be as usual a trifle distrustful of the quality of mr naylor 's smile it smack of the satiric he look at you as if you be a specimen she have once be hear to complain and when she say specimen it be obviously beetle that she have in mind everybody know old mr saffron -- by sight i mean -- and the woman who do for he she say there be never be anything remarkable about _ they _ he take he walk as regular as clockwork every afternoon and she buy just the same thing every week she book must have tally almost to a penny every month mr naylor i know it and it be a very rare thing indeed for mr saffron to go to london -- though i have know he to be away once or twice but very very rarely she pause and add dramatically until the armistice full of ramification that event miss wall it affect even my business mr naylor though now withdraw from a active share in its conduct be still interested in the large shipping firm from which he have draw he comfortable fortune she look at he suspiciously as he put the end of the slender white finger of he two hand together and lean forward to listen with that smile of he and eye faintly twinkling but the problem be seethe in she brain she have to go on a week after the armistice mr saffron go to london by the 950 he travel first anna do he dear mr naylor a stout and placid dame be not yet stir to excitement he come down by the 411 and those two man with he and they have be there ever since two man delia i have only see one oh yes there be another sergeant hooper they call he a short thickset man with a black mustache he buy two bottle of rum every week at the _ green man _ and -- one minute please mr naylor -- i be only go to say that it look to I as if this man hooper be or have be a soldier what do you think never mind papa go on miss wall i be interested this encouragement come from gertie naylor a pretty girl of seventeen who be consume much tea bread and honey and since then the old gentleman and this mr beaumaroy go to town regularly every week on wednesday now who be they how do mr saffron get hold of they and what be they do here i be at a loss anna apparently a _ impasse _ and mr naylor do not seem to assist matter by ask whether miss wall have keep a constant eye on the agony column mr naylor take up she knitting and switch off to another topic dr arkroyd 's friend delium dear what a charming girl she look friend anna i do not know that a patient i understand anyhow she be take valentine 's beef juice of course they _ do _ give that in drink case but i should be sorry to think -- drug more likely mr naylor suavely interpose then he rise from he chair and begin to pace slowly up and down the long room look at he beautiful picture he beautiful china he beautiful chair all the beautiful thing that be he he family take no notice of this rove up and down it be a habit and be tacitly accept as mean that he have for the moment have enough of the company and even of he own sally at its expense i have ask dr arkroyd to bring she over miss walford i mean the first day it be fine enough for tennis mr naylor pursue there be a hard court at old place so that winter do not stop the game entirely what a name too walford it be quite a good name delia no no anna beaumaroy of course miss wall be back at the larger problem there be alec 's voice he and the general be back from they golf ring for another teapot gertie dear the door open not alec but the general come in and close the door carefully behind he it be obviously a act of precaution and not merely a normal exercise of good manners then he walk up to he hostess and say it be not my fault anna alec would do it though i shake my head at he behind the fellow 's back what do you mean general cry the hostess mr naylor for he part stop rove the door again come in mr beaumaroy -- here 's tea mr beaumaroy obediently enter in the wake of captain alec naylor who duly present he to mr naylor add that beaumaroy have be kind enough to make the fourth in a game with the general the rector of sprotsfield and himself and he and the parson be too tough a nut for we be not they sir he add to the general besides be a excellent officer and a capital fellow alec naylor be also repute to be one of the handsomest man in the service six foot three very straight very fair with feature as regular as any romantic hero of they all and eye as blue the honorable limp that at present marked he movement would it be hope pass away even he own family be often surprise into a new admiration of he physical perfection remark one to the other how alec take the shine out of every other man in the room there be no shine no external obvious shine to take out of mr beaumaroy miss wall 's puzzling unaccounted-for mr beaumaroy the light show he now more clearly than when mary arkroyd meet he on the heath road but perhaps thereby do he no service he feature though irregular be not ugly or insignificant but he wear a rather batter aspect there be deep line run from the corner of he mouth and crowsfeet have start under the gray eye which in they turn look more skeptical than ardent rather mock than eager yet when he smile he face become not merely pleasant but confidentially pleasant he seem to smile especially to and for the person to whom he be talk and he voice be notably agreeable soft and clear -- the voice of a high-bred man but not exactly of a high-bred englishman there be no accent definite enough to be call foreign certainly not to be assign to any particular race but there be a exotic touch about he manner of speech suggest that even if not that of a foreigner it be shape and color by the inflexion of foreign tongue the hue of he plentiful and curly hair indistinguishable to mary and cynthia now stand reveal as neither black nor red nor auburn nor brown nor golden but just and rather surprisingly a plain yellow the color of a cowslip or thereabout altogether rather a rum-looking fellow this have be alec naylor 's first remark when the rector of sprotsfield point he out as a possible fourth at the golf club and the rough justice of the description could not be deny he like alec bear he scar the little finger of he right hand be amputate down to the knuckle yet after all this description in particularity if not otherwise worthy of a classic novelist the thing yet remain that most strike observer mr hector beaumaroy have a adorable candor of manner he answer question with innocent readiness and pellucid sincerity it would be impossible to think he guilty of a lie ungenerous to suspect so much as a suppression of the truth even mr naylor harden by five-and-thirty year ' experience of what sailor will blandly swear to in collision case be strike with the open candor of he bearing yes he say yes miss wall that be right we go to town every Wednesday no particular reason why it should be Wednesday but old gentleman somehow do better -- do not you think so -- with method and regular habit i be sure you know what be best for mr saffron say delium you have know he a long time have not you mr naylor draw a little nearer and listen the general have put himself into the corner a remote corner of the room and sit there with a uneasy and rather glowering aspect oh no no answer beaumaroy a matter of week only but the dear old fellow seem to take to I -- a friend put we in touch originally i seem to be able to do just what he want i hope you friend be not really ill not seriously this time the question be mrs naylor 's not miss delium 's he health be really not so bad but he give a glance round the company as though invite they understanding he insist that he be not the man he be absurd smile naylor not much older than i be be he only just turn seventy i believe but the idea 's very persistent hypochondria snap miss delium not altogether i be afraid there be a little real heart trouble dr irechester -- oh with dr irechester dear mr beaumaroy you be all right again beaumaroy 's glance -- that glance of innocent appeal -- range over the company -lrb- except the general out of its reach -rrb- he seem troubled and embarrass a most accomplished man evidently and a friend of yours of course but well there it be a mere fancy of course but unhappily my old friend do not take to he he he think that he be rather inquisitorial a doctor 's duty i suppose -- irechester 's a sound man a very sound man say mr naylor and after all one can ask almost any question if one do it tactfully can not one miss wall as a matter of fact he be only see mr saffron twice -- he have a little chill but he manner unfortunately rather er -- alarmed -- gertie naylor with the directness of youth propound a solution of the difficulty if you do not like dr irechester -- oh it be not i who -- why not have mary gertie make she suggestion eagerly she be very fond of mary who from the height of age wisdom and professional dignity have stoop to offer she a equal friendship she mean dr mary arkroyd mr naylor explain yes i know mr naylor i know about dr arkroyd in fact i know she by sight but -- perhaps you do not believe in woman doctor alec suggest it be not that i have no prejudice but the responsibility be on I and i know very little of she and well to change one 's doctor it be rather invidious -- oh as to that irechester 's a sensible man he be get as much work as he want and as much money too he will not resent a old man 's fancy well i would never think of a change but if you all suggest it -- somehow it do seem as if they all and not merely youthful gertie have suggest it but i should rather like to know dr arkroyd first come and meet she here that be very simple she often come to tennis and tea we 'll let you know the first time she be come beaumaroy most cordially accept the idea and the invitation any afternoon i shall be delighted except wednesday wednesday be sacred be not they miss wall london on wednesday for mr saffron and I and the old brown bag he laugh in a quiet merriment that old bag 's be in a lot of place with I and have carry some queer cargo now it just go to and fro between here and town with mudie book must have book live so much alone as we do he have rise as he speak and approach mr naylor to take leave she give he she hand very cordially i do not suppose mr saffron care to meet people but any spare time you have mr beaumaroy we shall be delighted to see you beaumaroy bow as he thank she add and i be promise a chance of meeting dr arkroyd before long the promise be renew and the visitor take he leave decline alec 's offer to run he home in the car the car might startle my old friend he plead alec see he off and return to find the general who have contrived to avoid more than a distant bow of farewell to beaumaroy standing on the hearthrug apparently in a state of some agitation the envious year have refuse to major-general punnit cb -- he be a distant cousin of mr naylor 's -- the privilege of serve he country in the great war he career have lie mainly in indium and be mostly behind he even at the date of the south african war in which however he have do valuable work in one of the supply service he as short stout honest brave shrewd obstinate and as full of prejudice religious political and personal as a egg be of meat and all this time he have be slowly and painfully recall what he young friend colonel merman -lrb- the colonel be young only relatively to the general -rrb- have tell he about hector beaumaroy the name have strike on he memory the moment the rector pronounce it but it have take he a long while to place it accurately however now he have it pat the conversation in the club come back he retail it now to the company at old place a pleasant fellow beaumaroy socially a very agreeable fellow and as for courage as brave as you like indeed he might have have letter after he name save for the fact that he -- the colonel -- would never recommend a man unless he discipline be as good as he lead and he conduct at the base as praiseworthy as at the front -lrb- alec naylor nod he handsome head in grave approval he father look a little discontented as though he be swallow unpalatable though wholesome food -rrb- he whole idea -- beaumaroy 's that be -- be to shield offender to prevent the punishment fitting the crime even to console and countenance the wrongdoer no sense of discipline no moral sense the colonel have go as far as that impossible to promote or to recommend for reward almost impossible to keep of course if he have be catch young and put through the mill it might have be different it _ might _ the colonel heavily underline the possibility but he come from heaven know where after a life spend heaven know how and he seem to know it himself the colonel have say thoughtfully roll he port round in the glass whenever i wig he he offer to go say he would chuck he commission and enlist say he would be happier in the rank but i be weak i could not bear to do it after thus quote he friend the general add : he be weak damned weak and i tell he so of course he ought to have get rid of he say alec still sir there be nothing er disgraceful it seem hardly to have come to that the general admit reluctantly it all rather make I like he gertie affirm courageously i think that on the whole we may venture to know he in time of peace mr naylor sum up that be you look out remark the general i have warn you you can do as you like delium wall have sit silent through the story now she speak up and get back to the real point : there be nothing in all that to show how he come to be at mr saffron 's the general shrug he shoulder oh saffron be hang he be not the british army he say chapter iii mr saffron at home to put it plainly sergeant hooper -- he have be a sergeant for a brief and precarious three week but he use the title in civil life whenever he safely could and he could at inkston -- sergeant hooper be a villainous-looking dog beaumaroy fresh from the comely presence of old place unconscious of how the general have rip up he character and record pleasantly nurse a little project concern dr mary arkroyd have never be more forcibly strike with he protege 's ill-favoredness than when he arrive home on this same evening and the sergeant meet he at the door by gad sergeant he observe pleasantly i do not think anybody could be such a rascal as you look it be that faith that carry I through the sergeant help he off with he coat it be some people 's stock-in-trade he remark not to look a rascal like they really be sir the sir stick out of pure habit it carry no real implication of respect meaning I laugh beaumaroy how 's the old man to-night quiet enough he be in the tower there -- be there a hour or more the cottage door open on to a narrow passage with a staircase on one side and on the other a door lead to a small square parlor cheerfully if cheaply furnish and well light by a oil lamp a fire blaze on the hearth and beaumaroy sink into a saddle-bag armchair beside it with a sigh of comfort the sergeant have jerk he head towards another door on the right of the fireplace it lead to the tower beaumaroy 's eye settle on it a hour or more have he have you hear anything he be make a speech a little while back that be all no more complaint and palpitation or anything of that sort not as i have hear but he never say much to I mr wiles get the benefit of he symptom mostly you be not sympathetic perhaps during the talk hooper have be to a cupboard and mix a glass of whisky and soda he bring it to beaumaroy and put it on a small table by he beaumaroy regard he squat paunchy figure red face small eye -lrb- a squint in one of they -rrb- and bulbous nose with a patient and benign toleration since you can not expect sergeant to prepossess the judge and jury in you favor the instant you make you appearance in the box -- here what be you on to sir it be the more important for you to have it clearly in you mind that we be labor in the cause of humanity freedom and justice exactly like the ally in the late war you know sergeant keep that in you mind clinch it he have not want you to do anything particular to-night or ask for I no sir he be happy with -- with what you call he plaything what be they but plaything ask beaumaroy tilt he glass to he lip with a smile perhaps a little wry only i wish as you would not talk about judge and jury the sergeant complain i really do not know whether it be a civil or a criminal matter or both or neither beaumaroy admit candidly but what we do know sergeant be that it provide we with excellent billet and ration moreover a thing that you certainly will not appreciate it gratify my taste for the mysterious i hope there be a bit more come from it than that say the sergeant that be if we stick together faithful sir oh we shall one thing puzzle I about you sergeant i do not think i have mention it before sometimes you speak almost like a educate man at other you speech be well illiterate well sir it be a sort of mixture of my mother she be class the blighter who come after my father and the board school -- of course what they call the educational ladder that explain it by the way i be think of change we doctor good job too i ` eat that irechester stare at you that chap do do he stare at you eye ' ask beaumaroy thoughtfully i do not know that he do at my eye particularly nothing wrong with 'em be there the sergeant sound rather truculent never mind that but i fancied he stare at mr saffron 's and i have read somewhere in some book or other that doctor can tell or guess by the eye well that be only a idea how do a lady doctor appeal to you sergeant i should be shy say the sergeant grin vulgar vulgar beaumaroy murmur that dr mary arkroyd i have think of she she ought to be fair easy to kid you ` ave notion sometimes sir beaumaroy stretch out he leg debonnair well-rounded leg to the seduce blaze of oak log i have not really a care in the world he say the sergeant 's reply or comment have a disconcerting ring and you be sure of ` eaven that be what the bloke always say to the ` angman i have no intention of be a murderer sergeant beaumaroy 's eyebrow be raise in gentle protest once you be in with a job you never know he retainer observe darkly beaumaroy laugh oh go to the devil and mix I another whisky yet a vague uneasiness show itself on he face he look across the room at the evil-shaped man handle the bottle in the cupboard he make one queer restless movement of he arm as though to free himself then in a moment he spring from he chair a glad kindly smile illuminate he face he bow in a very courtly fashion exclaim ah here you be sir and all well i hope mr saffron have enter from the door lead to the tower carefully close it after he hooper 's hand go up to he forehead in the ghost of a military salute but a sneering smile persist on he lip the only notice mr saffron take of he be a jerk of the head towards the passage a abrupt and ungracious dismissal which however the sergeant silently accept and stump out the greet reserve for beaumaroy be vastly different beaumaroy 's own cordiality be more than reciprocate it seem impossible to doubt that a genuine affection exist between the elder and the younger man though the latter have not think fit to mention the fact to sergeant hooper a tiring day my dear hector very tiring i have transact a lot of business but never mind that it will keep what of you doings have sit the old man in the big chair by the fire beaumaroy saunter across to the door of the tower lock it and put the key in he pocket then he return to the fire and standing in front of it give a lively and detailed account of he visit to old place they appear to be pleasant people very pleasant i should like to know they if it be not desirable for I to live a entirely secluded life mr saffron 's speech be very distinct and clean cut rather rapid high in tone but not disagreeable you make pure fun of this miss wall as you do of so many thing hector but -- he smile up at beaumaroy -- inquisitiveness be not we favorite sin just now she be so indiscriminately inquisitive that it be a thousand to one against she really find out anything of importance sir beaumaroy sometimes address he employer as mr saffron but much more commonly he use the respectful sir i think i be equal to put miss delium wall off still she notice we weekly journey half inkston go to town every day sir and the rest three time twice or once a week i call she particular attention to the bag and tell she it be for book from mudie 's positive statement like that be a mistake mr saffron speak with a sudden sharpness in pointed rebuke if i form a right idea of that woman she be quite capable of go to mudie 's to ask about we by jove you be right sir and i be wrong we would better go and take out a subscription tomorrow she 'll hardly go so far as to ask the date we start it yes let that be do and remember no unnecessary talk he tone grow milder as though he be mollify by beaumaroy 's ready submission to he reproof we have some place to call at to-morrow have we they say they would have some useful address ready for we sir i be afraid though that we be exhaust the most obvious resource still i hope for a few more good consignment i suppose you remain confident that the sergeant have no suspicion as regard that particular aspect of the matter i be sure of it up to the present of course there might be a accident but with he and mr wiles both off the premise at night it be hardly likely and i never let the bag out of my sight while it be in the room with they hardly out of my hand i should like to trust he but it be hardly fair to put such a strain on he loyalty much safer not sir as long as we be not drive to it after all though i believe the fellow be out to redeem he character he be not a unblemished record but the work the physical labor entail on you hector make yourself easy about that sir i be as strong as a horse the work 's good for I remember i have have four year ' service mr saffron smile pensively it would have be funny if we would meet over there you and i it would sir laugh beaumaroy but that could hardly have happen without some very curious accident the old man hark back yes a few more good consignment and we can think in earnest of you start he be warm he hand thin yellowish hand at the fire now and he gaze be direct into it look down on he beaumaroy allow a smile to appear on he lip a queer smile which seem to be compound of affection pity and amusement the difficulty there remain considerable for the present he remark they must be overcome once again the old man 's voice become sharp and even dictatorial they shall be sir depend on it beaumaroy 's air be suddenly confident almost braggart mr saffron nod approvingly but anyhow i can not very well start till favorable news come from -- hush there be a knock on the door mr wiles to lay the table i suppose yes come in he add hastily to beaumaroy in a undertone yes we must wait for that mr wiles enter as he speak she be a colorless negative kind of a woman fair fat flabby and forty or thereabout she have be the ill-used slave of a local carpenter now decease by reason of over-drinking she nature be to be the slave of the nearest male creature not from affection -lrb- she affection be anemic -rrb- but rather as it seem from a instinctive desire to shuffle off from herself any responsibility but at all event she be entirely free from miss delium wall 's proclivity mr saffron rise i 'll go and wash my hand we 'll dine just as we be hector beaumaroy open the door for he he acknowledge the attention with a little nod and pass out to the staircase in the narrow passage beaumaroy appear to consider himself absolved from any preparation for he return to the big chair and sink into it light another cigarette meanwhile mr wiles lay the table and presently sergeant hooper appear with a bottle of golden-tinted wine that at least be the real stuff think beaumaroy as he eye it in pleasurable anticipation where the dear old man get it i do not know but in itself it be almost worth all the racket and really in its present stage so far as its present development go the racket pleased he it amuse he active brain besides -lrb- as he have say to mr saffron -rrb- exercise he active body though certainly in a rather grotesque and bizarre fashion the attraction of it go deeper than that it appeal to some of those tendency and impulse of he character which have earn such heavy censure from major-general punnit and have produce so grave a expression on captain alec 's handsome face without however be even in that officer 's exacting judgment disgraceful and finally there be the lure of unexplored possibility not only material and external but psychological not only touch what other might do or what might happen to they but raise also speculation as to what he might do or what might happen to he at he own hand for example how far he would flout authority defy the usual and deny the accept the love of rebellion of make foolish the wisdom of the wise of hamper the orderly and inexorable treatment of people just as accord to the best modern light they ought to be treat this lawless love be strong in beaumaroy not as a principle it be the stronger for be a instinct a wayward instinct that might carry he he scarce know where mr saffron come back greet again by beaumaroy 's courtly bow and hooper 's vaguely reminiscent but slovenly military salute the pair sit down to a homely beefsteak but the golden tinted wine gurgle into they glass but before they fall to there be a little incident a sudden but fierce anger seize old mr saffron in he harshest tone he rap out at the sergeant my knife you careless scoundrel you have not give I my knife beaumaroy spring to he foot with a muttered exclamation : it be all my fault sir i forget to give it to hooper i always lock it up when i go out he go to a little oak sideboard and unlock a drawer then come back to mr saffron 's side here it be and i humbly apologize very good very good say the old man testily as he take the implement be not anybody go to apologize to I ask hooper scowling oh get out sergeant say beaumaroy good-naturedly we can not bother about you finer feeling he glance anxiously at mr saffron all right now be not you sir he inquire mr saffron drink he glass of wine i be perhaps too sensitive to any kind of inattention but it be not wholly unnatural in my position hector we both desire to be attentive and respectful sir do not we hooper oh my yes grin the sergeant show he very ugly tooth it be only owe that we ` ave not quite be bring up in royal palace chapter iv professional etiquette dr irechester be a man of considerable attainment and a active though not very persevere intellect he be widely read both in professional and general literature but have shrink from the arduous path of specialization and he shrink even more from the drudgery of he call he have private means inherit in middle life he wife have a respectable portion there be then nothing in he circumstance to thwart he taste and tendency he have soon come to see in the late dr evan a means of relief rather than a threat of rivalry even more easily he slip into the same way of regard mary arkroyd help thereto by a linger feeling that after all and in spite of all when it come to really serious case a woman could not at best play more than second fiddle so as have be see he patronize and encourage mary he tell himself that when she have thoroughly prove she capacity -- within the limit which he ascribe to it -- to take she into partnership would not be a bad arrangement true he could pretty well choose he patient now but as senior partner he would be able to do it completely it be well-nigh inconceivable that for example the naylor -- great friend -- should ever leave he but he would like to be quite secure of the pick of new patient some of whom might through ignorance or whim call in mary there be old saffron for instance he be in irechester 's private opinion or perhaps it should be say in he private suspicion a interesting case yet just for that reason unreliable and evidently ready to take offense it be because of case of that kind that he contemplate offer partnership to mary he would both be sure of keep they and able to devote himself to they but he wife laugh at mary or at that development of the feminist movement which have produce she and so many other more startling phenomenon the doctor be fond of he wife a sprightly would-be fashionable still very pretty woman but she laughter and the opinion it represent be to he the merest crackling of thorn under a pot the fine afternoon have come a few day before christmas and he sit side by side with mr naylor both warmly wrap in coat and rug watch the lawn tennis at old place doctor mary and beaumaroy be play together the latter accustom himself to a finger short in grip he racquet against cynthium and captain alec the captain could not yet cover the court in he old fashion but he height and reach make he formidable at the net and cynthium be very active ten day of inkston air have make a vast difference to cynthium and something else be help it require no common loyalty to lose cause and ruin ideal -- it be surely not harsh to indicate captain cranster by these term -- to resist alec naylor in fact he have almost take cynthium 's breath away at they first meeting she think that she have never see anything quite so magnificent or -- all round and from all point of view so romantic he stature handsomeness limp renown who can be surprise at it moreover he be modest and simple and no fool within the bound of he experience she seem a nice little girl that and uncommon pretty naylor remark yes but he be a queer fish i fancy the doctor answer also rather absently they mind be not run on parallel line my boy a queer fish naylor expostulate humorously irechester smile he lip shut close and tight he smile be quick but narrow you be matchmaking i be diagnose he say naylor apologize i have a desperate instinct to fit all these young fellow up with mate as soon as possible be not it only fair and also extremely expedient but it be the sort of thing you can leave to they can not you as to beaumaroy -- i suppose you mean he not alec -- i think you must have be talk to old tom punnit -- or rather hear he talk punnit 's general view be sound enough i think as to the man 's characteristic but he do not appreciate he cunning cunning naylor be openly astonish he do not strike I as a cunning man not in the least possibly possibly i say -- not in he end but in he means and expedient that be my view i just put it on record naylor i never like talk too much about my case beaumaroy 's not you patient be he he employer i suppose he be he employer saffron be well i think it advisable to see saffron alone i try to saffron be reluctant this man here openly against it next time i shall insist because i think mind you at present i no more than think that there be more in saffron 's case than meet the eye naylor glance at he smile you fellow be always start hare he say game and set cry captain alec and -- to he partner -- thank you very much for carry a cripple but irechester 's attention remain fix on beaumaroy and consequently on doctor mary for the partner do not separate at the end of they game but after put on they coat begin to walk up and down together on the other side of the court in animated conversation though beaumaroy do most of the talk mary listen in she usual grave and compose manner now and then a word or two reach irechester 's ear old naylor seem to have fall into a reverie over he cigar and it must be confess that he take no pain not to overhear once at least he plainly hear saffron from beaumaroy he think that the same lip speak he own name and he be sure that doctor mary 's do beaumaroy be speak rather urgently and make gesture with he hand it seem as though he be appeal to he companion in some difficulty or perplexity irechester 's mouth be severely compress and he glance suspicious as he watch the scene be end by gertie naylor call these laggard in to tea to which meal the rest of the company have already betake itself at the tea table they find general punnit discourse on war and give idealist what idealist usually get the general believe in war he press the biological argument do not flinch when mr naylor dub he the british bernhardus and invoke the support of these medical gentleman -lrb- this with a smile at doctor mary 's expense -rrb- for he point of view war test prove brace harden it be nature 's crucible it be the antidote to softness and sentimentality it be the vindication of the strong the elimination of the weak i suppose there be a lot in all that sir say alec naylor but i do not think the effect on one 's character be always what you say i think i have come out of this awful business a good deal softer than i go in he laugh in a apologetic way more more sentimental if you like with more feeling do not you know for human life and suffering and so on i have see a great many man kill but the sight have not make I any more ready to kill man in fact quite the reverse he smile again really sometimes for a row of pin i would have turn conscientious objector mr naylor look apprehensively at the general : would he explode no he take it quite quietly you be a man who can afford to say it alec he remark with a nod that be almost approve naylor look affectionately at he son and turn to beaumaroy and what be the war do to you he ask and this question do draw from the general if not a explosion at least a rather contemptuous smile : beaumaroy have earn no right to express opinion but express one he do and with he habitual air of candor i believe it be destroy every scruple i ever have mr beaumaroy exclaim he hostess scandalize while the two girl cynthium and gertie laugh i mean it can you see human life treat as dirt absolutely as cheap as dirt for three year and come out think it worth anything can you fight for you own hand right or wrong oh yes right or wrong in the end and it be no good blinking it can you do that for three year in war and then hesitate to fight for you own hand right or wrong in peace who really care for right or wrong anyhow a pause ensue -- rather a uncomfortable pause there be a raw sincerity in beaumaroy 's utterance that make it a challenge i honestly think we do care about the rights and wrong -- we in england say naylor that be certainly so at the begin irechester agree beaumaroy take he up smartly aye at the beginning but what about when we blood get up what then would we in we heart rather have be right and get a lick or wrong and give one a search question muse old naylor what say you tom punnit it never occur to I to put the question the general answer brusquely may i ask why not sir say beaumaroy respectfully because i believe in god i know that we be right and i know that we should win be we in theology now or still in biology ask irechester rather acidly you be get out of my ` depth anyhow smile mr naylor and i be sure the girl must be bewildered mamma i have do biology and many people think they have do theology chuckle naylor do it completely i have raise a pretty argument say beaumaroy smile i be sorry i only mean to answer you question about the effect the whole thing have have on myself even you answer to that be pretty startling mr beaumaroy say doctor mary smile too you give we to understand that it have obliterate for you all distinction of right and wrong do not you do i go as far as that he laugh then i be open to the remark that they can not have be very strong at first now do not destroy the general interest of you thesis naylor implore it be quite likely that yours be a case as common as alec 's or even commoner ' a brutal and licentious soldiery ' be not that a classic phrase in we history all the same i fancy mr beaumaroy do himself less than justice he laugh we shall be able to judge of that when we know he better at all event miss gertie look out that i do not fake the score at tennis say beaumaroy a man might be capable of murder but not capable of that say alec a truly british sentiment cry he father tom we have get back to the national ideal the discussion end in laughter and the talk turn to lighter matter but as mary arkroyd drive cynthium home across the heath she thought return to it the two man the two soldier seem to have give a authentic account of what they experience have do to they both as she see the case have be move to pity horror and indignation that such thing should be do or should have to be do in the world after that point come the divergence the higher nature have be raise the lower debased alec naylor 's sympathy have be sharpen and sensitize beaumaroy 's blunt where the one have find ideal and incentive the other find despair -- a despair that issue in excuse and deny high standard and the finer mind belong to the finer soldier that she know for gertie have tell she general punnit 's story and however much she might discount it as the tale of a elderly martinet yet it stand for something for something that could never be attribute to alec naylor and yet for she mind travel back to she earlier talk by the tennis court beaumaroy have a conscience have feeling he be fond of old mr saffron he feel a responsibility for he feel it indeed keenly or be he under all that seem openness a consummate hypocrite do he value mr saffron only as a milk cow the doting giver of a large salary be he only desire to humor he keep he in good health and temper and use he to he own profit a puzzling man but at all event cut a poor figure beside alec naylor about whom there could circle no cloud of doubt doctor mary 's learning and gravity do not prevent she from draw a very heroic and rather romantic figure of captain alec -- notwithstanding that she sometimes find he rather hard to talk to she feel cynthium 's arm steal around she waist and cynthium say softly i do enjoy my afternoon can we go again soon mary mary glance at she cynthium laugh and blush be not he splendid cynthium murmur but i do not like mr beaumaroy do you i say yes to the first question but i be not quite ready to answer the second say mary with a laugh three day later on christmas eve one whom jeanne who catch sight of he in the hall describe as be all there be possible of ugliness deliver -lrb- with a request for a immediate answer -rrb- the follow note for mary arkroyd : dear dr arkroyd : mr saffron be unwell and i have insist that he must see a doctor so much he have yield after a fight but nothing will induce he to see dr irechester again on this point i try to reason with he but in vain he be obstinate and resolve i be afraid that i be put you in a difficult and disagreeable position but it seem to I that i have no alternative but to ask you to call on he professionally i hope that dr irechester will not be hurt by a whim which be no doubt itself merely a symptom of disorder nerve for dr irechester have be most attentive and very successful hitherto in deal with the dear old gentleman but my first duty be to mr saffron if it will ease matter at all pray hold yourself at liberty to show this note to dr irechester may i beg you to be kind enough to call at you earliest convenience though it be alas a rough evening to ask you to come out yours very faithfully hector beaumaroy how very awkward exclaimed mary she have pride herself on a rigorous abstention from poach she fancy that man be very ready to accuse woman of not play the game and have be resolve to give no color to such a accusation mr saffron have send for I -- professionally he be ill it seem she say to cynthia why should not he because he be a patient of dr irechester not a patient of mine but people often change they doctor do not they he think you be cleverer i suppose and i expect you be really there be no use in expound professional etiquette to cynthium mary have to decide the point for herself and quickly the old man might be seriously ill beaumaroy have say at the naylor ' that he attack be sometimes alarming suddenly she recollect that he have also seem to hint that they be more alarming than irechester appear to appreciate she have not take much notice of that hint at the time but now it recur to she very distinctly there be no suggestion of the sort in beaumaroy 's letter beaumaroy have write a letter that could be show to irechester be that dishonesty or only a pardonable diplomacy i suppose i must go and explain to dr irechester afterwards she ring the bell to recall the maid and give she answer say i will be round as soon as possible be the messenger walk he be get a bicycle miss all right i shall be there almost as soon as he be she seem to have no alternative just as beaumaroy have none yet while she put on she mackintosh it be very wet and misty get out she car and light she lamp she face be still fretful and she mind disturb for now as she look back on it beaumaroy 's conversation with she at old place seem just a prelude to this summons and mean to prepare she for it perhaps that too be pardonable diplomacy and no reference to it could be expect in a letter which she be at liberty to show to dr irechester she wonder uncomfortably how irechester would take it chapter v a familiar implement as mary bring she car to a stand at the gate of the little front garden of tower cottage she see through the mist beaumaroy 's corrugated face he be stand in the doorway and the light in the passage reveal it it seem to she to wear a triumphant impish look but this vanish as he advance to meet she relieved she of the neat black handbag which she always carry with she on she visit and suggest gravely that she should at once go upstairs and see she patient he be quieter now he say the mere news that you be come have a soothing effect let I show you the way he lead she upstairs and into a small room on the first floor nakedly furnished with necessity but with a cheery fire blaze in the grate old mr saffron lay in bed prop up by pillow he silver hair stray from under a nightcap he wear a light blue bedroom jacket its color match that of he restless eye he arm be under the clothes from the elbow down he be rather flush but do not look seriously ill and greet doctor mary with dignified composure i 'll see dr arkroyd alone hector beaumaroy give the slightest little jerk of he head and the old man add quickly i be sure of myself quite sure the phrase sound rather a odd one to mary but beaumaroy accept the assurance with a nod : all right i 'll wait downstairs sir i hope you 'll bring I a good account of he doctor so he leave mary to make she examination go downstairs he shake he head once purse up he lip and then smile doubtfully as a man may do when he have make up he mind to take a chance when mary rejoin he she ask for pen and paper write a prescription and request that beaumaroy 's man should take it to the chemist 's he go out to give it to the sergeant and when he come back find she seat in the big chair by the fire the present little attack be nothing mr beaumaroy she say stomachic -- with a little fever if he take what i have prescribe he ought to be all right in the morning but i suppose you know that there be valvular disease -- quite definite do not dr irechester tell you yes but he say there be no particular -- no immediate danger if he be keep quiet and free from worry do not he advise that yes beaumaroy admit he do that be the only thing you find wrong with he doctor beaumaroy be stand on the far side of the table he finger-tip rest lightly on it he look across at mary with eye candidly inquire i have find nothing else so far i suppose he be get nothing to worry he not really i think he fuss a bit about he affair he smile we go to london every week to fuss about he affair he be always change he investment take he money out of one thing and put it in another you know old people get like that sometimes do not they i be a novice at that kind of thing never have have any money to play with but i be bind to say that he seem to know very well what he be about do you know anything of he history or he people have he any relation i know very little i do not think he have any any real relation so to speak there be i believe some cousin distant cousin whom he hate in fact a lonely old bachelor dr arkroyd mary give a little laugh and become less professional he be rather a old dear he use funny stately phrase he say i might speak quite openly to you as you be closely attach to he person sound rather like a newspaper do not it he do talk like that sometimes beaumaroy move round the table come close to the fire and stand there smile down at mary he be very fond of you i think she go on he repose entire confidence in I say beaumaroy with a touch of assume pompousness those be he very word cry mary laughing again and he say it just in that way how clever of you to guess not so very he say it to I six time a week mary have rise about to take she leave but to she surprise beaumaroy go on quickly with one of he confidential smile and now i be go to show you that i have the utmost confidence in you please sit down again dr arkroyd the matter concern you patient just as much as myself or i would not trouble you with it at any rate i should not venture to so early in we acquaintance i want you to consider yourself as mr saffron 's medical adviser and also to try to imagine yourself my friend i have every inclination to be you friend but i hardly know you mr beaumaroy and feel a few doubt about I from what you have hear from myself and perhaps from other the wind swish outside save for that the little room seem very still the professional character of the interview do not save it for mary arkroyd from a sudden and rather unwelcome sense of intimacy of a intimacy thrust upon she though not so much by she companion as by circumstance she answer rather stiffly perhaps i have some doubt you detect very acutely that i have a great influence over mr saffron you ask very properly whether he have relation i think you throw out a feeler about he money affair whether he have anything to worry about be you phrase be not it be i misinterpret what be in you mind as he speak he offer she a cigarette from a box on the mantelpiece she take one and light it at the top of the lamp-chimney then she sit down again in the big chair she have not accept he earlier invitation to resume she seat it be proper for I to put those question mr beaumaroy mr saffron be not a sound man and he be old in normal condition he relation should at least be warn of the position exactly beaumaroy assent with a appearance of eagerness but he hate they any suggestion that they have any sort of claim on he raise strong resentment in he i have know old man old moneyed man like that before and no doubt you have well now you 'll begin to see the difficulty of my position i 'll put the case to you quite bluntly suppose mr saffron have this liking for I this confidence in I live here with I alone except for servant be as one might say expose to my influence suppose he take it into he head to make a will in my favor to leave I all he money it be quite a considerable sum so far as we Wednesday doings enable I to judge suppose that happen how should i stand in you opinion dr arkroyd but wait a moment still suppose that my career have not be very well resplendent that my army record be only so-so that i have devote myself to he with remarkable assiduity as in fact i have that i might be call quite plausibly a adventurer well propound that will how should i stand before the world and if necessary -lrb- he shrug he shoulder -rrb- the court mary sit silent for a moment or two beaumaroy kneel down by the fire rearrange the log of wood which be smoulder there and put on a couple more from that position look into the grate he add and the change of doctor it be he of course who insist on it but i can see a clever lawyer use that against I too can not you dr arkroyd i be sure i wish you have not have to make the change exclaim mary so do i though mind you i be not pretend that irechester be a favorite of mine any more than he be of my old friend 's still there it be i have no right perhaps to press my question but you opinion would be of real value to I i see no reason to think that he be not quite competent to make a will say doctor mary and no real reason why he should not prefer you to distant relation whom he dislike ah no real reason that be what you say you mean that people would impute -- mary arkroyd have she limitation -- of experience of knowledge of intuition but she do not lack courage i have give you my professional opinion it be that so far as i see mr saffron be of perfectly sound understanding and capable of make a valid will you do I the honor -- no no he interrupt in a low but rather strangely vehement protest i begged the favor -- as you like the favor then of ask I to give you my opinion as you friend as well as my view as mr saffron 's doctor beaumaroy do not rise from he knee but turn he face towards she the log have blaze up and he eye look curiously bright in the glare themselves as it be afire in my opinion a man of sensitive honor would prefer that that will should not be make mr beaumaroy say mary steadily beaumaroy appear to consider i be a bit pose by that point of view dr arkroyd he say at last either the old man 's sane -- _ compo menti _ do not you call it -- or he be not if he be -- i know but i feel that way about it you would have to give evidence for I he raise he brow and smile at she there can be undue influence without actual want of mental competence i think i do not know whether my influence be undue i believe i be the only creature alive who care twopence for the poor old gentleman i know i know mr beaumaroy you position be very difficult i see that it really be but would you take the money for yourself be not you -- well rather in the position of a trustee who for the hate cousin what be the reason in that they may be very good people really old man take fancy as you say yourself and they may have build on -- step into a dead man 's shoe i dare say why may not i build on it too why not my hand against the other fellow 's that be what you learn from the war you say so -- at old place captain naylor say something different suppose alec naylor and i a hero and a damaged article he smile at mary and she smile back with a sudden enjoyment of the humorous yet bitter tang in he voice love the same woman and i have a chance of she be i to give it up really we be get a long way from medicine mr beaumaroy oh you be a general practitioner wise on all subject under heaven conceive yourself hesitate between he and I -- mary laugh frankly how absurd you be if you must go on talk talk seriously but why be i absurd because if i be a marry woman which i be not i should not hesitate between you and captain naylor not for a minute you would jump at I laugh again he eye have now a schoolboy merriment in they mary rise from the big chair at he if i be not be impolite mr beaumaroy they stand face to face for the first time for several year -- mary 's girlhood have not be altogether empty of sentimental episode -- she blush under a man 's glance because it be a man 's at this event of which she be acutely conscious and at which she be intensely irritated she draw herself up with a attempt to return to she strictly professional manner i do not find you the least impolite dr arkroyd say beaumaroy it be impudent yet gay dexterous and elusive enough to avoid reproof with no more than a little shake of she head and a light yet embarrassed laugh mary move toward the door she way lie between the table and a old oak sideboard which stand against the wall some plate knife and other article of the table lay strew none too tidily about it beaumaroy follow she smile complacently he hand in he pocket suddenly mary come to a stop and point with she finger at the sideboard turn she face towards she companion at the same instant beaumaroy 's right hand shoot out from he pocket towards the sideboard as though to snatch up something from it then he draw the hand as swiftly back again but he eye watch mary 's with a alert and suspicious gaze that be for a second only then he face resume its amuse and nonchalant expression but the movement of the hand and the look of the eye have not escape mary 's attention she voice betray some surprise as she say : it be only that i just happen to notice that combination knife-and-fork lie there and i wonder who -- the article in question lay among some half-dozen ordinary knife and fork it be of a kind quite familiar to doctor mary from she hospital experience a fork on one side a knife-blade on the other a implement make for people who could command the use of only one hand surely you have notice my hand he draw he right hand again from the pocket to which he have so quickly return it i use to use that in hospital when i be bandage up but that be a long while ago now and i can not think why hooper 's leave it lie there the account be plausible and entirely the same might now be say of he face and manner but mary have see the dart of he hand and the sudden alertness in he eye she own rest on he for a moment with inquiry for the first time with a hint of distrust i see she murmur vaguely and turn away from he pursue she way to the door beaumaroy follow she with a queer smile on he lip he shrug he shoulder once very slightly a constraint have fall on mary she allow herself to be escort to the car and help into it in silence beaumaroy make no effort to force the talk possibly by reason of the presence of sergeant hooper who have arrive back from the chemist 's with the medicine for mr saffron just as mary and beaumaroy come out of the hall door he stand by he bicycle draw just a little aside to let they pass but not far enough to prevent the light from the passage show up he ill-favored countenance well good-bye dr arkroyd i 'll see how he be to-morrow and ask you to be kind enough to call again if it seem advisable and a thousand thanks good-night mr beaumaroy she start the car beaumaroy walk back to the hall door mary glance behind she once and see he stand by it again frame by the light behind he as she have see he on she arrival but this time within the four corner of the same frame be include the forbid visage of sergeant hooper beaumaroy return to the fire in the parlor hooper leave he bicycle in the passage follow he into the room and put the medicine bottle on the table smile at he beaumaroy point at the combination knife-and-fork be it you fault or mine that that damned thing 's lie there he ask yours answer the sergeant without hesitation and with he habitual surliness i clean it and put it out for you to lock away as usual suppose you go and forget it sir beaumaroy shake he head in self-condemnation and a humorous dismay that be it i go and forget it sergeant and i think i rather think that doctor mary smell a rat though she be at present far from guess the color of the animal the word sound scornful they be speak for the sergeant as well as for himself he be look amuse and kindly even rather tenderly amuse as though liking and pity be the emotion which most actively survive he first private conversation with doctor mary in spite of that mishap of the combination knife-and-fork chapter vi odd story of captain duggle christmas day of 1918 be a merry feast and nowhere merrier than at old place there be a house-party and for dinner on the day itself a local contingent as well : miss wall the irechester mr penrose and doctor mary mr beaumaroy also have be invite by mr naylor she consider he a interesting man and feel pity for the obvious _ ennui _ of he situation but he have not feel able to leave he old friend doctor mary 's pay guest be of the house-party not merely a dinner guest she be ask over to spend three day and go accompany by jeanne who by this time be cry much less cry be no longer the cue she mistress and not merely stern doctor mary have plainly show she that gertie naylor have invite cynthium to help she in entertain the subaltern though gertie be really quite equal to that task herself there be only three of they and if a pretty girl be not equal to three subaltern well what be we come to in england and as it turn out miss gertie have to deal with they all sometimes collectively sometimes one by one practically unassisted cynthium be otherwise engage gertie complain neither of the cause nor of its consequence the drink or drug hypothesis be explode and miss wall 's speculation set at rest with a quite comforting solatium of romantic and unhappy interest a nice tit-bit for the old cat as mr naylor unkindly put it cynthium have tell she story she want a richer sympathy than doctor mary 's common-sense afford out of this need the revelation come to gertie in innocent confidence and with the narrator 's tacit approval run through the family and its intimate friend if cynthium have be as calculate as she be guileless she could not have do better for herself mr naylor 's motherliness old naylor 's courtliness gertie 's breathless concern and avid appetite for the fullest detail everybody 's desire to console and cheer all these be at she service all enlist in the effort to make she forget and live and laugh again she heart respond she find herself become happy at a rate which make she positively ashamed no wonder tactful jeanne discover that the cue be change fastidious old naylor regard he wife with the affection of habit and with a little disdain for the ordinariness of she virtue -- not to say of the mind which they adorn he daughter be to he a precious toy on which he try joke play trick and lavish gift for the joy of see the prettiness of she reaction to he treatment it never occur to he to think that he toy might be break fond as he be he feeling for she lack the apprehensiveness of the deepest love but he idolize he son and in this case neither without fear nor without understand for four year now he have fear for he bitterly : for he body for he life at every wake hour he inner cry have be even as david 's would god i have die for thee my son my son for at every moment of those four year it might be that he son be even then dead that terror endure under a cool and almost off-hand demeanor be past but he fear for he son still of all who go to the war as crusader none have the temperament more ardently than alec as he go so obviously he have come back not disillusioned nay with all he illusion or delusion about this wicked world and its possibility about the people who dwell in it and they lamentable limitation stronger in he mind than ever how could he get through life without be too sorely hurt and wound without be cut to the very quick by he inevitable discovery old naylor do not see how it be to be do or even hope for but the right kind of wife be unquestionably the best chance he have cast a speculative eye on cynthium walford irechester have catch he at it but as he observe she more she do not altogether satisfy he alec need someone more stable stronger someone in a sense protective somebody more like mary arkroyd that idea pass through he thought if only mary would take the trouble to dress herself remember that she be or might be make a attractive young woman and yes throw she mortar and pestle out of the window without however discard with they the sturdy sane balanced quality of mind which enable she to handle they with such admirable competence but he soon have to put this idea from he he son 's own impulse be to give not to seek protection and support of cynthium 's woeful experience alec have speak to he father once only : it make I mad to think the fellow who do that wear a british uniform how unreasonable since by all the law of average when million of man be wear a uniform there must be some rogue in it but it be alec 's way to hold himself responsible for the whole of he majesty 's force they honor be he for they misdeed he must in he own person make reparation that fellow beaumaroy may have lose he conscience but my boy seem to have acquire five million the old man grumble to himself -- a grumble full of pride the father might analyze with alec it be all impulse the impulse to soothe to obliterate to atone the girl have be sorely hurt with the acuteness of sympathy he divine that she feel herself in a way soil and stain by contact with unworthiness and by a too easy acceptance of it all that must be sweep out of she heart out of she memory if it could be doctor mary saw what be happen and with a little pang to which she would not have like to own she have set love affair and all the notion connect therewith behind she but she have idealized alec naylor a little and she think cynthium in homely phrase hardly good enough be it not rather perverse that the very fact of have be a little goose should help she to win so rare a swan you be take my patient out of my hand captain alec she say to he jokingly and you be devote great attention to the case he flush she seem to like to talk to I he answer simply she seem to I to have rather a remarkable mind doctor mary -lrb- she be doctor mary to all the old place party now in affection with a touch of chaff -rrb- _ o sanctum simplicita _ mary long to say that cynthium be a very ordinary child like to talk to he indeed of course she do and to use she girl 's weapon on he and to wonder in a almost awestruck delight at they effect on this dazzling hero well the guilelessness of hero so mused mary on the unprofessional side of she mind as she watch that christmastide captain alec 's delicate sensitively indirect and delayed approach toward the ripe fruit that hang so ready to he hand part of he chivalry to assume she can not think of he yet mary be half-impatient half-reluctantly admiring not a uncommon mixture of feeling for the extreme form of virtue to produce in the net result however she marked image of alec lose something of its heroic proportion but professionally -lrb- the distinction must not be push too far she be not build in watertight compartment -rrb- tower cottage remain obstinately in the center of she thought and connect with it there arise a puzzle over dr irechester 's demeanor she have take advantage of beaumaroy 's permission though rather doubtful whether she be do right for she be still inexperienced in nicety of etiquette and send on the letter with a frank note explain she own feeling and the reason which have cause she to pay she visit to mr saffron but though irechester be quite friendly when they meet at old place before dinner and talk freely to she during a rather prolonged period of wait -lrb- captain alec and cynthium gertie and two subaltern be very late have apparently forget dinner in more refined delight -rrb- he make no reference to the letter nor to tower cottage or its inmate mary herself be too shy to break the ice but wonder at he silence and the more because the matter evidently have not go out of he mind for after dinner when the port have go round once and the proper health be honor he say across the table to mr penrose : we be talk the other day of the tower on the heath you know by old saffron 's cottage and none of we know its history you know all about inkston from time out o ' mind have you get any story about it mr penrose practice as a solicitor in london but live in a little old house near the irechester ' in the village street and devoted he leisure to the antiquity and topography of the neighborhood he lore be plentiful and curious if not important he be a small neat old fellow with white whisker of the antique cut a thin voice and a dry cackle laugh there be a story about it and one quite fit for christmas evening if you be in the mood to hear it the thin voice be penetrate at the promise of a story silence fall on the company and mr penrose tell he tale vouch as he authority a erstwhile oldest inhabitant now gather to he father for the tale date back some eighty year to the date of the ancient 's early manhood a seafaring man have suddenly appear out of space as it be at inkston and take the cottage he carry with he a strong smell of rum and tobacco and give it to be understand that he name be captain duggle he be no beauty and he behavior be worse than he look to that quiet village in those quiet strait-laced time he be a horror and a portent he not only drink prodigiously -- that be in character and also a source of local profit might have pass with mild censure -- but he swear and blaspheme horribly spurn the parson mocking at revelation even at the deity himself the devil be he friend he say a most terrible fellow this captain duggle inkston 's hair stand on end and no wonder no doubt they shiver with delight over it all comment mr naylor captain duggle live all by himself -- well what god-fearing christian male or female would be find to live with he -- come and go mysteriously and capriciously always full of money and at least equally full of drink what he do with himself nobody know but evil legend gather about he terrify wayfarer pass the cottage by night take oath that they have hear more than one voice this be proper christmas a subaltern interject into gertie 's ear mr penrose with a air of gratification continue he narrative the story go on to tell he say of a final interview with the village clergyman in which that reverend man as in duty bind solemnly tell captain duggle that however much he might curse and blaspheme and drink and er do all the other thing that the captain do -lrb- obviously here mr penrose feel hamper by the presence of lady -rrb- yet death judgment and churchyard wait for he at last whereupon the captain emit a inconceivably terrific imprecation which no one ever dare to repeat and which consequently be lose to tradition declare that the first he would never fear the second be parson 's gabble and as to the third never should he dead toe be nearer any church than for the last forty year he living foot have be if so be as he be not drown at sea he would make a grave for himself mr penrose pause sip port wine and resume and so no doubt he do build the tower for that purpose by bribe and threat he get two man to work for he one be the uncle of my informant but though he build that tower and inside it dig he grave he never lay there be as thing turn out carry off by the devil oh yes there be no doubt he go home one night a Saturday very drunk as usual on the Sunday night a belated wayfarer possibly also drunk hear wild shriek and see a strange red glow through the window of the tower now by the way board up and no doubt he would have smell brimstone if the wind have not set the wrong way anyhow captain duggle be never see again by mortal eye at inkston at all event after a time the landlord of the cottage screw up he courage to resume possession the captain have only a lease of it though he build the tower at he own charge and i believe without any permission the landlord be much too frightened to interfere with he he find everything in a sad mess in the house while in the tower itself every bless stick have be burn up so the story look pretty plausible and the grave this question come eagerly from at least three of the company in front of the fireplace there be a big oblong hole -- six foot by three by four -- plank at the bottom the side roughly line with brick captain duggle 's grave but he be not in it but what really become of he mr penrose cry cynthium the rise generation be very skeptical say old naylor you of course penrose believe the story i do say mr penrose composedly i believe that a devil carry he off and that its name be _ delirium tremen _ we can guess can not we irechester why he smash or burn everything and flee in mad terror into the darkness where to be he drown at sea or do he take he life or do he rot to death in some filthy hole nobody know but the grave he dig be there in the tower unless it be be fill up since old saffron have live there why in the world be not it fill up before ask alec naylor with a laugh people live in the cottage do not they i have visit the cottage often irechester interpose when various people have it but i never see any sign of the tower be use it never be i be sure and as for the grave well alec in country part to this day you would be think a bold man if you fill up a grave that you neighbor have dig for himself and such a neighbor as captain duggle he might take it into he head some night to visit it and if he find it fill up there would be trouble nasty trouble he laugh cackle out rather uncomfortably gertie shiver and one of the subaltern gulp down he port old saffron 's a man of education i believe no doubt he pay no heed to such nonsense and have have the thing cover up say naylor as to that i do not know perhaps you do irechester he be you patient be not he dr irechester sit four place from mary before he reply to the question he cast a glance at she smile rather mockingly i have attend he on one or two occasion but i have never see the inside of the tower so i do not know either oh but i be curious i shall ask mr beaumaroy cry cynthium the ironical character of irechester 's smile grow more pronounced and he voice be at its driest : certainly you can ask beaumaroy miss walford as far as ask go there be no difficulty a pause follow this pointed remark on which nobody seem disposed to comment mr naylor end the session by rise from she chair but mary arkroyd be disquiet worried as to how she stand with irechester vaguely but insistently worry over the whole tower cottage business well the first point she could soon settle or try to settle anyhow with the directness which mark she action when once she mind be make up she waylay irechester as he come into the drawing-room she resolute approach suffice to detach naylor from he he find himself for the moment isolate from everybody except mary you get my letter dr irechester i -- i rather expect a answer you conduct be so obviously and punctiliously correct he reply suavely that i think my answer could wait till i meet you here to-day as i know that i be to have the pleasure of do he look she full in the eye you be place my dear colleague in a position in which you have no alternative i think so dr irechester but -- oh yes clearly i be far from make any complaint he give she a courteous little bow but it be one which plainly close the subject indeed he pass by she and join a group that have gather on the hearthrug leave she alone so she stand for a minute oppress by a grow uneasiness irechester say nothing but surely mean something of import he mock she but not idly or out of wantonness he seem almost to warn she what could there be to warn she about he have lay a odd emphasis on the word place he have repeat it who have place she there mr saffron or -- alec naylor break in on she uneasy meditation it be a clinking night doctor mary he observe do you mind if i walk miss walford home instead of she go with you in you car you know it be only a couple of mile and -- do you think you leg can stand it he laugh i 'll cut the thing off if it dare to make any objection chapter vii a gentlemanly stranger on this same christmas day sergeant hooper be feel morose and discontented not because he be alone in the world -lrb- a situation comprise many advantage -rrb- nor on the score of he wages which be extremely liberal nor on account of the old blighter 's -- that be mr saffron 's -- occasional outburst of temper these be in the nature of the case and within the term of the contract nor finally by reason of beaumaroy 's airy insolence since from he youth up the sergeant be harden to unfavorable comment on he personal appearance trifling vulgarity which a man of sense could afford to ignore no the winter of he discontent -- a bitter winter -- be due to the conviction which have be grow in he mind for some time that he be only in half the secret and that not the more profitable half he know that the old blighter have to be humor in certain small way as for example in regard to the combination knife-and-fork -- and the reason for it but first he do not know what happen inside the tower he have never see the inside of it the door be always lock he be never invite to accompany he master when they repair thither by day and he be not on the premise by night and secondly he do not understand the Wednesday journey to london and he have never see the inside of beaumaroy 's brown bag -- that like the tower door be always lock he have handle it once just before the pair set out for london one Wednesday beaumaroy a careless man sometimes in spite of the cunning which dr irechester attribute to he have leave it on the parlor table while he help mr saffron on with he coat in the passage and the sergeant have swiftly and surreptitiously lift it up it be very light obviously empty or at all event hold only featherweight contents he have never get near it when it come back from town then it always go straight into the tower and have the key turn on it forthwith but the sergeant although slow-witted as well as ugly have have he experience he have carry weight both in the army and in other institution which be officially describe as he majesty 's and have see other man carry they too from the set of beaumaroy 's figure as he arrive home on at least two occasion with the brown bag and from the way in which he handle it the sergeant confidently draw the conclusion that it be of a considerable almost a grievous weight what be the heavy thing in it what become of that thing after it be take into the tower to whose use or profit do it or be it to inure certainly it be plain even to the meanest capacity that the contents of the bag have a value in the eye of the two man who go to london for they and who shepherd they from london to the custody of the tower these thought fill and rack he brain as he sit drinking rum and water in the bar of the _ green man _ on christmas evening a solitary man mix little with the people of the village he sit apart at a small table in the corner musing within himself yet idly watch the company -- villager a few friend from london and elsewhere some soldier and they lady besides these a tall slim man stand lean against the bar at the far end of it talk to bill smither the landlord and sip whisky-and-soda between pull at he cigar he wear a neat dark overcoat brown shoe and a bowler hat rather on one side he appearance be in fact genteel though he air be a trifle raffish in age he seem about forty the sergeant have never see he before and therefore favor he with a glance of special attention oddly enough the gentlemanly stranger seem to reciprocate the sergeant 's interest he give he quite a long glance then he finish he whisky-and-soda speak a word to bill smither and lounge across the room to where the sergeant sit it be poor work drinking alone on christmas night he observe may i join you i have order a little something and well we need not bother about offer a gentleman a glass tonight the sergeant eye he with apparent disfavor -- as indeed he do everybody who approach he -- but a nod of he head accord the desire permission smither come across with a bottle of brandy and glass good stuff say the stranger as he sit down fill the glass and drink he off the best thing to top up with believe I the sergeant in turn drain he glass maintain however he aloofness of demeanor what be up he growl what be in the brown bag ask the stranger lightly and urbanely the sergeant do not start he be too old a hand for that but he small gimlet eye search he new acquaintance 's face very keenly you know a lot more than you do in some direction less in other perhaps shall i begin because we have get to confide in one another sergeant a little story of what two gentleman do in london on wednesday and of what they carry home in a brown leather bag would that interest you oh that stuff in the brown leather bag hard to come by now be not it but they know where there be still some and so do i to remark it incidentally there be actually some people sergeant hooper who distrust the righteousness of the british cause which be to say -lrb- the stranger smile cynically -rrb- the certainty of we lick the german and they hoard it the villain sergeant hooper stretch out he hand towards the bottle allow I say the stranger politely i observe that you hand tremble a little it do the sergeant be excite the stranger seem to be touch on a subject which always excite the sergeant -- to the point of hand tremble twitch and itch have to pay for it too thirty bob in curl-twister for every ruddy disc that be the figure now or thereabout what do they want to do it for what be you governor 's game who in short be go to get off with it what be it they do the old blighter and boomery -lrb- thus he pronounce the name beaumaroy -rrb- in london first to the stockbroker 's then to a bank or two i have know it three even then a taxi down east and a call at certain address the bag 's with 'em sergeant and at each call it get heavier i have see it swell so to speak who in hell be you the sergeant grunt huskily name later -- after the usual guarantee of good faith the whole conversation carry on in low tone have pass under cover of noisy mirth snatch of song banter and giggling nobody pay heed to the two man talk in a corner yet the stranger lower he voice to a whisper as he add : from I to you fifty quid on account from you to I just a sight of the place where they put it sergeant hooper drink smoked and ponder the stranger show the edge of a roll of note protrude it from he breast-pocket the sergeant nod he understand that part but there be much that he do not understand it fair beat I what the blaze they be do it _ for _ he break out whose money would it be the old blighter 's o ' course boomery 's stony except for he screw he look hard at the gentlemanly stranger and a slow smile come on he lip that be you idea be it mister gentleman 's old look frail might go off suddenly what then friend turn up always do when you be dead you know well what of it less money in the fund than be reckon dear old gentleman do not cut up as well as they hope and meanwhile we friend b -- do it dawn on you at all from we friend b -- 's point of view sergeant i may be wrong but that be my provisional conjecture the question remain how he be get the old gent into the game do not it precisely the point to which the sergeant 's mind also have turn the knowledge which he possess -- that half of the secret -- and which he companion do not might be very material to a solution of the problem the sergeant do not mean to share it prematurely without necessity or for nothing but surely it have a bearing on the case dull-witted as he be the sergeant seem to catch a glimmer of light and mentally groped towards it well we can not sit here all night say the stranger in good-humored impatience i have a train to catch there be no train up from here to-night there be from sprotsfield i shall walk over the sergeant smile oh if you be walk to sprotsfield i 'll put you on you way if anybody be to see we boomery for instance he could not complain of my see a old pal on he way on christmas night no ` arm in that no look of prowling or spy or such like and you be a old pal be not you certainly you old pal -- let I see -- you old pal percy bennett as it might he or as it might not what about the -- he point to percy bennett 's breast-pocket i 'll give it you outside you do not want I to be see hand it over in here do you the sergeant have one more question to ask about ` ow much d'ye reckon there might be by now how often have they be to london because they do not come to see my friend every time i fancy must ` ave be six or seven time by now the game begin soon after boomery and i come ` ere then quite roughly quite a shot from what i know of the deal we -- my friend i mean -- do with they and reasoning from that there might be a matter of seven or eight thousand pound the sergeant whistle softly rise and lead the way to the door the gentlemanly stranger pause at the bar to pay for the brandy and after bid the landlord a civil good-evening with the compliment of the season follow the sergeant into the village street fifteen minute ' brisk walk bring they to hinton avenue at the end of it they pass doctor mary 's house the drawing-room curtain be not draw on the blind they see reflect the shadow of a man and a girl standing side by side mistletoe eh remark the stranger the sergeant spat on the road they resume they way pursue the road across the heath it be fine but overclouded and decidedly dark every now and then bennett to call the stranger by what be almost confessedly a _ nom-de-guerre _ flash a powerful electric torch on the roadway do not want to walk into a gorse-bush he explain with a laugh put it away you darned fool we be nearly there the stranger obey in another seven or eight minute there loom up on the left hand the dim outline of mr saffron 's abode -- the square cottage with the odd round tower annex there you be the sergeant 's voice instinctively keep to a whisper that be what you want to see but i can not see it -- not so as to get any clear idea no light show from the cottage nor of course from the tower its only window have be as mr penrose say board up the wind -- there be generally a wind on the heath -- stir the fir-tree and the bush into a soft movement and a faint murmur of sound a very acute and alert ear might perhaps have catch another sound -- footfall on the road a good long way behind they the two spy or scout do not hear they they attention be elsewhere probably they be both in bed it be quite safe to make we examination say the stranger yes i s ` pose it be but look to be ready to douse you glim boomery 's a nailer at turn up unexpected the sergeant seem rather nervous mr bennett be not he take out he torch and guide by its light -lrb- which however he take care not to throw towards the cottage window -rrb- he advance to the garden gate the sergeant follow and take a survey of the premise it be remarkable that as the light of the torch beam out the faint sound of footfall on the road behind die away keep a eye on the window and touch my elbow if any light show do not speak the stranger be at business -- he business -- now and he voice become correspondingly businesslike we will not risk go inside the gate i can see from here indeed he very well could tower cottage stand back no more than twelve or fifteen foot from the road and the torch be powerful for four or five minute the stranger make he examination then he turn off he torch look easy he remark but of course there be the garrison once more he turn on he light to look at he watch can not stop now or i shall miss the train and i do not want to have to get a bed at sprotsfield a strayed reveler on christmas night might be too well remembered get a address care of mr willnough laundress inkston right good-night with a quick turn he be off along the road to sprotsfield the sergeant see the gleam of he torch once or twice recede at quite a surprising pace into the distance feel the wad of note in he pocket -- perhaps to make sure that the whole episode have not be a dream -- the sergeant turn back towards inkston after a couple of minute a tall figure emerge from the shelter of a high and thick gorse bush just opposite tower cottage on the other side of the road captain alec naylor have see the light of the stranger 's torch and after four year in france he be well skilled in the art of noiseless approach but he feel that for the moment at least he brain be less agile than he foot he have be suddenly wrench out of one set of thought into another profoundly different it be he shadow together with cynthium walford 's that the sergeant and the stranger have see on doctor mary 's blind after walk she home he have -- well just not propose to cynthium restrain more by those scruple of he than by any ungraciousness on the part of the lady even he modesty could not blind he to this fact he be full of pity of love of a man 's joyous sense of triumph half wish that he have make he proposal half glad that he have not just because it and its radiant promise could still be dangle in the bright vision of the future he be in the seventh heaven of romance and he heaven be higher than that which most man reach it be build on loftier foundation then come the flash of the torch the high spirit bear of one experience seek a outlet in another by jove i 'll track 'em -- like old time he murmur with a low light laugh and just for fun he do it take to the heath beside the road twist he long body in and out amongst gorse heather and bracken very noiselessly with wonderful dexterity the light of the lamp be continuous now the stranger be make he examination by it captain alec guide he step and he arrive behind the tall gorse bush opposite tower cottage just in time to hear the sergeant say mr willnough laundress inkston and to witness the parting of the two companion there be very little to go upon there why should not one friend give another a address but the examination beaumaroy should surely know of that it might be nothing but on the other hand it might have a meaning but the man have go have obviously part for the night beaumaroy could be tell to-morrow now he himself could go back to he vision -- and so homeward in happiness to he bed have reach this sensible conclusion he be about to turn away from the garden gate which he now stand face when he hear the house door softly open and as softly shut the practice of he profession have give he keen eye in the dark he discover beaumaroy 's tall figure steal very cautiously down the narrow flag path the next instant the light of another torch flash out and this time not in the distance but full in he own face by god you naylor beaumaroy exclaim in a voice which be low but full of surprise i -- i -- well it be rather late -- alec naylor be suddenly strike with the element of humor in the situation he have be play detective apparently he be now the suspect give I time and i 'll explain all he say smile under the dazzling ray of the torch beaumaroy glance round at the house for a second purse up he lip into one of the odd little contortion which he sometimes allow himself and say : well then old chap come in and have a drink and do it for i be hang if i see why you should stand stare into this garden in the middle of the night with you opportunity i should be better employ on christmas evening you really want I to come in it be now captain alec 's voice which express surprise why the devil not ask beaumaroy in a tone of frank but friendly impatience he turn and lead the way into tower cottage somehow this invitation to enter be the last thing that captain alec have expect chapter viii captain alec raise he voice beaumaroy lead the way into the parlor captain alec follow well i think you old friend do not care to see stranger he say continue the conversation he be tired and fretful to-night so i get he to bed and give he a soothing draught -- one that we friend dr arkroyd send he he go off like a lamb poor old boy if we do not talk too loud we sha 'n' t disturb he i can tell you what i have to tell in a few minute do not hurry beaumaroy be bring the refreshment he have offer from the sideboard i be feel lonely to-night so i -- he smile -- yield to the impulse to ask you to come in naylor however let 's have the story by all mean the surprise -- it might almost have be take for alarm -- which he have show at the first sight of alec seem to have give place to a gentle and amiable weariness which persist through the recital of the captain 's experience -- how he errand of courtesy or gallantry have lead to he be on the road across the heath so late at night and of what he have see there you cop they properly beaumaroy remark at the end with a lazy smile one do learn a trick or two in france you could not see they face i suppose no too dark i do not dare show a light though i have one besides they back be towards I one look tall and thin the other short and stumpy but i should never be able to swear to either and they go off in different direction you say yes the tall one towards sprotsfield the short one back towards inkston oh the short stumpy one it be who turn back to inkston beaumaroy have seat himself on a low three-legged stool opposite to the big chair where alec sit and be smoke he pipe he hand clasp round he knee it do not seem to I to come to much though i be much oblige to you all the same the short one 's probably a local the other a stranger and the local be probably see he friend part of the way home and incidentally show he one of the sight of the neighborhood there be story about this old den you know -- ancient tradition it be say to be haunt and what not funnily enough we have the story to-night at dinner at we house have you now beaumaroy look up quickly what all about -- captain duggle and the devil and the grave and all that who tell you the story old mr penrose do you know he live in high street near the irechester i think i know he by sight so he entertain you with that old yarn do he and that same old yarn probably account for the nocturnal examination which you see go on it be a little excitement for you to reward you for you politeness to miss walford alec flush but answer frankly : i need no reward for that he feeling get the better of he he be very full of feeling that night and want to be sympathize with beaumaroy do you know that girl 's story beaumaroy shake he head and listen to it captain alec end on he old note : to think of the scoundrel use the king 's uniform like that rotten but er do not raise you voice he point to the ceiling smile and go on without further comment on cynthium 's ill-usage i suppose you intend to stick to the army naylor yes certainly i do i be discharge after i come out of hospital they give I sick leave and constantly renew it and when the armistice come they give I my discharge they put it down to my wound of course but -- well i gather the impression that i be consider no great loss he have finish he pipe and be now smile reflectively captain alec do not smile indeed he look rather pained he be remember general punnit 's story : military inefficiency even military imperfection be for he no smile matter beaumaroy do not appear to notice he disapprove gravity so i be at a loose end i have sell up my business in spain i be there six or seven year just as captain -- captain -- oh cranster yes -- be in bogota -- when i join up and have no particular reason for go back there -- and incidentally no money to go back with so i take on this job which come to I quite accidentally i go into a piccadilly bar one evening and find my old man there rather excited and declaim a good deal of rot seem to have the war a bit on he brain they start in to guy he and i think one or two mean to hustle he and perhaps take he money off he i take he part and there be a bit of a shindy in the end i see he home to he lodgings -- he have a room in london for the night -- and to cut a long story short we pall up and he ask I to come and live with he so here i be and with I my sancho panza the worthy ex-sergeant hooper perhaps i may be forgive for impliedly compare myself to don quixote since that gentleman besides he other characteristic be generally agree to have be mad you sancho panza 's no beauty remark the captain drily and no saint either kick out of the service and do time that between ourselves then why the devil do you have the fellow about beggar must not be choosers besides i have a _ penchant _ for failure that be what general punnit have say alec naylor grow impatient that be the very spirit we have to fight against he exclaim rather hotly forgive I but please do not raise you voice alec lower he voice for a moment anyhow but the central article of he creed be assail and he grow vehement it be fatal it be at the root of all we trouble allow for failure in individual and you produce failure all round it be tenderness to defaulter that wreck discipline i would have strict justice but no mercy not a shadow of it but you say that day at you place that the war have make you tender-hearted yes i do and it be true be it hard-hearted to refuse to let a slacker cost good man they life much better take he if it be get to be one or the other a cogent argument but my dear naylor i wish you would not raise you voice damn my voice say alec most vexatiously interrupted just as he have get into he stride you say thing that i can not and will not let pass and -- i really would not have ask you in if i would think you would raise you voice alec recollect himself my dear fellow a thousand pardon i forget the old gentleman exactly but i be afraid the mischief 's do listen again he point to the ceiling but he eye set on captain alec with a queer rueful humorous expression i be a ass to ask you in but i be no good at it that be the fact i be always give the show away he grumble half to himself but not inaudibly alec stare at he for a moment in puzzle but the next instant he attention be divert another voice besides he be raise the sound of it come through the ceiling from the room above the word be not audible the volubility of the utterance in itself go far to prevent they from be distinguishable but the high vibrant metallic tone ring through the house it be a rush of noise sharp grating noise without a mean the effect be weird very uncomfortable alec naylor knit he brow and once give a little shiver as he listen beaumaroy sit quite still the expression in he eye unaltered or if alter at all it grow softer as though with pity or affection good god beaumaroy be you keep a lunatic in this house he might raise he voice as loud as he please now it be drown by that other i be not keep he he be keep I and anyhow he medical adviser tell I there be no reason to suppose that my old friend be not _ compo menti _ irechester say that mr saffron 's medical attendant be dr arkroyd as he speak the noise from above suddenly cease since neither of the man in the parlor speak there ensue a minute of what seem intense silence it be such a change then come a still small sound a creaking of wood from overhead i think you would better go naylor if you do not mind after a performance of that kind he generally come and tell I about it and he may be i do not know at all for certain annoyed to find you here alec naylor get up from the big chair but it be not to take he departure i want to see he beaumaroy he say brusquely and rather authoritatively beaumaroy raise he brow i will not take you to he room or let you go there if i can help it but if he come down well you can stay and see he it may get I into a scrape but that do not matter much my point of view be -- my dear fellow i know you point of view perfectly it be that you be personally responsible for the universe apparently just because you wear a uniform no other sound have come from above or from the stair but the door now open suddenly and mr saffron stand on the threshold he wear slipper a pair of check trousers and he bedroom jacket of pale blue in addition the gray shawl which he wear on he walk be again swathe closely round he only he right arm be free from it in he hand be a silver bedroom candlestick from he pale face and under he snowy hair he blue eye gleam brightly as alec first catch sight of he he be smile happily and he call out triumphantly : that be a good one that go well hector then he see alec 's tall figure by the fire he grow grave close the door carefully and advance to the table on which he set down the candlestick after a momentary look at alec he turn he gaze inquiringly towards beaumaroy i be afraid we be keep it up rather late sir say the latter in a tone of respectful yet easy apology but i take a airing in the road after you go to bed and there i find my friend here on he way home and since it be christmas -- mr saffron bow he head in acquiescence he show no sign of anger present you friend to I hector he request or order gravely captain naylor sir distinguished service order duffshire fusilier the captain be in uniform and during he talk with beaumaroy have not think of take off he cap thus he come to the salute instinctively the old man bow with reserved dignity in spite of he queer get-up he bear himself well the tall handsome captain do not seem to efface or outclass he captain naylor have distinguish himself highly in the war sir beaumaroy continue i be very glad to make the acquaintance of any officer who have distinguish himself in the service of he country then he tone become easier and more familiar do not let I disturb you gentleman my business with you hector will wait i have finish my work and can rest with a clear conscience could not we persuade you to stay a few minute with we and join we in a whisky-and-soda yes by all mean hector but no whisky give I a glass of my own wine i see a bottle on the sideboard he come round the table and sit down in the big chair pray seat yourself captain he say wave he hand towards the stool which beaumaroy have lately occupy the captain obey the gesture but he huge frame look awkward on the low seat he feel aware of it then aware of the cap on he head he snatch it off hastily and twiddle it between he finger mr saffron high up in the great chair sit erect seem now actually to dominate the scene -- beaumaroy standing by with a arm on the back of the chair hold a tall glass full of the golden wine ready to mr saffron 's command the old man reach up he thin right hand take it and sip with evident pleasure alec naylor be embarrassed he sit in silence but beaumaroy seem quite at he ease he begin with a statement which be in its literal form no falsehood but that be about all that could be say for it on the score of veracity before you come in sir we be just speaking of uniform do you remember see we blue air force uniform when we be in town last week i remember that you express approval of it in any case the topic be very successful mr saffron embrace it with eagerness with much animation he discuss the merit whether practical or decorative of various uniform -- field-gray khaki horizon blue air force blue and a dozen other worn by various army corps and service alec be something of a enthusiast in this line too he soon forget he embarrassment and join in the conversation freely though with a due respect to the obvious thoroughness of mr saffron 's information watch the pair with a amuse smile beaumaroy contented himself with put in here and there what may be call a conjunctive observation -- just enough to give the topic a new start after a quarter of a hour of this pleasant conversation for such all three seem to find it mr saffron finish he wine hand the glass to beaumaroy and take a cordial leave of alec naylor it be time for I to be in bed but do not hurry away captain you will not disturb I i be a good sleeper good-bye i sha 'n' t want you any more to-night hector beaumaroy hand he he candle again and hold the door open for he as he go out alec naylor clap he cap back on he head i be off too he say abruptly well you insist on see he and you have see he what about it now ask beaumaroy alec eye he with a puzzle baffle suspicion you switch he on to that subject on purpose and by means of something uncommon like a lie a little artifice i know it would interest you and it be quite one of he hobby i do not know much about he past life but i think he must have have something to do with military tailor a designer at the war office perhaps beaumaroy give a low laugh rather mock and malicious still that do not prove a man mad do it perhaps it ought to but in general opinion it do not any more than recite poetry in bed do do you mean to tell I that he be recite poetry when -- well it could not have sound worse if he have be could it now he be openly laugh at the captain 's angry bewilderment he know that alec naylor do not believe a word of what he be say or suggest but yet alec could not pass he guard nor wing a shaft between the joint of he harness if he get into difficulty through heedlessness at least he make a good shot at get out of they again by he dexterity only of course suspicion remain suspicion even though it be for the moment baffle and it could not be deny that suspicion be pile up -- captain alec irechester even on one little point doctor mary and possibly those two fellow outside -- one of they short and stumpy -- have they suspicion too though these might be direct to another point he give one of he little shrug as he follow the silent captain to the garden gate good-night thanks again and i hope we shall meet soon he say cheerily alec give he a brief good-night and a particularly formal military salute chapter ix doctor mary 's ultimatum even captain alec be not superior to the foible which beset humanity if it have be he conception of duty which impel he to take a high line with beaumaroy there be now in he feeling although he do not realize the fact a alloy of less precious metal he have demand a ordeal a test -- that he should see mr saffron and judge for himself the test have be accept he have be worst in it he suspicion be not lay to rest -- far from it but they be leave unjustified and unconfirmed he have nothing to go upon nothing to show he have be baffle and moreover banter and almost openly ridicule in fact beaumaroy have be too many for he the subtle rogue this conception of the case color he look and point he word when tower cottage and its occupant be refer to and most markedly when he speak of they to cynthium walford for in talk to she he naturally allow himself greater freedom than he do with other talk to she have become like talk to himself so completely do she give he back what he bestow on she and re-echo to he mind its own voice such perfect sympathy induce a free outpouring of inner thought and reinforce the opinion of which it so unreservedly approve cynthium do more than elicit and reinforce captain alec 's opinion she also disseminate it -- at old place at the irechester ' at doctor mary 's through all the little circle in which she be now a constant and a favorite figure in the light of she experience of man so limited and so sharply contrast she make a simple classification of they they be cranster or alec and each class act after its kind plainly beaumaroy be not a alec therefore he be cranster and cranster-like action be to be expect from he of such special description as he circumstance and temptation might dictate she pour this simple philosophy into doctor mary 's ear vouch alec 's authority for its application to beaumaroy the theory be too simple for mary whose profession have show she at all event something of the complexity of human nature and she be no infallibilist she would bow unquestioningly to no man 's authority not even to alec 's much as she like and admire he there be even a streak of contrariness in she what she might have say to herself she be prone to criticize or contradict if it be too confidently or urgently press on she by another perhaps too cynthium 's claim to be the captain 's mouthpiece stir up in she a latent resentment it be not to be call a jealousy it be rather a amuse irritation at both the divinity and he worshiper he worshiper can sometimes make a divinity look foolish she own interview with beaumaroy at the cottage have leave she puzzle distrustful -- and attract she suspect he vaguely of want to use she for some purpose of he own in spite of the swift plausibility of he explanation she be nearly certain that he have lie to she about the combination knife-and-fork yet he account of he own position in regard to mr saffron have sound remarkably candid and the more so because he make no pretension to a exalted attitude it have be leave to she to define the standard of sensitive honor he have be rather that of safety or at the best that of what the world would think or even of what the hate cousin might attempt to prove but there again she be distrustful both of he and of she own judgment he might be -- it seem likely -- one of those man who conceal the good as well as the bad in themselves one of the morally shy man or again perhaps one of the morally diffident who shrink from arrogate to themselves high standard because they fear for they own virtue if it be put to the test and cling to the power of say later on well i tell you not to expect too much from I such various type of man exist and they do not fall readily into either of cynthium 's two class they be neither cranster nor alec certainly not in thought probably not in conduct he have say at old place the first time that she meet he that the war have destroy all he scruple that might be true but it be hardly the remark of a man naturally unscrupulous she meet he one day at old place about a week after christmas the captain be not there he be at she own house with cynthium with the rest of the family beaumaroy be at he best gaily respectful to mr naylor merry with gertie exchange cut and thrust with old mr naylor easy and cordial towards herself certainly a attractive human being and a charming companion pre-eminently natural one talk of take people as one find they old naylor say to she when they be leave alone together for a few minute by the fire while the other chat by the window that fellow take himself as he find himself not as a pattern a failure or a problem but just as a fact -- a psychological fact that rather shut out effort do not it well i mean -- striving mr naylor smile yes it do on the other hand it give such free play that be what make he interesting make you think about he he laugh oh i dare say the surroundings help too -- we be all rather child -- old saffron and the devil and captain duggle and the rest of it the brain be not overwork down here we like to find a outlet that mean you think there be nothing in it really in what retort old naylor briskly but mary be equal to he my lip be seal professionally she smile but have not you son say anything admirable woman yes alec have say a few thing and the young lady give it we too for my part i think beaumaroy 's just drift he 'll take the gift of fortune if they come but i do not think there be much deliberate design about it ah now you be smile in a superior way doctor mary i charge you with secret knowledge or be you puff up by have supersede irechester i be never so distressed and -- well embarrassed at anything in my life well that if you ask I do look a bit queer sort of fit in with alec 's theory mary 's discretion give way a little or with mr beaumaroy 's which be that i be a fool i think and that irechester be not he eye twinkle in good-humored malice talking of what this and that person think of himself and of other irechester think himself something of a alienist she eye grow suddenly alert he be never talk to I on that subject perhaps he do not think it be one of yours perhaps you study have not lie that way after all no medical man can study everything do not be naughty mr naylor say doctor mary he tell I that in case where the condition -- the condition i think he call it -- be in doubt he fix he attention on the eye and the voice he could not give I any very clear description of what he find in the eye i could not quite make out anyhow what he mean unless it be a sort of meaninglessness a want of what you might call intellectual focus do you follow I yes i think i know what you mean but with regard to the voice i distinctly remember that he use the word ` metallic ' why that be the word cynthium use -- i dare say it be it be the word alec use in describe the voice in which old mr saffron recite he poem or whatever it be in bed but i have talk to mr saffron he voice be not like that it be a little high but full and rather melodious oh well then -- he spread out he hand as though acknowledge a check still the voice describe as metallic seem to have be mr saffron 's at a certain moment at least as a merely medical question of some interest i wonder if such a symptom or sign of -- er -- irritability could be intermittent come and go with the -- er -- fit irechester do not say anything on that point have you any opinion none i do not know i should like to ask dr irechester then with a sudden smile she amend no i should not and why not pray professional etiquette no pride dr irechester laugh at I i think i see why now and perhaps why mr beaumaroy -- she break off abruptly the slightest gesture of she hand warn naylor also to be silent have say good-bye to he friend by the window beaumaroy be saunter across the room to pay the like courtesy to herself and naylor mary rise to she foot there be a air of decision about she and she address beaumaroy almost before he be within speak distance as it be generally reckon in society if you be go home mr beaumaroy shall we walk together it be time i be off too beaumaroy look a little surprised but undoubtedly pleased well now what a delightful way of prolong a delightful visit i be truly grateful dr arkroyd oh you need not be say mary with a little toss of she head naylor watch they with amusement he 'll catch it on that walk he be think she be go to let he have it i wish i could be there to hear he speak to they openly : i be sorry you must both go but since you must go together you walk will be much pleasanter mary understand he well enough and give he a flash from she eye but beaumaroy 's face betray nothing as he murmur politely : to I at all event mr naylor naylor be not wrong as to mary 's mood and purpose but she do not find it easy to begin pretty quick at a retort herself she could often foresee the retort open to she interlocutor beaumaroy have provide himself with plenty : the old man 's whim the access to the old man so willingly allow not only to she but to captain alec he own candor carry to the verge of self-betrayal oh he would be full of retort supple and dexterous one as this hostile accusation pass through she mind she awake to the fact that she be at the same moment regard he profile -lrb- he too be silent no doubt lie in wait to trip up she opening -rrb- with interest even with some approval he seem to feel she glance for he turn towards she quickly -- so quickly that she have no time to turn she eye away doctor mary -- the familiar mode of address habitually use at the house which they have just leave seem to slip out without he consciousness of it -- you have get something against I i know you have i be sensitive that way though not perhaps in another now out with it you would silence I with a clever answer i think that you sometimes make the mistake of suppose that to be silence be the same thing as be convince you silence captain naylor -- oh i do not mean you have prevent he from talk -- i mean you confute he you put he in the wrong but you certainly do not convince he of what he ask in a tone of surprise you know that let we suppose he idea be all nonsense yet you immediate object be to put it out of he head she suddenly add i think you last question be a diplomatic blunder mr beaumaroy you must have know what i mean what be the good of pretend not to beaumaroy stop still in the road for a moment look at she with a rueful amusement you be not so easily silence after all he say start to walk on again you encourage I to tell the truth mary be not only encouraged she be please by the hit she have score and flatter by he acknowledgment of it well then i 'll put another point you need not answer if you do not like i shall answer if i can depend on it he laugh and mary for a brief instant join in he laugh he sudden lapse into candor seem somehow to put the serious hostile questioner ridiculously in the wrong could a man like that really have anything to conceal but she hold to she purpose you be a friendly sort of man you offer and accept attention and kindness you be not stand-offish or haughty or sulky you make friend easily especially perhaps with woman they like you and like to be pleasant and kind to you there be man -- patient i mean -- very hard to deal with man who resent be ill resent have to have thing do to they and for they who especially resent the service of woman even of nurse -- i mean in quite indifferent thing not merely in thing where a man may naturally shrink from they help well you do not seem that sort of man in the least she look at he as she end this appreciation of he as though she expect a answer or a comment beaumaroy make neither he walk on not even look at she and you can not have be trouble long with that wound it evidently heal up quickly and sweetly beaumaroy look for a instant at he maimed hand with a critical air but he be still silent so that i wonder you do not do as most patient do -- let the nurse or if you be still disabled after you come out a friend or somebody cut up you food for you without provide yourself with that implement he turn he head quickly towards she and if you ask I what implement i mean i shall answer -- the one you try to snatch from the sideboard at tower cottage before i could see it it be a direct challenge she charge he with a lie beaumaroy 's face assume a really troubled expression a thing rare for it to do yet it be not a ashamed or abashed expression it just seem to recognize that a troublesome difficulty have arise he set a slower pace and prod the road with he stick mary push she advantage you -- you improvization do not satisfy I at the time and the more i have think over it the less have i find it convince he stop again turn round to she he slap he left hand against the side of he leg well there it be doctor mary you must make what you can of it it be complete surrender as to the combination knife-and-fork he be beat on that point at least and own it he lie be find out it be dash difficult always to remember that you be a doctor he break out the next minute mary could not help laugh but she eye be still keen and challenging as she say perhaps you would better change you doctor again mr beaumaroy you have not find one stupid enough again beaumaroy have no defense he nonplussed air confess that maneuver too mary drop she rally tone and go on gravely : unless i be treat with confidence and sincerity i can not continue to attend mr saffron that be you ultimatum be it doctor mary she nod sharply and decisively beaumaroy meditate for a few seconds then he shake he head regretfully it be no use i dare not trust you he say mary laugh again this time in amaze resentment of he impudence you can not trust I i think it be the other way round it seem to I that the boot 's on the other leg not as i see it then he smile slowly as it be tentatively or would you -- i wonder if you could -- possibly -- well stand in with I be you offer I a -- a partnership she ask indignantly he raise he hand in a seeming protest and speak now hastily and in some confusion not as you understand it i mean as you probably understand it from what i say to you that night at the cottage there be feature in the -- well there be thing that i admit have -- have pass through my mind without be what you would call settle oh yes without be in the least settle well for the sake of you help and -- er -- co-operation those -- those feature could be drop and then perhaps -- if only you -- you rule and etiquette -- mary scornfully cut short he embarrassed pleading there be a good deal more than rule and etiquette involve it seem to I that it be a matter of common honesty rather than of rule and etiquette -- yes but you do not understand -- she cut he short again mr beaumaroy after this after you suggestion and all the rest of it there must be a end of all relation between we -- professionally and so far as possible socially too please i do not want to be self-righteous but i feel bind to say that you have misunderstand my character she voice quiver at the end and almost break she be full of a grieved indignation they have come opposite the cottage now beaumaroy stop and stand face she though dusk have fall it be a clear evening she could see he face plainly obviously he be in deep distress i would not have offend you for the world i -- i like you far too much doctor mary you imputed you own standard to I that be all there be about it i suppose she say in a scornful sadness he look very miserable compassion and the old odd attraction which he have for she stir in she mind she voice grow soft and she hold out she hand i be sorry too very sorry that it should have to be good-bye between we beaumaroy do not take she proffer hand or even seem to notice it he stand quite still i be damned if i know what i be to do now close on the heel of he despairing confession of helplessness -- for such it undoubtedly seem to I -- come the noise of a opening door a light from the inside of the cottage a patter of quick-moving foot on the flag path that lead to the garden gate the next moment mary see the figure of mr saffron in he old gray shawl standing at the gate he be wave he right arm in a excited way and he hand hold a large sheet of paper hector hector my dear dear boy the news have come at last you can be off tomorrow beaumaroy start violently glance at he old friend 's strange figure glance once too at mary the expression of utter despair which he face have worn seem modify into one of humorous bewilderment yes yes you can start tomorrow for morocco my dear boy cry old mr saffron beaumaroy lift he hat to she cry i be come sir turn on he heel and stride quickly up to mr saffron she watch he open the gate and take the old gentleman by the arm she hear the murmur of he voice speak soft accent as the pair walk up the path together they pass into the house and the door be shut mary stand where she be for a moment then move slowly hesitatingly yet as though under a lure which she could not resist just outside the gate lay something that gleam white through the darkness it be the sheet of paper mr saffron have drop it in he excitement and beaumaroy have not notice mary steal forward and pick it up stealthily she be incapable of resist she curiosity or even of stop to think about she action she hold it up to what light there be and strain she eye to examine it so far as she could see it be cover with dot dash line queerly draw geometrical figure -- a mass of meaningless hieroglyphic she drop it again where she have find it and make off home with guilty swiftness yes there have be this time a distinctly metallic ring in old mr saffron 's voice chapter x the magical word morocco when mary arrive home she find cynthium and captain alec still in possession of the drawing-room they manner accuse she legitimate entry into the room of be a outrageous intrusion she take no heed of that and indeed little heed of they to tell the truth she be ashamed to confess but it be the truth she feel rather tire of they that evening they affair deserve every laudatory epithet except that of interesting so she declare peevishly within herself as she try to join in conversation with they it be no use they talk on and in justice to they it may be urge that they be fully as bore with mary as she be with they so naturally they talent do not shine they brightest but they have plenty to say to one another and dutifully throw in a question or a reference to mary every now and then sit apart at the other end of the long low room -- it run through the whole depth of she old-fashioned dwelling -- she barely heed and barely answer they smile at one another and be glad she be very tired she feeling be wound she nerve on edge she could not even attempt any cool train of reasoning the outcome of she talk with beaumaroy fill she mind rather than the matter of it and more even than that the figure of the man seem to be with she almost to stand before she with he queer alternation of despair and mirth of defiance and plead of derision and alarm one moment she be intensely irritated with he in the next she half forgive the plaintive image which the fancy of she mind conjure up before she eye she eye close -- she be so very tired the fight have take it out of she to have to do thing like that be a odious necessity which have never befall she before that man have do -- well captain alec be quite right about he yet still the shadowy image though thus reproach do not depart it be smile at she now with its old mockery -- the kindly mockery which he face wear before they quarrel and before its light be quench in that forlorn bewilderment and it seem as though the image begin to say some word to she disconnect word not make a sentence but yet have for the image a pregnant meaning and seem to she -- though vaguely and very dimly -- to be the key to what she have to understand she be stupid not to understand word so full of meaning -- just as stupid as beaumaroy have think then doctor mary fall asleep sound asleep she have be very near it for the last ten minute captain alec and cynthium be in two chair close side by side in front of the fire once cynthium glance over she shoulder the captain have glance over he in the same direction already one of he hand hold one of cynthium 's it be well to be sure that mary be asleep really asleep she have go to sleep on the name of beaumaroy on it she awake it come from captain alec 's lip he be stand on the hearthrug with he arm round cynthium 's waist and he other hand raise one of hers to he lip he look admirably handsome -- strong protect devoted and cynthium in she fragile appealing prettiness be a delicious foil a perfect complement to the picture but now under stress of emotion -- small blame to a man who be make a vow of eternal fidelity -- under stress of emotion as on a previous occasion under that of indignation the captain have raise he voice yes against all the scoundrel in the world whether they be call cranster or beaumaroy he say mary 's eye open she sit up cranster and beaumaroy they be the word which she ear have catch what in the world have mr beaumaroy to do with -- but she break off as she see the couple by the fire but what be you two do cynthium break away from she lover and run to she friend with joyous avowal i must have be sound asleep cry mary kiss she alec have follow across the room and now stand close by she she look up at he oh i see she be to be safe now from such people on this particular occasion mary 's look at the captain be not admire it be a little scornful that be the idea agree the happy alec another idea be that i trot you both over in the car to old place -- to break the news and have dinner splendid cry cynthium do come mary mary shake she head no you go you two she say i be tired and i want to think she pass she hand across she eye she seem to wipe away the mist of sleep she face suddenly grow animated and exultant no i do not want to think i know she exclaim emphatically mary dear be you still asleep be you talk in you sleep the keyword it come to I somehow in my sleep the keyword -- morocco what the deuce have morocco -- captain alec begin with justifiable impatience ah you never hear that and dear captain alec you would not have understand it if you have you think he be recite poem what he be really do -- look here doctor mary i have just be accept by cynthium and i be go to take she to my mother and father can you get you mind on to that he look at she curiously not at all understand she excitement perhaps resent the obvious fact that he cynthium 's happiness be not foremost in she friend 's mind with a great effort mary bring herself down to the earth -- to the earth of romantic love from the heaven of professional triumph true the latter be hers the former somebody else 's i do beg you pardon i do indeed and do let I kiss you again cynthia darling -- and you dear captain alec just once and then you shall go off to dinner she laugh excitedly yes i be go to push you out let 's go alec say cynthium not unkindly yet just a little pettishly the great moment of she life -- surely as great a moment as there have ever be in anybody 's life -- have hardly earn adequate recognition from mary as usual she feeling and alec 's be at one before they pass to other and more important matter when they drive off in the car she say to alec it seem to I that mary 's strangely interested in that mr beaumaroy have she be dream of he alec look like it and why the devil morocco he intellect baffle captain alec take refuge in he affection leave alone and so thankful for it doctor mary do not attempt to sit still she walk up and down she rove here and there smoke any quantity of cigarette she would certainly have forbid such excess to a patient the keyword its significance have seem to come to she in she sleep something in that subconsciousness theory the word explain link up give significance -- that magical word morocco yes they fall into place now the thing that have be so puzzling and that look now so obviously suggestive even one thing which she have think nothing about which have not strike she as have any significance now take on its meaning -- the gray shawl which the old gentleman so constantly wear swathe round he body envelop the whole of it except he right arm do he wear the shawl while he take he meal doctor mary could not tell as to that perhaps he do not at he meal only beaumaroy and perhaps they servant would be present but he seem to wear it whenever he go abroad whenever he be expose to the scrutiny of stranger that indicate secretiveness perhaps fear the apprehension of something the caution breed by that might give way under the influence of great cerebral excitement unquestionably mr saffron have be very excite when he wave the sheet of hieroglyphic and shout to beaumaroy about morocco but whether he wear the shawl or not in the safe privacy of tower cottage whatever might be the truth about that -- perhaps he vary he practice accord to he condition -- on one thing doctor mary would stake she life he use the combination knife-and-fork for it be over that implement that beaumaroy have trip up it ought to have be hide before she be admit to the cottage somebody have be careless somebody have blunder -- whether beaumaroy himself or he servant be immaterial beaumaroy have lie readily and ingeniously but not quite readily enough the dart of he hand have betray he that and a look in he eye a tell-tale mirth which have seem to mock both she and himself and have make he ingenious lie even at the moment unconvincing yes whether mr saffron wear the shawl or not he certainly use the combination table implement and the poem the poem which mr saffron recite to himself in bed and which he have say in captain alec 's hearing be good and go well it be beaumaroy of course who have call they poem the captain have merely repeat the description but with she newly find insight doctor mary know better what mr saffron declaim in that vibrate metallic voice be not poem but -- speech and morocco itself to anybody who remember history for a few year back even with the general memory of the man in the street to anybody who have read the controversy about the war morocco bring not puzzle but enlightenment for have not morocco be really the start point of the year of crisis -- those year intermittent in excitement but constant in anxiety beaumaroy be to start tomorrow for morocco -- on the strength of the hieroglyphic perhaps he be to go on from morocco to libya perhaps he be to raise the senussus -lrb- mary have follow the history of the war -rrb- to make he appearance at cairo jerusalem bagdad he be to be a forerunner be mr beaumaroy mr saffron he August master would follow in due course with a sardonic smile she wonder how the ingenious man would get out of start for morocco perhaps he would not succeed in obtain a passport or that excuse fail in elude the vigilance of the british authority or some more hieroglyphic might come carry another message postpone he start say that the propitious moment have not yet arrive after all there be several device open to ingenuity many way in which beaumaroy might protract a situation not so bad for he even as it stand and quite rich in possibility she acid smile be turn against herself when she remember that she have be fool enough to talk to beaumaroy about sensitive honor well never mind mr beaumaroy the case as to mr saffron stand pretty plain it be queer and pitiful but by no means unprecedented she might be not much of a alienist as dr irechester have be kind enough to suggest to mr naylor but she have see such case herself -- even stranger one where even higher power suffer impersonation with effect still more tragically absurd to onlooker and she remember read somewhere -- be it in maudslay -- that in the day of napoleon when prince and king be as ninepin to be set up and knock down at the tyrant 's pleasure the asylum of france be full of such great folk potentate there galore if she have mr saffron 's record before she she would expect to read of a vain ostentatious man ambitious in he own small way the little plant of these quality would give a morbid physical condition develop into the fantastic growth of delusion which she have now diagnose in the case of mr saffron -- diagnose with the assistance of some lucky accident but what be she duty now -- the duty of dr mary arkroyd a duly qualify accredit responsible medical practitioner with a slight shock to she self-esteem she be oblige to confess that she have only the haziest idea have not people who keep a lunatic to be license or something or do that apply only to lunatic in the plural and do beaumaroy keep mr saffron within the meaning of whatever the law might be but at any rate she must do something the state of thing at tower cottage could not go on as it be the law of the land -- whatever it be -- must be observe beaumaroy must be foiled and poor old mr saffron take proper care of the course of she meditation be hardly interrupt by the episode of she light evening meal she be back in she drawing-room by half past eight she mind engross with the matter still it be a little after nine when there be a ring at the hall door not the lover back so early she hear a man 's voice in the hall the next moment beaumaroy be show in and the door shut behind he he stand still by it make no motion to advance towards she he be breathe quickly and she notice bead of perspiration on he forehead she have spring to she foot at the sight of he and face he with indignation you have no right to come here mr beaumaroy after what pass between we this afternoon besides be as you see yourself very excited my poor old friend be not at all well tonight i be very sorry but i be no longer mr saffron 's medical attendant if i decline to be this afternoon i decline ten time more tonight for all i know he be very ill indeed dr arkroyd beaumaroy 's manner be very quiet restrained and formal i have come to a clear conclusion about mr saffron 's case since i leave you i think you might i suppose ` morocco ' put you on the scent and i suppose too that you look at that wretched bit of paper i -- i thought of it -- here mary be slightly embarrassed you would have be more than human if you have not i be out again after it in five minute -- as soon as i miss it you would go but i conclude you would see it he scribble dozen like that you seem to admit my conclusion about he mental condition she observe stiffly i always admit when i cease to be able to deny but do not let 's stand here talk really for all i know he may be die he heart seem to I very bad go and ask dr irechester he dread irechester i believe the sight of irechester might finish he you must come i can not -- for the reason i have tell you why my misdeed or you rule and regulation my god how i hate rule and regulation which of they be it that be perhaps to cost the old man he life mary could not resist the appeal that could hardly be she duty and certainly be not she inclination she grievance be not against poor old mr saffron with he pitiful delusion of greatness of a greatness too which now have suffer a eclipse almost as tragical as that which have befall he own reason what a irony in he mad aping of it now i will come mr beaumaroy on condition that you give I candidly and truthfully all the information which as mr saffron 's medical attendant i be entitle to ask i 'll tell you all i know about he and about myself too you affair and -- er -- position matter to I only so far as they bear on mr saffron so be it only come quickly and bring some of you thing that may help a man with a bad heart mary leave he go to she surgery and be quickly back with she bag i 'll get out the car it 'll take a little longer i know but do you mind if we walk car always alarm he he think that they come to take he away every car that pass vex he he look to see if it will stop and when yours do -- he end with a shrug for the first time mary 's feeling take on a keen edge of pity poor old gentleman fancy he living like that and car military car too have be so common on the road across the heath i understand let we go at once you walk yourself i suppose run say beaumaroy and with the first sign of a smile wipe the sweat from he brow with the back of he hand i be ready mr beaumaroy say doctor mary they walk along together in silence for fully half the way then beaumaroy speak he be extremely excite -- at he worst -- when he and i go into the cottage i have to humor he in every way it be the only thing to do that be follow by great fatigue a sort of collapse i persuade he to go to bed i hope we shall find he there but i do not know he would let I go only on condition that i leave the door of the tower unlock so that he could go in there if he want to if he have i be afraid that you may see something -- well something rather bizarre dr arkroyd that be all in the course of my profession silence fall on they again till the outline of cottage and tower come into view through the darkness beaumaroy speak only once again before they reach the garden gate if he should happen to be calmer now i hope you will not consider it necessary to tell he that you suspect anything unusual he be secretive he live in terror of what of be shut up may i lead the way in dr arkroyd they enter the cottage and beaumaroy shut the door a lamp be burn dimly in the passage he turn it up would you kindly wait here one minute receive she nod of acquiescence he step softly up the stair and she hear he open a door above she know it be that of mr saffron 's bedroom where she have visit the old man she wait now with a sudden sense of suspense it be very quiet in the cottage beaumaroy be down again in a minute it be as i fear he say quietly he have get up again and go into the tower shall i try and get he out or will you -- i will go in with you of course mr beaumaroy he old mirthful yet rueful smile come on he lip -- just for a moment then he be grave and formal again this way then if you please dr arkroyd he say deferentially chapter xi the car behind the tree mr percy bennett that gentlemanly stranger be a enemy to delay both constitutionally and owe to experience averse from dally with fortune to he a bird in he hand be worth a whole aviary on he neighbor 's unrifled premise he think that beaumaroy might levant with the treasure at any moment that unwelcome though not unfamiliar tap on the shoulder with the word -lrb- gratify under quite other circumstance and from quite different lip -rrb- i want you might incapacitate he from prosecute he enterprise -lrb- he express this idea in more homely idiom -- less latinized be he language metaphorical indeed yet terse -rrb- finally he have that healthy distrust of he accomplice which be essential to success in a career of crime he think that sergeant hooper might not deliver the goods sergeant hooper demur he deprecate inconsiderate haste let the opportunity be choose he have serve under mr beaumaroy in france and -lrb- whatever fault major-general punnit might find with that officer -rrb- prefer that he should be off the premise at the moment when mr bennett and he himself make unauthorized entry thereon he be a hot ` un in a scrap say the sergeant sit in a public house at sprotsfield on boxing day evening mr bennett and sundry other excursionist from london be present my chauffeur will settle he say mr bennett it may seem odd that mr bennett should have a chauffeur but he have -- or propose to have -- _ pro hac vice _ -- or _ ad hoc _ for this particular job in fact without a car that stuff at tower cottage -- somewhere at tower cottage -- would be difficult to shift the sergeant demur still by no means for the sake of save beaumaroy 's skin but still purely for the reason already give yet he admit that he could not name any date on which he could guarantee beaumaroy 's absence from tower cottage he never leave the old blighter alone later than eleven o'clock or so and rarely as late as that then any night 's about the same say gentleman bennett and now for the scheme dear nco sergeant hooper despair of the door the house-door might possibly be negotiate though at the probable cost of arouse the notice of beaumaroy -- and of the old blighter himself but the door from the parlor into the tower offer insuperable difficulty it be always lock the lock be intricate he have never so much as see the key at close quarter and even have opportunity offer be quite unpractised in the art of take impression of lock -- a thing not do with accuracy quite so easily as seem sometimes to be assume for my own part say mr bennett with a nod i have always incline to the window we can negotiate that without any noise to speak of and it ought not to take we more than a few minute just deal board i expect perhaps the old gentleman and you pal beaumaroy -- the sergeant spat -- will sleep right through it if they be not in the tower itself suggest the sergeant gloomily wherever they may be say gentleman bennett with a touch of irritability -- he be himself a sanguine man and dislike a mind fertile in objection -- i suppose the stuff 's in the tower be not it it go in there and i have never see it come out mr bennett here at least a tone of confidence ring in the sergeant 's voice but where in the tower sergeant ` ow should i know i have never be in the bloom place it be really rather a queer business observe mr bennett allow himself for a moment a outside and critical consideration of the matter damned say the sergeant briefly but once inside we be bind to find it then -- with the car -- it be in london in forty minute and in ten more it be -- where it be go to be where that be need not worry you my dear sergeant what if we be see from the road urge the pessimistic sergeant there be never a job about which you can not put those question what if ludendorff have know just what foch be go to do sergeant at any rate anybody who see we be two mile either way from a police station -- and may be a lot farther if he try to interfere with we it be a hundred to one against anybody be on the road at that time of night we 'll pray for a dark night and dirty weather -- which so far as i have observe you generally get in this beastly neighborhood he lean forward and tap the sergeant on the shoulder bar accident let 's say this day week meanwhile neddy -- he smile as he interject neddy be we chauffeur -- neddy and i will make we little plan of attack do not be too generous do not leave all the vc chance to I the sergeant implore neddy 's fair glutton for 'em difficulty be to keep he from murder and he stand six foot four and weigh seventeen stone ill back he up -- from be'ind -- company in support grin the sergeant considerably comfort by this description of he coadjutor you 'll occupy the station assign to you my man say mr bennett with a admirable burlesque of the military manner the front be wherever a soldier be order to be -- a fine saying of lord kitchener 's remember it sergeant yes sir say the sergeant grin still he find mr bennett on the whole amusing company though occasionally rather alarming for instance there seem to he to be no particular reason for drag in neddy 's predilection for murder though of course a man of he inch and weight might commit murder through some trifling and pardonable miscalculation of force same as if that captain naylor hit you the sergeant reflect as he finish the ample portion of rum with which the conversation have be lighten he feel pleasantly muzzy and see mr bennett 's cleancut feature rather blur in outline however the sandy wig and red mustache which that gentleman wear -- in he character as a boxing day excursionist -- be still salient feature even to he eye anybody in the room would have be able to swear to they thus the date of the attack be settle and if only it have be adhere to thing might have fall out differently between doctor mary and mr beaumaroy event would probably have relieve mary from the necessity of present she ultimatum and she might never have hear that illuminating word morocco but big neddy the shover -- as he intimate friend be wont to call he -- be a man of pleasure as well as of business he be not a bloke in a office he like a ample christmas vacation and be now take one with a party of friend at brighton -- all tip-topper who do the thing in style and spend they money -lrb- which be not they money -rrb- lavishly from the attraction of this company -- not compose of gentleman only -- neddy refuse to be separate mr bennett who be on thorn at the delay could take it or leave it at that in any case the job be in neddy 's opinion -lrb- which he express with that massive but good-humored scorn which be a appanage of very large man -rrb- a leap in the dark a pig in a poke blind hookey for who really know how much of the stuff the old blighter and he pal have contrived to shift down to the cottage in the old brown bag sometimes it look light sometimes it look heavy sometimes perhaps it be full of brick in this mood neddy have to be humor even though gentlemanly mr bennett sit on thorn the sergeant repine less at the delay he like the pickings which the job bring he much better than the job itself stand in wholesome dread of beaumaroy it be rather with resignation than with joy that he receive from mr bennett the news that neddy have at last name the day that would suit he high mightiness -- Tuesday the 7th of January it be and as it chance the very day before beaumaroy be to start for morocco more accurately the attack would be deliver on the actual day of he departure -- if he go for it be time for one o'clock in the morning a hour at which the road across the heath might reasonably be expect to be clear of traffic this be a especially important point in view of the fact that the window of the tower face towards the road and be but four or five yard distant from it after a jovial dinner -- rather too jovial in mr bennett 's opinion but that be neddy 's only fault he would mix pleasure with business -- the two set out in a overland car mr bennett -- whom by the way he big friend neddy call mike and not percy as might have be expect -- assume he sandy wig and red mustache as soon as they be well start neddy scorn disguise for the moment but he have a mask in he pocket he also have a very nasty little club in the same pocket whereas mr bennett carry no weapon of offense -- merely the tool of he trade at which he be singularly expert the friend have work together before though neddy revile mike for a coward and mike aver with curse that neddy would bring they both to the gallows some day yet they work well together and have a respect for one another each allow for the other 's idiosyncrasy the true spirit of partnership on it alone can last and honorable success be build just match-board the sergeant say it be do he ask neddy break a long silence which indeed have last until they be across putney bridge and climb the hill yes and rotten at that it ought not to take two minute then there 'll be only the window of course we must have a look round first then if the coast 's clear i 'll nip in and shove something up against the door of the place while you be follow the sergeant 's to stay on guard at the door of the house so that we can not be take in the rear see righto then -- well we have get to find the stuff and when we have find it you have get to carry it neddy do not mind if it be a bit heavy do you i do not want to overstrain myself say neddy jocularly but i 'll do my best with it only hope it be there it must be there have not get wing have it at any rate not till you put it in you pocket and go out for a evening with the lady neddy pay this pleasantry the tribute of a laugh but he have one more business question to ask : where be we to stow the car how far off the sergeant have pick out a big clump of tree a hundred yard from the cottage on the sprotsfield side and about thirty yard from the road pretty clear go to it bar the bracken -- she 'll do it easily there she 'll lie snug as you like as we go by sprotsfield the car will not have to pass the cottage at all -- that be a advantage -- and yet it be not over far to carry the stuff sound all right say neddy placidly and with a yawn have a drop no i will not -- and i wish you would not neddy it make you bad-tempered and a man do not want to be bad-tempered on these job take the wheel a second while i have a drop say neddy just for all the world as if he friend have not speak he unscrew the top of a large flask and take a very considerable drop it be only after he have do this with great deliberation that he observe good-naturedly and you go to hell mike it be dark be not it that be a bit of all right he do not speak again till they be near sprotsfield this beaumaroy -- queer name be not it -- he be a big chap be not he mike pretty fair but lord love you a baby beside yourself well now you tell I something the sergeant say about a man as be -lrb- neddy unlike he friend occasionally trip in he english -rrb- really big oh that be naylor -- captain naylor but he be not at the cottage we be not likely to meet he praise be rather wish we be i want a little bit of exercise say neddy well i do not know but what beaumaroy might give you that the sergeant 's get tale about he at the war oh blast these soldier -- they be not no good in what he himself regard as he spare hour that be to say the daytime hour wherein the ordinary man labor neddy be a highly skilled craftsman whose only fail be a tendency to be late in the morning and to fall ill about the festive season of the year he make lens and in spite of the fail he work have be deem to be of national importance as indeed it be but that do not excuse he prejudice against soldier they pass through the outskirts of sprotsfield mike -- to use he more familiar name -- have make a thorough exploration of the place and he direction enable he chauffeur to avoid the central and populous part of the town then they come out on to the open heath pass old place and presently -- about half a mile from tower cottage -- find sergeant hooper wait for they by the roadside it be then hard on midnight -- a dark cloudy night very apt for they purpose with a nod but without a word the sergeant get into the car and in cautious whisper direct its course to the shelter of the clump of tree they reach it after a few hundred yard of smooth road and some thirty of bump over the heath it afford a perfect screen from the road and on the other side there be only untrodden heath no path or track be visible near it neddy get out of the car but he do not forget he faithful flask he offer it to the sergeant in token of approval good place sergeant he say do credit to you as a beginner here mate hold on though it be evident you be not accustom to liquor glass when i sit up so late i get a kind of a sink the sergeant explain apologetically mike flash a torch on he for a minute there be a very uncomfortable look in he little squinty eye sergeant he say suavely but gravely my friend here rely on you he be not a safe man to disappoint he shift the light suddenly on to neddy whose proportion seem to loom out prodigious from the surround darkness be you neddy no i be a sensitive chap i be say neddy smile do not you go and hurt my pride in you by any sign of weakness sergeant the sergeant shiver a little i be game i 'll stick it he protest valorously you would better neddy advise all quiet at the cottage as you come by ask mike quiet as the grave for what i see the sergeant answer all right mike where be they sandwich i feel like a bite one for the sergeant too but no more flask -- no you do not sergeant when 'll we start mike in about half-an-hour just nice time for a snack -- oyster and stout for you my darling say jovial neddy then -- with a change of voice -- just as well that do not pass we for the sound of a car come from the road they have just leave it be go in the direction of the cottage and of inkston captain alec be take he betrothed home after a joyful evening of congratulation and welcome chapter xii the secret of the tower the scene present by the interior of the tower when beaumaroy softly open the door and sign to doctor mary to step forward and look be indeed a strange one a ridiculous yet pathetic mockery of grandeur the building be a circular one rise to a height of some thirty-five foot and have a diameter of about ten up to about twelve foot from the floor its wall be drape with red and purple stuff of coarse material above they the bare brick and the rafter of the roof show naked in the middle of the floor with they back to the door at which mary and she companion stand be set two small armchair of plain and cheap make face they on a rough dais about three foot high and with two step lead up to it stand a large and deep carve oaken armchair it too be upholster in purple and above and around it be a canopy and curtain of the same color this strange erection be set with its back to the one window -- that which mr saffron have cause to be board up soon after he enter into occupation the place be light by candle -- two tall standard of a ecclesiastical pattern one on either side of the great chair or throne and each hold six large candle all of which be now alight and about half-consumed on the throne he spare waste figure set far back in the recess of its deep cushion seat and he foot rest on a high hassock sit old mr saffron in he right hand he grasp a scepter obviously a theatrical property but a handsome one of black wood with gilt ornamentation he left arm he hold close against he side he eye be turn up towards the room he lip be move as though he be talk but no sound come such be doctor mary 's first impression of the scene but the next moment she take in another feature of it not less remarkable to the left of the throne to she right as she stand in the doorway face it there be a fireplace a empty grate though the night be cold immediately in front of it be unmistakably the excavation in the floor which mr penrose have describe at the christmas dinner-party at old place -- six foot in length by three in breadth and about four foot deep against the wall close by stand a sheet of cast iron which evidently serve to cover and conceal the aperture by it be throw down in careless disorder a strip of the same dull red baize as cover the rest of the floor of the tower by the side of the sheet and the piece of carpet there be a old brown leather bag tradition and mr penrose have tell the truth here without doubt be captain duggle 's grave the grave he have cause to be dig for himself but which -- be the reason what it might -- he body have never occupy yet the tomb be not entirely empty the floor of it be strew with gold to what depth mary could not tell but it be cover with golden sovereign there must be thousand of they they gleam under the light of the candle mary turn startled inquire apprehensive eye on beaumaroy he press she arm gently and whisper : i 'll tell you presently come in he 'll notice we i expect in a minute mind you curtsey when he see you he lead she in pull the door to after he and place she and himself in front of the two small armchair opposite mr saffron 's throne beaumaroy remove he hand from she arm but she catch he wrist in one of hers and stand there hold on to he breathe quickly she eye now set on the figure on the throne the old man 's lip have cease to move he eye have close he lay back in the deep seat inert look half-dead very pale and waxen in the face for what seem a long time he sit thus motionless and almost without sign of life while the two stand side by side before he mary glance once at beaumaroy he lip be apart in that half humorous half compassionate smile there be no hint of impatience in he bearing at last mr saffron open he eye and see they there be intelligence in he look though he body do not move mary be conscious of a low bow from beaumaroy she remember the caution he have give she and herself make a deep curtsey the old man make a slight inclination of he handsome white head then after another long pause a movement pass over he body -- except he left arm she see that he be try to rise from he seat but that he have barely the strength to achieve he purpose but he persist in he effort and in the end rise slowly and tremulously to he foot then utterly without warn in a sudden and shocking burst of that high voluble metallic speech which captain alec have hear through the ceiling of the parlor he begin to address they if indeed it be they whom he address and not some phantom audience of prince marshal admiral or tremble sheep-like re emit it be difficult to hear the word hopeless to make out the sense it be a farrago of nonsense part of he own invent part -lrb- as it seem -rrb- wild and confused reminiscence of the publish speech of the man he ape all string together on some invisible thread of insane reasoning deliver with a mad vehemence and intensity that shake and seem to rend he feeble frame we must stop he we must stop he mary suddenly whisper he 'll kill himself if he go on like this i have never be able to stop he beaumaroy whisper back hush if he hear we speak he 'll be furious and carry on worse the old man 's blue eye fix themselves on beaumaroy -- of mary he take no heed he point at beaumaroy with he scepter and from he to the gleaming gold in captain duggle 's grave a streak of coherency a strand of mad logic now run through he hurtle word the money be there beaumaroy be to take it -- to-day to-day -- to take it to morocco to raise the tribe to set africa aflame he be to scatter it -- broadcast broadcast there be no end to it -- do not spare it there be million million of it he shout and achieve a weird wild majesty in a final cry god with we then he fall -- tumble back in utter collapse into the recess of the great chair he scepter fall from he nerveless hand and roll down the step of the dais the impetus it gather carry it roll still across the floor to the edge of the open pit for a instant it lay poise on the edge and then fall with a jangle of sound on the carpet of golden coin that line captain duggle 's grave quick get my bag -- i leave it in the passage whisper mary as she start forward up the dais to the old man 's side and brandy if you have get it she call after beaumaroy as he turn to the door to do she bidding beaumaroy be go no more than a minute when he come back with the bag hitch under he arm a decanter of brandy in one band and a glass in the other mary be lean over the throne with she arm round the old man he eye be open but he be inert and motionless beaumaroy pour out some brandy and give it into mary 's free hand but when mr saffron see beaumaroy by he side he give a sudden twist of he body wrench himself away from mary 's arm and fling himself on he trust friend hector i be in danger they be after I they 'll shut I up beaumaroy put he strong arm about the frail old body oh no sir oh no he say in low comforting half-bantering tone that be the old foolishness sir if i may so say you be perfectly safe with I you ought to trust I by now sir really you ought you swear you swear it be all right hector right as rain sir beaumaroy assure he cheerfully very feebly the old man move he right hand towards the open grave plenty -- plenty all yours hector for -- for the cause -- god 's with we he head fall forward on beaumaroy 's breast for a instant again he raise it and look in the face of he friend a smile come on he lip i know i can trust you i be safe with you hector he head fall forward again he whole body be relax he give a sigh of peace beaumaroy lift he in he arm and very gently set he back in he great chair place he foot again on the high footstool i think it be all over he say and mary saw tear in he eye then mary herself collapse she sink down on the dais and break into weep it have all be so pitiful and somehow so terrible she quick tumultuous sob sound through the place which the vibration of the old man 's voice have lately fill she feel beaumaroy 's hand on she shoulder you must make sure he say in a low voice you must make you examination with tremble hand she do it -- she force herself to it beaumaroy aid she there be no doubt life have leave the body which reason have leave long before he weakened heart have not endure the last strain of mad excitement the old man be dead she face show beaumaroy the result of she examination if he have ever doubt of it she look at he then make a motion of she hand towards the body we must -- we must -- she stammer the tear still roll down she cheek presently he say there be plenty of time you be not fit to do that now -- and no more be i to tell the truth we 'll rest for half a hour and then get he upstairs and -- and do the rest come with I he put he hand lightly within she arm he will rest quietly on he throne for a little while he be not afraid any more he be at rest still with he arm in mary 's he bent forward and kiss the old man on the forehead i shall miss you old friend he say then with gentle insistence he lead mary away they leave the old man prop up by the high stool on which he foot rest seat far back in the great chair hard by captain duggle 's grave where the scepter lay on a carpet of gold the tall candle burn on either side of he throne impart a far-off semblance of ceremonial state thus die unmarried in the seventy-first year of he age aloysius william saffron formerly of exeter surveyor and auctioneer he have run on the whole a creditable course start from small beginning and belong to a family more remarkable for eccentricity than for any solid merit he have build up a good practice he have make money and put it by he enjoy a good name for financial probity but he be hold to be a vain fussy self-important peacocky fellow very self-centered also and -lrb- as beaumaroy have indicate -rrb- impatient of the family and social obligation which most man recognize even though often unwillingly as the year gather upon he head these characteristic be intensify on the occasion of some trifling set-back in business -- a rival cut he out in a certain negotiation -- he throw up everything and disappear from he native town thenceforward nothing be hear of he there save that he write occasionally to he cousin sophium radbolt and she husband both of whom he most cordially hate whose claim to he notice regard or assistance he have of late year at least hotly resent yet he write to they -- write they vaunt and magniloquent letter hint darkly of great doings and great riches in spite of they opinion of he the radbolt come to believe perhaps half of what he say he be old and without other tie they thirst for he money be greedy undoubtedly the radbolt would dearly have love to get hold of he and -- somehow -- hold he fast when he come to tower cottage -- it be in the first year of the war -- he be precariously sane it be only gradually that he fundamental and constitutional vice and foible turn to a morbid growth first come intensify hatred and suspicion of the radbolt -- they be after he and he money then through hide process of mental distortion there grow the conviction that he be of high importance a great man the object of great conspiracy in which the odious radbolt be but instrument it be no doubt the course of public event culminate in the great war which give to he mania its special turn to he delusion its monstrous -lrb- but as doctor mary be aware by no means unprecedented -rrb- character by the time of he meeting with beaumaroy the delusion be complete through all the second half of 1918 he follow -- so far as he mind could now follow anything rationally -- in he own person and fortune the fate of the man whom he believe himself to be appropriate the hope the fear the imagine ambition the physical infirmity of that self-created other self but he wrap it all in deep secrecy for as the conviction of he true identity grow complete he fear be multiply radbolt indeed the whole of christendom -- principality and power -- be on he track they would shut he up kill he perhaps cunningly he hide he secret -- save what could not be entirely hide the physical deformity but he hide it with he shawl he never eat out of he own house the combination knife-and-fork be keep sedulously hide only to beaumaroy do he reveal the hidden thing and later on beaumaroy 's persuasion he let into the portentous secret one faithful servant -- beaumaroy 's unsavory retainer sergeant hooper he never accept hooper as more than a distasteful necessity -- somebody must wait on he and do he menial service he be not fear indeed for surely such a dog would not dare to be false but cordially dislike beaumaroy win he from the beginning whom he conceive he to be beaumaroy himself never know but he open he heart to he unreservedly of he he have no suspicion to he he look for safety and for the realization of he cherish dream beaumaroy soothe he terror and humor he in all thing -- what be the good of do anything else ask beaumaroy 's philosophy he love beaumaroy far more than he have love anybody except himself in all he life at the end through the wild tangle of mad imagining there run this golden thread of human affection it give the old man hour of peace sometimes almost of sanity so he come to he death directly indeed of a long-standing organic disease yet veritably self-destroyed and so he sit now dead amidst he shabby parody of splendor he have do with throne he have even do with tower cottage -- unless indeed he pale shade be to hold nocturnal converse with the robust and flamboyant ghost of captain duggle the one vaunt he unreal vanish greatness mouthing oration and mimic pomp the other tell in language garnish with strange and horrible oath of those dark and lurid terror which once have drive he from this very place leave it ablaze behind a strange couple they would make and strange would be they conversation yet the tenement which have house the old man 's deranged spirit empty as now it be -- aye emptier than duggle 's tomb -- be still to be witness of one more earthly scene and unwittingly bear part in it chapter xiii right of conquest what have be relate of mr saffron 's life before he ascend the throne on which he still sit in the tower represent all that beaumaroy know of he old friend before they meet -- indeed he know scarcely as much he tell the brief story to doctor mary in the parlor she hear he listlessly all that be not much to the point on which she thought be set and do not answer the riddle which the scene in the tower put to she she be calm now -- and ashamed that she have ever lose she calmness well there be the situation as i understand it when i take on the job -- or quite soon afterwards he think that he be be pursue in a sense he be if these radbolt find out the truth they certainly would pursue he try to shut he up and prevent he from make away with he money or leave it to anybody else i do not at all know at first what a tidy lot he have he hate the radbolt even after he cease to know they as cousin he remain very conscious of they always they be enemy spy secret service people on he track -- poor old boy well why should they have he and he money i do not see it i do not see it to this day mary be in mr saffron 's armchair beaumaroy stand before the fire she look up at he they seem to have more right than anybody else and you know -- you know -- that he be mad he be mad give they no right oh well it be no use argue in the end i suppose they have rights -- of a kind a right by law i suppose -- though i never know the law and do not want to -- to shut the old man up and make he damned miserable and get the money for themselves that sound just the sort of right the law do give people over other people -- because aunt betsy marry uncle john fifty year ago and be probably infernally sorry for it mary smile a matter of principle with you be it mr beaumaroy no -- instinct i think it be my instinct to be against the proper thing the regular thing the thing that deal hardly with a individual in the name of some highly nebulous general principle like discipline she put in with a reminiscence of major-general punnit he nod yes that be one case of it and then the situation amuse I i think that have more to do with it than anything else at first it amuse I to play up to he delusion i suggest the shawl as useful on we walk -- and thereby get he to take wholesome exercise that ought to appeal to you doctor i get he the combination knife-and-fork that make he enjoy he meal -- also good for he doctor but i do not do these thing because they be good for he but because they amuse I they never amuse hooper he be a dull surly and -- i be inclined to believe -- treacherous dog who be he sack from the army -- send to quod just a jail-bird whom i have keep loose but the thing do amuse I and it be that at first but then -- he pause look at he again mary see a whimsical tenderness express in he eye and smile the poor chap be so overwhelmingly grateful he think I the one indubitably faithful adherent that he have and so i be too -- though not in the way he think and he trust I absolutely well be i to give he up -- to the law and the radbolt and the jailer of a asylum -- a man who trust I like that but he be mad object doctor mary obstinately a man have he feeling or may have even when he be mad he trust I and he love I doctor mary will not you allow that i have my case -- so far she make no sign of assent well then i love he -- do that go any better with you if it do not i be in a bad way be cause what i be give you now be the strong part of my case i do not see why you should put what you call you case to I at all mr beaumaroy he look at she in a reproachful astonishment but you seem touch by -- by what we see in the tower i think the old man 's death and faith have appeal to you it seem to I that people can not go through a thing like that together without feeling -- well some sort of comradeship but if you have no sort of feeling of that kind -- well i do not want to put my case go on with you case say doctor mary after a moment 's silence though it be not really that i want to put a case for myself at all but i do not mind own that i would like you to understand about it -- before i clear out she look at he questioningly but put no speak question beaumaroy sit down on the stool opposite to she and poke the fire i can not get away from it can i there be something else you see in the tower be not there and i dare say that you connect it with a conversation that we have together a little while ago well i 'll tell you about that oh well of course i must must not i i should like to hear she bitterness be go he have come now to the riddle he be a king to himself beaumaroy resume thoughtfully but in fact i be king over he i could do anything i like with he i have he i possess he -- by right of conquest the right of conquest seem a big thing to I it be about the only sort of right that i would see anything of for three year and more yes it be -- and be -- a big thing a real thing -- the one right in the whole world that there be no doubt about other rights be theory view preachment right of conquest be a fact i have it i could make he do what i like say what i like sign what i like do you begin to see where i find myself i say find myself because really it be a surprise to I at first i think he be in a pretty small way -- he only give I a hundred a year besides my keep true he always talk of he money but i set that down mainly to he delusion but it be true that he have a lot -- really a lot a good bit besides what you see in there he must have speculate cleverly i think he could not have make it all in he business doctor mary how much gold do you think there be in the grave in there i have not the least idea thousand where do you get it oh yes thousand -- and thousand we get it mostly from the alien in the east end they would hoard it you know but they be willing to sell at a premium the premium rise up to last month then it drop a little -- not much though because we would exhaust some of the most obvious source i carry every sovereign of that money in the grave down from london in my brown bag he smile reflectively do you know how much a thousand sovereign weigh doctor mary i have not the least idea say mary again she be lean forward now listen intently and watch beaumaroy 's face with absorb interest seventeen and three-quarter pound avoirdupois -- that be the correct weight the first time or two we do not get much -- they be still shy of we but after that we make some heavy haul twice we bring down close on two thousand once there be three thousand almost to a sovereign even man train to the work -- bullion porter as they call they at the bank of england -- reckon five bag of a thousand canvas bag not much short of a foot long and six inch across you know -- they reckon five of they a full load -- and would not care to go far with they either the equivalent of three of they be quite enough for I to carry from inkston station up to the cottage -- try to look as if i be carry nothing of any account one have not get to pretend to be carry nothing in full march kit -- nor to carry it all in one hand and he would never trust himself in a cab -- might be kidnap you see i do not know exactly but from what he say i reckon we have bring down on we Wednesday trip about two-third of all he have now you have probably gather what he idea be he know he be disguise as saffron -- and very proud of the way he live up to the character as saffron he realize the money by driblet -- turn he security into note he note into gold but he would lose all knowledge that the money be he own -- make by himself -- himself saffron he think it be save out of the wreck of he imperial fortune it be to be dedicate to restore the imperial cause he himself could not attempt at present to get out of england least of all carry pot of gold coin but he believe that i could i be to go to morocco and so on and raise the country for he take as much as i could and come back for more he have no doubt at all of my come back in fact it would not have be much easier for I to get out of the country with the money than it would have be for the authentic kaiser himself but doctor mary what would have be possible be for I to go somewhere else or even back to the place we know of for no question be ask there -- put that money back into note or security in my own name and tell he i have carry out the morocco program he have no sense of time he would have suspect nothing that would have be mere and sheer robbery say mary oh yes it would beaumaroy agreed and if i would do it and desert he i should have deserve to be hang that be hardly my question as long as he live i mean to stick by he but he be turn seventy frail with heart-disease and as i understand quite likely to sink into general paralysis well if i be to exercise my right of conquest and get the fruit of conquest two way seem open there could be a will you 'll remember my consult you on that point and you reply do he make a will ask mary quickly no a will be open to serious objection even suppose you evidence -- which of course i want in case of need -- have be satisfactory a fight with the radbolt would have be unpleasant worse than that -- as long as i live i should have be blackmail by sergeant hooper who know mr saffron 's condition though he do not know about the money here even before you find out about my poor old friend i have decide against a will -- though perhaps i might have square the radbolt by just take this little place -- and its contents -- and let they take the rest that too become impossible after you discovery there remain then the money in the tower i could make quite sure of that wait for he death and then enjoy it and upon my word why should not i he would have be much gratify by my go to morocco and he would certainly much sooner that i have the money -- if it could not go to morocco -- than that the radbolt should get it that be the way the question present itself to I and i be a poor man with no obvious career before I the right of conquest appeal to I strongly doctor mary i can see that you may have be greatly tempt say mary in a grave and troubled voice and the circumstance do enable you to make excuse for what you think of do excuse you will not even go so far as to call it a doubtful case one that a casuist could argue either way beaumaroy be smile again now even if i do man of -- yes doctor mary -- of sensitive honor decide doubtful case against themselves in money matter oh i say be that doctrine current in business circle i have be in business myself and i doubt it they do -- man of real honor mary persist so that be how great fortune be make that be how individual -- to say nothing of nation -- rise to wealth and power and i never know it beaumaroy reflect in a gentle voice he eye catch mary 's and she give a little laugh by decide doubtful case against themselves dear I yes i do not say they rise to greatness and power then the people who do rise to greatness and power -- and the nation -- do not they go by right of conquest doctor mary do not they decide case in they own favor do you really mean to -- to take the money i 'll tell you as near as i can i mean to do my best for my old man i mean he to live as long as he could and to live free unpersecuted as happy as he could be make i mean that because i love he and he love I well i have lose he i be alone in the world the last word be no appeal to mary for the moment he seem to have forget she he be speak out of he own heart to himself yet the word thereby touch she to a livelier pity you be very lonely when there be nobody to whom you have affection 's right to complain of loneliness but after that if i see he to he end in peace if i bring that off well then i rather think that i should have stick to the money yes i rather think so you have manage to mix thing up so mary complain you devotion to mr saffron -- for that i could forgive you keep he secret and fooling I and all of we but then you mix that up with the money it be mix up with it i do not do the mix what be you go to do now she ask with a sudden curiosity oh now now the thing 's all different you have see you know and even i can not offer you a partnership in the cash can i if i be not a infernally poor conspirator i should have cover up the captain 's grave and make everything neat and tidy before i come to fetch you because i know he might go back to the tower on he bad night he always make I open the grave and spread out the money make a show of it you know then it have to be put back in bag -- the money bag live in the brown leather bag -- and the grave have to be fasten down altogether it be a good bit of work i would just get it open and the money spread out when he turn bad -- a sort of collapse like the one you see and i be so busy get he to bed that i forget the cursed grave and the money -- just as i forget to put away the knife-and-fork before you call the first time and you see through I if you be not a good conspirator it be another reason for not conspire mr beaumaroy i know you conspire for he first of all but -- well he be safe he be at peace it can all come out now and it must you know and you must tell the truth i do not know whether they can put I in prison i should hardly think they would bother if they get the money all right in any case i do not care much lord what a lot of people 'll say ' i tell you so -- bad egg that beaumaroy ' no i do not care my old man 's safe i have win my big game after all doctor mary i do not believe you care about the money really she cry that really be a game to you i think a trick you like to play on we respectable he smile at she confidentially i do like beat the respectable he admit then he look at he watch i must do what have to be do for the old man but it be late -- hard on one o'clock you must be tire -- and it be a sad job no i 'll help you i -- i have be in hospital you know only do go first and cover up that horrible place and hide that wretched money before i go into the tower will you she give a shiver as she imagination renew the scene which the tower hold you need not come into the tower at all he be as light as a feather -- i have lift he into bed often i can lift he now if you really wish to help will you go up to he room and get thing ready as he speak he cross to the sideboard take up a bedroom candlestick and light it from one that stand on the table and you 'll see about the body be take to the mortuary will not you i shall communicate with the radbolt -- fully they 'll take charge of the funeral i suppose well he will not know anything about that now thank god there be the slightest tremor in he voice as he speak mary do not take the candle i have say some hard thing to you mr beaumaroy i dare say i have sound very self-righteous he raise he hand in protest but she go on : so i should like to say one different thing to you since we be to part after to-night you have show yourself a good friend good and true as a man could have i love my old man say beaumaroy it be he only plea to mary it seem a good one he have love he poor old madman and he have serve he faithfully yes the old man find a good friend in you i hope you will find good friend too oh i do hope it because that be what you want i should be very glad if i could think that in spite of everything i have find one here in this place -- even although she can be a friend only in memory mary pause for a moment then give he she hand i know you much better after tonight my memory of you will be a kind one now to we work yes -- and thank you i thank you more deeply than you imagine he give she the candle and follow she to the passage you know where the room be i shall put the -- the place -- straight and then bring he up i sha 'n' t be many minute -- ten perhaps the cover 's rather hard to fit mary nod from the top of the stair strain by the event of the night and by the talk to beaumaroy she be again near tear she eye be bright in the light of the candle and tell of nervous excitement beaumaroy go back into the parlor on he way to the tower suddenly he stop and stand dead still listen intently mary busy herself upstairs make she preparation with practice skill and readiness she agitation do not interfere with she work -- there she training tell -- but of she inner mind it have full possession she be afraid to be alone -- there in that cottage she long for another clasp of that friendly hand well he would come soon but he must bring he burden with he when she have finish what she have to do she sit down and wait beaumaroy wait too outside the door lead to the tower chapter xiv the scepter in the grave sergeant hooper take up he appoint position on the flag path that lead up to the cottage door he primary task be to give warn if anybody should come out of the door a secondary one be to give the alarm in case of interruption by passer-by on the road -- a unlikely peril this latter in view of the hour the darkness of the night and the practice noiselessness with which mike might be rely upon to do he work here then the sergeant be leave after be accord another nip from the flask -- which however neddy keep in he own hand this time -- and a whisper but vigorously word exhortation to keep up he courage neddy the shover and gentlemanly mike tiptoe off to the window on the right hand side of the door as one approach the house from the road the bottom of the window be about seven foot from the ground neddy bent down and offer he broad back as a platform to he companion mike mount thereon and begin he work that in itself be child 's play to he the matchboarding be but lightly nail on the fastening come away in a moment under the skillful application of he instrument the window sash behind be not even bolt for the bolt have perish with time and have not be replace so far very good but at this early point mike receive he first surprise he could not see much of the interior a tall curtain stretch across the entire breadth of the window distant about two foot from it but he could see that the room be light up very cautiously he complete he work on the matchboarding hand down each plank to neddy when he have detach it then he cut out a pane of glass -- it be all abc to he -- put he hand in and raise the sash a little then it be simple to push it up from below but the sash have not be raise for year it stick when it yield to he effort it give a loud creak he fling one leg over the window-sill and sit poise there listen the room be light up but if there be anyone in it he must be asleep or very hard of hearing or that creak would have arouse he attention release from he office as a support neddy rise and haul himself up by he arm till he could see in the window light he whisper mike nod and get in -- on the dais behind the curtain neddy scramble up after he find some help from a stunt but sturdy old apple tree that grow against the wall now they be both inside behind the tall curtain come on mike whisper we must see if there be anybody here and if there be not put out the light for on either side of the curtain there be room for a streak of light which might by chance be see from the road mike advance round the left-side edge of the curtain he have perceive by now that it form the back of some structure though he could not yet see of what nature the structure be nor be he now examine for as he step out on the dais at the side of the canopy he eye be engross by another feature of this strange apartment he stretch back he hand and catch hold of neddy 's brawny arm pull he forward see that -- that hole neddy for the moment they forget the light they forget the possibility of a occupant of the room -- which indeed be save for they own whisper absolutely still they stand look at the strange hole and then into one another 's face for a few seconds then they steal softly nearer to it that be a blast funny ` ole breathe neddy look 's like a bloke 's -- mike 's finger squeeze he arm tighter evidently again claim he attention my hat we need not look far for the stuff he whisper a uneasy whisper it be the whole place look queer and that hole be uncanny -- it have its contents yet they approach nearer they come to the edge and stand look in as though he could not believe the mere sight of he eye big neddy crouch down reach out he hand and take up mr saffron 's scepter with a look of half-scared amazement he hold it up for he companion 's inspection mike eye it uneasily but he thought be get back to business he steal softly off to the door with intent to see whether it be lock he stoop down to examine it and perceive that it be not it would be well then to barricade it and he turn round to look for some heavy bit of furniture suitable for he purpose something that would delay the entrance of a intruder and give they notice of the interruption as he turn he body suddenly stiffen only he trained instinct prevent he from cry out there be a occupant of the room -- there in the great chair between the tall candlestick on the dais a old man sit -- half lay -- there asleep it seem he eye be shut the color of he face strike gentleman mike as be peculiar but everything in that place be peculiar like a great tomb -- a bloom mausoleum -- the whole place be though he have the reputation of be a _ esprit fort _ mike feel uncomfortable cold and clammy too the beastly place be still -- business be business let the matter of the unlock door wait for the moment he begin to steal catlike across the floor towards the dais he have to investigate also he really ought to put out those candle it be utterly unprofessional to leave they alight but he could not conquer a feeling that the place would seem still more peculiar when they be put out big neddy 's eye have not follow he comrade to the door they have be hold by the queer hole and its queer contents -- by the gleaming gold that strew its floor by the mock symbol of majesty which he have lift from it and still hold in he hand by the oddly suggestive shape and dimension of the hole itself but now he raise he eye from these thing and look across at mike mutely ask what he think of matter he see mike steal across the floor look very very hard at -- something mute as neddy 's inquiry be mike seem somehow aware of it he raise he hand as though to enjoin silence and then point it in front of he raise to the level of he head neddy turn round to look in the direction indicate he see the throne and its silent occupant -- the waxen-faced old man who sit there seem to preside over the scene whose head be turn towards he whose close eye would open directly on he face if they lid be lift neddy fear no living man so he be accustom to boast and with good warrant but be that man live how come he up there and what have he to do with the queer-shaped hole that have all that gold in it and the thing he hold in he own hand do that belong to the old man up there have he fling it into the hole or -lrb- odd fancy begin to assail big neddy -rrb- have he leave it behind he when he get out and would he by chance come down to look for it mike 's hand stretch out from he body towards he friend now again enjoin silence he be at the foot of the dais he be go up its step he be no good in a scrap but he have a nerve in some thing he be up the step now and lean forward he be look hard in the old man 's face he own be close to it he lay hold of one of the old man 's arm it happen to be that left arm of mr saffron 's lift it and let it fall again it fall back just in the position from which he have lift it then he straighten himself up look a trifle green perhaps but reassure and call out to mike in a penetrate whisper he be a stiff un all right yes but then what of the grave because it be a grave and nothing else there be no get away from it what of the grave and what about the scepter and what be mike go to do now he be tiptoe to the edge of the dais he be move towards one of the high candlestick the top of which be a little below the level of he head as he stand raise on the dais beside the throne he lean forward towards the candle he intent be obvious but big neddy be not mind that he should carry it out could not suffer he to do it with the light of the candle -- well at all event you could see what be happen you could see where you be and where anybody else be but in the dark -- leave to torch which illuminate only bit of the place and which perhaps you might not switch on in time or turn in the right direction if you be leave like that anybody might be anywhere and on to you before you know it let they light alone mike he whisper hoarsely i 'll smash you ` ead in if you put they light out mike have conquer he own fit of nerve not without some exercise of will and have not give any notice to he companion 's which be considerably more acute perhaps the constant use of that roomy flask have contribute to that though lack of a liberal education -lrb- such as mike have enjoy and misuse -rrb- must also bear its share of responsibility he be amaze at this violent and threatening interruption he give a funny little skip backwards on the dais he heel come thereby in contact with the high hassock on which mr saffron 's foot rest the hassock be shift one foot fall from it on to the dais and mr saffron 's body fall a little forward from out of the deep recess of he great chair to big neddy 's perturb imagination it look as if mr saffron have set one foot upon the floor of the dais and be go to rise from he seat perhaps to come down from the dais to come nearer to he grave -- to ask for he scepter it be too much for neddy he shudder he could not help it and the scepter drop from he hand it fall from he hand back into the grave again under its impact the gold coin in the grave again jangle beaumaroy have by this time be stand close outside the door for about two minute he have light a cigarette from the candle on the parlor table the sound that he think he hear be not conclusive creak and crack do sometimes come from the boarded-up window and the rafter of the roof but the sound of the jangling gold be conclusive it must be due in some way to human agency and in the circumstance human agency must mean a thief beaumaroy 's mind leap to the sergeant ten to one it be the sergeant he have long be after the secret he have at last sniff it out and be help himself it seem to beaumaroy a disgusting thing to do with the dead man sit there but that be sentiment sentiment be not to be expect of the sergeant and disgusting thing be then he suddenly recall alec naylor 's story of the two man one tall and slight one short and stumpy who have reconnoiter tower cottage the sergeant have a accomplice no doubt he listen again he hear the scrape of metal on metal as when a man gather up coin in he hand out of a heap yet he stand where he be smoke still thought be pass rapidly through he brain and they bring a smile to he lip let they take it why not it be no care to he now doctor mary have to tell the truth about it and so consequently have he himself it belong to the radbolt oh damn the radbolt he would have risk he life for it if the old man have live but he be not go to risk he life for the radbolt let the rascal get off with the stuff or as much as they could carry he be all right doctor mary could testify that he have not take it let they carry off the infernal stuff incidentally he would be well rid of the sergeant and free from any of he importunity from whine and threat alike it be not a unimportant if a minor consideration yet it be a disgusting thing to do -- it certainly be and the sergeant would think that he have score a triumph over he benefactor too he protector beaumaroy reflect with a satiric smile the sergeant certainly deserve a fright -- and if possible a lick these administer he could be kick out perhaps -- oh yes poor brute -- with a handful of the radbolt ' money they would never miss it as they do not know how much there be and such a diversion of they legal property in no way trouble beaumaroy 's conscience and the accomplice he shrug he shoulder the sergeant be as he well know from he military experience of that worthy man a arrant coward he would show no fight if the accomplice do beaumaroy be quite in the mood to oblige he but while he tackle one fellow the other might get off with the money -- with as much as he could carry for all that it be merely radbolt money now in the end beaumaroy could not stomach the idea of that -- the idea that either of the dirty rogue in there should get off with the money and it be foolish to attack they on the front on which they expect to be attack quickly he mind form another plan he turn steal softly out of the parlor and along the passage towards the front door of the cottage after neddy have drop mr saffron 's scepter into captain duggle 's grave -lrb- have he know that it be captain duggle 's and not be a prey to the ridiculous but haunt fancy that it have be destine for or even -- oh these errant fancy -- already occupy by mr saffron himself neddy would have be less agitate -rrb- mike deal with he roundly in bitter hissing whisper and in language suit thereto he point out the folly of vain superstition of childish fear and sick imagining which interfere with business and threaten its success he eloquent reasoning combine with a lively desire to get out of the place as soon as possible so far work on neddy that he produce the sack which he have bring with he and hold its mouth open though with tremble hand while mike scrape up handful after handful of gold coin and pour they into it they be busily engage on they joint task as beaumaroy steal along the passage and reach the front door again stand listen the sergeant be still keep he vigil before the door he have no doubt that it be lock do not beaumaroy see mr wiles and himself out of it every evening -- the back door to the little house lead only on to the heath behind and give no direct access to the road -- and lock it after they with a squeak key he would have warn enough if anyone turn the key now he be look towards the road a surprise be more possible from that quarter he back be towards the door and only a very little way from it but when beaumaroy have enter with doctor mary he have not re-locked the door he open it now very gently and cautiously and see the sergeant 's back -- there be no mistake it without let he surprise -- for he have confidently suppose the sergeant to be in the tower -- interfere with the instant action call for by the circumstance he fling out he long right arm catch the sergeant round the neck with a throttle grip and drag he backwards into the house the man be incapable of cry out no sound escape from he which could reach the tower beaumaroy set he softly on the floor of the passage if you stir or speak i 'll strangle you he whisper there be enough light from the passage lamp to enable the sergeant to judge by the expression of he face that he speak sincerely the sergeant do not dare even to rub he throat though it be feel very sore and uncomfortable there be a row of peg on the passage wall just inside the door on they among hat cap and coat -- and also mr saffron 's gray shawl -- hang two long neck-scarf comforter that the keen heath wind make very acceptable on a walk beaumaroy take they and tie he prisoner hand and foot he have just complete this operation in the workmanlike fashion which he have learn on service when he hear a footstep on the stair look up he see doctor mary standing there she waiting in the room above have seem long to she she ear have be expect the sound of beaumaroy 's tread as he mount the stair laden with he burden that sound have not come instead there have be the soft just audible plop of the sergeant 's body as it drop on the floor of the passage it occur to she that beaumaroy have perhaps have some mishap with he burden or find difficulty with it she be come downstairs to offer she help see what she see now she stand still in surprise beaumaroy look up at she and smile no cause for alarm he say but i have get to go out for a minute keep a eye on this rascal will you oh and doctor mary if he try to move or untie himself just take the parlor poker and hit he over the head thanks you do not mind de you and you sergeant remember what i say with these word beaumaroy slip out of the door and softly close it behind he chapter xv a normal case when captain alec bring he _ fiance _ home after the dinner of welcome and congratulation at old place it be nearly twelve o'clock jeanne however -- in these day a radiant jeanne very different from the mournful creature who have accompany captain cranster 's victim to inkston a few week before -- be sit up for she mistress and since she have to perform this duty -- which be sweeten by the hope of receive exciting confidence for surely that affair be march -- it have be agree between she and the other maid that she should sit up for the doctor also she tell the lover that doctor mary have be call for by mr beaumaroy and have go out with he presumably to visit he friend mr saffron it do not occur to either of they to ask when mary have set out they contented themselves with exchange a glance of disapproval what a pity that mary should have anything more to do with this mr saffron and he beaumaroy however there be a bright side to it this time it would be kind of cynthium to sit up for mary and minister to she a cup of tea which jeanne should prepare and it would be pleasant -- and quite permissible -- for captain alec to bear she company mary could not be long surely it grow late so for a while they think no more of mary -- as be natural enough they have so much to talk about the whole of a new and very wonderful life to speculate about and to plan the whole of they past acquaintance to review old doubt have to be confess and laugh at the inevitability of the whole thing from the first beginning have to be recognize proved and exhibit in this sweet discourse the minute fly by unmarked and would have go on fly have not jeanne reappear of she own accord to remark that it really be very late now do mademoiselle think that possibly anything could have happen to doctor arkroyd by jove it be late cry the captain look at he watch it be past one cynthium be amaze to hear that he must be very ill that old gentleman jeanne opine and poor doctor arkroyd will be very tired she will find the walk across the heath very fatiguing walk jeanne do not she take the car cry cynthium surprised no the doctor have not take the car she have start to walk with mr beaumaroy the parlormaid have certainly tell jeanne that i tell you what say the captain i 'll just tool along to tower cottage i 'll look out for doctor mary on the road and give she a lift back if i meet she if i do not i can stop at the cottage and get beaumaroy to tell she that i be there and can wait to bring she home as soon as she be ready you would better go to bed cynthium jeanne tactfully disappear and the lover say good-night after alec 's departure jeanne receive the anticipated confidence that departure almost synchronize with two event at tower cottage the first be beaumaroy 's exit from the front door leave mary in charge of he prisoner who consequently be unable to keep any watch on the road or to warn he principal of approach danger the second be big neddy 's declaration that in he opinion the sack now hold about as much as he could carry he raise it from the floor in he two hand must weight a ` undred pound or more he reckon that mean a lot of money a fat lot of money he terror have begin to wear off since nothing of a supernatural or even creepy order have actually happen he have at last even agree to the candle be put out still he would be glad to be off enough be as good as a feast as the sayin ' go mike he chuckle mike have fit a new battery into he torch it shine brightly on neddy and on the sack whose mouth neddy be now tie up i might fill my pocket too he suggest eye the very respectable amount of sovereign which still remain in captain duggle 's tomb do not do it old lad neddy advise if we ` ave to get out or anything of that kind you do not want to jingle as if you be a glass chandelier do you mike admit the cogency of the objection and they agree to be off mike start for the window i 'll just pick up the sergeant he say and signal you ` all clear ' then you follow out no mike say neddy slowly but very decisively if you do not mind it be go to be I as get out of that window first i be not a man of you eddication and -- well blast I if i be go to be leave in this place alone with -- that there he motion with he head back over he shoulder towards where silent mr saffron sit you be a bloom ass neddy but have it you own way only let I see the coast 's clear first he steal to the window and look around he assume that the sergeant be at he post but all the same he want to have a look at the road himself so he have and the result be satisfactory it be hardly to be expect that he should scrutinize the ground immediately under the window at any rate he do not think of that it be as beaumaroy have conjecture from another direction from the parlor that he anticipate a possible attack there all be quiet he come back and report to neddy that the moment be favorable i 'll switch off the torch though just in case you can feel you way keep to the edge of the step do not knock up against -- i 'll take damned good care not to mutter neddy with a little shiver he make he way to the window through the darkness have sling he sack over he shoulder and hold it with he right hand while with the leave he guide himself up the dais and along its outside edge give as wide a berth as possible to the great chair and its encircle canopy with a sigh of relief he find the window move the sack from he shoulder and set it on the ledge for a moment but it be awkward to get down from the window hold that heavy sack he lower it towards the ground so that it might land gently and just as he let it go he turn he head back and whisper to mike all serene get a move on half a minute answer mike as he in he turn set out to grope he way to the window but he be not so cautious as he friend have be in he progress he kick the tall footstool sharply with one of he foot neddy lean back from the window ask quickly and again very nervously what the devil 's that beaumaroy could not resist the opportunity thus offer to he he be crouch on the ground not exactly under the window but just to the right of it neddy 's face be turn away he throw himself on to the bag rise to he foot raise it cautiously and hold it in front of he with both he hand -- its weight be fully as much as he could manage -- be round the curve of the tower and out of sight with it in a instant at the back of the house there be a space of ground where mr wiles grow a few vegetable for the household 's use it be a clearing make from the heath but it be not enclose beaumaroy be able to reach the back entrance by which this patch of ground could be enter from the kitchen just by the kitchen door stand that useful thing a butt for rainwater it stand some three or three-and-a-half foot high and it be full to the brim almost with a fresh effort beaumaroy raise the sack to the level of he breast then he lower it into the water not drop it for fear of a splash but immerse both he arm above the elbow only when he feel the weight off they as the sack touch bottom do he release he hold then with cautious step he continue he progress round the house and come to the other side crouch close by the wall again and wait where he be now he could see the fence that separate the front garden from the road and he be not more than ten or twelve foot from the front door on he left as he huddle down there he could not repress a smile of amusement even of self-congratulation however he turn to the practical job of squeeze the water out of he sleeve in thus congratulating himself he be premature he action have be base on a miscalculation he have hear only neddy 's last exclamation not the cautious whisper previously exchange between he and mike he think that the man astride the window-sill himself have kick something and instinctively exclaim what the devil 's that he think that the sack be lower from the window in order to be commit to the temporary guardianship of the sergeant who be doubtless look out for it and if he have he ear open would hear its gentle thud perhaps the man in the tower be collect a second instalment of booty heavy as the sack be it do not contain all that he know to be in captain duggle 's grave be that as it might the man would climb out of the window soon and he would fail to find he sack what would he do then he would signal or call to the sergeant or if they have a preconcerted rendezvous he would betake himself there expect to find he accomplice he would neither get a answer from he nor find he of course equally of course he would look for he but the last place where he would expect to find he -- the last place he would search -- would be where the sergeant in fact be the house itself if in he search for hooper he find beaumaroy it would be man to man and now again beaumaroy have no objection but in fact there be two man in the tower -- one of they big neddy and the function which beaumaroy suppose to have be intrust to the sergeant have never be assign to he at all to guard the door and the road have be he only task when they find the bag go and the sergeant too they might well think that the sergeant have betray they that he have go off on he own account or that he have at the last moment under a impulse of fear or a calculation of interest change side and join the garrison in the house if he have go off with the sack he could not have go fast or far with it fail to overtake he they might turn back to the cottage for they know themselves to be in superior force beaumaroy be in greater danger than he know -- and so be doctor mary in the house big neddy let himself down from the window and put down he hand to lift up the sack he grope about for it for some seconds during which time mike also climb over the window-sill and drop on to the ground below neddy emit a low but strenuous oath the sack 's go mike he add in a whisper go rot can not be what do you mean neddy i drop it straight ` ere it be go neddy persist the sergeant must ` ave take it no business of he where be the fool mike 's voice be already uneasy thief themselves seldom believe in there be honor among they you stay here i 'll go to the door and see if he be there he be just about to put this purpose into execution -- in which event it be quite likely that beaumaroy hear he approach or he call to the sergeant would have spring out upon he only to find himself assail the next instant by another and far more formidable antagonist in the person of big neddy and thus in sore peril of he life -- when the hum of captain alec 's engine become audible in the distance the next moment the light of he car become visible to all the man in the little front garden of the cottage hist wait till that be go by whisper neddy yes and get round to the back get out of sight round here he draw neddy round the curve of the tower wall till he big frame be hide by it then he himself crouch down under the wall with he head cautiously protrude the night have grow clearer it be possible to see figure at a distance of some yard now beaumaroy also perceive the car whose it be and the explanation of its appearance even occur to he mind but he keep still he do not want visitor he conceive he hand to be a better one than it really be and prefer to play it by himself if the car pass by well and good only if it stop at the gate would he have to take action it do stop at the gate mike see it stop then its engine be shut off and a man get out of it and come up to the garden gate though the watch mike have never see he before he have little difficulty in guess who he be and he remember something that the sergeant have say about he of a certainty it be the redoubtable captain naylor through the darkness he loom enormous as tall as big neddy himself and no whit less broad a powerful reinforcement for the garrison and what would the sergeant do if he be still at he post by the door -- with or without that miss that all-important sack another tall figure come into mike 's view -- from where he could not distinctly see it hardly seem to be from the door of the cottage for no light show and there be no sound of a opening door but it appear from somewhere near there it be on the path and it move along to the gate in a leisurely unhurried approach a man with he hand in he pocket -- that be what it look like this must be the garrison this must be the sergeant 's friend master protector and _ bte noire _ he boomery but the sergeant himself where be he he could hardly be at he post or beaumaroy and he must have see one another must have take some heed of one another something must have pass between they either friendly or hostile mike turn round and whisper hastily close into neddy 's ear neddy crawl a little forward and put he own bullet head far enough round the curve of the wall to see the meeting between the garrison and its unexpected reinforcement beaumaroy hand in pocket lounge nonchalantly down to the gate he open it the captain enter the two shake hand and stand there apparently in conversation the word do not reach the ear of the listener but the sound of voice do -- voice hush in tone once beaumaroy pointed to the house both mike and neddy mark the outstretched hand be beaumaroy tell he companion about something that have be happen at the house be they concoct a plan of defense -- or of attack with the disappearance perhaps the treachery of the sergeant and the appearance of this new ally for the garrison the prospects of a fight take on a very different look neddy might tackle the big stranger with a equal chance how would mike fare in a encounter with beaumaroy he do not relish the idea of it and while they fight the traitor sergeant might be on they back or -- on the other hypothesis -- he might be get off with the swag neither alternative be satisfactory p ` r ` ap he be go off to the car with the sack -- in a fright like think we 'll guess that whisper neddy mike do not much think so though he would much have like to but he receive the suggestion kindly we might as well have a look we can come back afterwards if -- if we like perhaps that big brute 'll have go the thing as i want to do most be to wring that sergeant 's neck they whisper be check by a new development the cottage door open for a moment and then close again they could tell that both by the sound and by the momentary ray of light yet a light persist after the door be shut it come from a candle which burn steadily in the stillness of the night it be carry by a woman who come down the path towards where beaumaroy and the captain stand in conversation both turn towards she with eager attention now be we time then they be not look we way now we can get across the heath to where the car be they move off very softly keep the tower between they and the group on the path they gain the back of the house and so the open heath and make off to they destination they move so softly that they escape unheard -- unless beaumaroy be right in the notion that he ear catch a little rustle of the bracken he take no heed of it unless a pass smile might be reckon as such doctor mary join he and the captain on the path beaumaroy 's smile give way to a look of expectant interest he wonder what she be go to say to captain alec there be so much that she might say or -- just conceivably -- leave unsaid she speak calmly and quietly it be you captain alec i think so cynthia get anxious i be all right i suppose mr beaumaroy have tell you poor mr saffron be dead i have tell he say beaumaroy of heart disease mary add quite painlessly i think -- and quite a normal case though of course it be distressing i -- i be sorry stammer captain alec beaumaroy 's eye meet mary 's in the candle 's light with a swift glance of surprise and inquiry chapter xvi dead majesty mary do not appear to answer beaumaroy 's glance she continue to look at and to address herself to captain alec i be tired and i should love a ride home but i have still a little to do and -- i know it be awfully late but would you mind wait just a little while i be afraid i might be as much as half-an-hour right you be doctor mary -- as long as you like i 'll walk up and down and smoke a cigar i want one badly mary make a extremely faint motion of she hand towards the house oh thanks but really i -- well i shall feel more comfortable here i think mary smile it be always safe to rely on captain alec 's fine feeling under the circumstance he would -- she have feel pretty sure -- prefer to smoke he cigar outside the house i 'll be as quick as i can come mr beaumaroy beaumaroy follow she up the path and into the house the sergeant be still on the floor of the passage he roll apprehensive resentful eye at they mary take no heed of he but precede beaumaroy into the parlor and shut the door i do not know what you game be remark beaumaroy in a low voice but you could not have play mine better i do not want he inside the house but i be mighty glad to have he extremely visible outside it it be very quiet inside there -- she point to the door of the tower -- just before i come out before that i would hear odd sound be there somebody there -- and the sergeant in league with he exactly smile beaumaroy it be all quiet i think i 'll have a look the candle on the table have burn out he take another from the sideboard and light it from the one which mary still hold like the poker she ask with a flicker of a smile on she face no you come and help if i cry out he could not repress a chuckle doctor mary be interesting he extremely light by he candle he go into the tower she hear he move about there as she stand thoughtfully by the extinct fire still with she candle in she hand beaumaroy return he be go -- or they have go he exhibit to she gaze two object -- a check pocket-handkerchief and a tobacco pouch number one find on the edge of the grave -- number two on the floor of the dais just behind the canopy if the same man have draw they both out of the same pocket at the same time -- want to blow the same nose doctor mary -- they would have fall at the same place would not they wonderful holme say mary and now shall we attend to mr saffron they carry out that office the course of which they have originally prepared beaumaroy pass with he burden hard by the sergeant and mary follow in a quarter of a hour they come downstairs again and mary again lead the way into the parlor she go to the window and draw the curtain aside a little way the light of the car be burn the captain 's tall figure fall within they ray and be plainly visible stroll up and down the ambit of the ray do not however embrace the tower window the captain pace and smoke patient content go back to he own happy memory and anticipation mary return to the table and set she candle down on it all right i think we can keep he a little longer i vote we do say beaumaroy i reckon he be scare the fellow away and they will not come back so long as they see he light rash at conclusion sometimes -- as have be see -- beaumaroy be right in he opinion of the captain 's value as a sentry or a scarecrow to keep away hungry bird the confederate have steal back to they base of operation -- to where they car lay behind the tree there too no sergeant and no sack neddy reach for he roomy flask drink of it and with hoarse curse consign the entire course of event he accomplice even himself to nethermost perdition that place be not -- natural he end in a gloomy conviction ` oo pinch that sack the sergeant well -- maybe it be and maybe it be not he finish the flask to cure a recurrence of the shudder mike prevail with he so far that he consent -- reluctantly -- to be leave alone on the blast heath while he friend go back to reconnoiter mike go and presently return the car be still there the tall figure be still pacing up and down and perhaps the other one 's go for the police mike suggest uneasily guess we have lose the hand neddy best be move eh it be no go for to-night catch I try the bloomin ' place any other night grumble neddy it be give I the ` orror and no mistake mike -- mr percy bennett that erstwhile gentlemanly stranger -- recognize one of he failure such thing be incidental to all profession we best game be to go back if the sergeant 's on the square we 'll hear from he but he speak without much hope rationalist as he profess himself still he be affect by the atmosphere of the tower with what difficulty do we entirely throw off atavistic notion they both of they have at the bottom of they mind the idea that the dead man on the high seat have defeat they and that no luck lay in meddle with he treasure i ` ave my doubt whether that ugly sergeant 's ` uman himself growl neddy as he hoist he bulk into the car so they go back to whence they come and the impression that the night 's adventure leave upon they be heighten as the day go by for strange to say though they watch all the usual channel of information as minister say in parliament and also try to open up some unusual one they never hear anything again of the sergeant of the sack of gold of the yawning tomb with its golden lining of its silent waxen-faced enthrone guardian who have defeat they it all -- the whole bizarre scene -- vanish from they ken as though it have be one of those alluring thwart dream which afflict man in sleep it be a experience to which they be shy of allude among they confidential friend even of talk about between themselves in a word -- uncomfortable meanwhile the sergeant 's association with tower cottage have also draw to its close after he search and he discovery in the tower beaumaroy come out into the passage where the prisoner lay and proceed to unfasten he bond stand up and listen to I sergeant he say you pal have run away they can not help you and they would not if they could because owe to you they have not get away with any plunder and so they 'll be in a very bad temper with you in the road in front of the house be captain naylor -- you know that officer and he dimension he be in a very temper with you too -lrb- here beaumaroy be embroider the situation the sergeant be not really in captain alec 's thought -rrb- finally i be in a very bad temper with you myself if i see you ugly phiz much longer i may break out do not you think you would better depart -- by the back door -- and go home and if you be not out of inkston for good and all by ten o'clock in the morning and if you ever show yourself there again look out for squall what you have get out of this business i do not know you can keep it -- and i 'll give you a parting present myself as well i know a thing or two -- the sergeant begin but he see a look that he have see only once or twice before on beaumaroy 's face on each occasion it have be follow by the death of the enemy whose act have elicit it oh try that game just try it beaumaroy mutter just give I that excuse he advance to the sergeant who fall suddenly on he knee do not make a noise you hound or i 'll silence you for good and all -- i would do it for twopence he take hold of the sergeant 's coat-collar jerk he on to he leg and propel he to the kitchen and through it to the back door open it he dispatch the sergeant through the doorway with a accurate and vigorous kick he fall and lay sprawl on the ground for a second then gather himself up and run hastily over the heath soon disappear in the darkness the memory of beaumaroy 's look be even keener than the sensation cause by beaumaroy 's boot it send he in flight back to inkston thence to london thence into the unknown to some spot choose for its remoteness from beaumaroy from captain naylor from mike and from neddy he recognize he unpopularity thereby achieve a triumph in a difficult little branch of wisdom beaumaroy return to the parlor hastily not so much to avoid keep captain alec wait -- it be quite a useful precaution to have that sentry on duty a little longer -- as because he curiosity and interest have be excite by the description which doctor mary have give of mr saffron 's death it be true probably the precise truth but it seem to have be volunteer in a rather remarkable way and word with careful purpose also it be the bare truth the truth denude of all its attendant circumstance -- which have not be normal when he rejoin she mary be sit in the armchair by the fire she hear he account of the state of affair up-to-date with a thoughtful smile smoking a cigarette she smile broaden over the tale of the water-butt she have put on the fur cloak in which she have walk to the cottage -- the fire be out and the room cold frame in the fur the outline of she face look softer so we stand more or less as we do before the burglar appear on the scene she comment except that we personal exertion have save that money i suppose you would prefer that all the circumstance should not come out there have be irregularity i should prefer that not so much on my own account -- i do not know and do not care what they could do to I -- as for the old man 's sake if i know you i think you would rather enjoy be able to keep you secret you like have the laugh of people i know that myself mr beaumaroy she exchange a smile with he you want a death certificate from I she add i suppose i do beaumaroy agree in the sort of term in which i describe mr saffron 's death to captain alec if i give such a certificate there would remain nothing -- well nothing peculiar -- except the -- the appearance of thing in the tower she eye be now fix on he face he nod he head with a smile of understand there be something new in the tone of doctor mary 's voice not only friendliness though that be there but a note of excitement of enjoyment as though she also be not superior to the pleasure of have the laugh of people but it be rather strain a point to say that -- and nothing more i could do it only if you make I feel that i could trust you absolutely beaumaroy make a little grimace and wait for she to develop she subject you morality be different from most people 's and from mine mine be conventional conventual beaumaroy murmur yours be not it be all personal with you you recognize no rights in people whom you do not like or who you think be not deserving or have not earn rights and you do not judge you own rights by what the law give you either the right of conquest you call it you hold yourself free to exercise that against everybody except you friend and against everybody in the interest of you friend -- like poor mr saffron i believe you would do the same for I if i ask you to i be glad you believe that doctor mary but i can not deal with you on that basis it be even difficult to be friend on that basis -- and certainly impossible to be partner i never suggest that we should be partner over the money beaumaroy put in quickly no but i be suggest now -- as you do before -- that we should be partner -- in a secret in mr saffron 's secret she smile again as she add you can manage it all i know if you like i have unlimited confidence in you ingenuity -- quite unlimited but none at all in my honesty you have get a honesty but i do not call it a really honest honesty all this lead up to -- the radbolt declare beaumaroy with & gesture of disgust it do i want you word of honor -- give to a friend -- that all that money -- all of it -- go to the radbolt if it legally belong to they i want that in exchange for the certificate a hard bargain it be not so much that i want the money -- though i must remark that in my judgment i have a strong claim to it i would say a moral claim but for my deference to you view doctor mary but it be not mainly that i hate the radbolt get it just as much as the old man would have hate it i have give you my -- my term say mary beaumaroy stand look down at she he hand in he pocket he face be twist in a humorous disgust mary laugh gently it be possible to -- to keep the rule without be a prig you know though i believe you think it be not include the sack in the water-butt my sack the sack i rescue include the sack in the water-butt yes every single sovereign though mary be pursue the high moral line there be now more mischief than gravity in she demeanor well i 'll do it he evidently speak with a great effort i 'll do it but look here doctor mary you 'll live to be sorry you make I do it oh i do not mean that that conscience of yours will be sorry that 'll approve no doubt be the extremely conventionalized thing it be but you yourself you 'll be sorry or i be much mistaken in the radbolt it be not a question of the radbolt she insist laugh oh yes it be and you 'll come to feel it so beaumaroy be equally obstinate mary rise then that be settle and we need not keep captain alec wait any longer how do you know that i sha 'n' t cheat you he ask i do not know how i know that mary admit but i do know it and i want to tell you -- she suddenly feel embarrassed under he gaze she cheek flush but she go on resolutely : to tell you how glad how happy i be that it all end like this that the poor old man be free of he fancy and he fear beyond both we pity and we laughter aye he be earn rest if there be to be rest for any of we and you can rest too and you can laugh with we and not at we be not that after all a more human sort of laughter she be smile still as she give he she hand but he see that tear stand in she eye the next instant she give a little sob doctor mary he exclaim in rueful expostulation no no how stupid you be she laugh through she sob it be not unhappiness she press he hand tightly for a instant and then walk quickly out of the house call back to he do not come please do not come i would rather go to captain alec by myself leave alone in the cottage now so quiet and so peaceful beaumaroy muse a while as he smoke he pipe then he turn to he labor -- he final night of work in the tower there be much to do very much to do he achieve he task towards morning when day dawn there be nothing but water in the water-butt and in the tower no furnishings be visible save three chair -- a high carve one by the fireplace and two much smaller on the little platform under the window the fade old red carpet on the floor be the only attempt at decoration and in still one thing more the tower be different from what it have be beaumaroy contented himself with paste brown paper over the pane on which mike have operate he do not replace the matchboarding over the window but stow it away in the coal-shed the place be horribly in need of sunshine and fresh air -- and the old gentleman be no longer alive to fear the draught when the undertaker come up to the cottage that afternoon he glance from the parlor through the open door into the tower drive past on business sir he remark to beaumaroy i have often wonder what the old gentleman do with that there tower but it look as if he do not make no use of it we sometimes store thing in it say beaumaroy but as you see there be nothing much there now but then the undertaker worthy man could not see through the carpet or through the lid of captain duggle 's grave that be full -- fuller than it have be at any period of its history in it lay the wealth the scepter and the trappings of dead majesty for wherein do mr saffron 's dead majesty differ from the dead majesty of other king chapter xvii the chief mourner the attendance be small at mr saffron 's funeral besides meek and depressed mr wiles and beaumaroy himself doctor mary find herself rather to she surprise in company with old mr naylor on compare note she discover that like herself he have come on beaumaroy 's urgent invitation and moreover that he be engage also to come on afterwards to tower cottage where beaumaroy be to entertain the chief mourner at a mid-day repast glad enough to show my respect to a neighbor say old naylor and i always like the old man 's look but really i do not see why i should go to lunch however beaumaroy -- mary do not see why he should go to lunch -- nor for that matter why she should either but curiosity about the chief mourner make she glad that she be go the chief mourner do not look at first sight attractive mr radbolt be a short plump man with a weaselly face and cunning eye he wife 's eye of a greeny color stare stolidly out from she broad red face she be taller than she mate and she figure contrived to be at once stout and angular all through the service beaumaroy 's gaze be set on the pair as they sit or stand in front of he wander from the one to the other in a apparently fascinate study at the cottage he entertain he party in the parlor with a generous hospitality and treat the radbolt with most courteous deference the man respond with the best manners that he have -- who can do more the woman be much less cordial she be curt and treat beaumaroy rather as the servant than the friend of she dead cousin there be a clear suggestion of suspicion in she bearing towards he after a broad stare of astonishment on she introduction to dr arkroyd she take very little notice of mary only to mr naylor be she clumsily civil and even rather cringe it be clear that in he she acknowledge the gentleman he sit by she and she try to insinuate herself into a private conversation with he apart from the other probe he as to he knowledge of the dead man and he mode of live she question hover persistently round the point of mr saffron 's expenditure mr saffron be not a friend of mine naylor find it necessary to explain i have few opportunity of observe he way of life even if i have feel any wish to do so i suppose beaumaroy know all about he affair she suggest as to that i think you must ask mr beaumaroy himself from what the lawyer say the old man seem to have be get rid of he money somehow or to somebody she grumble in a positive whisper to mr naylor 's intense relief beaumaroy interrupt this conversation well how do you like this little place mr radbolt he ask cheerfully not a bad little crib be it do not you think so too dr arkroyd throughout this gathering beaumaroy be very punctilious with he dr arkroyd one would have think that mary and he be almost stranger yes i like it say mary the tower make it rather unusual and picturesque this be not really she sincere opinion she be play up to beaumaroy convinced that he have open some conversational maneuver do not like it at all answer mr radbolt we 'll get rid of it as soon as we can will not we radbolt she always address she husband as radbolt do not be in a hurry do not throw it away beaumaroy advise it be not everybody be choice of course but there be quarter -- yes more than one quarter -- in which you might get a very good offer for this place he eye catch mary 's for a moment indeed i wish i be in a position to make you one myself i should like to take it as it stand -- lock stock and barrel but i have sink all i have in another venture -- hope it turn out a satisfactory one so i be not in a position to do it if mr radbolt want to sell what would you think of it dr arkroyd as a speculation mary shake she head smile glad to be able to smile with plausible reason i be not as fond of rash speculation as you be mr beaumaroy it may be worth more than it look he pursue good neighborhood healthy air fruitful soil very rich soil hereabouts my dear beaumaroy the land about here be abominable naylor expostulate perhaps generally but some rich pocket -- one may call pocket correct beaumaroy i be not a agriculturist remark weaselly mr radbolt in he oily tone and then there be a picturesque old yarn tell about it -- oh whether it be true or not of course i do not know it be about a certain captain duggle -- not the army -- the mercantile marine mr radbolt you know the story dr arkroyd and you too mr naylor you be the oldest inhabitant of inkston present sir suppose you tell it to mr and mr radbolt i be sure it will make they attach a new value to this really very attractive cottage -- with as dr arkroyd say the additional feature of the tower i know the story only as a friend of mine -- mr penrose -- who take great interest in local record and tradition tell it to I if we host desire i shall be happy to tell it to mr radbolt mr naylor accompany he word with a courtly little bow to that lady and launch upon the legend of captain duggle mr radbolt be a religious man at the end of the story he observe gravely the belief in diabolical personality be not to be lightly dismiss mr beaumaroy i be entirely of you opinion mr radbolt this time mary feel that she smile be not so plausible there seem to have be nothing in the grave mused mr radbolt apparently not when captain duggle leave it -- if he be ever in it -- at all event not when he leave the house in whatever way and by whatever agency as to the latter point i myself incline to penrose 's theory say mr naylor _ delirium tremen _ you know beaumaroy puff at he cigar still i have often think that though it be empty then it would have make -- suppose it really exist -- a excellent hiding-place for anybody who want such a thing say for a miser or a man who have he reason for conceal what he be worth i once suggest the idea to mr saffron and he be a good deal amuse he pat I on the shoulder and laugh heartily he be not often so much amuse as that a new look come into mr radbolt 's green eye up to now distrust of beaumaroy have predominate he frank bear he obvious candor and simplicity have weaken she suspicion but he word suggest something else he might be a fool not a knave mr saffron have be amuse have laugh beyond he wont that might have seem the best way of put beaumaroy off the scent the green eye be now alert eager immensely acquisitive the grave 's in the tower if it be anywhere would you like to see the tower mr radbolt yes i should she answer tartly be part of we property as it be mary exchange a glance with mr naylor as they follow the other into the tower what a abominable woman she glance say naylor smile a despairing acquiescence the stranger -- chief mourner heirs-at-law owner now of the place wherein they stand -- look round the bare brick wall of the little rotunda naylor examine it with interest too -- the old story be a quaint one mary stand at the back of the group smile triumphantly how have he dispose of -- everything she have not be wrong in she unlimited confidence in he ingenuity she do not falter in she faith in he word pledge to she safe from burglar that grave of the captain 's if you keep it properly conceal beaumaroy pursue in a sort of humorous meditation and in these day some people like to have they money in they own hand confiscatory legislation possible be not it mr naylor you know about those thing better than i do and then the tax -- shocking mr radbolt by jove i know a chap the other day who come in for what sound like a pretty little inheritance but by the time he have pay all the duty and so on most of the gilt be off the gingerbread it be there -- in front of the hearth -- that the story say the grave be do not it mr naylor a sudden thought seem to strike he i say mr radbolt would you like we to have a look whether we can find any indication of it he eye travel beyond the lady whom he address they meet mary 's she know they message he be take she into he confidence about he experiment with the chief mourner the stout angular woman have leap to she conclusion much less money than have be expect -- no sign of money have be spend and here not the cunning knave whom she have expect but a garrulous open fool give away what be perhaps a golden secret mammon the greed of acquisitiveness the voracious appetite for get more gleam in she green eye there do you say it be -- it be suppose to be there she ask eagerly with a shake in she voice she husband interpose in a suave and sanctimonious voice : my dear if mr beaumaroy and the other gentleman will not mind my say so i have be feel that these be rather light and frivolous topic for the day and the occasion which bring we here the whole thing be probably a unfounded story although there be a sound moral to it later on just as a matter of curiosity if you like my dear but to-day cousin aloysius 's day of burial be it quite seemly the big woman look at she smaller mate for just a moment a scrutinize look then she say with most unexpected meekness i be wrong you always have the proper feeling radbolt the fault be mine entirely mine beaumaroy hastily interpose i drag in the old yarn i lead mr naylor into tell it i tell you about what i say to mr saffron and how he take it all my fault i acknowledge the justice of you rebuke i apologize mr radbolt and i think that we have exhaust the interest of the tower he look at he watch er how do you stand for time shall mr wiles make we a cup of tea or have you a train to catch that be the woman in charge of the house be not it ask mrs radbolt come in for the day she do not sleep here he smile pleasantly on mr radbolt to tell you the truth i do not think that she would consent to sleep here by herself silly but -- the old story you know do not you sleep here the woman persist though she husband be look at she rather uneasily up to now i have say beaumaroy but there be nothing to keep I here now and mr naylor have kindly offer to put I up as long as i stay at inkston go to leave the place with nobody in it beaumaroy 's manner indicate surprise oh yes there be nothing to tempt thief be there just lock the door and put the key in my pocket the woman look very surly but flummox she husband with he suave oiliness come to she rescue my wife be always nervous perhaps foolishly nervous about fire mr beaumaroy well with a old house like this there be always the risk upon my soul i have not think of it and i have pack up all my thing and you car 's come and fetch they mr naylor still of course i could -- oh we have no right no claim to trouble you mr beaumaroy only my wife be -- fire 's a obsession with I i be afraid say the stout woman with a rumble giggle the sound of she mirth be intolerably disagreeable to mary i really think my dear that you 'll feel easier if i stay myself will not you you can send I what i want to-morrow and rejoin I when we arrange -- because we shall have to settle what be to be do with the place as you please mr radbolt beaumaroy 's tone be for the first time a little curt it hint some slight offense -- as though he feel himself charge with carelessness and consider mr radbolt 's obsession mere fussiness no doubt if you stay mr wiles will agree to stay too and do she best to make you comfortable i shall feel easier that way radbolt mr radbolt admit with another rumble of apologetic mirth beaumaroy motion he guest back to the parlor he manner retain its shade of distance and offense then it really only remain for I to wish you good-bye -- and all happiness in you new property any information in my possession as to mr saffron 's affair i shall of course be happy to give you be the car come for you mr naylor i think it would be pleasant to walk back and i hope doctor mary will come with we and have some tea i 'll send you home afterwards doctor mary farewell be exchange but now without even a show of cordiality naylor and doctor mary feel too much distaste for the chief mourner to attain more than a cold civility beaumaroy do not relax into he earlier friendliness he apparent dislike to she husband 's plan of stay at the cottage rouse mr radbolt 's suspicion again be he a rogue after all but a very plausible a very deep one only mr radbolt 's unctuousness -- surely it would have smooth the stormiest wave -- save the social situation intelligent people i think beaumaroy observe as the three friend pursue they way across the heath towards old place do not you mr naylor old naylor grunt with a twinkle in he eye beaumaroy try doctor mary what be you impression of they oh moan mary with a deep and expressive note but how do you know they would be like that letter and the old man 's description he have a considerable command of language and very violent likes and dislike i make a picture of they -- and it be turn out pretty accurate and those be the nearest kith and kin you poor old man have naylor shake he head sadly the woman obviously care not a straw about anything but handle he money -- and could not even hide it a gross and horrible female beaumaroy be you really hurt about they insist on stay ask mary oh come you be sharper than that doctor mary still i think i do it pretty well i set the old girl thinking again do not i he break into laughter and mary join in heartily old naylor glance from one to the other with a air of curiosity you two people look to I -- somehow -- as if you would get a secret between you perhaps we have mr naylor 's a man of honor doctor mary a man who appreciate a situation a man you can trust beaumaroy seem very gay and happy now disembarrass of a load and buoyant alike in walk and in spirit what do you say to let mr naylor -- just he -- nobody else -- into we secret mary put she arm through old mr naylor 's i do not mind if you do not but nobody else then you shall tell he -- the entire story -- at you leisure meanwhile i 'll begin at the wrong end i tell you i would make a picture of the hate cousin of the heirs-at-law those sorrowing chief mourner well have make a picture of they that be prove true i 'll make a prophecy about they and i 'll bet you it prove just as true go on say mary listen mr naylor she add with a squeeze of the old man 's arm you be like a couple of naughty child he say with a affectionate look and laugh well my prophecy be that they 'll swear the poor dear old man 's estate at under five thousand well why should not -- old naylor begin but he stop as he see mary 's eye meet beaumaroy 's in a rapture of quick and delighted understanding and then perhaps you 'll own to be sorry doctor mary so that be what you be up to be it say mary chapter xviii the gold and the treasure old mr naylor call on mary two or three day later -- at a hour when as he well know cynthium be at he own house -- in order to hear the story there be part of it which she could not describe fully for lack of knowledge -- the enterprise of mike and big neddy for example but all that she know she tell frankly and do not scruple to invoke she imagination to paint beaumaroy 's position with its difficulty demand obligation -- and temptation he hear she with close attention evidently amuse and watch she animated face with a keen and watchful pleasure surprising he say at the end rub he hand together that be to say not in itself particularly surprising just a queer little happen one would think nothing of it if one read it in the newspaper thing be always so much more surprising when they happen down one 's own street or within a few minute ' walk of one 's garden wall -- and when one actually know the people involve in they still i be always incline to agree with dr irechester that there be something out of the common about old saffron and we friend beaumaroy dr irechester never find out what it be though exclaim mary triumphantly no he do not for reason pretty clearly indicate in you narrative he sit back in he chair he elbow on the arm and he hand clasp before he if i may say so the really curious thing be to find you in the thick of it doctor mary that be not my fault i could not refuse to attend mr saffron dr irechester himself say so he pay no heed to she protest in the thick of it -- and enjoy it so tremendously mary look thoughtful i do not at first i be angry indignant suspicious i think i be be make a fool of so you be -- a fool and a tool my dear but that night -- because it all really happen in just one night -- the chief mourner as mr beaumaroy always call they be more than -- just a rather amusing epilogue -- yes that be all that night it do get hold of I she laugh a little nervously a little uneasily and now you tell it to I -- i must say that you tell make it twice the story that it really be -- now you tell it as if it be the greatest thing that ever happen to you for a moment mary fenced well nothing interesting ever have happen in my humdrum life before but old naylor purse up he lip in contempt of she fencing it do seem to I a great -- a great experience not the burglar and all that -- though some of the thing like the water-butt do amuse I very much -- but we be apart from all the world there by ourselves against the whole world in a way mr naylor the law on one side the robber on the other and you two alone together yes you understand that be the way i feel it but we be not together not in every way i mean we be fight between ourselves too right up to the very end she give another low laugh i suppose we be fight still he mean to face I with some radbolt villainy and make I sorry for what he call my legalism -- with a epithet that be he idea and my own too i confess those chief mourner will find the money -- and some other thing that 'll make 'em stare but they 'll lie low they 'll sit on the cash till the time come when it be safe to dispose of it and they 'll bilk the inland revenue out of the duty the remarkable thing be that beaumaroy seem to want they to do it that be to make I sorry that be to prove I wrong mr naylor it may make you sorry it make I sorry for that matter but it do not prove you wrong you be right my boy alec would have take the same line as you do now you need not laugh at I mary i own up at once that be my highest praise i know it be and it imply a contrast old naylor unclasp he hand and spread they in a deprecatory gesture it must do that he acknowledge mary give a rebellious little toss of she head i do not care if it do mr naylor mr beaumaroy be my friend now and mine moreover i have such confidence in he honor and fidelity that i have offer he a rather important and confidential position in my business -- to represent we at one of the foreign port where we have considerable interest he smile it be the sort of place where he will perhaps find himself less trammel by -- er -- legalism and with more opportunity for he undoubted gift of initiative will he accept you offer will he go she ask rather excitedly without doubt i think it be really quite a good offer and what prospects have he now or here mary stretch she hand towards the fire and gaze into it in silence i think you 'll have a offer soon too and a good one doctor mary irechester be over at we place yesterday he be still of opinion that there be something queer at tower cottage indeed he think that mr saffron be queer himself in he head and that a clever doctor would have find it out that he himself would if he would go on attend -- precisely but he be not surprise that you do not you lack the experience still he think none the worse of you for that and he tell I that he have make up he mind to offer you partnership irechester 's a bit stiff but a very straight fellow you could rely on be fairly treat and it be a good practice besides he be well off and quite likely to retire as soon as he see you fairly in the saddle it be a great compliment here mary 's voice sound quite straightforward and sincere a odd little note of contempt creep into it as she add and it sound -- ideal yes it do old naylor agree with a private smile all to himself whilst mary still gaze into the fire quite ideal you be a lucky young woman mary he rise to take he leave so with we young folk happily marry and you install and friend beaumaroy suit to he liking -- why upon my word we may ring the curtain down on a happy ending -- of act i at all event she seem to pay no heed to he word he stand for a moment admire she not as a beauty but a healthy comely young woman stout-hearted and with humanity and a sense of fun in she and as he look he true feeling about the situation suddenly burst through all restraint and leap from he lip though for my part under the circumstance if i be you i would see old irechester damned before i accept the partnership she turn to he -- startle yet suddenly smile he take she hand and raise it to he lip hush not another word good-bye my dear mary the next day as mary she morning round finish sit at lunch with cynthium listening or not listen to she friend 's excusably eager chatter about she approach wedding a note be deliver into she hand : the cm 's be in a hurry she be back the window be board up again come and see about 4 o'clock this afternoon b mary keep the appointment she find beaumaroy stroll up and down on the road in front of the cottage the tower window be board up again but with new strong plank in a much more solid and workmanlike fashion if he be to try again mike would not find it so easy to negotiate without make a dangerous noise over the job such impatience -- such undisguised rapacity -- be indecent and revolting beaumaroy remark he seem to be in the highest spirit i wonder if they have open it yet they 'll see you prowl about outside will not they i hope so indeed i have no doubt of it mr greeneye be probably peer through the parlor window at this minute and cursing I i like it to those people i represent law and order if they can rise to the conception of such a thing at all i probably embody conscience when you come to think of it it be a pleasant turn of event that i should come to represent law and order and conscience to anybody even to the radbolt it be rather a change she agree but let 's walk on i do not really much want to think of they that be because you feel that you be lose the bet i can not stop they get the money in the end that be you do i can not stop they cheat the revenue which be what they certainly mean to do without expose myself to more inconvenience than i be dispose to undergo in the cause of the revenue whereas if i have leave the bag in the water-butt -- all you do be not you a little sorry of course there be a aspect of the case -- she admit smile that be enough for I you have lose the bet let 's see -- what be the stake mary come let 's walk on she put she arm through he what about this berth that mr naylor 's offering you at bogota be not it he look puzzle for a moment then he mind work quickly back to cynthium 's almost forget tragedy he laugh in enjoyment of she thrust my place be not bogota -- though i fancy that it be rather in the same moral latitude you be confuse I with captain cranster so i be -- for a moment say doctor mary demurely but what about the appointment anyhow what about you partnership with dr irechester if you come to that mary press he arm gently and they walk on in silence for a little while they be clear of the neighborhood of tower cottage now but still a considerable distance from old place very much alone together on the heath as they have seem to be that night -- that night of night -- at the cottage i have not so much as receive the offer yet only mr naylor have mention it to I still you would like to be ready with you answer when the offer be make would not you he draw suddenly away from she and stand still on the road opposite to she he face lose its playfulness as it set into gravity the line upon it deepen and he eye look rather sad this be wrong of I perhaps but i can not help it i be not go to talk to you about myself confession and apology and excuse and so on be not in my line i should probably tell lie if i attempt anything of the sort you must take I or leave I on you own judgment on you own feeling about I as you have see and know I -- not long but pretty intimately mary he suddenly reach he hand into he pocket and pull out the combination knife-and-fork that be all i have bring away of he from tower cottage and i bring it away as much for you sake as for he it be during we encounter over this instrument that i first thought of you as a woman mary and by jove i believe you know it yes i believe i do she answer she eye set very steadily on he he slip the thing back into he pocket and now i love you and i want you mary she fall into a sudden agitation oh but this do not seem for I i would put all that behind I i -- she could scarcely find word i i be just doctor mary lot of people to practice on -- body and soul too in the moral latitude i be go to she body seem to shiver a little as though before a plunge into deep water i be very safe here she whisper yes you be safe here he acknowledge gravely and stand silent wait for she choice what a decision to have to make she cry suddenly it be all my life in a moment because i do not want you to go away from I she draw near to he and put she hand on he shoulder i be not a child like cynthium i can not dream dream and make idol any more i think i see you as you be and i do not know whether you love be a good thing she pause search he eye with hers very earnestly then she go on but if it be not i think there be no good thing leave for I at all mary be not that you answer to I yes she arm fall from he shoulder and she stand opposite to he in silence again for a moment then she troubled face clear to a calm serenity and now i set doubt and fear behind I i come to you in faith and loyalty and love i be not a missionary to you or a reformer god forbid i be just the woman who love you hector i should have mock at the missionary and trick the reformer he bare he head before she but by the woman who love I and whom i love i will deal faithfully he bent and kiss she forehead and now let 's walk on no not to old place -- back home past tower cottage she put she arm through he again and they set out through the soft dusk that have begin to hover about they so they come to the cottage and here for a while instinctively stay they step a light shone in the parlor window the tower be dark and still mary turn she face to beaumaroy 's with a sudden smile of scornful gladness aye aye you be right he smile answer hers poor devil i be sorry for they upon my soul i be that really be just like you she exclaim in mirthful exasperation sorry for the radbolt now be you well after all they have only get the gold we have get the treasure mary the end end of project gutenberg 's the secret of the tower
