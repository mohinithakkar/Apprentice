egypt nineveh babylon and other ancient land he flourish and in the home of the noblest he be ever a honor guest the oldest collection of folklore story or myth now in existence be of east indian origin and be preserve in the sanskrit the collection be call _ hitopadesa _ and the author be veshnoo sarma of this collection sir william jone the great orientalist write the fable of veshnoo be the most beautiful if not the most ancient collection of apologue in the world as far back as the sixth century translation be make from they the same love for myth and legend obtain to-day in those oriental land there where the ancient and historic so stubbornly resist any change -- in persium indium china and indeed all over that venerable east -- the man who can recite the ancient apologue or legend of the past can always secure a audience and command the closest attention while the general impression be that the recital of these old myth and legend among oriental nation be for the mere pastime of the crowd it be well to bear in mind that many of they be use as a means to convey great truth or to reprove error hence the recital of they be not confine to a merely inquisitive audience that desire to be amuse we have a good example of this in the case of the recital by jotham as record in the book of judge of the legend of the gathering of the tree for the purpose of have one of they anointed king over the rest of this legend dr adam clarke the commentator say this be the oldest and without exception the best fable or apologue in the world the despotic nature of the government of those oriental nation cause the people often to use the fable or myth as a indirect way to reprove or censure when it would not have be safe to have use a direct form of speech the result be that it attain a higher degree of perfection there than among any other people a excellent example be nathan 's reproof of david by the recital of the fable of the poor man 's ewe lamb the red indian of america have justly be famous for they myth and legend we have never hear of a tribe that do not have a store of they even the hardy eskimo in he igloo of ice be surprisingly rich in folklore story a present of a knife or some other trifle that he desire will cause he to talk by the hour to he guest whether he be the daring trader or adventurous explorer on the tradition that have come down to he the interchange of visit between the northern indian and the eskimo have result in the discovery that quite a number of the myth recite in indian wigwam be in a measure if not wholly of eskimo origin on the other hand the eskimo have not fail to utilize and incorporate into he own rich store some that be undoubtedly of indian origin for thirty year or more we have be gather up these myth and legend sometimes a brief sentence or two of one would be hear in some wigwam -- just enough to excite curiosity -- then year would elapse ere the whole story could be secure as the tribe have no written language and the indian have to depend entirely upon they memory it be not to be wonder at that there be at time great divergence in the recital of even the most familiar of they story we have hear the same legend give by several story-teller and no two agree in many particulars other however be tell with very slight difference we have adopt the course of record what seem to we the most natural version and most in harmony with the instinct and characteristic of the pure indian the close scientific student of indian folklore will see that we have soften some expression and eliminate some detail that be non-essential the crude indian language while absolutely free from blasphemy can not always be literally translate _ verbum sit sapientus _ the method we have adopt in the presentation of these myth and legend in connection with the chatter and remark of we little one while unusual will we trust prove attractive and interesting we have endeavor to make it a book for all class here be some old myth in new setting and here be some we venture to think that have never before be see in english dress these will interest the student of such subject while the general style of the book will we hope make it attractive to young reader nanahboozhoo the personage who occupy the principal part in these myth be the most widely know of all those being of suppose miraculous birth who play such prominent part in indian legend he do not seem to have be claim by any one particular tribe doubtless legend of he be transmit down from the time when the division of tribe have not so extensively take place when perhaps the algonquin now so subdivide be one great tribe speak one language the variety of name by which he be know be account for by these tribal division and the rapid change which take place in the language owe to its have no written form to maintain its unity what he original name be when legend about he first begin to be tell be of course unknown however since the white race begin to gather up and record these indian myth he have be know as misha-wabus manabush jous-ke-ha messou manabozho nanahboozhoo hiawatha chiabo singua-sew -- and even some other name have be hear we have give he in this volume the name of nanahboozhoo as that be the one most frequently use by the indian among whom we live or visit there be more unanimity about he origin among the tribe than about he name the almost universal report be that he be the son of mudjekeewi the west wind he mother be wenonah the daughter of nokomi the author desire very gratefully

have ring on he tail without even knock at the door there noiselessly enter we northern home two large unhandsome indian they pay not the slightest attention to the grown-up paleface present but in they ghostly way march across the room to the corner where the two little child be play on the floor quickly but gently pick they up they swing they to they shoulder and then without a word of salutation or even a glance at the parent they noiselessly pass out of that narrow door and disappear in the virgin forest they be pagan saulteaux by name souwana and jakoo the indian name by which these two child be call by the native be sagastaookemou which mean the sunrise gentleman and minnehaha laughing water to the wigwam of souwana south wind these child be be carry they have no fear of these big indian though the boy be only six year old and he little sister but four they have learn to look with laugh eye even into the fiercest and ugliest of these red face and have make they they friend so even now while be carry away among the dense tree they merrily laugh and shout to each other the bright patch of sunshine on the ground the singing bird and the few brilliant-hued summer flower bring forth they exclamation of delight while all the time the grave silent indian hurry they on deeper and deeper into the forest yet carefully they guard they precious load and as the antlered deer in pass through the thick wood and under the low branch never strike trunk or bough so these son of the forest glide swiftly on without allow any hurt to come to the child of the paleface even if at time the faint trail lead they over slippery rock and under low intertwine branch the wigwam of souwana be pitch in a beautiful spot at the edge of the great forest near the sandy rocky eastern shore of lake winnipeg this great lake be well call the sea which be the meaning of its indian name it be about as long as lake ontario and erie combine and in some place be eighty mile wide at the entrance of the wigwam which be make of a couple of tan reindeerskin the child be carefully lift down from the man 's shoulder and then take into this indian abode come in suddenly from the bright sunshine it be some time before they could see distinctly the door flap of deerskin have drop like a curtain behind they all the light there be come in through the hole in the top where the pole of the wigwam cross each other presently however they be able to see a circle of indian child gather around a small fire that smolder on the ground in the center of the tent it be now in the pleasant summer time but the fire be need for something else than warmth as the little sagastao and minnehaha discover before long they be soon seat in the circle with the red child who young though they be be a wee bit startle at see these little paleface the white child however simply laugh with glee this outward demonstration seem very improper to the silent red child who be teach to refrain from expression of they gladness or sorrow the indian have bring the white child for a characteristic reason they have say among themselves if the white father and mother love we as they say they do we will test they by take away they child without ask permission they also wish to show they own love for the child and so have really bring they to a child 's feast it be perhaps as queer a tea party as you ever hear of there be no table on which to put the good thing prepare for the feast no plate no cup and saucer no knife no spoon not even a chair there be no cake no tart no jam no pie not even any bread and butter well what a feast you say without any place to sit or good thing to eat not too fast there be both of these there be the lap of mother earth and so down on the ground with bearskin and deerskin on it for rug the child sit then the deerskin door be again open and in come indian with birch-bark dish call _ rogan _ in which be nicely prepared wild duck rabbit and partridge but as they be uncooked they could not yet be eat by the now expectant hungry child then begin the preparation of the feast some of the indian add dry wood to the fire until there be a hot smokeless blaze other take out they sharp hunting knife and cleverly cut up the duck rabbit and partridge then these piece be spit on the end of sharp point of hard wood and skillfully broil or toast in the hot flame as fast as the dainty bit of meat be cook and a little cool they be give to the child in they finger and in that way the little one have they feast now please do not turn up you nose at such a feast think of it : out in a wigwam in the lovely forest where the wild bird sing and the squirrel chatter where be hear the music of the wave play on the shore but a few yard away with great friendly indian as you waiter the very air of that northern summer give you a appetite ready for anything those little people red and white soon become the jolliest of friend and as the white child could speak the indian language as well as they own they be soon all chatter away most merrily while they daintily pick the bone of course this way of eating be hard upon they hand face and clothing but what healthy child ever give a second thought -- if a first -- to any of these thing after a time this feast as all feast must come to a end then the question be what shall we do next for the child for the whole day have be plan by the grown-up indian for the entertainment of the little people canoe have be collect on the shore of winnipeg handy if it should be decide that they all should go for a afternoon outing on the water however souwana who have go out to look at the sky and observe the wind and wave now come in and report that he think they would better put off the canoe trip to some time when the lake be more calm it be then suggest that the child be ask what would please they most the little folk white and red be not slow in give they decision tell we a story about nanahboozhoo who shall be the story-teller there be a hearty call for souwana on come in from investigate the weather but a few minute before souwana have seat himself on a robe and be now enjoy he calumet or pipe stoical though he be he dark eye flash with pleasure at the unanimous call of the child but indianlike it would have be a great breach of manners if he have let he delight be know then again indianlike it would never have do to have seem to be in a hurry the indian child well know this but who ever hear of white child that could sit like statue grave and dignified while the story-teller take time to finish smoking a large pipe of tobacco so it be in this case in they wild excitement and eagerness to have the story begin both sagastao and minnehaha spring up and rush toward souwana vie with each other in see which could first pluck the half-smoked calumet from he mouth such audacity appal the indian child and fairly take the breath away from the older indian for be not souwana a chief and the calumet almost a sacred thing while between he lip souwana however be greatly delight here be a new experience and the very boldness of the child of the paleface be a evidence of they unbounded confidence and love to little sagastao the calumet be surrender and with the child cuddle around he souwanas begin he story : -lrb- illustration : with the child cuddle around he souwanas begin he story -rrb- now you must know that nanahboozhoo be a queer fellow he could make himself as tall as a tree or as small as a turtle or snake nothing could kill he he could not be drown even if drop hundred of foot into the lake nor burn to death even if he tumble into the fire he often meet with accident but he always come up right again and be ready for some other adventure in some new shape he have leave he mark on the rock and tree leave and flower almost anywhere we look we see sign that nanahboozhoo have be around as he temper be very uncertain he sometimes cause trouble and injure the appearance of thing which be once more beautiful than they be now but in general he be the friend of we race and work change that be for we good one day as nanahboozhoo be walk along on a sandy shore he feel very hungry it be now in the autumn of the year as he wander on he see a object move toward he he have not long to wait before he see that this object be a great black bear he pull up a young tree by the root and hide himself prepare to kill the bear when he should come near when the bear come near nanahboozhoo make a big jump out of he hide place and kill the bear with one blow then he build a big fire and have singe all the hair off the bear he cut he up and nicely roasted he when the meat be cook nanahboozhoo cut it up into fine piece for he intend to enjoy he feast by eat leisurely while he be thus busy prepare he feast he be annoy by a strange sound among the tree top that rub together when the wind blow nanahboozhoo be very quick-tempered and as the noise continue he determine to stop it so he leave he feast on the ground and climb away up one of those tree to the spot where the other press against it he be endeavor to pull the two great tree apart when one of he hand get catch between they and be firmly hold while struggle to get loose he hear a pack of wolf run toward he bear meat this make he struggle the harder to get he hand free the fierce wolf soon scented the food and have a good time devour it in spite of the shouting of nanahboozhoo when nanahboozhoo at length get he hand free and come down he find nothing left of he feast but the skull of the bear he be very angry not only at the wolf that have eat he feast but also at the tree that have hold he the great nanahboozhoo in so tight a grip as the wolf have run away he could not at present punish they but he resolve that he would so punish these great birch tree that they would never give he such a squeeze again so he prepare a great whip and with it he severely thrash the tree up to this time the birch have be the most beautiful of tree its great trunk be of the purest white without any blemish or blotch upon it but ever since the thrashing nanahboozhoo give it it have have to carry the mark of that terrible whipping and that be why the white birch tree be so cover with scar when nanahboozhoo have cease thrash the tree he find himself so very hungry that he resolve to eat the brain that be in the head of the bear that have be overlook by the wolf however he find the skull very hard so he transform himself into a little snake and in this way get inside of the bear 's skull and enjoy he feast in fact he enjoy it too much for when he be through with he eat he could not get out of the skull he be so full however he be able to roll along skull and all but as he could not see where he be go he bump along in a very erratic manner until at length he tumble into a big lake and sink at first deep down under the wave when he come up to the surface he just put a part of the head of the bear out of the water as do the bear when swim then he listen intently it be not long before nanahboozhoo hear voice say : ` look there be a bear swimming let we kill he so there be a chase on the lake and it be not long before the indian come up in they canoe and one of they with he stone ax strike the bear 's head such a blow that he split open the skull this just suit nanahboozhoo and instantly he spring out and make for the shore then nanahboozhoo journey on and again he begin to feel very hungry the brain of the bear be not much to one who have have he mind set on eat the whole carcass it be not long before he meet the raccoon awkwardly carry a birch _ rogan _ that he have steal from a couple of blind man see the merry smile on the raccoon 's face nanahboozhoo bid he a good day and ask he what be amusing he the raccoon who do not know that it be nanahboozhoo with whom he be talk tell he how he obtain the dish when nanahboozhoo hear this he be very angry at the raccoon for he heartless trick it seem that there be quite a large settlement of people who have among they a couple of blind man as these indian be hunter they have to be on the move a good deal of the time follow the game as the other people be kind-hearted instead of kill these old blind man now that they be unable to hunt they arrange for they a wigwam in a safe quiet place near the lake then they give they a kettle and bowl and other necessary thing and cut a large pile of wood and place it close at hand in order that they might be able to get water for they cooking and yet not stumble into the water they friend fasten a rope for they guidance from the door of the wigwam to a post on the edge of the lake the old man be now quite comfortable they friend come frequently with abundant supplies of food and the blind man be able to do they own work and be happy together they divide the day 's work so that one day one would be the cook while the other would bring in the wood and go for the water next day they would change about it give each enough to do and not too much for a long time the two man live contented and happy but it happen that one day the raccoon be out prowl along the shore look for something to eat when he happen to find the end of the rope that be tie to the post at the water 's edge now you must know say souwana that next to the wolverine the raccoon be the biggest mischief in the wood he be full of trick but he be very cunning and suspicious so before he interfere with the rope he cautiously follow it up and find that its other end be at the wigwam of these two old blind man hear no noise he cautiously peer into the wigwam and see they both sleep near the fire there be a smell of something good to eat and the raccoon decide to wait around to see if he could not get hold of it while he be thus wait the old man wake up and one say to the other ` my brother i be feeling hungry let we prepare we dinner ' ` very well ' say the other ` it be you turn to go to the lake for water while i make the fire ' when the raccoon hear this he run down to the lake and quickly untie the rope from the stake and draw it back tie it to a clump of bush on the land when the old man with the kettle feel he way along the rope until he reach its end he try to dip up the water as usual but all in vain there be nothing but the dry earth and bush not find any water he return to he brother with the sad news that the lake have dry up and that already bush be grow where yesterday there be plenty of water when he brother hear this doleful story he laugh at it and say : ` why that can not be possible no bush could grow up in such a short time ' however he brother declare it be the case and so the other one say ` well let I go and see if i can find some water ' when the tricky raccoon hear this he hurry back and at once untie the rope from the bush and refasten it to the post near the water when the second brother come along he easily find the water and fill the kettle he return to the wigwam where he vigorously accuse he brother of lie he poor fellow could not understand it and be much perplex the preparation of they dinner go on and soon it be ready there be however another one present that the blind man have no suspicion of and that be the raccoon who have now noiselessly come into the wigwam and greedily sit watch the preparation this dinner consist of eight piece of meat which when cook be place in they _ rogan _ or wooden bowl when ready they sit down with this bowl between they and begin to eat each take a piece of meat and they talk of various thing while they eat the raccoon now noiselessly take four of the piece of meat out of the bowl and begin eat they soon one of the man reach into the bowl to get another piece of meat and find only two piece leave he say : ` my brother you must be very hungry to eat so fast i have only have one piece of meat and there be only two leave ' ' i have not take they ' be the reply ` but i suspect that you be the greedy one who have eat they ' this make the other brother very angry and as they thus go on argue the raccoon to make matter worse and to have as he tell nanahboozhoo some more sport with the old blind fellow hit each of they a smart blow on the face the poor old man each believe that the other have strike he begin to fight and so they upset the _ rogan _ and lose the rest of they dinner and nearly set the wigwam on fire the raccoon then seize the two remain piece of meat and the bowl and with shout of laughter rush out of the wigwam the old man hear this perceive that they have be fool and they at once stop fight and apologize to each other the raccoon 's rascally trick make nanahboozhoo very angry indeed he have have a good deal of trouble to keep from let the raccoon know who he be so just as soon as the raccoon have finish he say : ' i be nanahboozhoo those old blind man be my brother and i 'll teach you a lesson you will never forget ' so he seize the raccoon and kill he and carry he body back to the tent of the blind man and make out of it a great feast for they and declare that in future the old raccoon should have to carry as many circle on they tail as piece of meat that have be steal out of the _ rogan _ of the blind man good for nanahboozhoo shout sagastao mr raccoon could not play any trick on he now tell we another story but here minnehaha interpose i think say she we have better go home now for father and mother may begin to think they have lose they little one let we wait until dark say sagastao and then mary will not see we dirty clothes for they greasy finger have soil they badly the wish of the little girl however prevail and so it be not long ere the indian salutation wat cheer wat cheer be shout to all and once more the two child be hoist upon the shoulder of the big indian and in the same manner in which they have be bring to the wigwam in the forenoon they ride home in the beautiful gloaming very tired be they yet not so weary but that they be able with they little hand to rub some of the paint off the face of they big stalwart carrier and daub it on they own the effect be so ludicrous that they merry laughter reach the ear of they expectant parent even before they emerge from the gloom of the forest chapter ii the child 's return -- indignation of mary the indian nurse -- she pathetic history -- she love for the child -- the story of wakonda and of the origin of mosquito in reach home the child be quietly receive by they parent who understand indian way have no desire to lessen they influence by find fault with they for carry off the child they treat the matter as though it be one of everyday occurrence mary the indian nurse however do not regard the incident so calmly when the child be bring back dirty greasy bedaubed and so tired that they could hardly hold up they little head she indignation know no bound and as she be perfectly fearless she couch she sentiment in the most vigorous phrase of the expressive cree language the history of indian mary be very strange indeed there be a incident in she life so sad that from the day of she recovery she be consider to be under the special care of the good spirit so that even the most influential chief or hunter have a superstitious fear of show any temper or make any bitter retort no matter what she might say year before this time mary be the wife of a cruel pagan indian who bear the english name of robinson although she be slight of figure and never very strong he exact from mary a great deal of hard work and be vex and angry if when heavily burden with the game he have shoot she do not move as rapidly along on the trail as he do carry only he gun and ammunition once when they be out in the wood some mile from he wigwam he shoot a full-grown deer and order she to bring it into the camp on she back pick up he gun he start on ahead and be a large stalwart man and move with the usual rapidity of the indian on the homeward trail he soon reach he wigwam unfortunately for he -- and as it turn out for mary also -- he find some free-trader -lrb- 1 -rrb- at he abode await he return they have few goods for trade in they outfit but they have a keg of fire water which have ever be the scourge of the indian -lrb- footnote 1 : fur buyer who be not agent of the fur company -rrb- robinson inform they of he success in shoot the deer and that it be even now be bring in the trader not only purchase what fur robinson have on hand but also the two hind quarter of the deer which mary be bring home robinson at once begin drink the fire water which he have receive as part payment he be naturally irritable and short-tempered even when sober but he be much more so when under the influence of spirituous liquor the unprincipled trader know this and wish to see he in one of he tantrum begin in a banter way to question whether he have really shoot a deer since he wife be so long in come with it this make he simply furious and when mary do at length arrive labor under the two-hundred-pound deer she be meet by she husband now wild with passion and the white man 's fire water little suspect danger she throw the deer from she shoulder where it have be support by the carry strap across she forehead weary and panting she turn to go into the wigwam for she skinning knife but ere she have go a dozen step she be startle by a yell from robinson which cause she instantly to turn and face he the sight that meet she eye be appalling before she stand she husband with a uplifted gleaming ax in he hand and curse on he tongue see that there be no chance to fly from he she throw herself toward he hope thereby to escape the blow she succeed in save she head but the ax bury itself in she spine mary 's pierce scream speedily bring a number of indian from neighbor wigwam when they find poor mary lie there in agony with the ax still imbed in the bone of she back they indignation know no bound indian as a rule have great self-control but this sight so stir they that there be very nearly a lynching robinson now sober by he fear clearly foresee that terrible would be he punishment and while the indian and trader turn to attend to mary 's wound the wretched husband stealthily slip away into the forest and be never again see there rumor however at length reach mary that he have flee away to the distant kaministiquium river where for a time he live solitary and alone in a little bark wigwam one day when out shooting in he canoe he be catch in some treacherous rapid and carry over the wild and picturesque ka-ka-be-ka fall about which so many thrilling indian legend cluster for seven year mary be a helpless invalid when she do recover she back have so curved that she look like a hunchback as she be poor and utterly unable either to hunt or to fish we help she in various way she be always grateful for kindness and in return be very willing to do what she could for we she be exceedingly clever with she needle and with a little instruction be soon able to assist with the sewing require however what especially win she to we and give she a permanent place in we home be she great love and devotion to we little one -lrb- illustration : the wild and picturesque ka-ka-be-ka fall -rrb- little sagastao be only a few month old when she install herself as he nurse and for year she be a most watchful and devoted as well as self-sacrificing guardian of we child in that northern home she seem to live and think solely for they at time especially in the matter of parental discipline there would be collision between mary and the mother of the child for the nurse with she indian idea could not accept of the position of a disciplined servant nor could she quietly witness the punishment of child whom she think absolutely perfect hence if she could not have thing exactly as she want they mary would now and then allow she fiery temper to obtain the mastery and spring up in a rage and throw a shawl over she head she would fly out of the house and be go for day she mistress pay no attention to these outburst she well know that when mary have cool down she would return and it be often amusing to see the way in which she would attract the child 's attention to she peer around tree or corner and then come meekly walk in with they as though they have only be for a pleasant outing of a hour or so well mary would be the greet of she mistress while mary 's quiet response would be the indian greet of wat cheer then thing would go on as usual for perhaps another six month when mary would indulge again in one of she tantrum with the same happy result she dress the child in picturesque indian costume -- coat dress leggings moccasin and other article of apparel of deer skin tan as soft as kid and beautifully embroider with silk and bead work not a spot could appear upon they garment without mary 's notice and as she always keep change ready she be frequently disrobe and dress they up when souwana and jakoo come that morning and pick up the child mary happen to be in another room have she be present she would doubtless have interfere in they movement as it be when she miss the child she indignation know no bound and only the most emphatic command of she mistress restrain she from rush after they all day long she have to content herself with mutter she protest while as usual she be busily employ with she needle when however the two stalwart indian return in the evening with the child on they shoulder the storm break and mary 's murmuring at first mere protest become loud and furious when the happy child so tired and dirty be set down before she the indian know of the sad tragedy in mary 's life would not show anger or even annoyance under she scathing word but with the stoical nature of they race they quietly endure she wrath this they be much better prepared to do since neither of the parent of the white child seem in the slightest degree disturb by they long absence or the tirade of the indignant nurse with high-bred courtesy they patiently listen to all that mary have to say and when the storm have spend itself they turn and noiselessly retire the child be wear out with they day 's adventure and they mother intimate that mary ought at once to bathe they and put they to bed this however do not satisfy mary it have become she custom to dress they up in the afternoon and keep they apparele in they brightest costume during the rest of the day therefore now the weary child after be bath be again dress in they best and bring out for inspection and a light supper before retire the bath and the supper have so refresh they that when mary have tuck they into they bed they be wide awake and ask she to tell they a story but sleep be what they need now more than anything else and she try to quiet they without any further word but so thoroughly arouse be they that they declare that if she refuse they know somebody who would be glad to have they visit he again and that he would tell they lot of beautiful thing this hint that they might return to the wigwam of souwana be too much for mary who very freely give utterance to she sentiment about he the child gallantly come to the defense of the old indian and also of nanahboozhoo of whom mary speak most slightingly say that he be a mean fellow who ought to be ashamed of many of he trick well reply sagastao if you will tell we better story than those souwana can tell we about nanahboozhoo all right we will listen to they but mind you we be go to hear he nanahboozhoo story too o indeed say mary with a contemptuous toss of she head there be many story better than those of he old nanahboozhoo will not it be fun to see whose story we like the best mary 's or souwana 's say minnehaha who foresee a interesting rivalry mary have now commit herself and so almost without realize what it would come to she find herself pit against souwana the great story-teller of the tribe however be determine that souwana should not rob she of the love of the child she be tempt to begin she story-telling even though the child be exhaust and so it be that when the lad ask a question mary be ready say mary say sagastao the mosquito bite we badly to-day do you know why it be that there be such troublesome little thing be there any story about they yes wakonda one of the strange spirit send they say mary because a woman be lazy and would not keep the clothes of she husband and child clean and nice tell we all about it they both cry out mary quiet they and begin the story long ago when the people all dress in deerskin there be a man whose name be pug-a-mah-kon he be a industrious fellow and have often to work a good deal in dirty place the result be that although he have several suit of clothes he seem never to have any clean one it be the duty of he wife to scrape and clean he garment and wash and resmoke they as often as they need it but she neglect she work and would go off gossip among she neighbor she husband be patient with she for a time but at length when he hear that wakonda be come to pay a visit to the people to see how they be get along he begin to bestir himself so as to be decently attire in clean handsome apparel to meet this powerful be who be able to confer great favor on he or if ill-disposed to injure he greatly he endeavor to get he wife to go to work and remove the dirt that have gather on he garment she be so lazy that it be only from fear of a beating that she ever do make any attempt to do as he desire she take the garment and begin to clean they but she be in a bad humor and do she work in such a slovenly and half-hearted way that there be but very little change for the better after the pretended cleaning when the news be circulate that wakonda be come the husband prepare to dress himself in he best apparel but great indeed be he anger and disgust when he find that the garment which he have hope to wear be still disgracefully grimy while the angry husband be chide the woman for she indolence wakonda suddenly appear to he the man appeal and ask for he advice in the matter wakonda quickly respond and say : ' a lazy gossip wife be not only a disgrace to she husband she be annoy to all around she and so it will be in this case ' then wakonda tell she husband to take some of the dirt which still cling to he garment which she be suppose to have cleanse and to throw it at she this the man do and the particle of dirt at once change into mosquito and so ever since especially in the warm day and night of early summer when the mosquito with they singing and stinging come around to trouble we we be remind of this lazy slovenly woman who be not only a trial to she husband but by she lack of industry and care bring such a scourge upon all the people do not wakonda do anything else murmur the little lad but that bless thing call sleep now enfold both the little one and with muttering of nanahboozhoo -- wakonda -- souwana -- mary -- they be soon far away in childhood 's happy dreamland chapter iii more about mary and the child -- minnehaha sting by the bee -- how the bee get they sting -- what happen to the bear that try to steal the honey the next morning while mary be dress they the child tell she of they adventure in the wigwam of the indian mary be really interested though she pretend to be disgust at the whole thing and profess in she indian way to be quite shock when they both confidentially inform she that they have have such a good time that they be go again even if they have to run away and be whip for it this be terrible news for mary and place she in a awkward position to tell the parent of the child 's resolve be something she would never do as it might bring down upon they some of the punishment which be quite contrary to she principle yet on the other hand to let they go and to give no information might cause more trouble than she like to think of neither could she bear the thought of the two child return from another day 's out with they neat clothing and pretty face soil and dirty do as they might she have never once inform on they and she have no mind to begin now she earnestly plead with they not to carry out they resolve the little one be shrewd enough to see that they have thoroughly alarm she and they be in no hurry to surrender the power which they see they have over she mary never say a word in english she understand a good deal that other say but she never express herself in other than the indian language hence both little sagastao and minnehaha always talk with she in she own tongue minnehaha see mary 's anxiety at they determination to run away to the indian think of compromise the matter by insist that mary should tell they more tale if she would do this they would not run away very soon especially do she emphasize the very soon this be hardly satisfactory to mary but as it be the best promise she could get she be oblige to consent little sagastao who be mary 's favorite once more unsettled she when he say now mary remember we have only promise not to run away very soon that mean that we intend to do it some time it seem that the little conspirator have talk it all over in the morning in they bed and have decide how they would get story out of mary without really promising not to run away to the wigwam of souwana the child be dress be take down by mary to prayer and breakfast after which a hour be allow in summer-time for outdoor amusement before the lesson begin little sagastao generally spend he hour either with he father or some trusty indian playing with and watch the gambol of the great dog of which not a few be keep at that mission home minnehaha be with she mother and be interested in the bestowal of gift to the poor widow and child who generally come at that hour owe to the isolate situation of the mission and the fact that there be no organize school within hundred of mile some hour of the forenoon be devote to the education of the child in the home the afternoon accord to the season be devote to reading and amusement mary the nurse while able to read fluently in the cree syllabic have no knowledge of english as the child 's education progress they want to teach mary she stubbornly resist however declare that if they teach she to read english they would want to make she talk it the mother note the unusual expectancy manifest by the child during the day and on inquire the reason be promptly inform that mary have promise to tell they a story or legend and have get to do it why have she _ get _ to do it say the loving mother strike with the emphasis which they have place on the word the little mischief be cunning enough to see that they have nearly run themselves into trouble and be wisely silent mary also notice this and at once she great loyalty to the little folk manifest itself and quickly turn to she mistress she say with a emphasis which be quite unusual : mary have promise they a story and as she always keep she word she have _ get _ to tell it say this she quickly spring from the floor where she have be sit and take a child by each hand she march with they out of the room hurrah for you mary you save we that time say little sagastao mary would not have be sorry if in some way the parent receive a inkling of what be in the mind of the child yet she have such peculiar idea that she would never herself be the one to convey that information during the brief summer month the pleasantest walk be along the shore of the lake many be the cosy little cave-like retreat where mary often lead the child there with the sunlit water before they and the ripple wave make music at they foot the old nurse croon out many a indian legend or exciting story about the red man of the past to-day however she be perplex by the attitude of the child and could not select any story that she think of sufficient interest to divert they mind from souwana and nanahboozhoo so for a time they wander on along the pleasant shore or turn aside to gather the brilliant wild flower a scream of pain from minnehaha interrupt they pleasure in gather some wild lily she be sting on both hand by some honey bee that be in the flower mary quickly make a batter of clay and bind up the wound hand in it then she sit down and take the child in she lap naughty bee to sting I like this say minnehaha with tear stream down she cheek i be not do they any harm yes you be and so be we all say the brother we be carry off the flower from which they get they honey which be they food well they might let we have a few flower without sting we reply minnehaha the intense pain of the sting rapidly abate under mary 's homely but skillful treatment and as the child still retain she place in mary 's lap she say can you tell we why such pretty little thing as bee have such terrible sting my hand feel as if they be on fire when i be first sting and i could not help cry out with the pain well say mary there be a time when the bee have no sting and they be as harmless as the house fly they be just as industrious as they be now but they have any amount of trouble in keep they honey from be steal from they for every creature love it in vain they hide they comb away up in hollow tree and in the cleft of high rock the bear which be very fond of honey be ever on the lookout for it and be very clever in get it when once they find where it be hide away bird with long beak would suck it out and even the little squirrel be always steal it the result be that whole swarm often starve in the long winter because all they honey which be they winter food be steal from they the bee be in danger of be destroy they give up work in great number together and scatter into little company and in the most secret place try to store away a little honey just enough to keep they alive from season to season but even these little hive be often discover and the honey devour thing have come to such a pass with they that they have almost give up hope of last much longer fortunately for they word be circulate that wakonda the strong spirit -- the one who send the mosquito -- be come around on a tour to see how everything be progress he be greater than even nanahboozhoo and be perhaps a relative of he but he very seldom appear or do anything for anyone however it happen that he have this year leave he beautiful home at spirit lake and be journey through the country and he be willing to help all who be in real distress so the bee resolve to apply to he for help wakonda receive they very graciously and eat heartily of the present of beautiful honey which some of they have make and have succeed in keep out of the way of bear and they other enemy when he feast of honey be over he listen to they tale of sorrow and woe he be indignant when he hear of the number of they enemy and of the persistency of they attack upon such industrious little creature for a time wakonda be uncertain as to the best method to adopt to help they he dismiss they for that day and tell they to come again on a day he mention say that by that time he would know just what to do -- for help they he would the bee be so delighted with this news that they could not keep it to themselves but must go and tell they cousin the wasp and hornet and even bumblebee when the appoint time arrive the bee be on hand -- and so be the wasp hornet and bumblebee wakonda welcome the bee most kindly but be a little suspicious about they visitor and he ask some sharp question but the bee be in such good humor about the help that be come that they do not refer to the bad habit of they cousin at all then wakonda make a speech to the bee and tell they how much he love they for they industrious habit which he wish all creature have he praise they for the fact that instead of idly waste the summer day they use they in gather up food for the long cold winter then he proceed to give they the terrible sting which they have have ever since and as the wasp and hornet claim to be they cousin wakonda be good-natured enough to give they the same sort of weapon some people especially boy think this be a great mistake and would be very glad if wakonda have refuse to give sting to the yellow wasp and the black hornet well what happen after the bee get they sting say sagastao a good deal happen say mary and that very soon a lot of they without as much effort to conceal they nest as formerly select a tall hollow tree and use a big knot hole as the door begin secrete they honey in it they have make the comb and be now fill they when along come a couple of bear these animal as you have be tell be great honey thief but they always have hard work to find where the timid bee have cunningly hide it away and now they could hardly believe that right here before they be a great swarm of bee fill the air with they buzz as they fly in and out of the knot hole with saucy assurance they at once begin climb the tree expect to be able to put they long paw into that big hole and draw out the comb but they never reach that knot hole the noise they make in they climbing alarm the bee out they come in great number and now instead of fly around in a panic like so many house fly and see they honey devour they at once fly at they enemy the bear they sting they on they nose and about they eye and lip and indeed in every spot where they could possibly reach they with they terrible new weapon the bear could not make out what the trouble be they howl with rage and terror yet they be resolve to get that honey and still try to crawl up higher on the tree but at length the bee muster in such vast number -- for those away gather honey as they return join in the attack -- that the bear become wild with pain and fear and have to give up they effort and drop to the ground even then the bee give they no peace and continue to sting they until they be oblige to run into the dark forest for relief thus it happen now that almost all creature that bother the bee be similarly treat -lrb- illustration : they howl with rage and terror -rrb- well say minnehaha they need not have sting I because i be pick a few flower but after all i be glad they have they sting or i suppose we should never have any honey they be not big enough to have much sense reply sagastao and so they go for everyone that get in they way mary now carefully remove the clay poultice which have effectually do they work a wash follow in the water of the lake which ripple at they foot and soon not the slightest trace of the sting remain by the time they reach home both pain and tear be well-nigh forget that evening before the child be send to bed they overhear jakoo who have come to the house with venison to sell tell in the kitchen a story that he have hear from souwana about a naughty fellow call maheigan who try to capture a beautiful kind-hearted maiden waubenoo and of how nanahboozhoo thrash he and then afterward because of some naughty child not hold they tongue waubenoo be turn into the whisky jack what the little child overhear have very much excite they curiosity and so when mary be put they to bed they demand from she the full story as this be one of the saulteaux indian legend while mary be a cree she be not familiar with it she tell the child that she know nothing about it but this by no means set they curiosity at rest chapter iv the love story of wakonta -- he test of the two maiden -- he choice -- the transformation of misticoosis a few day later mary be annoy by have the child tell she frankly that they do not think she be a first-class story-teller for if she have be she ought to have be able to answer minnehaha 's question about what nanahboozhoo do to maheigan when he try to catch waubenoo mary be vex at herself that she be unable to answer the question for she well know that the child would not rest satisfied until they have the story tell they by some one possibly souwanas himself indeed know they so well she have fully resolve to post herself from one of the note story-teller who have all the indian legend at they tongue tip but as yet she be ignorant in this matter and therefore fall considerably in the child 's estimation alary be somewhat hurt by notice perhaps for the first time sagastao and minnehaha whispering confidentially to each other the child converse with mary only in she own language which at that time they perhaps understand better than they do english now much to mary 's annoyance they confidential whispering be carry on in english be sensitive and quick-tempered when she see this sudden break in they affection toward she she be incline to resent it and ask the reason why she be not allow to know what they be talk about blunt little sagastao speak up at once : minnehaha and i have talk it over and have decide that unless you tell we better story and one which you know all about we be go to run away to the wigwam of souwana this be humiliating and distressing news mary fancy she have tell they a good story and that with a few other like it she could satisfy they curiosity and keep they at home until the brief summer would have pass not so however think the child they see they advantage and be resolve to keep it and when they lesson be over and they be leave entirely in the charge of mary they tax the little woman in a way that oblige she to exercise all she gift as a story-teller and she be far from be a poor one one day she take they out in a graceful birch canoe among the picturesque island they land on one of these island and spend some time in explore its beauty and rest where grow a profusion of the fragrant indian grass they be for a time much interested in the various wild bird that then be so numerous and fearless beautiful gull of different variety be there nesting and by follow mary 's direction the child be delighted to find that they could approach very near to the nest of some of they without disturb the mother bird while she mate in fearless confidence stand on guard beside she -lrb- illustration : the startling placard -rrb- -lrb- illustration : while she mate stand beside she -rrb- now mary hurrah for a story cry the child as they sit at lunch while mary be wonder what she would tell they minnehaha with all the restless inquisitive spirit of childhood notice the ceaseless rustling movement of the leaf in the stately northern poplar while the leaf of all the other tree be so still say : why be it mary that even while the leaf on the other tree be so quiet those almost round one be ever stir mary know the indian legend and at once proceed to narrate it it be believe by we people say mary that there be other person just as clever as nanahboozhoo and as able to do wonderful thing but they be very seldom hear of some of they be the child of wakonda the powerful spirit who dwell in the region of spirit lake where they say it be always sunshine many strange thing have be tell about they but everybody say they be kind-hearted and never do anything to injure any of we people unless it be well deserve the story be that long ago one of these son of wakonda whose name be wakonta could not find a wife to suit he in he own beautiful country and so he come to the region where the indian dwell for a long time he wander throughout great region of country before he find anyone who interest he however in he journeying wakonta go into the wigwam of some indian where there be two lovely maiden so very beautiful that he fall in love with both of they he be in the disguise of a very fine-looking young hunter so clever be he in the use of he bow and arrow that at the end of every hunting excursion he return laden with the richest spoil of the chase he fall more and more in love with the two girl and know of course that he could only get one of they he find a great difficulty in make he choice he have already go to the girl 's father and after find out from he the price demand for he daughter without mention which one very quickly by he magic power he obtain the heavy price and lay it at the father 's foot both of the girl seem equally please with he and each one secretly hope that she might be the object of he choice still he hesitate and although he try many experiment yet they so nearly equal each other in cleverness and beauty that he be still undecided however there be a great difference in they disposition while one be proud and jealous and have a very bitter tongue the other be just the opposite while one be very selfish the other be generous and kind-hearted but wakonta be not able to find this out at first and after he have consider various plan he decide that he would put on one of he many disguise and thus try they so he start off as though go on a hunting expedition but soon after he be out of sight he quickly assume the form of a poor and aged indian and come to the home of these two beautiful sister and ask for assistance wakonta choose a time when he know the rest of the family be away from the wigwam in order that he might see how the two sister would act toward he when he walk into the wigwam for nobody ever knock at a indian tent the maiden be a little startled at thus suddenly see this rough-looking old beggar-man in they midst the selfish proud girl whose name be misticoosis at once begin assail he and cry ` auwasta kena ' -lrb- get out go away you -rrb- in vain he plead that he be aged and hungry she would not listen to he omemee the other young indian maiden who have not say a word but have be pity he from the first moment she see how feeble and sad he look now interfere and remonstrate with she sister whose tongue keep up a constant stream of abuse take the old man to she side of the wigwam she seat he on a rug of deerskin and then build up before he a bright fire then she quickly bring in venison cook it nicely and give he the broth for drink and the meat for food he thank she gratefully but she check he word and say that she greatest joy be in make other happy not satisfy with what she have do and notice that he shoe be old and worn she take out of she beaded workbag a pair of splendidly work moccasin and put they on he foot all this time while this good-hearted generous omemee be treat the poor old man so kindly the proud selfish misticoosis be talk as hard and as fast as she could against such deed of kindness to all old people in she opinion when they have get so old and helpless as that old fellow be they ought to be kill by they relative the old man again express he thanks to the kind sister and then go he way soon the girl begin to think of array themselves for the return of they friend and lover the proud selfish misticoosis spend all the time in fix herself up in the most elaborate manner she have lately become quite jealous of she sister and she be resolve to so outshine she in appearance that the handsome young hunter would surely prefer she but omemee -lrb- a name which mean a dive -rrb- think to herself : ` my father and mother and the rest of the family will soon be return to the wigwam tired and hungry and the best thing i can do will be to have a good dinner ready for they all ' so only take time to comb and brush she luxuriant hair and make herself neat and tidy for she work she set about cook the meal she skillfully prepare venison and bear 's meat and the finest of fish hardly have she finish she work and see everything nicely cook before she hear the happy shouting of she younger brother and the sweet birdcall of she little sister as omemee and she sister misticoosis hurry out to greet they they be surprise to see the handsome stranger glide along in he beautiful canoe alongside of the larger one of the family of course the sight of they lover excite the two girl misticoosis who have spend all the hour in array herself in she finery and adornment boldly thrust herself to the front and crowd out the modest omemee who be flush by the busy work of cook the dinner and be wisely dress in a costume which harmonize with she face and with the work in which she have be engage so industriously the instant the handsome young indian land -- fancy the amazement of the two girl to notice that he have on he foot the same beautiful moccasin that not many hour before omemee have give to the aged feeble man before anyone could utter a word he come stride up to the girl and say : ` as a old weary man i come to you wigwam a few hour ago misticoosis give I nothing but abuse yet my only crime be that i be old she tongue go on and on without stop and all of she word be word of abuse for the old man and anger that he should have be leave to live so long but omemee kind-hearted omemee pity the poor old man she make he sit down on a couch of deerskin that he might rest he tired limb she build a fire and warm he she take of the best of the venison and make he food and drink and then ere he leave she put on he foot the most beautiful of she moccasin all she gift to the unknown old man be the best she have ` see the beautiful moccasin the gift of omemee ' i be that old man -- i be now the lover long seek a bride i have make my choice two beautiful maiden for a time divide my heart there be no division now by test they i have find out that only one be lovely within ` that no man may have to put up through life with the unceasing clatter of the tongue of misticoosis she will be from this time the unbeautiful aspen tree while she tongue shall be the leaf that will never again be still even in the gentlest breeze the leaf of other tree shall rest at time but the aspen leave now the tongue of misticoosis shall ever be restless and unquiet ' and even while he be speak misticoosis who be amaze and ashamed at the word he speak become root to the ground and gradually turn into a aspen tree then turn from she to the maiden of he choice he exclaim : ` but omemee the love the tender the kind-hearted thou art my heart 's choice ' say this the handsome hunter open he arm and omemee spring toward he for a moment he hold she in he arm then he say : ' i be wakonta and to the beautiful home of wakonta thou shalt be take ' then there be a wonderful transformation as quickly as a butterfly burst from its chrysali so suddenly be omemee transform into a beautiful dive and the hunter as quickly assume the same lovely form together they arise into the air and fly away to the unknown but beautiful home of wakonta in the land of perpetual sunshine chapter v the startling placard -- what happen to the little runaway -- the rescue -- mary tell they the legend of the swallow -- how some cruel man be punish who tease a orphan boy when mary enter the child 's bedroom one bright pleasant morning she be amaze at find both of the bed empty and a piece of foolscap paper pin to the dress table the write on it be beyond she power to read she

when she mistress have ask the reason for they nonappearance not until she have show the paper with its inscription to the kitchen maid who could read english do its full meaning burst upon she of course she be very much troubled and yet such be she loyalty to the child that she hesitate about let the parent know what have occur she be fully aware that she could not long keep the startling news from they and yet she be still resolve that never should any information be impart by she that might bring down upon they any punishment no matter how much deserve it be a long rough trail through the primitive forest to the wigwam of souwana how long the child have be away she could not tell mary with indian shrewdness have feel they bed and have find they both quite cold so she know the little mischief have be off at least a hour she interrogate not only the maid in the kitchen but also kennedy the man of all work outside neither of they have see or hear anything of the child and as they do not share mary 's idea the escapade of the child be soon know the parent be naturally alarm when they hear the news at once the father accompany by kennedy and the dog jack and cuffy start off on the trail of the runaway the intelligent dog have be show a couple of garment recently worn by the miss boy and girl and be tell to find they at once take up the trail in the direction of the wigwam of

dog growl ominously dash off ahead utterly regardless of all effort make by they master to restrain they this suspicious conduct on the part of the dog of course alarm the father and he indian companion and as rapidly as the rough trail would allow they hurry on in the direction take by the dog soon they ear be greet by a chorus of loud and angry yelp fear give speed to both the man and soon they dash out from the forest into the opening of a indian 's clearing here be a sight that fill they with alarm and almost terror standing on a pile of log be little sagastao and minnehaha sagastao erect and fearless with a club about as large as a ordinary cane while behind he lean against a high fall log be minnehaha surround they be several fierce wolfish indian dog among whom jack and cuffy wild and furious be now make dire havoc one after another wound and limp the cur skulk away as the two man rush up to the child ha ha hurrah for we jack and cuffy be not they the boss dog shout the fearless little runaway and now that the victory be win they nimbly spring down from they high retreat and apparently without the slightest fear congratulate both they father and the indian on the superiority of they own dog tremble with anxiety the anxious father thankful at the narrow escape of he child as he clasp they in he arm could not but be amaze at the indifference of the little one to the great danger from which they have just escape after pet jack and cuffy for they great bravery and courage the return journey be begin much to the regret of the child who plead hard to be allow to resume they trip to the wigwam of souwana to hear the story of nanahboozhoo -lrb- illustration : surround they be several fierce wolfish indian dog -rrb- the father be perfectly amaze at this request and of course it be sternly refuse he have start off in pursuit of the runaway with a resolve to punish they for this serious breach of home discipline but he alarm at they danger and he thankfulness for they escape have so stir he that he could not punish they nor even chide they at the time all he could do be to bring they safely home again and as usual in such emergency turn they over to the tender mercy of they mother sturdily the child march on ahead for a while then kennedy the indian take minnehaha in he arm he have not carry she many hundred yard before the weary little one fall fast asleep softly mutter as she slip off into the land of dream want to hear about nanahboozhoo great be the excitement at home when the party return sagastao rush into the arm of he mother and without the slightest idea of have do anything wrong begin most dramatically to describe how we jack and cuffy thrash those naughty eskimo dog that chase minnehaha and he upon that great pile of log mary in the meantime have take from kennedy 's arm the still sleep minnehaha and almost smother she with kiss as she bear she away to bed there be great perplexity on the part of the parent to know just what to do to impress upon the little one that they have be very naughty in thus run away for it be very evident from the utterance of both that they have not consider the matter in that light now in view of the weariness of minnehaha it be decide to leave the matter of discipline in abeyance until a little of the excitement have pass away in the meantime sagastao be ready to talk with everybody about the whole affair it seem that he and minnehaha have decide that mary be no good in tell story he say she story neither frighten they nor make they cry but souwana be the boss man to tell nanahboozhoo story he say they get up before anybody be stir that morning and dress themselves so quietly that nobody hear they they remember the trail along which souwana and jakoo have carry they after they have walk for some time they come to where there be a larger trail and they turn into it and come upon a lot of dog that have be chase some rabbit soon the rabbit get away from the dog when they reach those tree that have be chop down minnehaha be the first to notice that the dog have turn back and be come after they and she shout : ' o look those dog think we be rabbit and they be

shake the stick at they and -- and i shout : ' a wus atimuk ' -lrb- get away you dog -rrb- they come so near on the log that i hit one or two of they while all of the other on the ground keep bark at we but i keep shout back at they ' a wus atimuk ' my it be great fun then all at once we hear jack and cuffy and i tell you soon there be more fun when we big dog spring at they every time a eskimo be tackle by jack or cuffy he go down and be soon howl from the way in which he be shake and they have nearly thrash the whole of they when papa and kennedy come rush up i wish they have be there sooner to have see all the fun thus the lad 's tongue rattle on while it be evident he be utterly unconscious of the danger they have be in after some deliberation it be decide that in view of this runaway be the first offense of the kind the punishment should be confinement to they own room the next day until six o'clock in the evening on a diet of bread and water at this mary be simply furious she well know however that it be necessary for she to control herself in she master 's and mistress 's presence she manage to hold she tongue but she flash eye and a occasional mutter which would come out as she go about she usual duty show the smolder fire that be burn inside the child have be duly lecture for they breach of discipline and then that evening consign to they room for they imprisonment which be to last until the next evening that night mary take up she mattress and blanket and go and sleep on the floor between the two bed of the child and in spite of order so the maid say she secretly carry up a goodly size bundle from the kitchen the day be one of unusual quietness as the lively pair who generally keep the house full of music be now suppose to be away in humiliation and disgrace all regret that the punishment have to be inflict and the child make to realize they naughtiness in thus run away and all be look forward to the hour of six o'clock with pleasant anticipation when it arrive word be send to the child that they hour of imprisonment be over and that they be to present themselves in the library quick and prompt be the response and noisily and hurriedly the two darling come rush down the stair follow by mary they be array in they most beautiful apparel and be evidently prepare by they nurse to go with she for a walk the father feeling that it be necessary begin to make a few remark expressive of regret that he have thus be oblige to punish they when he be interrupt by little sagastao with the honest and candid remark speak in a way which while perfectly fearless be yet devoid of all rudeness or impertinence : o father dear you need not feel badly about we at all as mary have be with we all day and have tell we lovely story and mary bring we taffy candy break in darling minnehaha with equal candor and some currant cake and other nice thing so we get on very well after all these candid utterance on the part of the two child not only amaze but amuse the parent and be another revelation of mary 's wonderful love for the child and she defiance of disciplinary measure which she think might cause the slightest pain or sorrow and here she stand in the open door and as soon as they father 's word and they own rather startling confession be end she call they to she and away they go for a long walk along the beautiful shore of the lake leave they parent to conjecture whether the punishment that have be inflict would produce any very salutary result when the child be gather that evening in the study with they parent little sagastao say : papa minnehaha and i have be talk it all over with mary and she have show we that it be naughty on we part to run away as we do and we be sorry that we do anything that cause you and mamma sorrow and anxiety about we and so well we know you will forgive we and as the four little arm go twine around the parent ' neck there be joy and gladness all round and it be evident that there be no danger of the escapade be repeat the follow be a couple of the legend that mary tell they while they be prisoner in they own room that day the legend of the swallow long ago say mary there be some indian family who live on the top of a very high hill like a mountain they have quite a number of small child and i be sorry to say they be very naughty and would often disobey they parent one of they bad deed be to run away and thus make the father and mother very unhappy until they return they parent be very much afraid that some of the windegoo or wild animal would catch they when they thus run away by themselves with no strong man to guard they so the parent try to make they home as nice as possible for they they make all sort of toy for they and give they nice little bow and arrow and other thing that ought to have amuse they and keep they happy at home all the effort of they parent however be of no use they soon be tire of they home amusement and when they parent ' back be turn they would run away at length they conduct become so bad and the parent find themselves so powerless to prevent it that they decide to appeal to the indian council for assistance for a time the stern command of the chief be listen to and obey then they neglect he word and about as frequently as ever they be find play truant from they home and parent at length on one occasion when they have all run away and have be off for several day and could not be find they father and mother call upon wakonda to look for they and to send they home wakonda be very angry when he hear about these naughty child run away so much and so he set off in a hurry to find they after a long search he discover they on the bank of a muddy river make mud hut and mud animal he be so angry at they that he at once turn they into swallow and say ` from this time forward you will ever be wanderer and you home will always be make of mud ' and so it have be i say mary do you remember that yarn because minnehaha and i run away say sagastao well we be not make mud hut say minnehaha mary be not to be catch however even if she do love they so much and she do not answer sagastao 's question although in she heart she be not sorry if he see something in the legend that would deter he from again run away how some cruel man be punish who tease a orphan boy there be once a old grandmother who be leave alone with only a orphan grandson all of she other relative be dead this boy be a very industrious little fellow and do all that he could to help he grandmother they both have to work very hard to have sufficient to

nanahboozhoo -- how he lose he brother nahpootee the wolf -- why the kingfisher wear a white collar who be this nanahboozhoo that we be hear so much about thus be the old story-teller address by sagastao who always be anxious to learn about those who interest he the old man begin in this way : when the great mountain be wrap in the cloud we do not see they very well so it be with nanahboozhoo the long year that have pass since he live have like the fog and mist make it less easy to say exactly who he really be but i will try to tell you nanahboozhoo be not from one tribe only but from all the indian hence it be that he very name be so different the ojibway call he mishawabus -- great rabbit the menominus call he manabush he have other name also one tribe call he jouskeha another messou

mother of twin boy but at they birth she die and so do one of the boy nokomis wrap the living child in soft dry grass lay it on the ground at one end of she wigwam and place over it a great wooden bowl to protect it from harm then in she grief she take up the body of wenonah she daughter and bury it with the dead child at some distance from she wigwam when she return from thus lay away she dead she sit down in she wigwam and for four day mourn she loss at the end of that time she hear a slight noise in she wigwam which she soon find come from that wooden bowl then as the bowl move she

matter what have happen a great munedoo -lrb- spirit -rrb- be bear somewhere ' and at once they begin to devise means by which they might kill manabush or nanahboozhoo as he be now call when they should find he but nanahboozhoo do not long continue to look like a rabbit as he be superior to other people he could change himself to any form he like he be most frequently see as a fine strong young indian hunter he call the people he uncle when he grow up he say to he grandmother the old nokomi that the time have come when he should prepare himself to go and help he uncle the people to better they condition this he be able to do see he be more than human for he father be the west wind and he mother a great-granddaughter of the moon sometimes he be the beautiful white rabbit then he would be a wolf or a wolverine then he would be a lovely bird he could even change himself to look like a dry old stump or a beautiful tree sometimes he would be like a little half-frozen rabbit then he would be a mighty magician and often a little snake he be just as changeable in he disposition as in he outward appearance sometimes he be do the best thing imaginable for he uncle the indian people and at other time he be full of mischief and trickery but on the whole he be a friend and although quick-tempered and fiery yet he do lot of fine thing for the people for he be really one of the best of the munedoo of the early time when the time come for he to leave he grandmother 's wigwam he build one for himself and then he ask nokomis to prepare for he the sacred magical musical stick which she alone could make he grandmother make he four stick and with these he use to beat time when sing he queer song some of they be very queer and end up with ` he he ho ho ha ha hi hi '

the year go by he do some thing that cause he to be fear very much he uncle always go to he when they get into trouble but whether he would help they or not depend much on the humor he be in when they come -lrb- illustration : the beautiful reflection in the water -rrb- after he have live for year in the first wigwam which he have build and teach the people of the earth many thing he father the west wind hold a council with the north wind and the south wind and the east wind and as nanahboozhoo be never marry and be live such a lonely life they determine to restore to life and give to reside with he he twin brother who have die at he birth the name of this brother be nahpootee which mean the skillful hunter nanahboozhoo be very fond of he and take great care of he he grow very rapidly and he and nanahboozhoo be very great friend like nanahboozhoo nahpootee could disguise himself in any form he choose one favorite form he often assume be that of a wolf as he be often away on hunting excursion the evil spirit or windegoo who dwell under the land and sea have never be able to do much harm to nanahboozhoo he be too clever for they and although they often try he generally worst they now they be doubly angry when they hear that nahpootee have be restore to life and be live with he nanahboozhoo warn he brother of they enmity and of the necessity of be on he guard against they these brother move far away and build they wigwam in a lonely country on the shore of a great lake which be now call mirror lake because of its beautiful reflection here as he be a hunter nahpootee be keep busy supply the wigwam with food once while he be away hunting nanahboozhoo discover that some of the evil munedoo dwell in the bottom of the very lake on the shore of which they have build they wigwam so he warn he brother nahpootee never to cross that lake but always to go around on the shore and for some time he remember this warning and be not attack but one cold winter day when he have be out for a long time hunting he find himself exactly on the opposite side of the lake from the wigwam the ice seem strong and as the distance be shorter he decide that rather than walk around on the shore he would cross on the ice when about half-way across the lake the ice break he be seize by the evil munedoo and drown when nahpootee fail to return to the wigwam nanahboozhoo be fill with alarm and at once begin search everywhere for he loved lose brother one day when he be walk under some tree at the lake he behold high up among the branch ookiskimunisew the kingfisher ` what be you do there ' ask nanahboozhoo ` the bad munedoo have kill nahpootee ' ookiskimunisew reply ` and soon they be go to throw he body up on the shore and i be go to feast on it ' this answer make nanahboozhoo very angry but he conceal he feeling ` come down here handsome bird ' he say ` and i 'll give you this collar to hang on you neck ' the kingfisher suspect that the speaker be nanahboozhoo the brother of nahpootee and he be afraid to descend ` come down and have no fear ' say nanahboozhoo in a friendly tone ' i only want to give you this beautiful necklace to wear with the white shell hang from it ' on hear this the kingfisher come down but suspect that nanahboozhoo would be up to some of he trick he keep a sharp watch on he nanahboozhoo place the necklace about the neck of the bird so that the beautiful white shell should be over the breast then he pretend to tie the end behind but just as he have make a half knot in the cord and be go to tighten it and strangle the bird the latter be too quick for he and suddenly slip away and escape he keep the necklace however and the white spot may be see on the breast of the kingfisher to this day soon after this the shade or ghost of nahpootee appear to nanahboozhoo and tell he that as he death be the result of he own carelessness in not keep on the land he would not be restore to live here but be even now on he way to the happy hunting grounds in the land of the setting sun beyond the great mountain nanahboozhoo be deeply move by the loss of he brother who have be such a pleasant companion to he so great be he grief that at time the earth tremble and the evil spirit dwelling under the land or water be much terrify for they know they would be terribly punish by nanahboozhoo if he should ever get they in he power but it be a long

cariole by they careful driver they speed along the trail they make the wood echo with they merry shout and laughter -- unless it be so bitterly cold that they have to be completely cover up it be not to be wonder at that there be time when on reach some distant wigwam there be little hard white spot on they cheek or nose which tell the watchful indian that the frost king have be at work and that speedily those frostbite must be remove little care they for the momentary pain that ensue when the frozen part be be thaw out they be out for a good time and they have too much grit and courage to let such trifle as a few frostbite disturb they happiness the bright fire burn in the center of the wigwam or in the fireplace at the end or side of the little indian house be of course always welcome after a long run in the bitter cold tell we souwana say sagastao one very cold day as they be gather around he wigwam fire how it be that nanahboozhoo steal the fire from those who be guard it and give it to the indian it must not be too long a story say minnehaha as we have yet to go to the wigwam of kinnesasis little fish with he present and it would be too bad to be late when they know we be come so souwanas pledge himself to make the story as short as he could without spoil it and then after a few more whiff from he beloved calumet he begin : it be long ago when there be fewer people in the forest and on the prairie than now they do not have as many comfort as they have now and one of the rarest thing among they be fire sometimes when the lightning 's flash set a tree on fire they would have it for a little while but they do not seem to be able to keep it go and they be often very cold and generally have to eat they food without cooking it nanahboozhoo be then still live with he grandmother nokomi and be sorry to see that she often suffer from the cold and that the food be miserable because it be not cook so he set he wit to work and decide that something must be do as he should now have to deal with the muche munedoo evil spirit he have to be very careful he put himself in various disguise and at length he hear all about how the coyote have steal some of the fire from the watcher in the underground world who possess enormous quantity of it it frighten he a little when he hear that there be so much fire in the world under we but he be not apt to be afraid very long and so as he go on search and on the sly listen to the talk of windegoo and other he find that the fire for which he have be so long search be in the possession of a fierce old medicine warrior who guard it with the greatest care those who have employ the coyote to get it have intrust its keep to he in those day they have a idea that fire be such a dangerous thing that it would be almost certain destruction to the race if it be give to all this old warrior have he two daughter who be great fierce woman to assist he in guard the fire several attempt have be make to steal the fire ere nanahboozhoo resolve to see what he could do all of these other effort have fail and the party who try they be kill nokomis hear of these unsuccessful attempt and try to dissuade she grandson nanahboozhoo from such a dangerous enterprise nanahboozhoo however be a very skillful fellow and although this be one of he first great undertaking for it be long ago he be not to be stop by she fear and so away he go as the ice be not yet on the water he take he birch canoe and paddle eastward as far as he could then he hide he canoe where he could easily find it on he return the next thing he do be to transform himself into a rabbit and in that shape he hurry on until he see in the distance the sacred wigwam where dwell the old guardian of the fire and he two daughter who be famous for they height and they strength to excite the pity of these daughter nanahboozhoo jump into some water and then crawl out wet and cold he slowly approach the wigwam here the two daughter find he and he look so miserable that they take pity on he and at once carry he into the wigwam and set he down near the sacred fire that he might soon get warm and dry -lrb- illustration : where the fire be steal out of the center of the earth -rrb- how very kind that be of the old man 's daughter say minnehaha i do not know about that say the more matter-of-fact sagastao folk sometimes get into trouble by take up everything that come along remember that old rascal that humbug father but souwana remember he promise adroitly shunt off the youngster and resume he story the two girl after see how contented and happy the rabbit seem to be as it warm itself by the fire again return to they duty in different part of the large wigwam the rabbit soon after hop a little nearer to the fire that he might be able to seize hold of a burning stick or brand but as he move the ground shake and tremble under he so that it awake the old man who have fall into a heavy sleep thus disturb he call out to he daughter in alarm : ` my daughter what be it that cause the ground to tremble ' the girl reply that they do not know they have do nothing beyond they usual work except to bring in to warm a poor little shiver half-frozen rabbit that they have find outside at first the old man be a little suspicious and rolling over he take a good look at nanahboozhoo but he have make himself into such a poor little wretched half-drowned rabbit that the old man 's suspicion be completely dispel and he turn over again and go to sleep nanahboozhoo be please to hear the old man snore again and he only wait now until the two girl should both be busy in the wigwam on the opposite side from the door then he suddenly change himself into a fleet young indian runner and quickly seize hold of a burning stick he dash out of the wigwam and away he rush toward the place where he have leave he canoe of course there be instant pursuit the two daughter although they be magician like they father well know that they would be punish by the superior evil spirit if they allow any of the sacred fire to be steal and they be furious at the cunning and deceitful nanahboozhoo whom they now recognize for play such a trick upon they shout to they father to arouse he they immediately run after the retreat nanahboozhoo who with the burning brand in he hand be speed rapidly over the trail but fleet as he be he soon discover that the two girl by they magic be rapidly gain upon he they be the fleetest of runner even if they be girl and it be for that reason that they and they father be intrust with the sacred fire great honor be to be theirs if they guard it to the satisfaction of those who have intrust it to they while on the other hand great would be they disgrace if they fail in they duty when they find that they be gain on nanahboozhoo and be likely to regain possession of the firebrand with shout and threat they declare that severe indeed would be he punishment when he fall into they hand for he abuse of they kindness and he trickery nanahboozhoo feel that he be indeed in a tight place he do not however intend to be overtake and he speed on if possible faster than ever until there be only a large dried-up barren meadow between he and the spot where he have tie he canoe on the shore of the lake the girl be only a few hundred yard behind he and he resolve to fight they with this sacred fire so as he rapidly continue he flight he plunge the now blaze firebrand into the dry grass here and there on each side of the trail the wind be in he face and it carry back the fierce blaze and dense black smoke and not only quickly hide he from the sight of he pursuer but also make it very dangerous for they to follow he nanahboozhoo thus succeed in reach he canoe and fix the burning brand in one end of the boat he be soon rapidly paddle over the water toward he distant home the fly spark of the torch burn he badly in several place but he do not much mind this and he dare not stop to dress he wound for fear that he pursuer would yet overtake he fortunately he succeed in reach he distant home there at the shore to welcome he return be nokomis who have be full of anxiety about he she carefully dress he burnt face and hand and gladly receive the gift of the fire which have be such a blessing to the indian ever since at first there be a good deal of trouble among the indian to keep the fire burning sometimes the watcher appoint to look after it especially in the summer month would forget to add fresh fuel or would go to sleep and neglect it then they would have to send off to some perhaps distant wigwam where the people have be more careful and secure some live coal from they nanahboozhoo be trouble about this he fear that if it be allow to die out at the same time in all of the wigwam he might not be so successful again if he have to try to get a fresh supply from the fierce old man and he now wrathful daughter so he go out into the wood and at length a good spirit come to he in a dream and tell he of various way in which the fire could be obtain he show he how it could be make by rapid friction with dry stick another way he reveal to he be by the striking together of a flint stone and a piece of iron spark of fire could thus be produce which catch in punk would soon become a blaze so now the indian do not have to cover up the fire as they be formerly oblige to do thanks to nanahboozhoo 's dream they can make it fresh whenever they want it hurrah for nanahboozhoo for he good work this time say sagastao well i think he be a mean fellow to so fool those two nice girl who take he in and warm he when he be a poor little wet shiver rabbit say minnehaha take he in the lad retort well i guess it be well he be able to take they in as he do by set fire to that old grass in the meadow for if he have not do so they would soon have have he scalp but here minnehaha appeal to souwana and say : i have be wonder how it be the old man and he daughter get the fire in the first place from out of the underground will you not tell we that story some time the old man look grave and be silent for a minute or two then he reply : i think you have better ask kinnesasis he know the story better than i do for in he youth he travel far west into the land of the high mountain where the legend be that the fire be steal out of the center of the earth all right thank you souwanas we be go to take kinnesasis some present and while there we will ask he for the story here a indian lad rush into the wigwam with the word that kennedy be come with they cariole the child be well wrap up and soon with they usual happy wat cheer wat cheer they be speed homeward chapter ix kinnesasis -- how the coyote obtain the fire from the interior of the earth a great time the child have in the wigwam of kinnesasis he be such a jolly little old indian and he be specially happy to-day when the child open out the gift and present they he be more than delighted with a suit of black clothes send he from a distance by friend who have hear about he and he need he quickly put on the whole suit which fit he very nicely and then much amuse the child by say : i be

such a fuss over the man who make they he be pay for make they say sagastao but kinnesasis could only think of the man who make the suit of which he be so proud kinnesasis 's old wife be if possible still more delighted with she present than the old man with he she and minnehaha be always the best of friend and now as the child hand she gift after gift of warm clothing and food she joy know no bound and old as she be when some warm shoe be give she she spring up and begin sing a indian song while with all the agility of a young maiden she spin around the wigwam in rhythmic measure to she word which roughly translate be as follow : the good spirit have pity on I though for day i have little to eat i be wretched and sad in my heart i be cold o so cold in my foot but now i have plenty of meat clothes for my body shoe for my foot i 'll not grumble nor sorrow but praise the good spirit the rest of my day well do shout the child when the old woman stop they be greatly delighted with she performance kinnesasis however who as well as he wife be now a church member profess to be much shock at see she thus dance as though in the wild excitement of the ghost dance but both sagastao and minnehaha stand up for the old wife they say the word she sing be good enough for the church any day and they be sure nobody could find fault with she thus show how glad and thankful she be and nobody ever do find fault and soon be the affair almost forget for now the merry jingle of more dog bell be hear and who should come into the wigwam of kinnesasis but the parent of sagastao and minnehaha cordially be they greet at first it be difficult for they to recognize the staid little gentleman in he full suit of broadcloth as the lively but generally ill-clothed kinnesasis the visitor -- who quickly see and be delighted with the transformation -- greet he as though he be some distinguished stranger this vastly amuse the child scream with laughter at kinnesasis 's pretense of keep up the farce they shout out why this be only we dear old kinnesasis he be no great stranger it be only kinnesasis with he new clothes well then be ask who be that charming old lady over there with such a fine shawl and brilliant handkerchief on and such fancy new shoe on she foot surely she be a stranger no no the child again shout why that be kinnesasis 's wife with she new present on my do not she look nice here the little one seize hold of the happy old indian woman and make she get up and show herself off in she new apparel of which she be just as proud as kinnesasis and she give we such a jolly dance in they papa would not you like to see she do it again cry minnehaha but here kinnesasis pretend to be shock beyond measure in a most diplomatic manner direct the attention of the parent to some other matter and so the mischievous child do not succeed in make a church scandal by induce one of the flock to dance before the missionary tell we kinnesasis say sagastao how it be that that old man and he daughter first obtain the fire which nanahboozhoo so cleverly steal from they and give to the indian long ago at first kinnesasis hesitate about tell the old legend say that he do not think the father and mother of the child would care for such story do not they though cry the child you do not know they very well then if you do not know that they like story just about as well as we do and with this they at once appeal to the parent who of course side with they and express they desire to listen to this story that the child have tell they they be to hear from dear old kinnesasis throw some more log on the fire around which the white visitor with the indian gather kinnesasis begin : it be long ago when i be a young lad that i hear the story from the old story-teller of we people i have travel with my father for many day far toward the setting sun we reach the land of the great mountain and there with we people of those region we spend some moon it be while we be among they that i hear from the ancient story-teller the legend of how the fire be steal from the center of the earth where it be keep hide away from the human family that there be such a thing as fire be well know it have be see burst out of the top of distant mountain and there have be time in great thunderstorm when the lightning have set fire to dead tree -- and indeed in this latter way the indian have become acquaint with its value to the human race but they have not take care to keep it burn and no one have be appoint to specially look after it the reason why fire have not be from the first give to man be because when the race be create the fire be not much need the earth be then much warmer than it be now there be no snow or ice ever see except on the top of the very highest mountain great animal now all dead and other that could only live in the hottest country live all over these great land then there be abundance of fruit and nut and root that be all very good for food then some great disaster happen to the world and soon it begin to grow colder and many animal and even family perish snow and ice appear where they be never see before there be great suffering from the cold the hunter begin to kill the animal for food they be now not satisfy with the fruit and root they want something better so the fire be much need but where it be or how to get it be the question fortunately a old dreamer dream a dream about it as the council assemble to hear he dream he tell they that the fire be preserve in the heart of the earth by a magician call sistinakoo and that it be keep very carefully surround by four wall one within the other in each of which be a single door at the first door a great snake keep guard at the second door a mountain lion or panther be the guardian a grizzly bear guard the third door and at the fourth and last door sistinakoo himself keep watchful care over the precious fire that smolder on a stone altar just inside this last wall when the council hear all this they be almost discourage they think it would be impossible for anyone to get by all of these guard and steal the fire they first ask the fox to try but he only reach the first door when the great snake nearly make a meal of he thoroughly frighten he rush back to the top of the earth and tell of he narrow escape for a time nothing more be do to try and get the fire the people continue to suffer for the earth keep get colder and colder and ice and snow be now to be find in land that have previously be comfortably warm so the council be call again and the question again raise as to what could be do it happen that there come to the council a very old man who remember a tradition hand down from he forefather which say that part of the earth beneath we be hollow and that some of the animal even the great buffalo have dwell in those underground region before they come to dwell on the surface of the earth he say that the coyote the prairie wolf be the last one to leave and that he be sure that he still remember the route to the very spot where sistinakoo the head chief of the region guard the fire so jealously why should they so guard the fire and be so careful about let people have it when we know how good it be ask minnehaha because reply kinnesasis there be a tradition that at some time or other the fire should get the mastery over man and the whole world be burn by it and they think that they would carefully guard it from get scatter about by careless people who might set the world on fire well go on kinnesasis and tell we the rest of the story say the impatient sagastao so when the indian council hear this story they send for the king of the coyote and tell he of they wish that he should return to that underworld and bring up the fire for they use to they surprise and great delight the coyote say he would go and he immediately begin he preparation for the journey so greatly have the cold increase that he find the dark mouth of the entrance under the mountain almost surround by snow and ice after travel for some time in the darkness he reach the outer wall where he wait a little distance from the door until the snake be take he usual sleep then he quickly step past he know the habit of the other animal he wait until they be asleep and then he noiselessly pass they all even sistinakoo himself be sound asleep so the coyote creep silently up to the fire and light the large brand or torch that be securely fasten to he tail the instant it begin to blaze up as the coyote rush out through the first door sistinakoo shout ` who be there some one have be here and have steal the fire ' -lrb- illustration : the coyote be too quick for they all -rrb- he at once begin to make a great row and loudly call to the different keeper to close the door in the wall but the coyote be too quick for they all and ere the sleeper be wide enough awake to do anything he have pass through all the door and be far on he way to the top of the ground the fire be gladly receive by the people but after some time when some big prairie and forest have be burn up by it the man get fearful that the world might be destroy and so they intrust it to the care of the old magician and he two daughter with order to be very careful to whom they give any it be from they nanahboozhoo steal it to scatter it once more freely among the people as we now have it but the tradition be still believe in the day of my grandfather that good as the fire be to warm we and cook we food it would yet become we master and do the world much harm kinnesasis be thank by all for he recital of this suggestive legend especially by he older listener who see much in it that be in harmony with the earlier belief of other nationality by this time however the dog in they train be impatiently bark and longing to get back home for they supper so after farewell greeting to kinnesasis and he wife one cariole after another be load and away the happy one speed over the icy expanse of the frozen lake chapter x the christmas packet -- the distribution of gift -- a visit by dog train at fifty-five below zero -- souwana tell how the indian first learn to make maple sugar how great the excitement be which attend the arrival of the christmas packet can hardly be realize by person who have never be expose to the privation of a land which the mail reach every six month and where they wait half a year for the daily paper after this long wait it be no wonder that a great shout be raise when far away in the distance the long-expected heavily-loaded dog-train be see that for several hundred mile have carry the precious message of love and the token of good will from dear one far away this year a extra train well load with much-needed supplies for the mission be among the arrival its come be hail with special delight by the child for even in that northland santa claus be not unexpected and it be surmise by some of the wee one that possibly some of he gift would arrive about that time and they be not disappoint for loved one far away in more favored land have remember these little one in they northern home where the frost king reign and many and varied be the gift which they now receive i be go to take souwana some of my candy say sagastao and i be go to give he a nice red silk handkerchief say minnehaha the child have by this time pretty well learn he weakness for these thing and it be a pleasure now for they to think that they have it in they power to make he happy the next morning be as usual bright and cloudless but it be bitterly cold the mercury be freeze in one thermometer and in the other one the spirit indicate fifty-five below zero yet so impatient be these spirited child to be off with they gift to souwana and with something also for each member of the family that they pleading prevail a cariole with plenty of fur robe be soon at the door and with old kennedy as they driver they be soon speed away behind a train of dog indian be naturally alert and watchful and so the merry jingle of the silvery bell be hear while the cariole be still at some distance on the trail cordially be they welcome and strong arm speedily carry they into the cosy wigwam where in the center burn a great fire of dry spruce and birch wood as the cold be so intense and the child have permission to remain for two hour it be decide that kennedy should return home at once with the dog as it would have be cruel to have keep they out in the cold so long the heavy wrap be soon remove and the child be comfortably seat on the fur rug provide for they then they very proudly open they parcel and distribute the contents -- they own gift as well as those which have be send to souwana and he family from the mission minnehaha reserve she special gift for the last when all of she other have be bestow she unfold the beautiful red silk handkerchief and go over to souwanas she do she best to tie it nicely around he neck the old man genuine indian that he be be much move by she winsome way and handsome gift he say but little but there be a soft kindly look in he eye that show he gratitude more than any word could have do it mean a good deal more than perhaps he would like to admit and those who see it be thankful that they have observe it know that it mean so much sagastao who have already give he several present have hold on to he box of candy he have learn that for such thing the old man could be coax to do almost anything and now he hold they out and say : now souwana as all the present have be pass around i have get some fine sweetie for you but we must have a first-class nanahboozhoo story for they o yes say minnehaha and as it be to be for sweetie let we have a nice sweet story of nanahboozhoo this time a sweet story you want well before i begin let we fix up the fire and all get comfortably seat around it then as they usually do the two white child cuddle as close to the inimitable story-teller as they could little care they for the cold without or even for the occasional puff of smoke which seem at time to prefer to enter the eye of the listener rather than to go out at the orifice at the top of the wigwam a sweet story musingly say the old man in this land of fish and bear and wolf and wildcat and wolverine then he pause long enough to fill he mouth again with the candy which he enjoy so much a sweet story then it must be of a land south of this where for some year i dwelt many many moon ago a land where the se-se-pask-wut-a-tik -lrb- sugar maple tree -rrb- grow and flourish in all its beauty there in those wigwam long ago live the people whom we call the huron the dakotah and the ojibway these ojibway be cousin of my own people the saulteaux well the story i want to tell you have its beginning long long ago one day there come a great embassage of indian from the far south with word of peace and good will they say that in they country they have no cold weather and very seldom see any snow they say that the tree be different and that many thing grow there that they do not see in we northern country they bring with they many present and be kindly receive by we people and then after some week of feast and speech-make they return home laden with the best gift we tribe could bestow among the present which these southern indian bring be a large quantity of sugar this be the first time it be ever see among the indian of the north it be very much prize and be very carefully divide among the people so that each one have a small quantity it do not last very long for everybody be fond of it when it be all go the people be sorry and the question be ask ` why can not we send a company of we own people and get more of it ' this suggestion meet with the favor of the tribe and a large party of the best runner be select and be well supply with rich present and pipe of peace they start off to find the southland and to obtain abundance of the sugar some week pass by before word be hear from they and the news be very bad fierce war have break out among the tribe that live between ours and those who dwell in that far south we indian have to fight for they life many of they be kill other be badly wound and of the large company that start out not more than half ever return to they home the expedition be a complete failure still there be the memory of the sugar among they and it happen that one day in the council somebody say : ` why not send to nanahboozhoo ' good shout minnehaha that be just what i think they would do well hold on say she more matter-of-fact brother just as like as not nanahboozhoo would give they salt instead of sugar if he be in one of he tantrum souwana be not displeased at this interruption on the part of the child and gladly avail himself of the opportunity thus offer to once more help himself to the sweet earnestly appeal to souwanas minnehaha who always look on the bright side of thing and who have a quick intuition quite beyond she year say : it could not be a sweet story if nanahboozhoo give they salt instead of sugar could it souwana the old man as soon as he mouth be sufficiently empty to resume he story amuse by the earnestness with which the child appeal to he reply with the word tapwa tapwa -lrb- verily verily -rrb- sagastao however unwilling to give in retorted o ` tapwa tapwa ' do not mean anything anyway souwana only laugh at this criticism and proceed with he story -lrb- illustration : across a single log at a dizzy height -rrb- so it be decide to send a deputation to nanahboozhoo to tell he of the wish of the tribe to have se-se-pask-wut -lrb- sugar -rrb- as have the tribe of the southland the deputation who start off to find nanahboozhoo have a great deal of difficulty in find he it seem that a great strife have arise between nanahboozhoo and some of the underground muche munedoo -- bad spirit sometimes call the ana-mak-quin -- who have determine to kill nokomi the grandmother of nanahboozhoo because of they spiteful hatred of nanahboozhoo whom they know they could not kill because he have supernatural power nanahboozhoo have as usual be play some of he prank on they and that be why they be determine to kill nokomi what be some of the trick that nanahboozhoo have be up to this time ask sagastao it would take I too long to tell you now reply souwanas nanahboozhoo dearly love he grandmother although he be often give she great fright just as other grandson sometimes do so when he hear of what the muche munedoo be threaten he take up he grandmother on he strong back and carry she far away and make for she a tent of maple in a great forest among the mountain the only access to it be across a single log at a dizzy height over a wild rush river it be now in the fall of the year and the leaf of these tree be all crimson and yellow so brilliant that when see from a long distance they look like a great fire thus it happen that when the bad spirit follow after nanahboozhoo and nokomi see the brilliant color through the haze of that indian summer day they think the whole country be on fire and they turn back and trouble they no more nanahboozhoo be pleased that the beautiful maple tree have be of so much assistance to he he decide to dwell among they for some time so he prepare a very comfortable wigwam for himself and he grandmother it be in the wigwam among the maple that the deputation find nanahboozhoo he receive they kindly and listen to they story and they request at first nanahboozhoo be perplexed he be such a great traveler that he have often be down in the great southland and well know how the sugar be there make he have see the field of sugar cane and know the whole process by which the juice be squeeze out and then boil down into sugar he also know that it require a lot of hard work before the sugar be make when nokomi hear the request of the deputation to she grandson she be very much interested -- for have not nanahboozhoo several time when return from those trip to the south bring back to she some of the sugar -- and she have like it very much and so now she add she pleading to theirs that he would in some way grant they they request of course nanahboozhoo could not refuse now so he tell they that as the beautiful maple tree have be so good to he and nokomi from this time forward they should like the sugar cane of the south yield the sweet sap that when boil down would make the sugar they like so much he tell they however that it be not for the lazy one to have but only for those who be industrious and would carry out he command then nanahboozhoo describe to they the whole process of sugar make he tell they that only in the spring of the year would the sweet sap flow then they be to have ready they tap gouge they spile and bucket great fireplace be to be build and here as fast as the sap be gather from the tree it be to be boil down in they little kettle into the nice molasses and then a little more so that when it cool it would harden into sugar ` now ' add nanahboozhoo ` go back to you people and tell they that it depend on they industry between now and the spring who shall have the most of the sugar you love so well ' then he skillfully model out a stone tap gouge of the shape require to make the incision in the tree from which the sap would flow with he knife he make a sample spile of cedar the thin end of which be to be drive into the hole make by the gouge and along which the sap would flow then he tell they to make plenty of bucket of birch bark and thus be ready when the time come to secure a abundant supply of sap thus the art of make maple sugar first come to be know nanahboozhoo give it to the indian long ago then when the paleface come they follow the same process that be the way nanahboozhoo show we how to get the maple sugar but here the sound of the bark of the dog and the sweet tone of the silvery bell on the collar of the dog that have come for the child tell that the two hour have pass away thank you ever so much say the grateful minnehaha as she rise to have loving hand carefully wrap she up for the return ride for that sweet sweet story it be so good of nanahboozhoo to tell they about the sap in the maple tree even if it be only there in the spring time i think old nokomi deserve a good deal of the credit say sagastao it seem to I that nanahboozhoo would not have do it if she have not make he well nanahboozhoo do it anyway and so we and the indian have we maple sugar and molasses and i be glad and so hurrah for nanahboozhoo thus reply minnehaha here souwana lift the well-wrapped-up child and carry she out to the cariole where she and she brother be speedily cover and tuck in among the warm robe marche marche be shout to the dog by the driver and away they speed over the icy trail with such speed that it be not long ere they be again safe and happy in they own cozy home chapter xi mary relate

the sweet birdie or the brilliant flower but the young invalid have he way this time and mary proceed to tell the story of the indian ' idea as to the origin of sickness and disease long long ago say mary all the animal and bird on this earth live in peace and harmony with the human family then there be food for all in abundance without any shed of blood even the wild animal that now live by kill and devour each other find plenty of food in the fruit and vegetable that then be so abundant man and woman also live on similar thing and be contented and happy but as the year go on the people become so numerous and they settlement spread over so much of the earth that many of the poor animal begin to be cramp for room even this could have be bear but by and by man begin to make bow and arrow spear and knife and other weapon and begin to use they on the defenseless animal then soon they begin to eat the flesh of the animal and presently they find that they prefer the meat thus obtain to the fruit and vegetable of the earth formerly they have make they garment out of the fiber of the tree and plant which the woman carefully prepare and weave but after a while they discover that the skin of the buffalo and deer and other animal when well prepare make better and more durable garment and wigwam than the material they have previously use as time go on the destruction of the larger animal increase and man become so much more cruel than formerly that even the frog and worm that in the earlier day be never harm be now destroy without mercy or by sheer carelessness or contempt thus the animal come to be in such a sad plight that it be resolve by they to call great council of they member together to consult upon what could be do for they common safety the bear be the first to assemble they gather together on the peak of a great smoky mountain which the white man now call cathedral mountain and the great white bear from the northland be appoint chairman -lrb- illustration : which the white man now call cathedral mountain -rrb- well that be funny say minnehaha just fancy a big white bear sit up in a chair why he would need a whole sofa to hold he do not be silly child say the patronize brother it be a bear ' council and of course the chair use be bear ' and not man 's when mary be appeal to to settle the question she could only say as the council be hold on the top of a mountain perhaps the bear sit on the rock but never mind let I go on with the story after the white bear have make he speech he take he seat and say he be now ready to hear the statement of the different bear who have assemble to lodge they complaint against the way in which man kill they relative devour they flesh for food and make garment and robe out of they skin nearly every kind of bear have grievous statement to make and so blood-curdling be some of they recital that it be decide to begin war at once against the human race then the question be ask ` what weapon shall we use against they ' after some discussion it be decide to use bow and arrow the favorite weapon of they enemy ` and what be they make of ' be the next question this be soon answer by a bear who have be catch when young and keep captive for a couple of year in the wigwam of one of they enemy he have often see the process of make bow and he be now able to tell all about it and even to do the work himself it be not long before the first bow with some arrow be manufacture and there be great excitement when the first trial of it be make a large strong bear be select to shoot the first arrow to they great disappointment the trial be not a success for it be find that when the bear let the arrow fly after draw back the bow he long claw catch in the string and spoil the shot other bear try but they all have long claw and they all fail then some one suggest that this difficulty could be overcome by they cut off they long claw but here the chairman the white bear interpose say that it be very necessary that they should have they long claw in order to climb tree or up steep rocky place ` it be better ' say he ` for we to trust to we claw and tooth than to man 's weapon which certainly be not design for we ' the bear remain in council until they get very hungry but think as much as they might they could not devise any satisfactory plan for they be stupid animal after all and they disperse to they different home no better able to fight the human race than before then the deer next hold a council representative of all the different kind of deer from the great elk and moose down to the smallest species in existence assemble in a beautiful forest glade the moose be select as chief after a long discussion it be resolve that in revenge for man 's tyranny they would inflict rheumatism lumbago and similar disease upon every hunter who should kill one of they number unless he take great care to ask pardon for the offense that be the reason why so many hunter say just before they shoot ' i beg you pardon mr deer but shoot you i must for i want you flesh for food ' they know that if they do this they be safe the cree legend be that it be the bear that have to be propitiate by gentlemanly expression when he be be approach to be kill i well remember be with a couple of hunter closely follow up a bear and just before they fire they keep say ` excuse we for shoot you brother bear but we must do it we want you warm fur robe we family want you meat we girl want you grease to put on they head so you must excuse we brother bear please do brother bear please do ' thus they go on at a great rate until he be kill but many forget it and the spirit of they chief know it and be angry and he strike those hunter or they relative down with rheumatism or some other painful disease next the fish and snake and other reptile hold they council and they decide that as the human race have now become such enemy to they they would trouble they with ` fearful dream ' of snake twine about they and blow they poisonous breath in they face by which they would lose they appetite and die while other of they would seek opportunity to make the water they drink or even the air they breathe unwholesome the poisonous one be also direct to use every opportunity to kill with they deadly bite whenever possible the bird also hold a council over which the crow be appoint chairman the eagle object and want the place but he be vote down because there be so few of he kind and these be only hunt for they feather to adorn the war bonnet of the great chief and warrior the crow be appoint because he be always with the human race and know the various scheme and trick they be invent to injure the bird and animal of various kind after much deliberation the bird decide to give cold and cough and throat disease and consumption to the human race and to thus lessen they number that there might be room for all creature the insect and smaller animal then hold they council and the grubworm be appoint to preside over the gathering he be so elated over he election and that they have arrange a scheme which should be fatal especially to woman that he fall over backward and could not get on he foot again so from that time the grubworm have only be able to wiggle in that way there be any amount of talk and buzz among the crowd the frog be especially noisy and angry in he remark ` it be high time ' say he ` that we begin to do something against this cruel human race or we will soon be sweep off the earth see how my back be ugly with lump and sore because man have so kick and knock I about ' other follow in the same strain of indignant protest against man 's cruelty even the fly and mosquito have something to complain of well after the buzz and the croaking and the humming and angry talking be over they settle down to business some be appoint to poison the water so that malaria and fever should attack the now hate race other such as the fly and mosquito be to carry in they bite and sting many disease thus it have come to pass that there be more damage do to the hate human being by these bite and sting than the mere smart pain cause at the time of the bite thus because the human race change from be all kindness to the rest of the creature both great and small into be cruel and savage all these various creature have combine to bring dreadful disease among man in revenge for they own wrong that be too bad say minnehaha why could they not have keep on loving each other all the time instead of thing be as they be now sagastao who have laugh at the idea of the mosquito come to a council and of they have anything to complain of say i would like to know what mosquito live on in those good old day you speak about now they be after I lively enough and he slowly lift up he hand on the back of which a couple be rapidly fill themselves with he blood but mary who indian like be wise and observant only say wait a minute or two and i will show you then she quickly hurry back into a swampy place and soon return with a thick juicy leaf to the under side of which several mosquito be still cling with they body distend with its juice there she say as she carefully hold the leaf sideways that be what most of the mosquito still live on they attack we race in revenge for we be so cruel as to kill so many of the animal large and small but this as you can easily see be they natural food this appeal to the eye quite silence the child who have consider the whole story as only a indian legend to be amuse with mary who have often be worst by the sharp criticism and inquiry with which they be apt to receive she pet indian legend be quite delighted at she apparent triumph so she hastily spring up say : it be time we be go home some other day i will tell you the story of how the medicine come chapter xii the naming of the baby -- a canoe trip -- the legend of the discovery of medicine -- how the chipmunk carry the good news there be great excitement among a number of indian man and woman who have gather on the shore in front of the mission one pleasant summer morning grave indian with souwana in they midst be calmly discuss some object of interest while mary and a party of woman some of whom have they baby with they be much more noisy talk rapidly about something which be evidently a matter of exciting interest even sagastao and minnehaha be rush in and out of the house and run from one group of indian to the other full of eager inquiry and pleasant anticipation what could it all be about let we ask the child for such little people often know more than we be likely to give they credit for here come minnehaha and we ask she the cause of such a early gathering of the indian and the reason why they be so unusually interested in some matter unknown to we -lrb- illustration : they baby with they -rrb- why do not you know the bright little girl promptly reply they have come to form a name council to give my little baby sister a indian name you see she add sagastao and i be bear among the cree indian but baby be bear here among the saulteaux just think : the first little white baby bear among they and they want to give she a nice saulteaux name the reason why they be talk so much now before they form the council be that lot of they have pet name they want to give we baby but of course she can only have one yes say sagastao and we old mary be try to get the woman to oppose the name that souwana will offer just because she be down on he but i 'll bet he will beat she yet you should not say ` i 'll bet ' mother have often tell you that it be very rude reprovingly say little minnehaha you never learn it from father or mother you must have pick that up from some rough trader well all right i 'll not say it again but i 'll bet -- no i mean -- hurrah for souwana and he side anyway and off he run dear I say the little sister i do have so much trouble with that boy soon the council assemble the man and woman arrange themselves in a big circle and spend some time in drink some strong well-sweetened tea that have be prepare for they they have be desirous of have they usual pagan ceremony but of course this could not be allow so the ceremony of tea drinking and they usual smoking be substitute then the little baby be bring in by she nurse and hand to one of the oldest woman she take the child and after kiss she and utter some word of endearment pass she on to the woman on she left she in she turn kiss she utter some kindly word and pass she on to the next so baby go from hand to hand until she have make the complete circle of woman and man this be the ceremony of adopt the child into the tribe mary the nurse of the older child be exclude from this circle as she be of another tribe after some more tea have be drunk the child be again send on she round this time each person as he or she hold the child pronounce some indian name that he or she wish the babe to be call mary who have now crowd herself into the circle persist in have a voice in the matter she want the child to be call papewpenase -lrb- laugh bird -rrb- but she be vote down by the crowd who say : no that be cree we must have saulteaux with a certain amount of decorum each name suggest be discuss only to be reject for a time there be quite a deadlock as no name could be decide upon now that you have all speak say souwana and can not come to any agreement i as chief will make the final decision this be the first white child bear among we as sagastao and minnehaha whom we all love be bear at norway house among the cree most of the name which you have suggest have some reference to bird and they sweet song a compound name which will include these idea and mine souwana -lrb- south wind -rrb- can surely be find this suggestion be well receive as florence be bear in the spring of the year when the bird return from the south fill the air with melody after the long stillness of that almost arctic winter so busy brain and wag tongue be at work and the result be the formation of the follow expressive name which be quickly bestow upon the child it be first loudly announce by souwana himself : souwanaquenapeke which in english be the voice of the south wind bird at once all the indian take it up and utter it over and over again so that it would not be forget even sagastao and minnehaha who could talk as well in the indian language as in english take up the word and shout out souwanaquenapeke until they have it as thoroughly as they own mary alone be vex and so annoyed that she could not conceal she disappointment this be particularly notice by sagastao and as soon as minnehaha join they they slip quietly away together have obtain permission they take a canoe and go for a paddle on the quiet lake mary like all other indian be passionately fond of the water and in spite of she crooked back be a strong and skillful paddler the child be place in the center of the canoe on a fur rug while mary seat herself in the stern and paddle they over the beautiful sunlit wave for a time but little be hear for the child be absorb in the scene of rarest beauty or watch some fish principally the active gold eye sport in the water around they after a while the child begin to clamor for a story but mary would not speak a word sagastao suspect the cause of mary 's unusual silence what be the use sakehou he protest of you be in a pet because baby be not name papewpenase the name they give she pleased everybody else you must be pleased too if you be cross and will not speak to we we will go and run away to souwana will not we say minnehaha this be too much for mary and she quickly surrender and make a excuse about thinking of some beautiful story to tell they when they should land on that little rocky island just ahead of they very well say sagastao let we have the one about how medicine be discover and give to the indian to cure disease just the one i be think about say mary and while we rest on the lovely white sand i will tell you the story a few vigorous stroke of the paddle send the canoe well up on the sandy shore and soon they all land a good romp relieved they of the stiffness cause by the cramped position in the canoe then as they cuddle down in the warm sand mary begin she story you remember little sweetheart how the animal of various kind hold council and decide to be revenge on the human family for they cruelty by send disease among they well these creature do as they say they would and the result be that lot of man die and also the woman and child that do the creature no harm be get different kind of sickness and many of they be die be there no disease among they before these time inquire minnehaha no not what you might call disease reply mary the people live such simple life that with the exception of accident such as be drown in great storm or kill by fall tree or something that way nearly all the people die of old age then they have no doctor in those day ask sagastao no there be no medicine man in those time although there be those skillful to set broken limb or attend to any who happen to be accidentally wound but that be nearly all then all at once these disease send by the angry animal begin to appear among they and of course there be much alarm the people do not know what have bring they nor how to get rid of they many people be sick and number of they die you see the animal hold they council in secret and away from the presence of man and so it would never have be know if the ground squirrel call by some the chipmunk have not go and tell all about the council to the man he have always be friendly to the human race he have attend a number of the council and be the only animal that have venture to say anything in the favor of man by do this he so enrage the other animal that some of they fall upon he with great fury and would have tear he in piece if he have not be able to escape into he hole in the ground as it be they so tear and wound he with they tooth and claw that the stripe remain in he back to this day well when he be heal enough to get around again he visit the abode of the human race and be very sorry to find that the disease send by the other angry animal be cause much suffering and many death so he reveal the whole thing to a number of man and tell they to be on they guard but even this be not sufficient it be feel that now that these disease be spread among they they must have some remedy for the cure of they or they would all soon be destroy while thus wonder what they should do they little friend the ground squirrel come to they help again he go about among the tree and plant who be always friendly to man and he tell they of the sad calamity that have come to the human race when the tree and plant hear what have be do by the animal to injure and destroy they friend they speedily hold council among themselves and resolve that they would do all they could to overcome the evil first the great tree hold they council talk over the matter and decide what they could do in the way of furnish remedy to cure these disease that be do so much injury the pine and the spruce and the balsam tree say ` we will give of we gum and balsam ' the slippery elm say it would give of its bark to make the soothing healing drink the sassafras say it would give of its root to make the healthful tea that will bring back health again the prickly ash and the sumach and other volunteer they help and speak of the wonderful healing power there be in they if rightly use when the plant come to they council the number that want to help be very great no one be able to keep a record of they and of the healing power they profess to have there be the mandrake with its may apple and the wintergreen with its pretty red berry the catnip and the bone-set which be so good for cold the lobelium which be such a quick emetic the spikenard the peppermint the snakeroot sarsaparilla gentian wild ginger raspberry and score of other all cheerfully offer assistance when the ground squirrel who have for day be attend the council of the tree and plant have make out he list of what remedy each tree and plant could furnish he be very much delighted and then thank they for they offer assistance he rapidly return to the abode of mankind and inform they of he great success of course they be very much pleased and very grateful to the ground squirrel for he kindness and he interest in they happiness this be the reason why the chipmunk or ground squirrel live near the home of man you never see a indian shoot they or the boy or girl try to snare they they be always welcome among the tree and the wigwam the indian love they because they speak up for man when the other animal turn against he and because it be one of they ancestor that make the tree and plant reveal they good medicine for the cure of the sick now i know why it be when i be out with the indian boy that they never would shoot a arrow at a chipmunk even when i ask they to say sagastao yes say mary all of the indian have hear they father tell of the kindness of the old father chipmunk in the day when the animal know so much and could talk and so they warn the child against injure these pretty little creature but it be now time they be return the light canoe be once more push down into the lake and soon they be merrily glide along over the clear transparent water to they cozy home chapter xiii in the wigwam of souwana -- how gray wolf persecute waubenoo and how he be punish by nanahboozhoo we have come to-day for a nice story about nanahboozhoo say minnehaha as she and sagastao lift the deerskin door at the wigwam of souwana and enter with all the assurance of child who know they be welcome do he ever do anything to punish bad fellow who be cruel to they wife and child ask sagastao because if he do i wish he would come and thrash old wakoo that bad fellow who have be thrash he wife again because he say she do not snare enough rabbit to suit he souwana who be one of the kind-hearted indian never cruel to any of he family be much amuse at the fire and indignation with which the young lad speak so after he have have comfortable seat arrange for the child among the robe and blanket he endeavor to satisfy they demand nanahboozhoo he say do such thing long ago but once when he be give a good thrashing to a man who have be very cruel to he wife the wife as soon as she be able spring up from the place where she husband have knock she to seize a paddle and attack nanahboozhoo with such fury that he resolve never to interfere again if he could help it in a quarrel between man and wife and add the old man with a merry twinkle in he eye it be best for everybody if possible to keep out of such quarrel yes but mismis -lrb- grandfather minnehaha 's pet name for souwana -rrb- you surely know a nice story in which nanahboozhoo help some one without get into trouble himself of course i do my grandchild say the old man and i know you will be please with it my story be about a lovely indian maiden who be bother by a cruel hunter he be determine that she should marry he although she do not like he and nanahboozhoo come to she rescue the maiden 's name be waubenoo she have the misfortune to lose both she father and mother when she be about eighteen year old there be four child all much younger than she leave in she sole care they have no uncle or aunt or other relative near to take care of they and so waubenoo have to hunt and fish to get food for she little brother and sister fortunately she father have leave a number of good trap and net and plenty of twine for snare and so the industrious girl get on fairly well the great lake near she wigwam be well supply with fish and the forest all round have in they many rabbit and partridge and other small game when great storm arise on the big lake and waubenoo could not go out alone in she birch bark canoe to visit she net some of the indian who be please to see how kind and industrious she be would overhaul she net and bring in what fish be catch thus she toil on and with the assistance of these kind indian she do very nicely she little brother and sister love she dearly and do what they could to help in the simpler and easier part of the work every decent person among the indian be please with she industrious habit and often in they quiet way have some cheery word of encouragement for she but there be one exception and this be a selfish indian hunter who see what a fine-looking strong woman she have become and so clever in she work with both net and trap resolve that she should be he wife to work for he and do he bidding this man have be marry before and if the report be true which have be tell it be likely that he wife have die because of he cruelty to she so he resolve in he selfishness to take waubenoo from care for she brother and sister to be he wife and to hunt and fish for he that he might live a life of idleness she parent be dead this selfish young indian do not have to go to she father to buy she to be he wife all he think he have to do be to go and tell she she have to be he wife and come and do as he command she so harsh and cold be he word and so very rough and forbid he look that while waubenoo be frightened she be grave and high spirited enough to indignantly refuse he request and to order he never to trouble she again this of course make he very angry he refuse to go and continue to insist on she go with he fear that he might revenge himself upon she by do she or the child some harm she tell he that it be she duty to stay with the little one whom the death of the parent have leave in she care that they might perish if she now leave they but nothing would turn away he anger and if it have not happen just then that some friendly indian come along he would have cruelly beat she before they he dare not strike she and so mutter some threat he sulkily stride away into the forest poor waubenoo be now sadly troubled lighthearted and free she have cheerfully work and toil for she loved one but now here come this cruel fierce-looking man whom she could only look on with fear and dread and threaten to drag she away from they all gray wolf for that be he name have a bad reputation among the indian the young man shun he and the maiden take good care to be out of the way when he be around that he would persist in he attempt to get waubenoo all be convinced but that he should succeed no one desire still while indian idea on some of these thing be so peculiar that no one seem disposed to interfere at the same time some of they be generally on the lookout for she protection as for brave waubenoo while certain that he would still trouble she she be resolve never to submit to he thus the week roll on with gray wolf look for some opportunity to carry she off and make several attempt to do so which waubenoo ever alert and watchful succeed in prevent at length he persistent attempt become so annoying that she be oblige to neglect much of she work in order to keep on she guard food be get scarce because she dare not now go far from she wigwam to hunt for the partridge and rabbit and other small creature she be so clever in snare at length she resolve to go to nanahboozhoo and seek he aid in get rid of this troublesome fellow when nanahboozhoo hear she sad story he become very angry he be indignant that such a commendable maiden one who have be so kind to she little brother and sister should be bother by a big selfish lazy fellow who only want she because she be so industrious and so clever at she work nanahboozhoo have hear much about she kindly treatment of the child and of she skill in provide for they want so he lose no time in go back with she to she wigwam at first the younger child be much afraid of he as they like all other indian child have hear such wonderful tale about he but he be in such a jolly good humor that day and be so delighted with everything he see about waubenoo 's wigwam and with the proof of she industry that he soon make friend with all the child how to go to work to give gray wolf such a lesson that he would never trouble they any more he hardly know at first however he have not be there many hour before he have to come to a decision for one of the little child come rush into the wigwam with the terrible news that gray wolf carry a big dog whip and look very angry be come along the trail nanahboozhoo only laugh when he hear this and he very quickly decide what to do ` sit down there ' he say to waubenoo ` in that dark side of the wigwam with a blanket over you head and keep perfectly still until i call you and you child must keep quiet do not be frighten or say a word no matter what happen ' then nanahboozhoo who as you know could change himself into any form he like suddenly transform himself so as to look exactly like waubenoo so perfect be he resemblance to she even to he dress that she brother and sister could not have detect the disguise indeed the young one could not help look over to the spot where the real waubenoo sit in the gloom with the blanket draw over she head but they be indian child early train to be quiet and do as they be tell and so they fully obey he command of course when gray wolf come into the wigwam he be completely deceive and now think that he have catch waubenoo when there be no friendly indian around he at once begin speak very fiercely to she : ' i have ask you for the last time ' he say ` and now i have come with my dog whip and i intend give you a good thrashing and then drive you to my wigwam i intend to call you atim my dog and like a dog i be go to thrash you ' -lrb- illustration : give he such a terrible beating -rrb- he then savagely raise the whip to strike as he think waubenoo but the blow never reach its victim or even nanahboozhoo in he disguise at whom it be aim for nanahboozhoo be so enraged that anybody in the shape of a man could be so cruel and selfish as to come and threaten a kind young woman like waubenoo that he suddenly spring at gray wolf and seize he by he scalp lock he drag he out of the wigwam and then wrenching the heavy whip out of he hand give he such a terrible beating that he remember it as long as he live then roughly throw he to the ground nanahboozhoo still in the disguise of waubenoo hurry into the wigwam and say to the real waubenoo : ` now while he be weak and cowed go out and talk sternly to he and tell he that if he ever trouble you again it will be worse for he than this have be ' when waubenoo come out she appearance so terrify gray wolf that he try to get up and skulk away weak as he be waubenoo glad that she enemy be so conquer that he would not be likely to trouble she much more do as nanahboozhoo request she nanahboozhoo be heartily thank by waubenoo and the child for thus rid they of this bad indian who have for so long make they life miserable ere he leave nanahboozhoo warn the child to say nothing about he come ` for ' say he ` if gray wolf find out who it be that thrash he he may yet be troublesome ' well would it have be for all if the child have remember this advice add souwana o tell we what they do and what happen shout sagastao not to-day say the old man it be time you both be back at you lesson and as i be go that way with some whitefish i will take you with I in my canoe but be that all about the story of waubenoo and the child say minnehaha yes say souwana until we come to the next for a long time after gray wolf receive the beating he keep away from they although he heart be full of anger and revenge although he be a big fellow he fear to again threaten she who although she seem but a ordinary-sized indian maiden possess the strength that have enable she to give he such a thrashing chapter xiv the pathetic love story of waubenoo -- the treachery of gray wolf -- the legend of the whisky jack it come about in this way say souwana and it be such a sad story about beautiful waubenoo will it make I cry say the tender-hearted minnehaha if so i do not think i want to hear it stay and hear it you little pussy say sagastao i be sure it be not worse than the babe in the wood well you always cry first when we read that story together say minnehaha at this the lad have nothing to say for in spite of he apparent brusqueness he heart melt more quickly and he eye fill easier with tear at a pathetic story than do he sister 's well go ahead souwana say sagastao we each have a pocket handkerchief and when they be use up you can lend we a blanket at this quaint speech everybody laugh and then the old man begin he second story about waubenoo it all come about because little child have long tongue and this story should warn little child that while they have two eye and two ear they have but one tongue and that they should not at any time talk about or repeat half of what they have see and hear the little brother and sister of waubenoo have be warn that they should say nothing about the visit of nanahboozhoo to they wigwam in fact nanahboozhoo be such a queer fellow that he do not at any time want people to be gossip about he and if he have do any good deed for anyone he do not wish they to be ever speak about it then another reason why nanahboozhoo do not want they to talk about he visit and help be the fear that gray wolf find out how it be that he have receive such a beating would be more bitter and revengeful against waubenoo and would again try to get she in he power the little child be of course delighted that they wigwam be no longer visit by gray wolf whose come have always fill they with terror while waubenoo be so pleased at have thus get rid of he that she be happier and brighter than she have be for a long time it be not long before some of the other indian notice the change they be surprise that gray wolf have so suddenly stop he visit and that he seem so dejected and sullen naturally they curiosity be excite and they be anxious to find out what have happen better to have be mind they own business break in young sagastao who seem to see the drift of the story be quiet and do not interrupt souwana say minnehaha who often feel call upon to restrain she brother 's impulsiveness of course souwana continue gray wolf have so suffer that he have very little to say and if ever tease about waubenoo he fall into a great passion waubenoo herself be too sensible to gratify they idle curiosity but the very return of she brightness and she unwillingness to talk about the matter only add to the foolish desire of outsider to find out what have really occur so some of these naughty busybody begin question the child when they could get they away from waubenoo for in she presence they be as mute as she be they pester and bother the child and try in various way before they succeed but one day while waubenoo be away overhaul she trap some of those wicked meddler visit she wigwam and succeed in get one of the smallest one -- i just forget now whether it be a boy or a girl a girl of course shout sagastao no indeed i be sure it be a naughty boy say minnehaha well no matter which but one of they say : ` nanahboozhoo ' this one word nanahboozhoo be quite enough to startle and alarm they for nanahboozhoo be also much fear as he sometimes do dreadful thing the fact that nanahboozhoo have be in they very midst although they be a long time in hearing anything more than the one word from the now frightened child be quite enough to excite the whole village for the news be soon spread abroad by the tattler such busybody could not be satisfy with only hear that nanahboozhoo have visit the wigwam of waubenoo of course they want to hear about what he say and do and i be sorry to have to say that after a while with coax and present they manage to get from the child the whole delightfully exciting story when gray wolf who be so jeered and laugh at by all who dare hear from the gossiper how it have happen that he have receive such a thrashing he be doubly wild and furious when waubenoo find out that all be know about how nanahboozhoo have help she she be very sorry that she little brother and sister have be so naughty and disobedient she also know that now she would have to be more careful than ever against the movement of gray wolf but the fact be that he have be so cow by he beat that he be afraid to openly attack she lest she should get nanahboozhoo to help she again and it might be worse for he than it be at he first meeting but he treasured up revengeful feeling in he heart and resolve that at some time or other he would dreadfully punish she some year pass by and the older child next to waubenoo be able to do most of the hunting and fishing as well as to be on guard against any of the evil doings of gray wolf thus they be able in a measure to repay they sister whom they dearly love although they be so thoughtless for all she great kindness to they one fall there come to the village a splendid indian hunter he be of the same tribe but live with he people most of the time at a distant part of the country he be so pleased with this village where dwelt waubenoo that he decide to remain for the winter and hunt he be such a very pleasant fellow and such a great hunter that he soon make many friend gray wolf be the only man who seem to hate he and he be even so rash as to insult he openly in a indian gathering soquaatum for this be the young warrior 's name stand the insult of gray wolf for some time then when he see that some of the young hunter begin to think he be afraid of gray wolf he suddenly spring at he and knock he down and then seize he by he belt he shake he as easily and thoroughly as a wildcat would a rabbit then he throw he from he and sit down among the people as though nothing have happen that evening when he and the relative with whom he live be seat around the fire in the wigwam he hear for the first time the story of waubenoo : of she great industry she love for she little brother and sister and how she have be threaten by gray wolf and then befriend by nanahboozhoo this story very much interested soquaatum and especially as in he hunting he have meet she younger brother now a fine strapping hunter and have become very fond of he although he be much younger so he resolve that as soon as he could he would visit she wigwam and seek she acquaintance ho ho so this be to be a love story say sagastao be quiet do say he sister all love story do not end well remember there be gray wolf souwana profit by the interruption for it give he a opportunity to light he pipe with flint and steel and he then resume the story soon after soquaatum array himself in he most attractive costume and call at the tent of waubenoo he excuse be that he want to see she brother and arrange some hunting excursion waubenoo who have often hear she brother speak of he great skill as a hunter and have also hear how easily and thoroughly he have handle gray wolf receive he most kindly and at once make he welcome well it be not surprising that he should soon fall in love with waubenoo and so pleased be she with he manner as well as he attractive appearance that she become very fond of he and it be not many day after they first meeting before it be noised abroad that soquaatum and waubenoo be lover soquaatum remain until about the middle of the winter then he return to he distant home to make all preparation for receive he wife for whom he be to come in the spring gray wolf be of course furious when he hear that waubenoo be to be marry and to the man who have humiliate he in the presence of so many people though angry and revengeful he be at heart a cowardly fellow and now that waubenoo 's brother be full-grown he be afraid of he as well as of soquaatum while he be in the neighborhood but he fear do not prevent he from think of scheme for revenge which however come to nothing because the friend of waubenoo be so vigilant and well prepare at length one of he plan succeed and this be how it happen : gray wolf enlist a young indian who be equally bad with himself to help he as soquaatum have now be go for some week to he home which be far east from that region gray wolf and he wicked companion go a good long distance -- many mile -- in that direction there they make a hunting lodge and lay they plan to capture waubenoo then gray wolf 's companion go back and remain secrete near the wigwam of waubenoo one night he see she two brother leave about midnight for some distant trap that would take they all day to reach as soon as this bad fellow be satisfy that they be well out of sight and hearing he rush up to the tent of waubenoo and hastily arouse she from she sleep he have array himself as though he be gain on she she begin call : ` soquaatum soquaatum ' alas he be far away but there be another who fortunately be near nanahboozhoo have be out hunting and he have a sled which he be drag load with game he be surprise as he hear this call ` soquaatum soquaatum ' and as he continue listen it become hoarse and then only like a whisper he could stand it no longer he rush through the wood and there he see waubenoo dashing along on snow-shoe call in a low whisper : ` soquaatum soquaatum ' while not a hundred foot behind she be gray wolf yell in triumph that he would soon capture she unfortunately nanahboozhoo be not in a very good humor that day he have hear of some little child that have be tattle about he and he have hear that the child in the tent of waubenoo have tell about he visit however when he see who it be that be in danger and hear she cry to he for help when she see he and especially when he see who it be that be after she he quickly turn waubenoo into a bird and without any trouble she quickly fly up into a tree out of the reach of danger ever since that waubenoo have be the whisky jack and if you will listen to whisky jack when he be not scold or clamor at you camp for food he voice be like that of the lose indian maiden with a bad cold call for she lover what do nanahboozhoo do to gray wolf say sagastao hush say minnehaha do not you know nanahboozhoo do not like to have child talk about he this excessive caution on the part of the little girl vastly amuse souwana then he tell they that nanahboozhoo turn gray wolf into a dog and make he draw home he heavy load of meat chapter xv a novel race : the wolverine and the rock -- how the wolverine 's leg be shorten -- a punishment for conceit there be great excitement one morning among the child in the schoolroom when mary come in with the word that some hunter with they dog sled have call and that they have with they a great wolverine which have be kill in the wood not very far away the child run out to look at it now the wolverine be know to be such a cunning clever animal that the killing of one be quite a event among the indian and the lucky hunter who succeed in destroy one be the hero of the hour a man may on one hunting trip kill several bear or wolf or many other animal and there be not much say about it but to kill a wolverine that pest and scourge of the hunter be indeed a feat that any man be proud of why be it call a wolverine ask sagastao because it be once like a wolf and have small foot and long leg but now its leg be short and its foot be very large what shorten its leg and make its foot become so large ask sagastao it be too cold a day to remain any longer outside look at the wolverine or to learn more about it so the child be oblige to return to they warm schoolroom where they lesson be resume it be evident however that both sagastao and minnehaha be ready with a couple of question for mary and it be not long after school hour that they seek she and ask : mary what be it that shorten the leg of the wolverine and what make he foot so big the wolverine reply mary be once the finest of all the different kind of wolf he have the softest and nicest of fur he leg be long and he foot be firm and handsome but he be a awfully conceited fellow he fancy he be the handsomest creature in existence and look down with contempt on all the other kind of wolf he use to go to the side of the clear transparent lake where he could see he shadow reflect in the water and he would strut up and down and say : ' o dear what a lovely creature i be ' it be true he be very clever in many way he be so swift that he could run down even the antelope and the elk and at all the great animal gathering where the different creature meet in council he be the swiftest there and easily win the chief prize at the great race which the animal use to hold indeed he win so many race that at length he could get no animal to compete with he he even try to get up race with the bird but they laugh at he for he conceit one day he happen to be hunting among the mountain near the top of one he see a large ball-like rock standing there apart from the other big rock come up close to this great round rock he say to it : ` be that you i see walk just now ' ` no i can not walk i have lie here for a long time ' say the rock the wolverine retort that he be sure he have see the rock walk this make the rock angry and he tell the wolverine that he be tell a falsehood then the saucy wolverine reply : ` you need not speak to I in that way for i have see you walk ' then the wolverine run off a little distance and challenge the rock to catch he but the rock do not reply to this and the bold wolverine come close up to the rock strike it with he paw and say : ` come now see if you can catch I ' ' i can not run ' say the rock ` but i can roll ' at this the conceit wolverine begin to laugh ` that will do all i want be a race you can run or roll just as you like ' then the race begin the wolverine start down the mountain side at a great rate and the rock come roll behind he at first the big rock do not move very fast and the wolverine laugh as he look back and see the rock be so far behind but the rock come on faster and faster and now it make the wolverine do he very best to keep ahead of it on they rush over the stick and stone and rough place down -- down that great long mountain side at length swift and strong as he be the wolverine begin to get tired and although he be run as he never do before in he life the big rock be surely gain on he by and by he be so frightened that in look behind at the rock now close at he heel he trip over a stick and down he fall the rock roll over he and just as it have completely crushed he down to the earth there it stop then the wolverine whose head be not crush under the rock cry out : ` get off go away you be hurt I you be crush my bone ' but the rock reply : ` you torment I and tell I i be tell a falsehood and you challenge I to a race with you and now that i have catch you i will not stir until some one stronger come and take I off ' then the wolverine lift up he voice and cry to he relative the wolf and fox to come and remove the rock when these animal come and see he in such a plight they ask he : ` how come you to get under the rock ' the wolverine reply : ' i challenge the rock to catch I and it roll on I ' when the wolf and the fox hear this they be not very sorry they know how conceit the wolverine have be about he speed indeed they be all smart because of the ease with which he have beat they and so instead of help he at once they say he deserve he punishment after a time however they begin to be sorry for the poor wolverine who be cry out piteously for help but they find they be not able to remove the rock they could not even stir it in the least ` get out of the way ' say the wolverine ` and i will call my other friend the thunder and the lightning ' in a few minute a great black cloud be see rapidly come out of the west as it come rush along the fox and the wolf be very much frighten by the great noise it make however they have courage enough to ask the lightning to take off the fine coat of the wolverine but not to kill he then they run back and watch to see the lightning do its work the lightning promise to do what have be ask of he for he have hear of this proud conceited wolverine who have boast that he could run like lightning and now he be just go to teach he a lesson so he dart back a distance to gather force and then he come on with a rush and strike the rock and knock it into small piece he also completely strip the skin from the back of the wolverine but do not kill he when the wolverine get up and stand there naked with all he beauty go he be very angry at the lightning ` you be like other so-called friend i have hear about ' he say ` you can not do a thing but you must overdo it and spoil all you have no need to tear my beautiful fur coat from my back when you know i only ask you to come and strike the rock ' then the poor shiver wolverine gather the piece of he coat and carry they to he sister the frog who dwell in a marsh and he ask she to sew they together the frog have sore eye and when she sew they together she do not do it properly hence the wolverine be very angry and he hit she a crack on the head and knock she into the water then he take up the coat and go and find he youngest sister the mouse he tell she of he trouble and how the frog have so badly do she work then he show the mouse how he want the coat to be sew he little sister feel badly for she big brother and so she set to work and with great care sew all the piece together in they right place when the wolverine see how nicely she have do she work he be much pleased ` you mouse may live everywhere ' he say in real gratitude ` and in spite of all you enemy you will never be destroy ' then the wolverine try to put on he coat but alas he find he leg have be shorten and he foot very much flatten out by the terrible crush he have have under that big stone which he have be so foolish as to challenge to a race guess he do not run many more race say sagastao no indeed be the reply he be so mortified and angry that from that day to this the wolverine have always be a sulk solitary animal and play all the mean trick he can on all kind of animal as though he have a spite against they he now have not one friend who ever care for he unless it be he little sister the mouse chapter xvi the legend of the twin child of the sun -- how they rid the earth of some of the great monster -- they great battle with nikoochi the giant one pleasant summer day when the child have the pleasure of a canoe out with mary and kennedy they decide to visit the wigwam of they old friend kinnesasis and he wife they have not see they for some time and as souwana be away on a long hunting excursion they could not expect any nanahboozhoo story until he return kinnesasis be a capital story-teller and they be eager to reach he wigwam there after make both he and he wife happy with some gift they know they could get some interesting story in return they meet with a hearty welcome and spend a happy day there among the story kinnesasis tell they as hand down by he forefather the following be perhaps the most interesting : long ago there be great monster on this earth some of they be enormous animal and fiercer than any that now exist then there be magician and other evil spirit like windegoo some of whom be tall giant cannibal that fill the people with terror they lay in wait and catch the child and even the grown-up people as the wild beast now catch they prey then they kindle up great fire and roasted they and eat they often when the parent go to look for they child they also be catch and eat the people be render very miserable not only by these great monster in human form but also by the attack of the enormous animal that then live indeed they begin to fear that they would all soon be kill unless help come to they these people be worshiper of the sun whom they call the great sun father and some tribe still have they sun dance in he honor when he see that the people be in such great trouble and be likely to be all kill by they cruel enemy he resolve to deliver they from they foe so he disguise himself and come down to the earth and marry a beautiful woman of the northland they have lovely twin boy whose name be sesigizit the older and ooseemeeid the younger they grow so rapidly that they be able to walk when only a few day old they sun father disappear as soon as they be bear go to the far eastland strange to say although these two boy grow so rapidly at first they as suddenly cease grow and so remain quite small but they be very intelligent and be ever ask question ` who be we father ' they inquire of they mother one day -lrb- illustration : sun dance lodge of the blood indian -rrb- but she ignore the question and although they keep bother she it be a long time before she would give they any information at all and that be very little however she do tell they that they be more than ordinary child and finer than other boy but then there be lot of mother who say such thing to they own little one as they be now big enough she bring out of hide a couple of bow and quiver full of arrow and some magic rabbit stick and give they to the boy ` these be leave for you by you father ' say the mother ere he go away and he give command that they be to be give to you as soon as you be able to use they ' the child be of course anxious to try they bow and arrow and these magic stick so very soon after they have receive they they resolve to go off on a hunting expedition the mother who be anxious about they warn they of the various monster in human shape great windegoo and cannibal that be ever lie in wait to catch and roast and eat little boy she also tell they of the animal that be so enormously large that they could catch they up and swallow they as easily as a turkey do a grasshopper thus she try to put they on they guard against the terrible foe that have devour so many of they people the boy however be not much frightened and they eagerly set off on they journey they be especially warn by they anxious mother not to go to the east as there be a narrow lake there to which many of these evil creature come for water especially a great monster wolf that have devour many people yet they immediately start off in that direction for like some other boy they do not obey even they mother it be noon before they reach the lake at first as they examine it everything seem very quiet and still ` mother must have be mistake ' say sesigizit ' i do not see any living thing here ' but as they wander farther along the shore suddenly ooseemeeid cry out : ' o see that great wolf on the other side ' they drop down as quickly as they could but the fierce brute have already catch sight of they he be very much larger than any of the wolf that now howl in the dark forest he not only destroy many of the people but when he come to spring or small stream he either drink up all the water or so spoil it that it be unfit for use the boy shoot they arrow at he but he side be so tough for he have bone like jointed armor upon they that he be only slightly wound he be however make very angry by they attack and he pick up a magic stick and throw it at they they would have fare badly if they have not so suddenly throw themselves upon the ground that it pass over they when the boy see that they arrow be not swift enough to kill such a great animal they decide to use the magic rabbit stick which they father the sun have give they with order that they be only to be use when the arrow fail the wolf when he see that one of he magic stick have miss its aim be more savage than ever and he seize he remain one for he only have two and he throw it with all he power at the boy this time they both jump high up from the ground and the stick pass under they it be they turn now and so they both throw they magic stick with such force that the great bony armor of the wolf be crush in and he be kill sesigizit quickly run around the lake to the spot where the great body lay and cut out the heart of the wolf while ooseemeeid secure the two magic stick that the wolf have throw at they as well as they own weapon and then with these trophy they return to they own home ` where have you be ' ask the anxious mother when they appear ` we have be to the lake ' they reply she could hardly believe it ` my boy ' she say ` you surely be mistake for no one who go there return the great monster that devour we people live there and they let no one escape ' then they tell she of they battle with the great wolf and how they have kill he they also show she he heart which they have bring home with they she be very much excited she call the people together and there be great rejoice at the death of this terrible wolf which have be such a scourge to they some time after sesigizit and ooseemeeid ask they mother if she know where grow any good tough wood suitable for make bow and arrow she answer be : ` far away in the foothill be a canyon or ravine where a forest of just such wood as you need be grow but the path that lead to it be narrow and there sit guard a great monster giant who kill and throw into the ravine everyone who have attempt to get any of that wood and in addition there be a fierce mountain lioness prowl around somewhere on the route and she have already kill many people and carry they off to she den ' ooseemeeid at once desire to set off and get a supply of this wood but sesigizit when he find out how fearful they mother be that they would both be kill if they make the attempt at first refuse to go he objection however vanish when he see he brother make ready to start and in spite of they mother 's fear they start off they have not go very far when they meet the great mountain lioness she be out hunting food for she cub these she have hide in a den which be away up on a precipitous mountain side ooseemeeid ask she if she know the way to the canyon where grow the good wood ` yes ' she reply ' i be just go that way and i will show you the route ' she say this because she wish in this way to allure the two boy to walk near to she den and there she would kill they for food for she cub so she lead they until they come to a place where the path be very dangerous because it be on a narrow shelve rock around the mountain side here the monster lioness ask the boy to walk on ahead of she but they refuse say that they have be teach never to walk in front of they elder the lioness urge but the boy be firm and so she have to yield and let they have they way when in the most dangerous part of the pass the boy pretend to be very much alarmed and ask to be permit to walk between she and the mountain side at first she be suspicious but they seem now to be so cowardly and afraid that she think they be not able to do she any harm so she walk on the outer edge of the pass and let they have the inside and also allow they to put they hand on she as though to steady themselves when they come to the most dangerous spot where it be so narrow that even a mountain lion have to be careful they both suddenly draw they magic stick and give she a great shove send she over the side of the narrow rocky ledge and down she fall -- to be dash to piece thousand of foot below with a shout of triumph the two boy carefully push on and find the den quickly kill the cub and cut off the right forepaw from each one to carry home from this high pass they could now see the canyon where grow the good wood for which they be seek they also see the lodge of the monster giant who guard the narrow path that lead to it they see by its size that he must be a enormous creature and so they look to see that they arrow and magic stick be all in good order and handy for use the great giant have hear they shout of triumph when they have destroy the mountain lioness and it make he very angry for he hate any noise or disturbance he name nikoochi which mean solitude indicate this when he see the small boy he be at first inclined to laugh in derision at they but when they have come near enough to shoot they magic arrow at he he soon begin to roar with the stinging pain they give he in vain he try to catch the active little fellow he be so big and clumsy and they be so quick in they movement that it be a utter impossibility for he to get he hand upon they then he begin tear up great rock and stone and try to crush they by hurl these at they here the boy ' father the sun come to they help and he shine so fiercely into the eye of the great monster that he be unable to see very well and the boy easily keep out of the way of the rock throw at they -lrb- illustration : they both throw they magic stick -rrb- the monster be big and fat and unaccustomed to exertion and he be soon tire out indeed he be so big that the arrow of the boy seem only like pin and needle stick into he and the boy begin to fear that they quiver would be empty before they have conquer he just then they meet a old witch with a bundle of stick which she be carry to she wigwam she be very angry with nikoochi for he would not allow she even to gather the dry stick that fall to the ground in the forest he be guard the result be that she have to wander far away to get the little fuel she need in she wigwam the boy tell she of they battle with this selfish old monster and that even now he be badly wound by they arrow which however do not seem to reach any vital spot she tell they that the only place where they weapon could be effectual in kill he be in the top of he skull that they must first in some way crack it with they magic rabbit stick and then they could shoot they arrow into he brain hearing this they quickly resume they attack upon he in vain he tear up great rock and hurl they with all he force at they they either cleverly jump on one side or spring up into the air out of the way then watch for they opportunity they wait until he stoop down and when he be struggle to loosen from the earth a great rock as big as a house sesigizit throw with all he power he magic rabbit stick it strike the giant fair on the top of he head with such force that it break off a piece of he skull the next instant ooseemeeid fire one of he arrow so accurately that it pierce into the brain through the spot thus leave expose with a roar of rage and pain the great monster fall roll down into the deep canyon and die after secure he big flint knife which drop from he belt the boy hurry into the canyon and gather a lot of fine wood for arrow shaft and return to they mother when she ask they where they have be they reply that they have be to the canyon and that they have kill both the mountain lioness and the great giant at first she could hardly believe this but as they have bring the paw of the cub and the flint knife of the great giant why she just have to believe it great indeed be the rejoicing of the people at be thus rid of these creature chapter xvii souwana tell of the queer way in which nanahboozhoo destroy mooshekinnebik the last of the great monster one cold day souwana who have not be see by the child for some time -- he have be away on a long hunting excursion -- quite unexpectedly walk into the mission house during the school hour of sagastao and minnehaha the news of he come be hail with delight by the child and it require a certain amount of firmness on the part of the head of the household to keep they at they study they be however quickly pacify and return with diligence to they lesson when inform that they old friend have be invite to stay all day and doubtless would have a story of some kind for they when they study be all over the venison and bear 's meat which he have bring be quickly purchase at a price that well please he then he sit down for a rest and a smoke in the kitchen of course he have he usual tiff with mary the nurse who be very jealous of he because he have so win the love and confidence of the child souwana be greatly amuse at she jealousy of he especially since he be tell by one of the indian maid that the child have be overhear gravely debate between themselves which be the better story-teller mary or souwana when peace again reign some illustrated volume from the library be give to souwana for he inspection he be not able to read english but he be very fond of look at picture there be one book that have a special fascination for he in fact when he first examine it and have have some of its illustration explain to he it give this superstitious indian about the biggest fright he have ever receive it be a book in which be picture and describe many of the great extinct monster of the old time these enormous hideous creature whose bone and fossil remains be still occasionally to be find quite alarmed he yet the book be generally about the first one he desire to see on this present visit however souwana while as usual eager again to inspect this book be observe to look at it in a very different spirit the explanation come out later when he have the child around he -- indeed almost the whole household -- listen to a new nanahboozhoo story which he have secure from some famous old indian whom he have meet while far away on he long hunting excursion yes it be true he begin that there do once live on this earth both in the land and in the water great animal like those here show in this book i have be to the wigwam of the great shuniou and from he i have learn much about they as hand down in the tradition of we forefather great and terrible be they and the people of those time live in great terror of they for the bow and arrow and even the stone war club of the strongest warrior be powerless to kill or even dangerously wind such monster it be well for the inhabitant of the earth in those day that these great monster be few in number and that they be constantly fight among themselves for so large and terrible be they that only animal as big and fierce of other kind could battle with they but there be one great monster that live in the water and as he have no enemy big enough to attack he he live on even long after the other great animal be all kill off shuniou say that the tradition be that a great rush of water cause many of the last of the great monster that have tusk of ivory to be carry to the far northland and there as the terribly cold winter set in they be all freeze to death this must be true add souwana for it be not many year ago that the hudson bay company send they man there to get this ivory which they intend to ship to england they come back with word that some of the dead body have be see where the ice break up but this great monster in the water as i have say live on after the rest be all suppose to have die off or be kill he be a terrible scourge to those indian whose wigwam be on the shore of the great sea in which he live they be in mortal terror when they venture out in they canoe to fish this they have to do as they depend almost entirely on fish for they living and there be time when the fish leave the shallow water near the shore and go out far from land there the indian have to follow and catch they or they and they family would starve happily for they sometimes for month together no one would hear or see anything of this great sea monster then perhaps suddenly he would rise up right under a canoe in which be several indian whom he would easily catch and swallow one by one he would sometimes rush after a herd of deer that have go out swimming in the water he would catch and easily swallow several of they well i should think that the big horn of a moose or reindeer would give he some trouble to swallow say sagastao he be so large say souwana that the horn or body of the largest deer do not seem to bother he in the least degree i wonder if it be not one of he great grandfather that swallow jonah say the observant minnehaha the indian at length come to be so much distressed by the loss of so many of they number and by they inability to slay the monster that they resolve to ask nanahboozhoo to come and help they if he possibly could i ought to have tell you say souwana that this great monster be call by the indian mooshekinnebik nanahboozhoo at once respond to they request for he be very angry when he hear how many industrious fisherman have be swallow by this creature he be doubly angry when he return with the deputation who have go for he and further learn that only the day before mooshekinnebik have be mean enough to come near to the shore and catch and swallow some boy and girl who have be out swim that warm summer day when nanahboozhoo inform nokomi of the request of the people for he help to deliver they from the long hate mooshekinnebik she be very much frightened and more so when he tell she of the strange and dangerous plan he be go to adopt to carry out he purpose it be this : he be go to allow himself to be swallow by this monster who have already destroy so many people o how dreadful say minnehaha we will never hear any more nice story about nanahboozhoo all a pack of lie there never be any such monster snap out old mary who could not longer conceal she jealousy at see how interested the child be in the story hold on mary not so fast cry sagastao take the book from souwana and show the picture to mary there sakehow he say use he favorite term of endearment look for yourself and see those lovely creature -- some of they quite big enough to swallow we all without wink but mary be stubborn as well as jealous and would not give in even when kennedy the favorite dog driver who be present tell she that even now there be some of the great tusk and bone of animal that the officer call mammoth over at the hudson bay company 's fort ready to be ship to england next summer she be however quickly silence when sagastao sit down beside she and throw he head into she lap say very coaxingly : now mary just be quiet and let we hear souwana tell the rest of the story of what nanahboozhoo do to mooshekinnebik peace be thus restore souwana who have be much amuse by mary 's ire resume he story : when nokomi hear she grandson describe how he be go to let the monster swallow he she resolve to come and pitch she tent on the seashore among the people who have be so troubled and there to await the return of she grandson if he should ever come back from such a perilous adventure nanahboozhoo ask he mother for some magic singing stick and also for a very sharp knife then he make for himself a small raft of log and bid she good-bye for a short time he spring on it and be soon float out in search of the dreaded creature over the great water when well out from the shore he begin to make music with he magic stick and to sing a defiant song : ` ho ho great fish down in the sea come if you dare and swallow I my brother all you be fond of eat ` tis time some one give you a beating he he hi hi ho ho ho ho ` you see i be not far away so come and taste I while you may yet not afraid be i no no so hurry up old fish ho ho he he hi hi ho ho ho ho ' nanahboozhoo sing this brave song over and over to the weird harmony of he magic music stick until he reach the place where the great fish be rest when the great monster mooshekinnebik hear the voice of nanahboozhoo he come up to the surface of the water to find out who be make all that music and shout out such defiant word when he see that it be only one young man on a raft of dry log he order one of he child to go and knock the raft to piece and swallow that noisy fellow but this be not what nanahboozhoo want and so he shout out : ' i want the old father fish to eat I ' this make old mooshekinnebik very angry and so open mouth he rush furiously at nanahboozhoo who when the great monster be close enough take a leap into the open mouth and be immediately swallow up for a short time after be swallow nanahboozhoo be unconscious but he soon recover himself and be able to look around and see the queer prison in which he be now confine it be fortunate for he that he have eye like a cat and so could see as well in the dark as in the light he find that he be not the only inmate of this queer prison there be a lot of creature whom he call he brother -- the bear the deer the fox the beaver and even the squirrel nanahboozhoo inquire of they and they tell he how they have be capture and the length of time they have be in that horrid place they also inform he that many other who have be capture be now dead nanahboozhoo find that they be quite hopeless and look forward to nothing but death however he call they around he and inform they that he have willingly come among they for the purpose of afford a speedy deliverance this be indeed good news then he explain to they the plan he have in he mind and say that it be necessary for they to kick up a rumpus in the interior of this monster that they would thus make he so very sick that he would have to go near to land and when they should have he there he think he have another plan that would enable they all to escape -lrb- illustration : he take a leap into the open mouth -rrb- they all agree to do anything they could to help on he plan so nanahboozhoo take out he magic singing stick and begin to play and sing at once the bear the deer the fox the beaver and indeed all of the creature that be still alive catch up the lively tune and such a dancing and jump and fly around be hardly ever see before this internal commotion very much disturbed mooshekinnebik he could not make out what be the matter he shake himself thoroughly but that do no good then he dart off through the water at a great rate but this also be of no use then he roll over and over and over in the water this of course stop the dancing and hubbub inside for a time but as the wall of the prison be soft also the floor and ceiling nobody be hurt and so the instant it cease they be up and at it again harder than ever mooshekinnebik never have such a turn in he life he do not know what to do still nanahboozhoo keep singing louder and louder while the dancer keep up they wild antic around he at length nanahboozhoo decide that the monster be about enough frightened for he to do something else and so he draw out he sharp knife and give mooshekinnebik a good stab near he heart this throw he into convulsion and add to he terror and he begin swim toward the shore when nanahboozhoo know this he keep stab he more and more until at length he body be hear to scrape on the shallow sandy ground at this nanahboozhoo with a mighty effort plunge he knife with all he power deep into the monster 's heart the instant he do this mooshekinnebik be throw into a number of mighty convulsion and in one of they with one tremendous effort he fairly throw himself out of the water on the shore and there he die so great and terrible have be these die convulsion that all the creature inside and even nanahboozhoo himself have become unconscious from be so knock about how long they remain so they do not know nanahboozhoo be the first to regain he sens and he be indeed very sorry to see that all of he comrade be still unconscious he have some difficulty in get out from under the body of he comrade who be pile up on he he be glad that the monster be dead but he be uncertain whether they be on the shore or at the bottom of the water so he speedily determine to find out he climb up over the body of he comrade to the place that he think be the thinnest and there with he keen knife he begin cut through the roof of this queer prison to he great delight he be soon able to see the sunshine come through when he have cut a hole big enough to let in some air and sunshine he take up he magic singing stick and begin singing for the purpose of revive all those imprison with he he song be not much to we but it be a great deal to those shut up in such a prison it be : ` kesik-in-na-win kesik-in-na-win ' -lrb- i see the sky i see the sky -rrb- as nanahboozhoo continue to sing this over and over one after another he brother sneeze and open they eye they be indeed a happy lot at the prospect of deliverance when nanahboozhoo see that they be all now recover he again set to work with he knife and it be not long before he have a hole large enough to permit all of the imprison creature to make they escape the news soon spread and it be not long before nokomi with other come to see the huge dead monster and there be great rejoicing and this add souwana be the tradition as tell by shuniou of how nanahboozhoo destroy mooshekinnebik what become of the little monster ask minnehaha the indian reply souwana under the leadership of nanahboozhoo make such a war upon they that they be soon annihilated chapter xviii welcome springtime in the northland -- how nanahboozhoo kill the great white sea lion the chief of the magician -- the revenge -- the flood -- escape of nanahboozhoo and the animal on the raft -- the creation of a new world the come of the pleasant springtime be hail with great delight seven or eight month be find to be a very long spell of cold winter weather and so when with a rapidity unknown in more southern climate the winter break up and the welcome warm weather make its appearance everybody seem to feel its genial influence the first little wild flower be look for with intense interest and great indeed be the joy of the child when some be find the sweet singing bird that in the previous autumn on the first sign of the come down from the colder north of the frost king have flit away to the summer southland be now return in multitude the air be full of they melody and as score of they fearless and trustful make themselves at home in the bird resort around wahkiegum great indeed be the child 's delight as they welcome they back to they haunt in the north and really it do seem as though the bird be glad to be there again for it be only in the north that these bird sing they sweet love song to each other and build they nest and hatch out they little brood the whisky jack that have be croak out they hoarse cry all winter seem to get sulky and vex that they be now so little admire and so they flit away farther north and bury themselves in the interior of the deepest forest in the joyousness of those happy day up in those high latitudes when the change of every twenty-four hour can easily be notice sagastao and minnehaha for a time troubled neither souwanas nor mary for indian legend or story there be in the rapid melting of the snow the break up of the immense ice field on the lake the appearance of the land and then the grass and flower and the planting of seed in they little garden enough to keep they busy and happy but even all these thing at length lose they interest the flight of the wild goose swan and duck have all cease they with many other kind of migrate bird be busy nesting the sweet songster around the home be everyday companion and while the child love they as much as ever the excitement of they come have die away so when one day they see souwana come over the now sparkling water in he canoe they be delighted to welcome he as usual when he reach the shore the contents of he canoe be examine speedily there the child find a couple of beaver that have but lately be trap and a dozen or more muskrat that souwana have spear in the marsh these animal be the result of one night 's hunting and now souwana be on he way home to have they skin and the pelt prepare for sale to the fur trader the child 's curiosity be much arouse by the sight of the beaver and muskrat and they question the old man about they the queer broad scaly tail of the beaver much interested they and draw from souwana a interesting account of the various purpose for which the clever industrious beaver use this apparently awkward appendage do you know any nanahboozhoo story in which he tell anything about beaver or muskrat ask sagastao yes indeed reply souwana in nearly all the story that be tell about the form of the new land after the great flood both the beaver and the muskrat be mention as well as the other animal tell we one of the story urge little minnehaha the arrival of some other canoe at this point interrupt the conversation the newcomer be on they way to the wigwam of souwana who be they chief he be about to go on with they but when he see the look of disappointment on the face of the child he with he usual thoughtful kindness transfer the two beaver and the muskrat from he own canoe to one of the late arrival then tell the people to give they to he wife to have they all cook and ready for dinner by which time he would join they he send the people on they way have light he calumet with the child seat near he he begin : nanahboozhoo 's life commence long before the great flood of water that cover the earth about which all of we tribe have hear something he have he own wigwam and furnish it with everything he want one day when walk on the shore of a great river he see some sea lion lie on the sandy beach bask in the sun these animal like the beaver could live as well in the water as on the land as he closely watch they from a distance and see the rich shiny skin he think what a nice tobacco pouch could be make out of one of they when nanahboozhoo once set he heart on anything he at once begin to work hard to secure it he try various plan to capture one of these sea-lion but none of they succeed they be too clever to be catch as other animal be and he see that he would have to adopt some unusual method he decide that he would go down very early to the spot on the bank of the river where they be in the habit of sun themselves and disguise himself as a old stump of a tree then when they come out and be enjoy the sunshine he would shoot the fine old white one with the beautiful glossy skin that he have so much admire as on other day the lion come and when they see this stump the white lion which be a kind of king among they say : ' i never see that big stump before i think it must be nanahboozhoo ' another one say he think the same thing other only laugh and say ` it be only a old pine stump ' however as a number of they be suspicious it be decide to go up and shake it and see if it would move and thus really find out they go to it and three of they together use they greatest effort to move it nanahboozhoo have to make one of the hardest effort of he life to hold firm however he succeed and so the lion only say : ` it really be a stump of a tree but it be very strange we do not notice it before ' then they roll about on the warm sand in the sunshine until one after another fall asleep nanahboozhoo now noiselessly and quickly turn himself into a young hunter then take up he bow and arrow he shoot the white lion he arrow stick fast in he body and badly wound he but do not kill he at once the lion all plunge into the river and disappear nanahboozhoo be sorry that he do not get the lion 's skin indeed he be greatly vex and annoy to have to return to he wigwam without it a day or two after as he be walk in the wood he meet with a very old woman she have a bundle of slippery elm bark out of which poultice be make by the indian for wound and bruise and also some root for medicine ` where be you go nookoom -lrb- grandmother -rrb- and what be you go to do with the bark and root ' ` o ' say she ` you can not imagine what trouble we be in for nanahboozhoo have shoot and badly wound one of we chief and great effort be go to be make to catch and kill he ' she also tell he that she have be honor in be send for to come and use all of she healing art to try and restore the wounded chief to health again and that now she be on she way to he abode to poultice he with the slippery elm bark and to give he medicine make by boil the root to allay the great fever from which he be suffer nanahboozhoo thus discover that these lion as he have suppose they to be be wicked magician who have be do a great deal of harm and who when they choose to do so could change themselves into the form of lion and live either under the water or on land as best suit they to escape from be kill by those whom they have injure as the old woman be very talkative nanahboozhoo soon obtain from she all the information he desire among other thing she tell he that sometimes people come to she for bad medicine to give to person with whom they have quarrel and in this way they would kill they with the poison which she make out of toadstool and other deadly thing hear these dreadful fact from she own lip nanahboozhoo resolve to kill she but first he have she tell he where the wound chief 's abode be and all about what be expect of she when she arrive there he then speedily tomahawk she and clothing himself in she garment he make himself look exactly like she after which he take up she bundle of bark and root and go to the dwelling of the chief there he find quite a crowd assemble but all be in confusion and excitement on account of the wound chief when they see as they think the old woman come whom they be eagerly expect they make way for she nanahboozhoo go straight to the place where the wound chief lay he be surprise to see that the arrow which he have shoot be still stick in he side he make a great ado about prepare the poultice and medicine and set everybody around he do something to help carry out he plan then when all be hurry and none look at he nanahboozhoo push the arrow with such force into the body of the chief that it kill he instantly then with a shout of triumph he make he escape -lrb- illustration : he run away west to the great mountain -rrb- there be of course great excitement among the people they at once call a council and consult what they should do to destroy nanahboozhoo they be as i have tell you magician and have power to raise the water and so they resolve to drown he they accordingly call on the water to rise and rush over the plain and forest in the direction in which he live nanahboozhoo have travel with great speed back to he wigwam but hardly have he reach it ere he hear the roar of the flood of water that be come to overwhelm he he see he great danger and he run away west to the great mountain but the flood of water continue rise and drive he up higher and higher when he see that he be near the highest peak he begin to think what he must do next around he in the rage water be quantity of log and tree and among they or on the now small peak of land be number of various animal with all he power he set to work and it be not very long ere he have a large raft make out of the float log as the last spot of land be now be overwhelm by the flood and he pity the animal that be swim about he take they on the raft with he as nanahboozhoo know all the animal and they language he hold a council on the raft he tell they that if he could get even a very little of the old world that be drown he could make a new world for they all he first ask the otter if he would try and see if he could dive down and bring up a little portion of the earth the otter at once make the attempt but after a while he come up to the surface apparently quite dead nanahboozhoo reach out and lift he in and place he in a sunny spot on the raft then the beaver try he take a great header and down he dive resolve to succeed if possible but after a time even he come up apparently as lifeless as the otter nanahboozhoo lift he body up out of the water and lay it in the sun by the side of the otter the muskrat next volunteer to try what he could do so down he dive and after a much longer time than the other have be down he too float up senseless and cold nanahboozhoo take he up and as he do so he notice that there be earth in he mouth and on he paw he carefully collect this in he hand and then place the body of the muskrat beside the otter and the beaver he then blow upon the earth and thus make it dry and porous so that when it be place in the water it would not sink but float he then put a lively little mouse upon it which by run round and round upon the earth make it grow larger and larger nanahboozhoo then put a squirrel upon it for the same object then the marten and mink -- for the new earth be now so extend that it could hold up these light animal for a time nanahboozhoo have to guard the now rapidly grow young world from the larger animal with a stick for fear they would sink it they be all very tired of have to remain huddle together so long on the raft and be eager to follow the smaller creature that seem so happy on the new earth even if it be not very large as yet as there be much to be do to fit this new world up for they to dwell upon everyone have to do what he could the bird be send to fly over the water to pick up branch and seed by and by nanahboozhoo decide that the earth which have now grow beyond the reach of he eye be large enough and so he revive the otter the beaver and the muskrat and with they and all the other animal around he he take possession of the new world in order to ascertain the size of the world he send a wolf to run to the end of it and then to return at once to he the wolf easily make the journey in one day nanahboozhoo then keep he with he for some time and again send he off the second journey take he five day the third ten the fourth a month then he be go a year and then five year thus it go on until at length nanahboozhoo start off a young wolf just able to run on the long journey this one die of old age ere he have complete the trip nanahboozhoo then say that the world be large enough and command it to cease from grow chapter xix among the brier and wild rose -- why the rose have thorn -- why the wild rabbit be white in winter one day as the child be out in the clearing back of they home gather some of the wild strawberry that grow there and also some of the wildflower that bloom during the short brilliant summer they be delighted to see souwana come along the road with he gun on he shoulder and some duck and rabbit in he hand very cordial be they greeting but soon the quick eye of the kindly indian notice that there be several long red scratch and even some drop of partly dry blood on the hand of he little friend it be hardly necessary for he to ask the cause of the wound as the bunch of sweet brier and wild rose with they sharp needle-like thorn in the happy child 's hand tell the tale put down he gun and game souwana quickly gather some of the sweet fragrant grass which be there so abundant and skillfully twist it into little coil he wind one around each of the bunch of flower which the child have gather and which they be still have trouble to hold on account of the thorn the bouquet thus arrange could now be carry without inflict any more wound or pain amid they chat and laughter for these white child be teach like indian child not to be afraid of a few scratch or a little pain minnehaha who be industriously wipe the blood from some wound on she little white hand with she apron say : how be it souwana that all these rosebush and brier have such sharp thorn on they i suppose mary would say that nanahboozhoo the rascal have something to do with it put in sagastao at this reference to mary there be a mischievous twinkle in the eye of the old indian yes he reply nanahboozhoo have lot to do with it and yet when you hear the story you will see that he be not such a rascal at the time he do it as mary would make out but almost as good as she pet wakonda who give the bee they sting o tell we all about it now say minnehaha we have this forenoon as a half holiday and papa be to join we in about a hour for a walk in the wood the kind-hearted old indian have be please with the plucky way in which the child have slight they wound hand and before he begin he story he act the part of the skillful physician he find some soft juicy leave which he crush and spread on the ugly red scratch the effect be magical and the child who have so bravely treat they wound with indifference gratefully acknowledge the sudden cessation of the smart select a pretty spot under a clump of balsam tree where some boulder-like stone afford they comfortable seat the child cuddle down with they old friend to hear how the rose get they thorn long ago the rose be the most abundant of flower but they grow on bush that be smooth and fragrant and such delicious eating that all the animal that eat grass or browse be constantly seek for and devour not only the rise flower but also the bush on which they grow the result be that the rose of all kind be in danger of be exterminate in those day tree and flower and other thing have greater power of think and act than they have now and so the rose of different kind meet in council to decide what could be do to preserve those of they that be still leave in existence it be decide that a deputation of they should be send to nanahboozhoo to implore he assistance he be such a eccentric fellow and assume so many disguise that they have a good deal of difficulty in find he they travel long distance and inquire of the various wild animal they meet and even consult the tree and hill at length they be inform that he be now live in a valley among the mountain and experiment as a gardener they hurry away as fast as the fierce wind which they have hire to carry they could blow they along at first when they reach he abode they be very much frightened as it be easy to observe from the loud angry tone in which nanahboozhoo although afar off be speak that he be in a great rage however they have come too far to be easily discourage they quietly draw near and hide behind some dense balsam tree they carefully listen to find out the cause of he anger fortunately they could not have come at a better time for themselves for it seem that nanahboozhoo have become very much interested in he work as a gardener all the thing he have plant have grow so well that in order to protect they from prowl wild animal he have set all around the garden a fine hedge of rosebush so many be require that nanahboozhoo have be oblige to transplant bush from a great distance around for they do not grow so abundantly as formerly the morning of the very day on which the deputation of the rosebush arrive nanahboozhoo have return from one of he short adventure fancy he indignation at find that in he absence all sort of animal from the rabbit to the mountain elk have visit he abode and have not only completely eat that lovely hedge of rosebush but have also greatly injure the beautiful garden of which he be so proud when the deputation of rose understand the cause of he wrath they at once leave they hiding place and aid by a sudden puff of wind come before nanahboozhoo the sight of they excite he curiosity as it have seem to he that every rosebush have be destroy before he could say a word however the rosebush who be then able to talk at once present they petition and plead for he powerful assistance to save they from be exterminate by they enemy nanahboozhoo listen to they petition and after some consultation with the rose bush it be decide to cover the stock and branch up to the very beautiful flower with small thorn-like prickle so that every animal henceforth would be afraid to either devour or closely approach they as they have be accustom to do in the past with this protection grant they they be more than pleased and so it now happen that rose of many kind still exist in various part of the world thank you very much for that story say minnehaha even if nanahboozhoo do put prickle on the rosebush he be not a rascal for we would not have have any rose at all but for what he do for a wonder sagastao be silent for a time but at length he find something to say and he word be a bit of a confession and promise of amendment : now that i know why it be that the prickle be on the wild rose i 'll not get mad even if my finger bleed when i be gather a bouquet for mother at this moment the two favorite dog jack and cuffy come bound up by this the child know that they father be not far behind and they be not disappoint at first he look anxious when he see the little hand wrap up in green leaf but as with merry laugh they tell he what the leaf be for everything be bright again souwana be greet very cordially as usual and assure that at the mission house he would find in the mistress a willing purchaser of he duck and rabbit the child be always interested in the game although minnehaha strongly declare that it be a pity to kill the pretty creature souwana and they father be chat together while the child be turn the duck and rabbit over see what red eye some of the duck have say sagastao they look as though they have be cry guess you would have cry too rather indignantly reply minnehaha if you have be shoot as they be huh he reply with a tinge of contempt how could they cry after be shoot i do not believe that be it at all and look here minnehaha i be go also to ask why it be that while all the rabbit be so white in winter they be all now so brown in summer quickly the resolve be carry out and so while minnehaha be tell she father what a beautiful story they have hear about the rose sagastao with he hand on the shoulder of the old indian who be seat on a rock be eagerly firing at he he double-barreled question : why have some duck such red eye and why be the rabbit white in winter and brown in summer both do by nanahboozhoo say the old man with a smile as he take he pipe out of he mouth hurrah for nanahboozhoo shout the lad this outburst on the part of sagastao at once attract the attention of the other to he and minnehaha want to know what be the matter now why do you not hear souwana say that nanahboozhoo give the duck the red eye and make the rabbit to be white in winter and brown in summer then turn to souwana he ask how do nanahboozhoo do it here the father while amuse at the lad 's enthusiasm interpose and say : you have already keep souwana a long time and perhaps he be busy busy say the irrepressible sagastao who be shrewd beyond he year busy why souwana would rather tell story than do anything else -- unless to smoke he pipe then he glibly tell souwana in saulteaux what have pass between he and he father in english and add be that not so souwana the old indian smile and say kindly : how can i help enjoy tell story when i have such good little listener but what about he dinner ask the kind-hearted minnehaha if we keep he here tell story he will be too late to get back to he wigwam for he dinner i think we have better take he home with we this be quickly decide upon and that there might be no mistake a piece of bark be quickly cut from a birch tree and a few line write upon it tell the good mother in the home that they have meet souwana and that he be entertain the child with nanahboozhoo story and would be with they to dinner then jack the great dog be call and send back with the missive with order to give it to he mistress as the dog dash away homeward the mischievous sagastao say : my do not i wish i be in the kitchen when mary hear that we be out here with souwana listen to story about nanahboozhoo will not she be hop mad it will be better say he father for souwana to tell he story than for you to make any further remark of that kind at first souwana seem to show some hesitancy in begin he story in the presence of he missionary and he whisper to sagastao he fear that perhaps he father would not care for such trifle as indian legend and story with he usual bluntness the lad declare : o you do not know we father if you think that way about he he love nice story as well as we do and tell we lot of they so go ahead for you be go home to dinner with we thus assure the old man begin : i will tell you to-day about how it be that the rabbit be white in winter long ago they be always brown just like those that be lie there with the duck it be true that they increase very fast but then it be very true that they have many enemy they have not many way to defend themselves against they foe who be of so many kind almost all the animal that live on flesh be always hunting for rabbit and so be the fox of all kind the wild cat wolf and wolverine and even the little weasel and ermine then there be fierce bird -- the eagle the hawk of all kind and the owl -- that be always on the lookout for rabbit young or old the result be that with this war continually be wage against they the poor rabbit have a hard time of it and especially in winter for they find it very difficult to hide themselves when the leaf be off the tree and the ground cover with snow in those day in the long ago the animal use to have a great council there the great father or head of each kind of animal and bird use to meet together and talk about they welfare and the welfare of each other then there be peace and friendship among they while at the council they appoint a king and he preside as a great head chief all the animal that have trouble or grievance have a right to come and speak about they and if possible have they remedy some queer thing be say sometimes at one council the bear find great fault with the fox who have deceive he and have cause he to lose he beautiful tail by tell he to go and catch fish in a big crack in the ice he sit there so long that the crack freeze up solidly and to save he life he have to break off he tail but all the thing they talk about be not so funny as that they have they trouble and danger and they discuss various plan for improve they condition and consider how they could best defeat the skill and cleverness of the human hunter when the rabbit 's turn come to be hear he have indeed a sorrowful tale to tell he say that he people be nearly all destroy the rest of the world seem combine against he race and they be kill they by day and night in summer and winter and they have but little power to fight against they many enemy they be almost discourage but have come to the council to see if they brethren could suggest any remedy or plan to save they from complete destruction while the rabbit be speak the wolverine wink at the wildcat while the fox although he try to look solemn could not keep he mouth from water at the thought of the many rabbit he intend yet to eat thus it can be see that the poor harmless rabbit do not get much sympathy from that part of the crowd that kill he race all the rest of the year still there be some animal like the moose and the reindeer and the mountain goat that stand up in the council and speak out bravely for the rabbit indeed they tell the animal that have only laugh at the rabbit 's sad story that if nothing be do for the little rabbit and they go on kill as they be do they would soon be the greatest sufferer for if the rabbit be all go there be nothing else that they could get in sufficient number to keep they alive this which be a fact rather sober some of they at first but they soon resume they mocking at the poor little rabbit and he story and as they be in the majority the council refuse to do anything in the matter when the moose hear the decision of the council he be very sorry for he poor little brother the rabbit so after think it over he tell the rabbit to jump up on one of he flat horn while he be hold they down then the moose carry he out some distance from the council meeting and say : there be no hope for you here the most of the animal live on you and so they will not do anything that will make it more difficult for you to be catch than it be now you only chance be to go to nanahboozhoo and see what he can do for you hurrah shout sagastao i think it would be to nanahboozhoo after all continue souwana say : the moose encourage the rabbit by say ` nanahboozhoo 's name be once manabush or keche-wapoose great rabbit and so i be sure he will be you friend as i think he be a distant relation ' not wait for the council to close away speed the rabbit along the route describe by the moose who have lately find out where nanahboozhoo be stop the rabbit be such a timid creature that when he come near to nanahboozhoo he be much afraid that he would not be welcome however he case be desperate and although he heart be thump within he with fear he hurry along to have the thing over as soon as possible to he great joy he find nanahboozhoo in the best of humor and he be receive most kindly nanahboozhoo saw how wearied and tire the rabbit be after the long journey and so he make he rest on some fragrant grass in the sunshine while he go out and bring in for he to eat some of the choicest thing from he garden then afterward he have the rabbit tell of all he trouble and of how he be treat at the council this part of the story of how they act at the council make nanahboozhoo very angry ` and that be the way they treat this little brother at the council we have give they where it be expect that the smallest and the weakest shall have the same right to have he case hear and attend to as the biggest and strongest it be high time that somebody be come to I with council news if thing be like this look out mister fox and wolverine and wild cat for if i get after you i will so straighten you out that you will be sorry that the rabbit have to go to nanahboozhoo for the help you ought to have give he ' nanahboozhoo have work himself up into such a furious temper that the rabbit be almost frighten to death but when he see this nanahboozhoo only laugh at he and say he be sorry to have scare he ' i be so angry ' say nanahboozhoo ` at those animal for ill-treat you that i forget myself and now little brother what do you want I to do for you ' they have a long talk about the matter and the decision be that there should be two great change the first be that the eye of the rabbit be to be so increase in power that they should in future be able to see by night as well as by day and the second be that in all northland where much snow fall during many month of the year rabbit shall change into a beautiful white color like the snow and thus continue as long as the winter last and the rabbit now have a much better time than they have formerly they can glide away in the darkness from they enemy when in the wood and when out in the snow they be not easily see and often escape notice by remain perfectly still but long ere souwana have end jack have return from the home with a note to say that dinner would soon be ready and that no one could be more welcome than souwana but what about the red eye of the duck say the two child whose appetite for story be simply -- well like those of other boy and girl here the father have to interfere and say that there have be quite enough for one day however before the walk homeward begin souwana be pledge to tell the other story at the first convenient opportunity chapter xx pass hunter and they spoil -- the vain woman -- why the marten have a white spot on he breast as the home where sagastao and minnehaha live be near a trail along which number of indian hunter be accustom to travel when on they way to the trading post with they fur they frequently call in to see they loved friend the paleface these hunter be always welcome and as they be very seldom in a hurry the child draw from they many a quaint indian legend or story of animal life it be also a great pleasure for the child to have the hunter return from a successful trip open they fur pack and spread out before they the rich fur and tell they story about these animal -- the silver fox the otter beaver mink marten ermine and sometimes even about great bear and wolf whose skin they have often have these valuable fur be generally well dress and prepare for shipment by the industrious woman before they be take to the trading post sometimes however a hunter when on the trail to the trading post would find in one of he trap a animal just catch and not have time to return to he wigwam and have the skin dress and dry he would carry the animal just as it be and sell it to the fur trader one day there call a number of indian and among they be a hunter with a couple of marten which he have catch in he trap that very morning sagastao and minnehaha have never see these little animal before and they handle they with much interest and ask several question about they why have the marten that queer white spot on its throat ask minnehaha the indian look at each other and a grim smile flit over they bronzed face when they hear this question they conduct only the more excited the curiosity of the child and they both clamor for the answer then one of the indian say : ask mary she know all about the story and as a woman be in the affair she can tell it better than we can with this answer the child have to be content for the hunter have drink they cup of tea soon take they departure when the child find mary they at once demand the story what story say mary o you know what we want for you be in the kitchen and hear what be say -lrb- illustration : wigwam and indian -rrb- but mary still protest she ignorance and declare that she have be so busy care for souwanaquenapeke that she have not listen to half the chatter that have pass between they and the indian o i know you sakehow mary say sagastao you do not want to tell we because there be a woman like yourself mix up in it mary bridle up with indignation but before she could utter a word the arm of sagastao be around she neck and he cry : forgive I sakehou for speak so foolishly i do remember now that you have leave the kitchen with baby before minnehaha ask the question this prompt apology and the sweet word sakehow restore harmony and mary be now anxious to please they what be the question which interested you ask mary why have the marten that queer white spot on its throat ask minnehaha and the man tell we to go to you because there be a woman in it add sagastao mary smile when she hear this yes she say there be a foolish woman mix up in the story it be like this as far as i can remember and it be a story from the north people long ago a man have a wife who be a very proud vain woman she be not contented with have she husband and she own people say nice thing about she but she want to be flatter and admire by every creature you know that i have tell you that in old time animal could talk and do many thing well this conceited woman with she silly foolish way begin attract the different animal around she almost everybody be laugh at she but she seem to think it great fun to have so many admirer she get a lesson one day when flirt with the bear they be walk along together and she let he put he arm around she but he give she such a hug that he break two of she rib she be a long time get well and then she husband give she a great lecture you would have think that this would have cure she but not a bit of it when she be well again she be just as silly as ever though she take good care not to flirt with any animal that could hug like a bear she next bewitch the skunk with she foolishness but one day as they walk together a dog suddenly attack the skunk and in he anger and excitement he so perfumed the woman instead of the dog with he odor that she husband find she out and give she a beat everybody be now laugh at she on account of she silly way and as she husband have person employ to see what creature she go out walk with she have to remain at home in she wigwam but when a woman get proud and conceited and carry on like this one do she be hard to cure the fact be she husband be too kind to she he do not give she plenty of work to keep she busy and out of mischief instead of make she chop the wood and carry the water and do other hard thing he do it for she for he be very proud of she and she be indeed a beautiful woman he do however make she stay in they wigwam instead of allow she to go about wherever she like she spend most of she time in fix herself up in she beautiful clothes and think what a lovely creature she be but she soon miss the flattery of she admirer and resolve that in spite of she husband she would try to hear it again so vigilant however be she husband and he friend that they be too clever for she one day she husband return from hunting and visit he trap and snare among other animal that he have trap be a beautiful marten he have catch it in what be call a dead-fall that be where a log be so arrange that when the animal reach the bait he be directly under the log which fall upon he the instant he pull the bait when the woman take up the marten which she husband have throw at she foot she notice that it be still quite warm but she say nothing about it to she husband who pick up a ax and blanket say that he be go off to visit he more distant trap and would not be back for some day before he leave he make she promise that she would not leave the wigwam until he return the woman as soon as she be sure that she husband be really go pick up the marten on examine it she be convince that it be not dead only knock senseless by the fall log so she rub it and breathe into its nostril and then with a reed blow air into its lung sure enough the life be in it and the first sign it give be a big sneeze or two at this the woman wrap it up in a warm covering and hold it until it be well again the marten of course be very much frighten when it find itself in the hand of a woman it be about to struggle to get free when the woman speak to it in its own language at this it be very much surprised and more so when the woman tell it how she have give it back its life and that now in return it must do what she desire any animal or human be would be willing to promise as much when its life have be thus restore to it ' i will do anything i can for you ' say the marten ' i want you to go to you king marten ' say the woman ` and tell he that a beautiful lady have hear so many wonderful thing about he that she be very anxious to have a visit from he ' this the marten promise to do and it be not very long before the king marten come of course he have to be very cautious as he have be warn of the many who be watch the silly woman hardly however have he time to say much to she before the footstep of she husband be hear outside the instant he open the door of the wigwam the king marten run out and disappear in the forest ` what be that ' ask the husband ' o dear that be the marten you trap it must have come to life and escape ' say the woman who thus cleverly save herself and the king marten the man be suspicious but as the marten which he have trap be not to be find he could not find fault with she except to say that she ought to have skin the marten soon after he have bring it in the king marten who be a very conceited fellow have be quite strike with the beauty of the woman and so in spite of he narrow escape he resolve to go and see she again by watch she husband 's departure he manage to have several brief visit and at length become so infatuate with she that he try to coax she to run away with he when she hear this she be very angry for with all she foolishness she have only act as she do because of she vanity and love of flattery now that the marten have dare make such a request she resolve that he should be punish so one day when he be sit beside she and say a lot of foolish flattery she hear the footstep of she husband approach but do not warn the king marten so the man thus catch the old marten sit by the side of he wife at this he be much annoyed and as the marten suddenly run out the man ask the woman what it mean so she tell he all that the marten have say and of he impertinence in ask she to leave he and become the marten 's wife at this the man be very indignant and so they arrange to punish the marten the next time the man go off he tell he wife to fill the kettle with water and put it on the fire to boil then the man take he trap and start off as though he be go on a long journey but he only go a little way just far enough to throw the marten off he guard and sure enough while he be watch he see the marten go into the wigwam then the man come quietly to the door and listen he hear the marten urge he wife to leave and run away with he then he suddenly spring into the tent and shout out : ` old king marten what be you do here how dare you talk to my wife ' so say the man seize the kettle of boiling water and throw its contents at the marten severely scald he the marten tear at he burn breast as he dash away into the wood and from that day to this all marten have that whitish spot on they chest cause by that burn what become of the woman say sagastao never mind now we have waste too much time already on such a good-for-nothing conceited flirt say mary chapter xxi shooting loon -- why the loon have a flat back red eye and such queer foot -- nanahboozhoo lose he dinner -- origin of lichen -- why some willow be red -- the partridge nothing give the child greater pleasure than to have the indian take they in they canoe for a couple of hour ' trip on the bright water of the beautiful lake that spread out before they home these pleasant outing be sometimes render exciting and doubly interesting by the sight of a black bear or a deer wander on the shore or swimming from some point on the island at other time there would be number of loon or great northern diver as they be generally call they wonderful quickness in diving then the length of time that they could remain under the water and the great distance they would swim before come to the surface be watch with great interest by both sagastao and minnehaha the indian do not often hunt loon in fact they find it so difficult to shoot one that more than its value in ammunition be generally expend in the attempt the indian always declare that these clever bird could see the flash of they gun and dive down out of danger before the shot reach they however as some of they be desire for they beautiful feather-covered skin which make most valuable and beautiful cap and muff it be decide that souwana and kennedy should take the missionary 's breech-loading rifle in addition to they own gun and try to secure a few the child beg to be allow to accompany they and as the day be unusually fine and the lake almost without a ripple they be give a holiday and allow the privilege of a all-day outing with these two trusty and experienced man a generous lunch with the indispensable tea kettle be place in the canoe by careful mary who as usual be angry that the child be to be so long under the witchery of old souwana with the merry shout of laughter from the child as they accompaniment the two indian skillfully ply they paddle and it be not long before they be some mile distant and on the lookout for loon it often happen that the thing desire be the last to come so it be this day wild duck in goodly number and even goose and some swan and pelican be frequently see at length however strange mournful sound far ahead be hear and the experienced indian know that the bird for which they be look be not far away still it be some time before the first long white neck and black head be see in the distance for the cry of the loon not only differ from that of any other bird but be very far-reaching the excited child be now tell to be very still and keep quiet use they eye alone and witness the contest between man 's skill and the bird ' cleverness so accustomed have some old loon become to be fire at and miss by indian use the old-fashioned flintlock shotgun which make such a flash when fire that they just barely keep out of range the instant they see the fire flash -- down they go and then as the shot or bullet strike the place where they be they bob up again serenely in the same spot or in one not very far distant this risky sport some of they will keep up for hour or until the disheartened hunter have waste nearly all they ammunition to-day however there be to be a new weapon try against they and alas for they they be sadly worst kennedy first load he old flintlock shotgun and blaze away but as usual they be out of sight under the water before the shot strike the place where the loon have be for a time the loon be shy and swim quite a distance away but after a while as they find that kennedy 's gunshot could be dodge they do not bother to swim very far away this be just what souwana be wait for he now take up the rifle and as soon as a loon come to the surface he fire from this new weapon that give no flash to warn the poor bird of the deadly bullet that be so rapidly speed on its way thus it happen that loon after loon be strike and several beautiful bird be secure -- greatly to the sorrow of the child who delight in watch they clever diving and sudden reappearance after kennedy discharge he old gun out of deference to they feeling the indian soon cease shooting although with this new rifle they could easily have secure many more let we now go ashore on one of these island say sagastao and have we lunch and a nanahboozhoo story after put in minnehaha this plan be just what the indian be think about and so in a short time they be all on the shore dry wood be abundant and a bright fire be soon burn and then when the water be boil and the tea make the lunch basket be open and the meal be much enjoy by all now souwana say minnehaha we be all ready for the story at the same time and if you pipe go out i 'll hand you a burning stick with which you can light it again maybe i will keep you very busy remark the old man much amuse at the offer -- and so it prove for he pipe to-day persist in go out one day begin souwana as nanahboozhoo be walk along the shore of a lake he become hungry he consider what it would be best for he to do in order to procure something to eat he decide to deceive the waterfowl he see a duck swimming along near the shore and speak to the bird in this fashion : ` come here my brother ' ` what be it ' say the duck as it approach nanahboozhoo ` kesha munedoo -lrb- gracious spirit -rrb- have reveal word to I to tell to all the waterfowl some very important thing go and tell all sort of waterfowl to come and when they be all together i will inform you what have be reveal to I ' the duck obey nanahboozhoo who in the meantime make a very bare wigwam of green bough or rather cause it to appear that he do for he do not exert much labor upon it all sort of waterfowl come to nanahboozhoo and they seem anxious to hear what have be reveal nanahboozhoo receive they with great apparent friendliness and invite they to come into the wigwam when they have all enter he say : ` you must all dance first before i tell you what have be reveal to I all of you must stand close together around inside of the wigwam and put you neck close together while dancing and all of you must flap you wing at the same time ' then nanahboozhoo commence singing : ` pau-zau-gwa-be-she-moog ke-ku-ma-mis-kwa-she-gun ' -lrb- ` shut you eye and i 'll make you wise ' -rrb- these word nanahboozhoo repeat three time all the fowl keep time to the music and word of the song and dance shut they eye nanahboozhoo continue singing change to the follow word : ` au-yun-ze-kwa-gau ' all the time such be nanahboozhoo 's power over the bird that they keep singing and dancing and at the same time hold they head close together nanahboozhoo 's voice be singing in the center of the tent he drum beat at the same time while he in person go around in the wigwam or lodge wring the neck of the waterfowl and throw they on the side of the lodge the loon the great diver bird be dance on the open door side of the lodge he suspect that nanahboozhoo be up to some of he trick do something bad so he open he eye and see at once he give the alarm and shout : ` nanahboozhoo be kill we ' all the fowl that be still alive when they hear these word at once fly out at the top opening of the lodge except the loon or diver and he be at the door turn and run out of the lodge as fast as he could toward the shore of the lake nanahboozhoo be so angry at he for daring to open he eye and then for warn the other enable many of they to get away that he run after he and stamp upon he as he have just reach the shore hence it be because of nanahboozhoo 's cruelty that the loon have have a flat back and red eye and its foot be so unlike those of any other waterfowl when nanahboozhoo have make a large fire he take the waterfowl he have kill before the diver give the alarm and cover they under the ash leave only they foot stick out while he be wait for they to cook he feel very sleepy so he lay down to rest but before he go to sleep he say ` my face side have always do all the watch this be not fair i will make my back do its share of the watch ' so as he cuddle down to have a sleep before the fire he say to he back : ` now you do the watch you lazy broad back while i be sleep ' then be very tired he fall into a heavy sleep after a time the watcher call out : ` nanahboozhoo indian be come ' nanahboozhoo slightly raise himself but he see no indian so he lay down to sleep again but again and yet again for three time do he faithful watcher call and warn he against he approach enemy nanahboozhoo be now so stupid with sleep that he only arouse himself a little not enough to enable he to detect the lurk enemy so he become very angry with he watcher he broad back and give it a great thrashing say : ` there take that you great stupid watcher for so disturbing I with you false report ' then nanahboozhoo fall asleep again the broad back be very much offend at the treatment he have receive for he know he be right and now though the indian be close at hand he do not again warn nanahboozhoo so the enemy come and steal all of he cook fowl the indian carefully lift out the fowl by they leg which nanahboozhoo leave stick up when they have eat the body of the fowl they stick back the leg in the ash as nanahboozhoo have leave they when at last he sleep be end nanahboozhoo arise ready for he meal of nicely cook fowl great indeed be he surprise and indignation when he pull out the foot from the ash and find that the body of the fowl be not there he fly into a passion and resolve to punish he back so he make a fire of big tree and stand with he back very close to it when he flesh begin to be badly burn it blistered and make a noise like the roasting of meat nanahboozhoo do not at first seem to mind the pain and only say : ` you may well say ` zeeng zeeng ' in you burning i will teach you a lesson you will remember for not tell I that the indian be steal my roasted waterfowl ' nanahboozhoo then go on he way but in spite of he magic power he feel a sort of a soreness in he back he twist he head around and see the blister that have be make by the fierce fire so he think how he must get rid of they for they bother he although nothing could injure he for very long while walk on the edge of a precipice he slip -- and away he slide far down the rocky side when he reach the bottom he look back and there on the rock on which he have slide down he see thing which he have never see before ` my nephew ' say nanahboozhoo ` when they see these thing on the rock will call they wau-konug -lrb- lichen -rrb- and although they be poor food they will keep they from starve when they have nothing better ' this be the indian tradition of the origin of the patch of lichen attach to the bare rock the indian still call they ` no-scab ' and when boil they make a kind of jelly food which be a little better than starvation then nanahboozhoo although he back be bleed from he slide down the rough rock continue walk sometimes along the shore and sometimes in the thick bush in one place where the thicket be very dense such be he magic power that he pull a lot of the thicket together and walk over on they top when he look back he see that the blood from the wound in he back have give a red color to the bush over which he have walk then say nanahboozhoo : ` my nephew will call these bush me-squah-be-me-sheen -lrb- red willow -rrb- they will use they to stop bleed when they meet with any severe accident ' and such the indian still do when they live among they this be the tradition as to the origin of the red willow once so common in many of the indian haunt the reason why the partridge be call kosh-ko-e-wa-soo -lrb- one that startle -rrb- be because one make even nanahboozhoo give a big jump it happen in this way : as nanahboozhoo be walk along one day in the wood he see a small creature this little thing think it would be best for he to be brave in the presence of nanahboozhoo and so when he be ask who he be he answer : ' i be one who startle ' ` you can not startle I ' say nanahboozhoo the little creature suddenly fly away and nanahboozhoo resume he journey by and by he reach a dangerous rocky point on the shore just as he be at the worst point the partridge suddenly fly almost from under he foot with a rumble noise and so startle he that he jump up spring quickly aside fall into the water and get a great wet so even nanahboozhoo have to confirm the name of the little partridge the return trip be not much enjoy by the child the dead loon in the canoe do not look as attractive as they have appear when swimming and diving so gracefully in the lake souwana be quick to notice they depression of spirit and he there and then resolve that he would never again shoot any living thing in they presence and he faithfully keep he resolve mary meet they as they land and she quick eye detect the change in they spirit and as they wear they heart on they sleeve for she she quickly find out the cause of they sorrow she be not slow in avail herself of the opportunity afford of give souwana and kennedy a vigorous scolding for nearly break the heart of she precious darling by kill in they presence some of the bird whose play they have often watch for hour together the two man take she scolding in they usual silent way and then have a quiet laugh together when she wrath have exhaust itself and she have indignantly walk off with the child chapter xxii nanahboozhoo 's ride on the back of the buzzard who let he fall -- a short-lived triumph -- why the buzzard have no feather on he head or neck one beautiful warm day when the leaf of the tree be all bright and golden with they autumnal tint the child be visit at the tent of souwana the old man be make a beautiful little bow and a quiver full of arrow for sagastao while the old wife be manufacture a elaborate baby cradle of the indian pattern for minnehaha in which she could carry she favorite doll in the style popular among the indian girl the child be much interested in watch these highly-prized gift be prepare for they and of course have much to say in the way of thanks to those who be do so much to add to they happiness while they be thus busy several canoe be see come from the south as the wind be favorable sail have be improvise out of blanket each fasten to a couple of oar and with these simple appliance they speed rapidly along see souwana 's wigwam on the point of land the indians come to the shore and smoked and chat for a short time ere they resume they journey toward the north -lrb- illustration : the indian story-teller -rrb- they have in they canoe quite a variety of game and among they a large ill-smelling bird call a turkey-buzzard it be say that the young indian hunter who have shoot it think at first that it really be a turkey but he find out he mistake when he go to lift it from the ground where it have fall the odor be so offensive that at first he think he would leave it behind but when he remember that often some of the large feather be use in ornamental work he decide to bring it along the child be interested in its appearance as this be the first dead turkey-buzzard they have ever see look souwana say minnehaha the poor birdie have no feather on its neck or head it must be very cold there when the winter come well i think that as likely as not it be its own fault that it lose its feather say sagastao and then he add as he poke the rank bird over with a stick : i would not be surprise to hear that nanahboozhoo have something to do with it nanahboozhoo have say souwana and it be because of a mean trick that the buzzard play upon he and now that these indian be off who be in a hurry to reach poplar point if you will sit down on the rock in the warm sunshine i will tell you the story no second invitation be necessary so while the child seat themselves near he on the smooth granite rock the old man continue he arrow make and tell they the follow story : one day when nanahboozhoo be walk through the country he see the buzzard soar up high in the air like a eagle he be make graceful circle round and round with very little effort after a time the buzzard fly down to the earth and there he stand on a rock with he great wing outstretch nanahboozhoo quietly approach and enter into conversation with he ` brother buzzard ' he say ` you must be very happy when sail around up there in the blue sky where you can so easily see everything that be go on down here on the world below you i wish you would take I up there on you back and let I see how this world look from that high place in the blue sky where you live so much ' the buzzard on hearing this request at once fly down to the side of nanahboozhoo and say : ' i will with pleasure take you up on my back and let you see as you desire how the world look from that high place ' then nanahboozhoo see how smooth be the back of the great bird say : ` brother buzzard you back be so smooth that i be afraid i will slip off so you must be careful not to sweep round too rapidly in you circle in the sky ' the buzzard tell nanahboozhoo that he would be very careful although at the same time he be resolve if it be possible to play a trick on he for he have a grudge of some long standing against he which nanahboozhoo seem to have forget nanahboozhoo then mount on the back of the great buzzard and hold by he feather as well as he possibly could the buzzard then take a short run spring from the ground and spread he great strong wing speedily rise up higher and higher in the sky nanahboozhoo at first feel rather timid as he find himself thus rapidly soar through the air especially as it be so difficult for he to keep he seat when the buzzard begin circle round and round it be even more difficult for the body of the bird lean over more and more as he speed increase but nanahboozhoo be very clever and after a while he become more accustomed to he queer position and be very much interested in the splendid sight of the great world beneath he over which he could now see for such a great distance lake and river forest and mountain all give delight to nanahboozhoo who have wonderful power of vision at length as they rise up higher and higher in the blue sky nanahboozhoo shout out in he delight as far away in the distance he recognize the wigwam of he grandmother nokomi indeed so delighted be he that for a moment he let go he hold on the buzzard and swing up he arm in he excitement the treacherous buzzard notice this see it be the opportunity for which he have be watch and circle round so suddenly that he body be tilted over and before nanahboozhoo could regain he grip he slip off the smooth back and fall like a stone to the ground so terrible be the force with which he strike the earth that he be knock senseless and lay there for a long time like one dead but as i have tell you nanahboozhoo be more than human and nothing could really kill he so it happen that after a while he recover he sens but he be annoyed disgusted that he have allow the buzzard to play such a mean trick on he then he prepare to resume he journey and of course he look up to see if there be any sign of the buzzard he have not far to look for there up in the sky not far off be the old buzzard laughing at the trick he have play upon nanahboozhoo and much pleased with he own cleverness in deceive one know to be so crafty ` laugh away old buzzard ' say nanahboozhoo ` you have have the best of I this time but look out for i will put a mark upon you for this trick of yours that will enable you friend and you enemy to recognize you both by day and by night ' but the buzzard from he high safe place in the sky only laugh back in derision and say : ` no indeed nanahboozhoo you will do nothing of the kind you have be deceive the other creature but in I you have find you match you can not deceive I and now especially as you have threaten I i will always be on the watch for you ' -lrb- illustration : nanahboozhoo then mount on the back of the great buzzard -rrb- nanahboozhoo make no reply to this boastful speech but he do a lot of thinking and he soon have he plan lay to teach mr buzzard a lesson he would never forget resume he journey he push on as though nothing have happen the buzzard be at first suspicious and watch he for some time then see nothing unusual in he movement he fly away into the distant sky nanahboozhoo in order to carry out he plan to punish the buzzard resolve to turn himself into a dead deer he know that the buzzard live on dead animal of all kind he choose a high spot visible from a great distance and there he lay himself down and change himself into the body of a great deer it be not long before the various animal and bird that subsist on such thing begin to gather round this dead body the buzzard that have such wonderful eye to see great distance see from afar this gathering of the bird and animal and as he be ever on the lookout for such thing he soon join the rest of the creature around the deer he fly round and round it several time for he be at first somewhat suspicious the closest inspection however show he that it be only a dead deer and that be the unanimous opinion of all the other animal and bird that gather there there could be no doubt in any creature 's mind but that it be a deer and that it be quite dead the buzzard now that all he suspicion be go in he great greed to get the best he could savagely begin with he powerful beak tear a hole in the side of the body that he might get down to the rich fat that be around the kidney this be what those fierce greedy bird always try to get first deeper and deeper into the flesh he tear until at length he be able to crowd in he head and neck to reach the dainty morsel he so much prize this be just what nanahboozhoo be wait for and when the head and neck of the buzzard be completely hide in the body up jump the deer and as he do so the flesh close up so tightly around the head and neck of the buzzard that the greedy bird be there securely hold ` ha ha old buzzard i do catch you after all as i say i would ' say nanahboozhoo ` now pull out you neck and head ' the buzzard with very great difficulty at length succeed in draw he head out of the side of the deer the effort to do so however be so great that he lose all of the beautiful feather that once adorn he head and neck from that day they have never grow on he again and there be nothing there to be see but the red rough-looking skin ` never again ' say nanahboozhoo ` will feather cover you neck or head and so you friend and enemy as they see you will be remind of how nanahboozhoo punish you for play one of you trick on he and also from this time forward you food will only be of the rankest kind and the disagreeable odor will so cling to you that even in the darkest night you hateful presence will be detect and shun ' thus add souwana the buzzard be the most despise of bird because he be such a ugly fellow with he featherless head and neck and because he disagreeable odor taint the sweet air wherever he go chapter xxiii a moonlight trip on the lake -- the legend of the orphan boy -- he appeal to the man in the moon -- how he conquer he enemy moonlight night in the northland be often very beautiful there in the summer time the gloaming continue until nearly midnight then nothing can be more glorious than to glide along amid the beautiful fir-clad rocky island in a birch canoe over the still transparent water so large and luminous be the full moon of July and August that with the west aglow and with the wondrous aurora flash and blaze in the north there be practically little night and no darkness at all nothing give the child greater pleasure than to have permission to go with mary and kennedy in a large roomy birch canoe for a moonlight excursion during one of those warm brilliant night with plenty of rug or cushion to make the coziest of seat in the center of the canoe they fairly revel in the beauty of the romantic surroundings while they float on the moonlit lake often in some place of more than ordinary beauty kennedy would cease paddling and then they very quietness add to the charm of those happy outing -lrb- illustration : with mary and kennedy in the birch canoe -rrb- say mary say sagastao i be read in one of my book about the ` man in the moon ' do you know anything about he he be look at we very kindly to-night say minnehaha i really believe i see he laugh he be so pleased we have come out to see he this lovely night these remark of the child cause all in the canoe to more closely scan the great round moon that be shine with silvery whiteness straight in front of they there be lot of story about the moon among we people say mary but not a great many about the man in the moon there be however a queer one about how he come down and help a poor orphan boy o tell it to we just now say minnehaha while he be watch and listen do mary say sagastao and minnehaha and i will watch the old fellow and see how he like to be talk about well say minnehaha mary will be talk to he to he face and not behind he back as people sometimes do when talk about other thus the child run on with they prattle mary and kennedy be much amuse come mary hurry up father say the gloaming would end about eleven and we must be at the shore by that time pretty late hour for little child say kennedy never mind that say sagastao we will make up for it in winter time when it get dark at four o'clock with sagastao on one side of she in the big canoe and minnehaha on the other -- they favorite position when listen to she fascinating story as she croon they out in she soft musical cree -- mary tell they the story long ago she begin there be a poor orphan boy who have neither father nor mother uncle aunt nor any living relative that he know of he have a very hard time of it as the people do not seem to take kindly to he so he have to live just where he could he manage to get along all right during the pleasant summer time but when the long cold winter begin he suffer very much one winter some selfish people let he live with they because he be willing to work hard for what little they do for he they treat he badly in many way they make he go out into the wood and cut firewood but when he bring it home they would only allow he to stay in the cold entry-way which they have build to they winter dwelling they make he go and hunt different animal for food and then when he bring they home they cook and eat the best themselves and just throw the fragment and bone to he as they would to a dog every member of the household treat he very cruelly except a nice little girl the youngest daughter of the family she feel very sorry for he she would secretly take he better food and she furnish he with a knife with which he could cut the tough piece of meat she have to be very careful not to be discover for if find out she would have be severely punish so she pity have to show itself on the sly and the few word she be able to tell he of she sympathy have to be whisper as she pass he when nobody be look or listen the poor boy up to this time have no ambition to better himself but she kind word and deed make he resolve that he must begin and do something for himself but what could he do everybody seem against he but this little girl and she could do nothing in the way of help he to escape from these people who now that he be become so useful to they would not let he go what really could he do thus the day and week and month pass on and there seem no chance of escape he have try to run away but have be catch and bring back and beat one night when it be not very cold he go outside of the narrow entry where he generally have to sleep and throw himself on the ground and cry in he sorrow and despair he seem to be utterly unable to better himself as he lay there he begin look up at the great bright moon that now so large and round be he think look earnestly at he soon he be able to see that there be a great man in the moon as he watch he he be glad to notice that he be not look crossly at he but kindly and so he begin cry to the man in the moon to come and help he to escape from the miserable life he be lead sure enough as the boy keep on cry and plead he see the man in the moon begin to come down to this world he come to the very spot where the unhappy boy be lie but instead of help he he make he stand up and then he give he a good sound thrashing make the boy however strike back at he as vigorously as he could the beat he get very much disheartened and discourage the boy for it be not what he have expect on the follow night when he have recover a little he begin reproach the man in the moon ' i call for you ' he say ` to come and help I against my enemy and now you have come and thrash I ' but these word instead of soften the man in the moon cause he to come down again and give the poor boy a far worse thrashing than before but for every blow he make the boy return one as good as he have receive now for the first time the boy begin to notice that the more he be beat the stronger he grow still he could not understand what the man in the moon mean so he come again and they have another regular set-to and the boy have another good sound thrashing he ask he what be the meaning of he beat he thus the man in the moon now speak to he but he word be so much like a puzzle that at first the boy do not understand they this be what the man in the moon say : ` would you triumph o'er the strong be strong would you let they no more conquer conquer ' for a time the boy repeat they over and over he use to say that as the result of these meeting with the man in the moon he have grow so strong that he be nearly able to hold he own against he antagonist then one day when the man in the moon be puff from the encounter the latter say : ` now by hard knock and exercise i have put you on the way of end you trouble be strong and conquer farewell i be not come again as you do not need I any more ' then away he fly back to he place in the moon the boy seem now to know that he be to use he strength for he own deliverance to test himself he begin toss up the stone that be so numerous on the shore of the lake first he begin with quite small one but soon he find that he could pick up and throw about great big one that be like rock when he return from this last contest with the man in the moon it be nearly daylight at first the people begin order he about as usual but they soon have reason to be sorry for they cruelty and abuse for the boy seize one after another of they and fling they with such violence against the rock that they brain be dash out and they blood run in stream down the side of the rock -- where it turn into seam in the rock which can be see to this day one person only of all who live in that dwelling do the now strong boy leave alive and that be of course the good-hearted little girl who use to speak kind word to he and befriend he when she could they grow to be very fond of each other and be afterward marry and live in full possession of all the thing that once belong to the cruel people for whom the little orphan boy have work so long well sakehou say sagastao i have be watch the man in the moon while you have be tell the story about he queer way of help the boy to help himself and he be look pleased all the time so i be sure he be well satisfy with the way you have tell the story old mary be delighted with these word from the lip of the lad she love with such a passionate devotion but what do you think about it little sister say the lad call to minnehaha who be cuddle down on the other side of mary but the darling give no answer for she have long ago slip off into dreamland and there she remain until the strong arm of kennedy lift she up from the canoe and carry she home chapter xxiv souwana 's love for souwanaquenapeke -- how nanahboozhoo cure a little girl bite by a snake -- how the rattlesnake get its rattle -- the origin of tobacco -- nanahboozhoo in trouble wahkiegun as souwana name the home of he white friend always

love of the old chief for they sweet little sister be sometimes a little impatient when they find that he would have he hour with she before they could draw a nanahboozhoo story out of he you be all right he would say in he dry humorous way as far as you go you be only cree he would add with a smile refer to the fact that they have be bear among the cree indian farther north but souwanaquenapeke be better as she be a pure saulteaux this of course would put sagastao and minnehaha on the defensive for in those day they own pride of birth be that they be cree indian faithful old mary herself a cree would of course take they part and it be very amusing -- laughable at time -- to listen to the wordy strife in these discussion mary be always the one to first lose she temper when this happen the penalty be to have the child throw a shawl over she head and thus silence she from they loving hand she quietly take she punishment and be soon restore to good nature good-hearted souwana then speedily respond to the call for a story but the little souwanaquenapeke must be if awake in he arm or if asleep in a little hammock or native cradle beside he what be it to be about to-day ask the old man as the child full of eager anticipation draw a couple of chair up before he after some discussion souwana decide to tell they the nanahboozhoo story of how he lessen the power of the

the sad doings of the snake he hurriedly go into the forest and there find a certain plant he say ` from this day forward the root of this plant shall be a remedy for all people against the bite of snake ' then nanahboozhoo show the mother that the root be to be pound and make into a drink and a poultice the glad mother quickly carry out he instruction and the little girl be soon well again the indian have ever since be very thankful to nanahboozhoo for let they know of this plant which they still use for such purpose and which they call snakeroot nanahboozhoo remain until he see that the little girl be quite recover then he say : ` now i will fix that snake so that he will not be able to do so much harm in the future ' then go out he catch the king of the snake and give he a great scolding for the meanness of that one of he family which have crawl into the tent of the indian mother and so cruelly bite that little girl while she sleep then get very angry for nanahboozhoo be very quick-tempered he say : ` snake like other thing have the right to live they be give they place in the world and they work they be to keep down the mouse rat frog toad and other thing that might become too numerous they have they poison give they to defend themselves if attack but they have no right to go and kill or injure anyone do they no harm i 'll teach you snake that in future you can not quietly crawl about and bite innocent people thus ' so he take a piece of the wampum from one of the string with which he have decorate himself and have carefully carve the hard shell of which wampum be make nanahboozhoo firmly fasten they to the snake 's tail and say : ` from this day forward may all snake like you have those noisy rattle upon they so that all people will call you rattlesnake and may it be that you can never move without make a noise with those rattle so that people will always be able to hear they and thus get ready to fight you or to get out of you way before you can do any harm ' well do nanahboozhoo shout little sagastao he be the one for I but why do he not kill all the rattlesnake at once souwana be however too clever to be catch try to answer a question that although ask by a child be beyond he knowledge so he resort to he calumet and as the smoke of it begin to taint the air sagastao say well souwana can you tell we where you indian first get you tobacco this question be more to the taste of the old indian so while he smoke he relate the tradition of the introduction of tobacco among he people very many winter ago say he as nanahboozhoo be travel on one of he long journey he visit a land of great high mountain one day as he be pass a great chasm in the mountain he see some blue smoke slowly come up out of it this excited he curiosity and he go to see what cause it as he draw near to it he be very much pleased with its odor on further investigation he find that the great cave from which the smoke arise be inhabit by a giant who be the keeper of tobacco nanahboozhoo on search find he half asleep in this cave among great bale and bag of tobacco the smell of the smoke of the tobacco have so pleased nanahboozhoo that he ask the giant to give he some the giant refuse in a very surly fashion say that he only give portion of it away to he friend the munedoo who come once a year to smoke with he nanahboozhoo see that he be not go to be able to get any by thus plead for it snatch up one of the well-filled tobacco bag dash out with it and flee away as rapidly as possible the great giant be fearfully enraged and at once begin the pursuit of this rash fellow who have thus steal he tobacco from under he very nose it be a fearful race nanahboozhoo have to jump from one mountain top to the next and so on and on from peak to peak closely behind he follow the giant and nanahboozhoo have all he could do to keep from be capture fortunately for he he now know the mountain well and he remember one ahead of he the opposite side of which be very steep when he reach this top he suddenly throw himself down upon the very edge and as the giant pass over he nanahboozhoo suddenly spring up and give he such a push that he tumble down into the fearful chasm he be so bruised and wound that as he get up and hobble away down the far-off valley nanahboozhoo watch he see that he look just like a great grasshopper he burst out laughing and then shout to the giant : ` for you meanness and selfishness i change you into a grasshopper pukaneh shall be you name and you will always have a dirty mouth ' and so it be to this day for every little boy who have catch grasshopper know that they saliva be as though they have be chew tobacco when nanahboozhoo have rest himself a little he return to the cave of the giant and take possession of the great quantity of tobacco he find there he divide it among the indian tribe and from that time those who live where it will grow have cultivate it and have supply all the other i wish say minnehaha that nanahboozhoo have leave pukaneh and he tobacco in the cave for i do not think tobacco smoke be very nice in the house -lrb- illustration : nanahboozhoo give he a great push -rrb- souwana be amuse with the little girl 's opposition to he beloved weed and while she be talk take the opportunity to refill he calumet when it be in good smoking order he urgently request by sagastao resume he story-telling sometimes it do not fare so well with nanahboozhoo there be time when he cleverness seem to forsake he and he get into trouble ' that at other time he would easily have avoid for example one day in the summer time as he be hurry along he become very thirsty soon however he come to a river which have many tree on its bank he push he way through they until he come to the bank just as he be stoop down to drink he see some nice ripe fruit in the water without seem to think of what he be do he dive into the quite shallow water to get the fruit hit he head against the rocky bottom and be pretty badly hurt he be vex and angry as well as disappointed but he take a good drink of the water and then he lay down on the grass in the shade of the tree to rest as he lay there on he back he see above he on the branch of the tree the fruit which he have at first thought be in the water laughing at he own stupidity and climb up into the tree he soon have all the ripe fruit he could eat then on he go and as he head be quite sore from the bump he have get when he dive into the shallow river he determine to visit some wigwam which he see not far off the people receive he very kindly with the exception of one surly cross old man they quickly prepare some balsam and put it on he wounded head nanahboozhoo be well please with this kindness and say that he would be glad to perform for they some kindly act in return before anyone else however could speak the cross old man sneer out : ' o if you think you be clever enough to do anything grant that i may live forever ' this request and the sneering way in which it be make cause the quick-tempered nanahboozhoo to become very angry and he suddenly spring up and catch the indian by the shoulder and violently throw he on the ground say : ` from this time you shall be a stone and so you request be grant ' chapter xxv the dead moose -- the rivalry between the elk and the moose people and they various contest -- the disaster that befall the latter tribe -- the haze of the indian summer the sight of four stalwart indian drag on a dog sled the body of a enormous moose on the ice in front of they home very much interested the child nothing would do but they must be wrap up and allow to go out and examine it while the man rest and have a smoke its great horn its enormous ugly head and then its coarse bristle-like hair have all to be examine and comment upon the opportune arrival of souwana who have be attract by the sight of the moose much pleased the child and just as soon as the investigation of the moose be over and the hunter have proceed on they journey the child insist on souwana go home to wahkiegun with they and tell they something about the moose they also want to hear a wonderful story which he know tell how nanahboozhoo help the elk to conquer the moose when there be a disposition to surrender we be easily conquer so it be with souwana on this occasion the child in they love for they friend plead so importunately that a good cup of tea be prepare for and much enjoy by he before he begin he story he interested auditor as close as possible around he once when nanahboozhoo be journey through the country say souwana he find a village of indian who be very poor they be call oomasko elk people they have nothing but the poorest of robe on they back and they be nearly destitute of everything in the shape of trap weapon and canoe the village be strangely silent for even the dog that generally be around in such number have disappear when nanahboozhoo see this destitution and poverty he at once inquire the reason and be surprised and very angry to hear that they be great gambler not far off from they be another village whose people be call mooswa or moose people and nanahboozhoo soon find out that while the inhabitant of these two village be antagonistic to each other they frequently meet to gamble and that the moose people be nearly always successful and have win from the elk people nearly everything they possess the latter be very much humiliate at nanahboozhoo 's find they in such a wretched condition but they tell he they be convince that some trickery have be practice upon they by they opponent they also inform nanahboozhoo that they would be glad if he would help they to get back they much need possession nanahboozhoo promise that he would assist they on condition that after they possession be regain they should give up the pernicious habit of gamble this they unanimously promise to do the first thing nanahboozhoo do be to disguise himself as a whisky-jack and fly over to the village of the moose people and try to discover how it be that they have be so invariably successful when they gamble with the elk people it be as he suspect he old enemy the anamakqui the evil spirit that have destroy he brother nahpootee the wolf have send one of they number among the moose people and he have enable they to win nearly all of the dog as well as other thing from the elk people indeed he himself have generally be the one who have toss the plum stone with which they gamble and they have win by he magic power when nanahboozhoo hear this he know that he first work must be to secure the magic muskamoot -lrb- medicine bag -rrb- so he fly round and round and peer in through the top of the wigwam where the pole cross each other he be fortunate enough to see the magic bag hang up on a cross pole over the place where the anamakquus sleep he notice also that it be well guard and that it would require some cleverness on he part to get it nanahboozhoo be as you know a very clever fellow he quickly fly back to the village of the elk people and order the most industrious of the woman who be skillful in make fire bag to make one exactly as he describe this be of course similar to the magic muskamoot he have see hang up in the tent nanahboozhoo then put into it thing that would have just the opposite effect to those which be in the bag of the anamakquus he wait until it be dark and then noiselessly fly back to the village of the moose people he silently enter the wigwam at the top where there be now a wide opening as it be in the warm summer time very quickly exchange the bag he have with he for the magic muskamoot and return to the village of the elk people it do not take he long to arrange he plan the chief of the elk have a beautiful daughter and it be give out that a fine young chief from a far-away tribe have come to ask for she in marriage the father have welcome this young chief -- who be of course nanahboozhoo -- and as he have bring costly gift he be at once acknowledge as the accept son-in-law the news spread rapidly and it soon reach the moose village when they hear of the many gift which this rich young stranger have bring with he they of course be greedy to win they as they have win the rest of the elk ' property it be not many day before a company of they come over to the elk and meet the beautiful daughter of the chief they say : ` we have come over to have a game of plum stone with you lover to see if he be a better player than we be ' the girl go at once into the wigwam and inform she intended husband nanahboozhoo of the challenge of these people she also tell he that they be very clever but that they have no idea of he be anything else than what he appear to be then she add : ` be sure to win if you do not they will beat we with club and stick for the custom be that the side that be defeat in the gambling must submit to a beating by the conqueror ' then nanahboozhoo and the champion for the moose people sit down on opposite side of the bowl in which be the plum stone while the people of each of the two village range themselves behind they own champion when nanahboozhoo shake the bowl and then let the plum stone cease roll it be see that he have win every point at this the elk set up a great shout of triumph the moose people shout back : ` do not be so fast the game be to be the best three out of five just wait until we man have play ' the plum stone be then hand to he and pat he medicine bag he confidently shake they up but when they have cease roll it be see that he have lose every point the victory be now so nearly win that the elk begin to say : ` get you club ready to thrash the moose people for we be surely go to be winner this day ' the moose people be however not yet quite discourage ` there be three try yet ' they say ` and we man may yet win ' but they hope be soon go for when nanahboozhoo throw the plum stone the third time he be as successful as at the first this decide the game in favor of the elk who now rush upon the moose people and thrash they all the way back to they own village the moose be very much humiliate at this defeat they have not only have a good beating but accord to the custom of the tribe they be oblige to restore much of the property which they have win from the elk in they previous contest a council be call not long after and there be quite a discussion among they as to the best plan to be adopt to defeat the elk and regain supremacy they decide on a trial of strength for in such encounter they have generally be victorious they have two high pole erect with a crossbar on the top and the contest be to see which side could produce the man who should throw the heaviest stone over that bar they send they challenge to the elk to meet they if they dare the elk quickly respond and be soon at the place where the moose people who be await they have erect the high pole with the crossbar when everything have be arrange they strongest man take up a heavy stone and with a tremendous effort succeed in barely throw it so that it strike the crossbar and carry it down to the ground when the crossbar have be replace a son of the chief of the elk go forward as though he would be the competitor on the side of the elk he pretend as though he could not even lift the heavy stone which the moose champion have throw when the moose people see this they shout out in triumph and begin to get ready to give the elk as good a beating as they have receive from they on a former occasion see they thus come nanahboozhoo rush forward seize the heavy stone and send it high up and far over the top of the pole -- thus win the victory again for the elk with a shout of triumph the elk again attack the moose and drive they in disgrace back to they own village the moose people be now more humiliate than ever but they determine to try another plan for they be resolve not to give up to the elk whom they have so often defeat after much consultation they say : ` let we have a contest at diving in the lake that we may see if we champion can not remain longer under the water than any one of the elk ' so they go over to the village of the elk and tell they they have come to have another contest with they to the proposal of the moose the elk all agree and both party proceed to the lake here a large hole be cut in the ice and the champion of the moose prepare to go down into the water one of the brother of the beautiful indian girl who have be select as nanahboozhoo 's bride say to nanahboozhoo : ` as we body be tougher than yours you must let I compete this time ' nanahboozhoo would not let he do this he say : ' i be not afraid of the cold water and besides i have plenty of friend down there ' and sure enough the mud turtle come up and say in word that only nanahboozhoo could understand : ` my brother i have come up at the request of you brother the wolf to aid you trust yourself in my care and no harm will come to you ' nanahboozhoo be well pleased to hear this for he know that he spirit brother have send he friend the mud turtle to help he in this trial the competitor now strip themselves and when the signal be give they both dive into the water and disappear the moose people have such confidence in they champion that they have all bring with they very heavy stick with which they intend give the elk a great beating in return for the two previous defeat the elk however be not dismayed they only say : ` just wait until the contest be decide ' in the meantime the competitor under the water be so near together at first that the people on the land hear the moose say ` elk be you cold ' to which the mud turtle who have cover the elk competitor over with he shell reply : ` no moose but be you cold ' as the people on the shore could not hear any answer to this question it give some alarm to the moose people about they champion who they fear must be benumb with the cold this be really the case for in a short time he come to the surface of the water so nearly freeze to death that he have to be help out of the water when the mud turtle and nanahboozhoo hear the shouting of triumph of the elk they know that the moose champion have fail and so they come up to the surface nanahboozhoo swim ashore and join in the pursuit of the disheartened moose people who have again so signally fail these repeat defeat very much angered and humiliate the moose people they almost quarrel among themselves in they vexation as they talk they over at they council still they be in no humor to give up they have two very swift runner among they and they decide to challenge the elk to a foot race so they again send a number of they party over to the tent of the elk people and say : ` we be not at all satisfied yet and we wish to know if the son of the chief and he brother-in-law the young stranger who have come into you midst will run a foot race against two of we young people ' this challenge be at once accept and soon all preparation be make for the great race it be decide that it should be run on the ice of the frozen lake which be several mile round much snow have fall but the people of both side turn out for day and clear out a good track they make it near the shore and so that the finish spot would be near where be the start point the moose feel quite certain of win this time because by they magic they runner be to be turn into real moose with four leg and they argue that runner with four foot could surely beat those who have only two but there be other who have hear about this great race and among they be the wolf the spirit brother of nanahboozhoo and so he come to he the night before the race ` my brother ' he say ' i will come and help you in this race you be the only one that can see I so i will be on the track about half way round and when you come there you can get on my back and i will carry you at a greater speed but you must keep you leg move as if rapidly run or the people will suspect something unusual ' there be a great crowd to witness this race between the two great moose to represent the moose people and the son of the chief and he unknown brother-in-law to represent the elk when the signal be give away they start over the icy trail the moose soon be at the front with the chief 's son not far behind nanahboozhoo be purposely a little in the rear and so be able to spring upon the wolf 's back without attract attention -lrb- illustration : they be excite at he come -rrb- with this steed under he he speed along with marvelous rapidity at the half-way point of the race he overtake he brother-in-law and give he he hand they be soon far in front when they rush in ahead there be great excitement the moose people be soon run back to they village with the elk whipping they to the very door of they wigwam after this the moose dare not challenge the elk to any further contest but they be so furious that they meditate murder in they heart toward the young stranger who have they now see be the cause of they many defeat nanahboozhoo however easily thwart they evil scheme but at length some of they be so bad that he anger be arouse and he exert all he magic power ` moose you be by name ' he say to they ` and for you bad deed i change you into the animal after whom you be name hereafter you will live in the swamp among the willow and young birch on they you will have to browse for a living for a little variety in you food you may in the summer time go out into the shallow water and paw up and eat the great root of the water-lily ' thus the elk again have peace and quietness gambling be never again allow among they and nanahboozhoo after receive they grateful thanks return to he own country what do he do after that ask sagastao not much for a while but after a time he decide to go away up north each fall however he come and look around to see how everything be go on then he rest on some of the mountain and have a big smoke which settle down on the hillside and valley and make the beautiful hazy time which we all call the indian summer well say minnehaha if the smoke of nanahboozhoo 's big pipe of peace make the beautiful haze of the lovely indian summer it be about the best thing i have hear yet of tobacco smoke do and so say we all glossary \* \* \* \* \*
