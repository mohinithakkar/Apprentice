have to ask the house for rather a large draft upon its indulgence the indian secretary be like the aloe that bloom once in 100 year : he only trouble the house with speech of he own once in twelve month there be several topic which the house will expect I to say something about and of these be two or three topic of supreme interest and importance for which i plead for patience and comprehensive consideration we be too apt to find that gentleman both here and outside fix upon some incident of which they read in the newspaper they put it under a microscope they indulge in reflection upon it and they regard that as take a intelligent interest in the affair of indium if we could suppose that on some occasion within the last three or four week a wrong turn have be take in judgment at simlum or in the cabinet or in the indium office or that to-day in this house some wrong turn might be take what disaster would follow what titanic effort to repair these disaster what devour waste of national and indian treasure and what a wreckage might follow these be possible consequence that misjudgment either here or in indium might bring with it sir i believe i be not go too far when i say that this be almost if not quite the first occasion upon which what be call the british democracy in its full strength have be bring directly face to face with the difficulty of indian government in all they intricacy all they complexity all they subtlety and above all in they enormous magnitude last year when i have the honor of address the house on the indian budget i observe as many have do before I that it be one of the most difficult experiment ever try in human history whether you can carry on what you will have to try to carry on in indium -- personal government along with free speech and free right of public meeting this which last year be partially a speculative question have this year become more or less actual and that be a question which i shall by and by have to submit to the house i want to set out the case as frankly as i possibly can i want if i may say so without presumption to take the house into full confidence so far -- and let nobody quarrel with this provision -- as public interest allow i will beg the house to remember that we do not only hear one another we be ourselves this afternoon overheard word that may be speak here be overhear in the whole kingdom they be overhear thousand of mile away by a vast and complex community they be overhear by other who be do the service and work of the crown in indium by those too who take part in the immense work of commercial and non-official life in indium we be overhear by great indian prince who be outside british indium we be overhear by the dim mass of indian whom in spite of all we shall persist in regard as we friend we be overhear by those whom i be afraid we must reluctantly call we enemy this be the reason why everybody who speak to-day certainly include myself must use language that be well advise language of reserve and as i say again the fruit of comprehensive consideration the budget be a prosperity budget we have however to admit that a black shadow fall across the prospect the plague figure be appalling but do not let we get unreasonably dismayed even about these appalling figure if we review the plague figure up to last December we might have hope that the horrible scourge be on the wane from 92000 death in the year 1900 the figure go up to 1100000 in 1904 while in 1905 they exceed 1000000 in 1906 a gleam of hope arise and the mortality sink to something under 350000 the combined effort of government and people have produce that reduction but alas since January 1907 plague have again flare up in district that have be fill with its terror for a decade and for the first four month of this year the death amount to 642000 which exceed the record for the same period in any past year you must remember that we have to cover a very vast area i do not know that these figure would startle we if we take the area of the whole of europe it be in 1896 that this plague first appear in indium and up to April 1907 the total figure of the human being who have die be 5250000 but deal with a population of 300000000 this dire mortality although enormous be not at all comparable with the result of the black death and other scourge that spread over europe in earlier time in proportion to the population the plague mortality in 1904 -lrb- the worst complete year -rrb- would only represent if evenly distribute a death-rate of about 3 per 1000 but it be local and particularly centre in the punjab the united province and in bombay i do not think that anybody who have be concern in indium -- i do not care to what school of indian thought he belong -- can deny that measure for the extermination and mitigation of this disease have occupy the most serious constant unflagging zealous and energetic attention of the indian government but the difficulty we encounter be manifold as many member of the house be well aware it be possible that hon member may rise and say that we be not enforce with sufficient zeal proper sanitary rule and on the other hand i dare say that other hon member will get up to show that the great difficulty in the way of sanitary rule be observe arise from the reluctance of the population to practice they that be perfectly natural and be well understand they be a suspicious population and we all know that when these new rule be force upon they they constantly resent and resist they a policy of severe repression be worse than useless i will not detain the house with particulars of all the proceedings we have take in deal with the plague but i may say that we have institute a long scientific inquiry with the aid of the royal society and the lister institute then we have very intelligent officer who have do all they could to trace the root of the disease and to discover if they could any means to prevent it it be a curious thing that while there appear to be no immunity from this frightful scourge for the native european enjoy almost entire immunity from the disease that be difficult to understand or to explain now as to opium i know that a large number of member in the house be interested in it judge by the voluminous correspondence that i receive all the church and both political party be sincerely and deeply interested in the question and i be go to say that the resolution with which they have favor I often use the expression righteousness before revenue the motto be excellent but its virtue will be cheap and shabby if you only satisfy you own righteousness at the expense of other people 's revenue mr lupton : we be quite ready to bear the expense mr morley : my hon friend say they be quite prepared to bear the expense i commend that observation cheerfully to the chancellor of the exchequer this question touch the conscience of the people of the country my hon friend sometimes go a little far still he represent a considerable body of feeling last may when the opium question be raise in this house something fall from I which reach the chinese government and the chinese government on the strength of that utterance of mine make in the name of he majesty 's government have persistently do they best to come to some sort of arrangement and understanding with he majesty 's government in September a imperial decree be issue in china order the strict prohibition of the consumption and cultivation of opium with a view to ultimate eradication in ten year communication be make to the foreign secretary and since then there have be a considerable correspondence some of which the house be by question and answer acquaint with the chinese government have be uniformly assure not only by my word speak in may but by the foreign secretary that the sympathy of this country be with the object set forth in they decree of September then a very important incident as i regard it and one likely by-and-bye to prove distinctly fruitful be the application by the united state government to we government as to whether there should not be a joint inquiry into the opium traffic by the united state and the other power concern the house know by question and answer that he majesty 's government judge that procedure by way of commission rather than by way of conference be the right way to approach the question but no one can doubt for a moment consider the honorable interest the united state have show on previous occasion that some good result will come with time and persistence i will not detain the house with the detail but certainly it be a true satisfaction to know that a great deal of talk as to the chinese interest in the suppression of opium be fictitious be unreal i be much strike by a sentence write by the correspondent of _ the time _ at peke recently everybody who know he be aware that he be not a sentimentalist and he use remarkable language he say that he view the development in china of the anti-opium movement as encourage that the movement be certainly popular and be support by the entire native press while a hopeful sign be that the use of opium be fast become unfashionable and would become more so a correspondence so far as the government of indium be concern be now in progress those of my hon friend who think we be lack perhaps in energy and zeal i would refer to the language use by mr baker the very able finance member of the viceroy 's council because these word really define the position of the government of indium -- what the eventual outcome will be it be impossible to foresee the practical difficulty which china have impose on herself be enormous and may prove insuperable but it be evident that the gradual reduction and eventual extinction of the revenue that indium have derive from the trade have be bring a stage nearer and it be necessary for we to be prepare for whatever may happen he add that twenty year ago or even less the prospect of lose a revenue of five and a half crore of rupee a year would have cause great anxiety and even now the loss to indian finances would be serious and might necessitate recourse to increase taxation but if as they have a clear right to expect the transition be effect with due regard to finance and be spread over a term of year the consequence need not be regard with apprehension when i approach military expenditure and war and the danger of war i think i ought to say a word about the visit of the ameer of afghanistan which excite so much attention and kindle so lively a interest in great part not only of we own dominion but in asia i be persuade that we have reason to look back on that visit with entire and complete satisfaction he majesty 's government previously to the visit of the ameer instruct the governor-general in council on no account to open any political question with the ameer that be really part of the condition of the ameer 's visit and the result of that policy have be to place we relation with the ameer on a eminently satisfactory foot a far better footing than would have be arrive at by any formal premeditated convention the ameer himself make a speech when he arrive at kabul on he return and i be aware that in this speech i come to a question of what may seem a party or personal character with which it be not in the least my intention to deal this be what the ameer say on 10th April -- the officer of the government of indium never say a word on political matter they keep they promise but as to myself whenever and wherever i find a opportunity i speak indirectly on several matter which concern the interest of my country and nation the other side never take undue advantage of it and never discuss with I on those point which i mention he excellency 's invitation -lrb- lord minto 's -rrb- to I be in such a proper form that i have no objection to accept it the invitation which he send be word in quite a different form from that of the invitation which i receive on the occasion of the delhi durbar in the circumstance i have determine to undergo all risk -lrb- at the time of the delhi durbar -rrb- and if necessary to sacrifice all my possession and my own life but not to accept such a invitation as be send to I for come to join the delhi durbar these thing be far too serious for I or any of we to indulge in controversy upon but it be a satisfaction to be able to point out to the house that the policy we instruct the governor-general to follow have so far work extremely well i will go back to the army last year when i refer to this subject i tell the house that it would be my object to remove any defect that i and those who advise I might discover in the army system and more especially of course in the scheme of lord kitchener since then with the assistance of two very important committee well qualify by expert military knowledge i come to the conclusion that a improved equipment be require hon gentleman may think that my opinion alone would not be worth much but after all civilian have get to decide these question and provide that they arm themselves with the expert knowledge of military authority it be rightly they voice that settle the matter certain change be necessary in the allocation of unit in order to enable the troops to be better trained and therefore we final conclusion be that the special military expenditure show in the financial statement must go on for some year more but the house will see that we have arrange to cut down the rate of the annual grant and we have take care -- and this i think ought to be set down to we credit -- that every estimate for every item include in the program shall be submit to vigilant scrutiny here as well as in indium i have no prepossession in favor of military expenditure but the pressure of fact the pressure of the situation the possibility of contingency that may arise seem obviously to make it impossible for any government or any minister to acquiesce in the risk on the indian frontier we have to consider not only we position with respect to foreign power on the indian frontier but the exceedingly complex question that arise in connection with the turbulent border tribe all these thing make it impossible -- i say nothing about internal condition -- for any government or any minister with a sense of responsibility to cancel or to deal with the military program in any high-handed or cavalier way next i come to what i be sure be first in the mind of most member of the house -- the political and social condition of indium lord minto become viceroy i think in November 1905 and the present government succeed to power in the first week of December now much of the criticism that i have see on the attitude of he majesty 's government and the viceroy leave out of account the fact that we do not come quite into a haven of serenity and peace very fierce monsoon have break out on the olympian height at simlum in the camp and in the council at down street this be the inheritance into which we come -- rather a formidable inheritance for which i do not this afternoon attempt to distribute the responsibility still when we come into power we policy be necessarily guide by the condition under which the case have be leave we policy be to compose the singular condition of controversy and confusion by which we be face in the famous army case we happily succeed but in eastern bengal for a time we do not succeed when i see newspaper article begin with the preamble that the problem of indium be altogether outside party question i well know from experience that this be too often apt to be the forerunner of a regular party attack it be say that there have be supineness vacillation and hesitation i reply boldly there have be no supineness no vacillation no hesitation from December 1905 up to the present day i must say a single word about one episode and it be with sincere regret i refer to it it be call the fuller episode i have have the pleasure of many conversation with sir bampfylde fuller since he return and i recognize to the full he ability he good faith and the dignity and self-control with which during all this period of controversy he have never for one moment attempt to defend himself or to plunge into any sort of contest with the viceroy or he majesty 's government -lrb- 1 -rrb- conduct of that kind deserve we fullest recognition i recognize to the full he gift and he experience but i be sure that if he be in this house he would hardly quarrel with I for say that those gift be not altogether well adapt to the situation he have to face -lrb- footnote 1 : a unhappy lapse take place at a later date -rrb- what be the case the lieutenant-governor suggest a certain course the government of indium think it be a mistake and tell he so the lieutenant-governor thereupon say very well then i be afraid i must resign there be nothing in all that except what be perfectly honorable to sir bampfylde fuller but do anybody here take up this position that if a lieutenant-governor say if i can not have my own way i will resign then the government of indium be bind to refuse to accept that resignation all i can say be and i do not care who the man may be that if any gentleman in the indian service say he will resign unless he can have he own way then so far as i be concern in the matter he resignation shall be promptly and definitely accept it be say to-day that sir bampfylde fuller recommend certain measure about education and that the government have now adopt they but the circumstance be completely change what be think by lord minto and he council to be a rash and inexpedient course in those day be not think so now that the circumstance have change i will only mention one point there be a statement the other day in a very important newspaper that the condition of anti-british feeling in eastern bengal have gain in virulence since sir bampfylde fuller 's resignation this the viceroy assure I be a absolute perversion of the fact the whole atmosphere have change for the better when i say that lord minto be justify in the course he take i say it without any prejudice to sir bampfylde fuller or the slightest wish to injure he future prospects now i come to the subject of the disorder i be extremely sorry to say that some disorder have break out in the punjab i think i may assume that the house be aware of the general circumstance from answer to question under the regulation of 1818 -lrb- which be still alive -rrb- coercive measure be adopt here i would like to examine so far as i can the action take to preserve the public interest it would be quite wrong in deal with the unrest in the punjab not to mention the circumstance that provide the fuel for the agitation there be ravages by the plague and these ravages have be cruel the season have not be favourable a third cause be a act then on the stock which be believe to be injurious to the condition of a large body of man those condition affect the colonisation act be greatly misrepresent a indian member of the punjab council point out how impolitic he think it be and as i tell the house about a week ago the viceroy decline to be frighten by the foolish charge of pander to agitation and so forth refuse assent to that proposal but in the meantime the proposal of the colonisation law have become a weapon in the hand of the preacher of sedition i suspect that the member for east nottingham will presently get up and say that this mischief connect with the colonisation act account for the disturbance but i call attention to this fact in order that the house may understand whether or not the colonisation act be the main cause of the disturbance the authority believe that it be not there be twenty-eight meeting know to have be hold by the lead agitator in the punjab between 1st march and 1st may of these five only related even ostensibly to agricultural grievance the remain twenty-three be all purely political the figure seem to dispose of the contention that agrarian question be at the root of the present unrest in the punjab on the contrary it rather look as if there be a deliberate heating of the public atmosphere preparatory to the agrarian meeting at rawalpindus on the 21st April which give rise to the trouble the lieutenant-governor visit twenty-seven out of twenty-nine district he say the situation be serious and it be grow worse in this agitation special attention it be state have be pay to the sikh who as the house be aware be among the best soldier in indium and in the case of lyallpur to the military pensioner special effort have be make to secure they attendance at meeting to enlist they sympathy and to inflame they passion so far the active agitation have be virtually confine to the district in which the sikh element be predominant print invitation and leaflet have be principally address to village hold by sikh and at a public meeting at ferozepore at which disaffection be openly preach the man of the sikh regiment station there be specially invite to attend and several hundred of they act upon the invitation the sikh be tell that it be by they aid and owe to they willingness to shoot down they fellow countryman in the mutiny that the englishman retain they hold upon indium and then a particularly odious line of appeal be adopt it be ask how be it that the plague attack the indian and not the european the government say these man have mysterious means of spread the plague the government spread the plague by poisoning the stream and well in some village the inhabitant have actually cease to use the well i be inform only the other day by a officer who be in the punjab at that moment that when visit the settlement he find the villager disturb in mind on this point he say to he man : open up you kit and let they see whether these horrible pill be in they the man do as they be order but the suspicion be so great that people insist upon the glass of the telescope be unscrewed in order to be quite sure that there be no pill behind they see the emergency and the risk suppose a single native regiment have side with the rioter it would have be absurd for we know we have get a weapon there at we hand by law -- not a exceptional law but a standing law -- and in the face of the risk of a conflagration not to use that weapon and i for one have no apology whatever to offer for use it nobody appreciate more intensely than i do the danger the mischief and a thousand time in history the iniquity of what be call reason of state i know all about that it be full of mischief and full of danger but so be sedition and we should have incur criminal responsibility if we have oppose the resort to this law i do not wish to detain the house with the story of event in eastern bengal and assam they be of a different character from those in the punjab and in consequence of these disturbance the government of indium with my approval have issue a ordinance which i be sure the house be familiar with under the authority and in the term of a act of parliament the course of event in eastern bengal appear to have be mainly this -- first attempt to impose the boycott on mahomedan by force secondly complaint by hindu if the local official stop they and by mahomedan if they do not try to stop they thirdly retaliation by mahomedan fourthly complaint by hindu that the local official do not protect they from this retaliation fifthly general lawlessness of the lower class on both side encourage by the spectacle of the fighting among the higher class sixthly more complaint against the official the result of the ordinance have be that down to may 29th it have not be necessary to take action in any one of these district i notice a ironical look on the part of the right hon gentleman when i refer with perfect freedom to my assent to the resort to the weapon we have in the law against sedition i have have communication from friend of mine that in this assent i be outrage the principle of a lifetime i should be ashamed if i detain the house more than two minute on anything so small as the consistency of my political life that can very well take care of itself i begin by say that this be the first time that british democracy in its full strength as represent in this house be face to face with the enormous difficulty of indian government some of my hon friend look even more in sorrow than in anger upon this alleged backsliding of mine last year i tell the house that indium for a long time to come so far as my imagination could reach would be the theater of absolute and personal government and that raise some doubt reference have be make to my have resist the irish crime act as if there be a scandalous inconsistency between oppose the policy of that act and impose this policy on the native of indium that inconsistency can only be establish by anyone who take up the position that ireland a part of the unite kingdom be exactly on the same footing as these 300000000 people -- composite heterogeneous with different history of different race different faith do anybody contend that any political principle whatever be capable of application in every sort of circumstance without reference to condition -- in every place and at every time i at all event have never take that view and i would like to remind my hon friend that in such idea as i have about political principle the leader of my generation be mr mill mill be a great and benignant lamp of wisdom and humanity and it be at that lamp i and other kindle we modest rushlight what do mill say about the government of indium remember he be not merely that abject and despicable be a philosopher he be a man practice in government and in what government why he be responsible experienced and intimately concern in the government of indium what do he say if there be anybody who can be quote as have be a champion of representative government it be mill and in he book which i take it be still the classic book on that subject this be what he say -- government by the dominant country be as legitimate as any other if it be the one which in the exist state of civilization of the subject people most facilitate they transition to a higher state of civilization then he say this -- the ruling country ought to be able to do for its subject all that could be do by a succession of absolute monarch guarantee by irresistible force against the precariousness of tenure attendant on barbarous despotism and qualify by they genius to anticipate all that experience have teach to the more advanced nation if we do not attempt to realize this ideal we be guilty of a dereliction of the highest moral trust that can devolve upon a nation i will now ask the attention of the house for a moment while i examine a group of communication from officer of the indian government and if the house will allow I i will tell they what to my mind be the result of all these communication as to the general feeling in indium that after all be what most concern we for this unrest in the punjab and bengal sooner or later -- and sooner rather than later i hope -- will pass away what be the situation of indium generally in the view of these experienced officer at this moment even now when we be pass through all the stress and anxiety it be a mistake not to look at thing rather largely they all admit that there be a fall in the influence of european officer over the population they all or nearly all admit that there be estrangement -- i ought to say perhaps refrigeration -- between officer and people there be less sympathy between the government and the people for the last few year -- and this be a very important point -- the doctrine of administrative efficiency have be press too hard the wheel of the huge machine have be drive too fast we administration -- so shrewd observer and very experienced observer assure I -- would be a great deal more popular if it be a trifle less efficient a trifle more elastic generally we ought not to put mechanical efficiency at the head of we idea i be lead up to a practical point the district officer represent british rule to the majority of the people of indium be overload with work in they official relation and i know there be highly experienced gentleman who say that a little of the looseness of earlier day be better fitted than the regular system of latter day to win and to keep personal influence and that we be in danger of create a pure bureaucracy honorable faithful and industrious the servant of the state in indium be and will be but if the present system be persist in there be a risk of its become rather mechanical perhaps i might even say rather soulless and attention to this be urgently demand perfectly efficient administration i need not tell the house have a tendency to lead to over-centralisation it be inevitable the tendency in indium be to override local authority and to force administration to run in official groove for my own part i would spare no pain to improve we relation with native government and more and more these relation may become of potential value to the government of indium i would use my best endeavor to make these state independent in matter of administration yet all evidence tend to show we be rather make administration less personal though evidence also tend to show that the indian people be peculiarly responsive to sympathy and personal influence do not let we waste ourselves in controversy here or elsewhere or in mere anger let we try to draw to we side the man who now influence the people we have every good reason to believe that most of the people of indium be on we side i do not say for a moment that they like we it do not come easy in west or east to like foreign rule but in they heart they know that they solid interest be bind up with the law and order that we preserve there be a motion on the paper for a inquiry by means of a parliamentary committee or royal commission into the cause at the root of the dissatisfaction now i have often think while at the indium office whether it would be a good thing to have the old-fashioned parliamentary inquiry by committee or commission i have consider this i have discuss it with other and i have come to the conclusion that such inquiry would not produce any of the advantage such as be gain in the old day of old committee and certainly would be attend by many drawback but i have determine after consult with the viceroy that considerable advantage might be gain by a royal commission to examine with the experience we have gain over many year into this great mischief -- for all the people in indium who have any responsibility know that it be a great mischief -- of over-centralisation it seem a great mischief to so acute a man as sir henry maine who after many year ' experience write express agreement with what mr bright say just before or just after the mutiny that the centralised government of indium be too much power for any one man to work now when two man singularly unlike in temperament and training agree as to the evil of centralisation on this large scale it compel reflection i will not undertake at the present time to refer to the commission the large question that be speak of by maine and bright but i think that much might be gain by a inquiry on the spot into the working of centralisation of government in indium and how in the opinion of trained man here and in indium the mischief might be alleviate that however be not a question before we now you often hear people talk of the educate section of the people of indium as a mere handful a infinitesimal fraction so they be in number but it be fatally idle to say that this infinitesimal fraction do not count this educate section be make and will make all the difference that they would sharply criticise the british system of government have be long know it be inevitable there need be no surprise in the fact that they want a share in political influence and want a share in the emolument of administration they means -- many of they -- be scanty they have little to lose and much to gain from far-reaching change they see that the british hand work the state machine surely and smoothly and they think have no fear of race animosity that they hand could work the machine as surely and as smoothly as the british hand and now i come to my last point last autumn the governor-general appoint a committee of the executive council to consider the development of the administrative machinery and at the end of march last he publicly inform he legislative council that he have send home a despatch to the secretary of state propose suggestion for a move in advance the viceroy with a liberal and courageous mind enter deliberately on the path of improvement the public in indium be aware of it they wait and be now wait the result with the liveliest interest and curiosity meanwhile the riot happen in rawalpindus in lahore after these riot break out what be the course we ought to take some in this country lean to the opinion -- and it be excusable -- that riot ought to suspend all suggestion and talk of reform sir he majesty 's government consider this view and in the end they take very determinedly the opposite view they hold that such a withdrawal would of course have be construe as a triumph for the party of sedition they hold that to draw back on account of local and sporadic disturbance however serious anxious and troublesome they might be would have be a really grave humiliation to hesitate to make a beginning with we own policy of improve the administrative machinery of the indian government would have be take as a sign of nervousness trepidation and fear and fear that be always unworthy in any government be in the indian government not only unworthy but extremely dangerous i hope the house concur with he majesty 's government in answer to a question the other day i warn one or two of my hon friend that in resist the employment of power to suppress disturbance under the regulation of 1818 or by any other lawful weapon we could find they be promote the success of that disorder which would be fatal to the very project with which they sympathise the despatch from indium reach we in due course it be consider by the council of indium and by he majesty 's government and we reply be send about a fortnight ago someone will ask -- be you go to lay these two despatch on the table to-day i hope the house will not take it amiss if i say that at this stage -- perhaps at all stage -- it would be wholly disadvantageous to lay the despatch on the table we be in the middle of the discussion to-day and it would break up steady continuity if we have a premature discussion _ coram populo _ everyone will understand that discussion of this kind must be very delicate and it be of the utmost importance that they should be conduct with entire freedom but to employ a word that i do not often use i might adumbrate the proposal this be how the case stand the despatch reach he majesty 's government who consider it we then set out we view upon the point raise in the despatch the government of indium will now frame what be call a resolution that draft resolution when frame by they in conformity with the instruction of he majesty 's government will in due course be send here we shall consider that draft and then it will be my duty to present it to this house if legislation be necessary as it will be and it will be publish in indium to be discuss there by all those concern the main proposal be the acceptance of the general principle of a substantial enlargement of legislative council both the governor-general 's legislative council and the provincial legislative council detail of this reform have to be further discuss in consultation with the local government in indium but so far it be think best in indium that a official majority must be maintain again in the discussion of the budget in the viceroy 's council the subject be to be group and explain severally by the member of council in charge of the department and longer time be to be allow for this detailed discussion and for general debate one more suggestion the secretary of state have the privilege of recommend to the crown member of the council of indium i think that the time have now come when the secretary of state may safely wisely and justly recommend at any rate one indian member i will not discuss the question now i may have to argue it in parliament at a later stage but i think it be right to say what be my intention realize as we all do how few opportunity the govern body have of hear the voice of indian i believe i have defend myself from ignore the principle that there be a difference between the western european and the indian asiatic there be vital difference and it be infatuation to ignore it but there be another vital fact -- namely that the indian asiatic be a man with very vivid susceptibility of all kind and with live tradition of a civilisation of he own and we be bind to treat he with the same kind of respect and kindness and sympathy that we should expect to be treat with ourselves only the other day i see a letter from general gordon to a friend of mine he write -- to govern man there be but one way and it be eternal truth get into they skin try to realize they feeling that be the true secret of government that be not only a great ethical but a great political law and we shall reap a sour and sorry harvest if it be forget it would be folly to pretend to any dogmatic assurance -- and i certainly do not -- as to the course of the future in indium but for to-day anybody who take part in the rule of indium whether as a minister or as a member of the house of common participate in the discussion on affair in indium -- anyone who want to take a fruitful part in such discussion if he do he duty will find himself on the assumption that the british rule will continue ought to continue and must continue there be i know a school -- i do not think it have representative in this house -- who say that we might wisely walk out of indium and that the indian would manage they own affair better than we can manage affair for they anybody who picture to himself the anarchy the bloody chaos that would follow from any such deplorable step must shrink from that sinister decision we at all event -- minister and member of this house -- be bind to take a completely different view the government and the house in all its party and group be determine that we ought to face all these mischief and difficulty and danger of which i have be speak with a clear purpose we know that we be not do it for we own interest alone or we own fame in the history of the civilised world alone but for the interest of the million commit to we we ought to face it with sympathy with kindness with firmness with a love of justice and whether the weather be fair or foul in a valiant and manful spirit ii to constituent -lrb- arbroath October 21 1907 -rrb- it be a enormous satisfaction to I to find myself here once more the first time since the polling and since the splendid majority that these burgh be good enough to give I i value very much what the provost have say when he tell you that i have never though i have have pretty heavy burden neglect the local business of arbroath and the other burgh the provost truly say that i hold a important and responsible office under the crown and i hope that fact will be the excuse if excuse be need for my confine myself to-night to a single topic when i speak to a friend of mine in london the other day he say what be you go to speak about and i tell he he be a very experienced man and he say it be a most unattractive subject indium at any rate this be the last place where any apology be need for speak about indium because it be you who be responsible for my be the indian minister if you 2500 majority have be 2500 the other way i should have be no longer the indian minister there be something that strike the imagination something that awaken a feeling of the bond of mankind in the thought that you here and in the other burgh -- -lrb- shipmen artificer craftsman and shopkeeper live here -rrb- -- be bring through I and through you responsibility in elect I into contact with all these hundred of million across the sea therefore it be that i will not make any apology to you for my choice of a subject to-night let I say this not only to you gentleman here but to all british constituency -- that it be well you should have patience enough to listen to a speech about indium because it be no secret to anybody who understand that if the government be to make a certain kind of bad blunder in indium -- which i do not at all expect they to make -- there would be short work for a long time to come with many of those scheme upon which you have set you heart do not dream if any mishap of a certain kind be to come to pass in indium that you can go on with that program of social reform all cost money and absorb attention in the spirit in which you be now about to pursue it i be not particularly fond of talk of myself but there be one single personal word that i would like to say and my constituency be the only place in which i should not be ashamed to say that word you after all be concerned in the consistency of you representative now i think a public man who spend overmuch time in vindicate he consistency make a mistake i will confess to you in friendly confidence that i have wince when i read of lifelong friend of mine say that i have in certain indian transaction shelve the principle of a lifetime one of you countryman say that like the python -- that fabulous animal who have the largest swallow that any creature ever enjoy -- i have swallow all my principle i be a little disappointed at such clatter as this when a man have labor for more year than i care to count for liberal principle and liberal cause and think he may possibly have accumulate a little credit in the bank of public opinion -- and in the opinion of he party and he friend -- it be a most extraordinary and unwelcome surprise to he when he draw a very small cheque indeed upon that capital to find the cheque return with the uncomfortable and ill-omened word no effect i be not go to defend myself a long time ago a journalistic colleague who be a little uneasy at some line i take upon this question or that comfort himself by say well well the ship -lrb- speaking of I -rrb- swing on the tide but the anchor hold yes gentleman i be no pharisee but i do believe that my anchor hold and you cheer show that you believe it too now to indium i observe the other day that the bishop of lahore say -- and he word put in a very convenient form what be in the mind of those who think about indian question at all -- it be my deep conviction that we have reach a point of the utmost gravity and of far-reaching effect in we continued relation with this land and i most heartily wish there be more sign that this fact be clearly recognize by the bulk of englishman out here in indium or even by we ruler themselves now you and the democratic constituency of this kingdom be the ruler of indium it be to you therefore that i come to render my account just let we see where we be let we put the case when critic assail indian policy or any give aspect of it i want to know where we start from some of you in arbroath write to I a year ago and call upon I to defend the system of indian government and the policy for which i be responsible i decline for reason that i state at the moment i be here to answer to-night when the time make it more fitting in anticipation all those difficulty which some excellent people with whom in many way i sympathise feel again i say let we see where we start from do anybody want I to go to london to-morrow morning and to send a telegram to lord kitchener the commander-in-chief in indium and tell he that he be to disband the indian army to send home as fast as we can despatch transport the british contingent of the army and bring away the whole of the civil servant suppose it to be true as some people in arbroath seem to have think -- i be not argue the question -- that great britain lose more than she gain suppose it to be true that indium would have work out she own salvation without we suppose it to be true that the present government of indium have many defect -- suppose all that to be true do you want I to send a telegram to lord kitchener to-morrow morning to clear out bag and baggage how should we look in the face of the civilised world if we have so turn we back upon we duty and sovereign task how should we bear the smart sting of we own conscience when as assuredly we should we hear through the dark distance the roar and scream of confusion and carnage in indium then people of this way of think say that be not what we mean then what be it that be mean gentleman the outcome the final outcome of british rule in indium may be a profitable topic for the musing of meditative mind but we be not here to muse we have the duty of the day to perform we have the task of to-morrow spread out before we in the interest of indium to say nothing of we own national honor in the name of duty and of common sense we first and commanding task be to keep order and to quell violence among race and creed sternly to insist on the impartial application of rule of justice independent of european or of indian we begin from that we have get somehow or other whatever the detail of policy and executive act may be we be bind by the first law of human thing to maintain order there be plenty of difficulty in this immense task in england and i be not sure that i will exclude scotland but i say england in order to save you feeling one of the obstacle be the difficulty of find out for certain what actually happen scare headline in the bill of important journal be misleading i be sure many of you must know the kind of mirror that distort feature elongate line make round what be lineal and so forth i assure you that a mirror of that kind do not give you a more grotesque reproduction of the human physiognomy than some of these tremendous telegram give you as to what be happen in indium another point be that the press be very often flood with letter from indian or ex-indian -- from _ indicus olim _ and other -- too oftened color with personal partisanship and deep-dyed prepossession there be a spirit of caste outside the hindu sphere there be a great deal of write on the indian government by man who have acquire the habit while they be in the government and then unluckily retain the habit after they come home and live or ought to live in peace and quietness among they friend here that be another of we difficulty still when all such difficulty be measure and take account of it be impossible to overrate the courage the patience and fidelity with which the present house of common face what be not at all a easy moment in indian government you talk of democracy people cry oh democracy can not govern remote dependency i do not know it be a hard question so far after one session of the most liberal parliament that have ever sit in great britain this most democratic parliament so far at all event have safely round a extremely difficult angle it be quite true that in reference to a certain indian a conservative member rashly call out one night in the house of common why do not you shoot he the whole house tory radical and labor man they all revolt against any such doctrine as that and i augur from the proceedings of the last session -- with courage patience good sense and willingness to learn that democracy in this case at all event have show and i think be go to show its capacity for face all we problem now i sometimes say to friend of mine in the house and i venture respectfully to say it to you -- there be one tremendous fallacy which it be indispensable for you to banish from you mind take the point of view of a british liberal when you think of indium it be say the other day -- no i beg you pardon it be allege to have be say -- by a british member of parliament now travel in indium -- that whatever be good in the way of self-government for canada must be good for indium in my view that be the most concise statement that i can imagine of the grossest fallacy in all politics it be a thoroughly dangerous fallacy i think it be the hollowest and i be sorry to say the commonest of all the fallacy in the history of the world in all stage of civilisation because a particular policy or principle be true and expedient and vital in certain definite circumstance therefore it must be equally true and vital in a completely different set of circumstance what sophism can be more gross and dangerous you might just as well say that because a fur coat in canada at certain time of the year be a truly comfortable garment therefore a fur coat in the deccan be just the very garment that you would be delighted to wear i only throw it out to you as a example and a illustration where the historical tradition the religious belief the racial condition be all different -- there to transfer by mere untempered and cast-iron logic all the conclusion that you apply in one case to the other be the height of political folly and i trust that neither you nor i will ever lend ourselves to any extravagant doctrine of that species you may say ah you be lay down very different rule of policy in indium from those which for the best part of you life you lay down for ireland yes but that reproach will only have a sting in it if you persuade I that ireland with its history the history of the rebellion union and all the other chapter of that dismal tale be exactly analogous to the 300 million of people in indium i be not at all afraid of face you test i can not but remember that in speak to you i may be speak to people many thousand of mile away but all the same i shall speak to you and to they perfectly frankly i do not myself believe in artful diplomacy i have no gift for it there be two set of people you have get to consider first of all i hope that the government of indium so long as i be connect with it and responsible for it to parliament and to the country will not be hurry by the anger of the impatient idealist the impatient idealist -- you know he i know he i like he i have be one myself he say you admit that so and so be right why do not you do it -- why do not you do it now whether he be a indian idealist or a british idealist i sympathise with he ah gentleman how many of the most tragic miscarriage in human history have be due to the impatience of the idealist -lrb- loud cheer -rrb- i should like to ask the indian idealist whether it be a good way of procure what everybody desire a reduction of military expenditure for example whether it be a good way of do that to foment a spirit of strife in indium which make reduction of military force difficult which make the maintenance of military force indispensable be it a good way to help reformer like lord minto and myself in carry through political reform to inflame the mind of those who listen to such teacher to inflame they mind with the idea that we proposal and project be sham assuredly it be not and i will say this gentleman do not think there be a single responsible leader of the reform party in indium who do not deplore the outbreak of disorder that we have have to do we best to put down who do not agree that disorder whatever you ultimate policy may be -- must be with a firm hand put down if indium to-morrow become a self-governing colony -- disorder would still have to be put down with a iron hand i do not know and i do not care to whom these gentleman propose to hand over the charge of govern indium whoever they might be depend upon it that the maintenance of order be the foundation of anything like future progress if any of you hear unfavourable language apply to I as you representative do I the justice to remember consideration of that kind to nobody in this world by habit by education by experience by view express in political affair for a great many year past to nobody be exceptional repression more distasteful than it be to I after all gentleman you would not have I see man try to set the prairie on fire without arrest the hand you would not blame I when i see man smoke they pipe near powder magazine you would not blame I you would not call I a arch coercionist if i say away with the man and away with the pipe we have not allow ourselves -- i speak of the indian government -- to be hurry into the policy of repression i say this to what i would call the idealist party then i would say something to those who talk nonsense about apathy and supineness we will not be hurry into repression any more than we will be hurry into the other direction this party which be very vocal in this country say : -- oh we be astonished and indium be astonished and amaze at the licence that you extend to newspaper and to speaker why do not you stop it oriental they say do not understand it yes but just let we look at that we be not oriental that be the root of the matter we be in indium we english scotch and irish be in indium because we be not oriental we be representative not of oriental civilisation but of western civilisation of its method its principle its practice and i for one will not be hurry into a excessive haste for repression by the argument that oriental do not understand patience or toleration you will want to know how the situation be view at this moment in indium itself by those who be responsible for the government of indium this view be not a new view at all it be that the situation be not gravely dangerous but it require serious and urgent attention that seem for the moment to be the verdict extremist be few but they be active they field be wide they net be far spread anybody who have read history know that the extremist often beat the moderate by he fire he heated energy he concentration by he very narrowness so be it we remember it we watch it all with that lesson of historic experience full in we mind yet we still hold that it would be the height of political folly for we at this moment to refuse to do all we can with prudence and energy to rally the moderate to the cause of the government simply because the policy will not satisfy the extremist let we if we can rally the moderate and if we be tell that the policy will not satisfy the extremist so be it we line will remain the same it be the height of folly to refuse to rally sensible people because we do not satisfy extremist i be detain you unmercifully but i doubt whether -- and do not think i say it because it happen to be my department -- of all the question that be to be discuss perhaps for year to come any question can be in all its actual foundation and all its prospective bearing more important than the question of indium there be many aspect of it which it be not possible for I to go into as for example some of its military aspect i repeat my doubt whether there be any question more commanding at this moment and for many a day to come than the one which i be impress upon you to-night be all that be call unrest in indium mere froth or be it a deep rolling flood be it the result of natural order and wholesome growth in this vast community be it natural effervescence or be it deadly fermentation be indium with all its heterogeneous population -- be it move slowly and steadily to new and undreamt of unity it be the vagueness of the discontent which be not universal -- it be the vagueness that make it harder to understand harder to deal with some of they be angry with I why because i have not be able to give they the moon i have get no moon and if i have i would not part with it i will give the moon when i know who live there and what kind of condition prevail there i want if i may to make a little literary digression much of this movement arise from the fact that there be now a large body of educate indian who have be feed at we example and we instigation upon some of the great teacher and master of this country milton burke macaulay mill and spencer surely it be a mistake in we not to realize that these master should have mighty force and irresistible influence who can be surprise that educate indian who read those high master and teacher of ours be intoxicate with the idea of freedom nationality self-government that breathe the breath of life in those inspiring and illuminating page who of we that have the privilege in the day of we youth at college or at home of turn over those golden chapter and see that lustrous firmament dawn over we youthful imagination -- who of we can forget shall i call it the intoxication and rapture with which we strive to make friend with truth knowledge beauty freedom then why should we be surprise that young indian feel the same movement of mind when they be make free of we own immortal i would only say this to my idealist friend whether indian or european that for every passage that they can find in mill or burke or macaulay or any other of we lofty sage with they noble heart and potent brain i will find they a dozen passage in which history be show to admonish we in the language of burke -- how weary a step do those take who endeavor to make out of a great mass a true political personality they be word much to be commend to those zealot in indium -- how many a weary step have to be take before they can form themselves into a mass that have a true political personality my warning may be waste but anybody who have a chance ought to try to appeal to the better the riper mind of educate indium time have go on with I experience have widen i have never lose my invincible faith that there be a better mind in all civilised community -- and that this better mind if you can reach it if statesman in time to come can reach that better mind can awaken it can evoke it can induce it to apply itself to practical purpose for the improvement of the condition of such a community they will earn the crown of beneficent fame indeed nothing strike I much more than this when i talk of the better mind of indium -- there be subtle element religious spiritual mystical traditional historical in what we may call for the moment the indian mind which be very hard for the most candid and patient to grasp or to realize in they full force but we duty and it be a splendid duty be to try i always remember a little passage in the life of a great anglo-indian sir henry lawrence a very simple passage and it be this no one ever eat at sir henry lawrence 's table without learn to think more kindly of the native i wish i could know that at every anglo-indian table to-day nobody have sit down without leave it have learn to think a little more kindly of the native one more word on this point bad manners overbearing manners be disagreeable in all country : indium be the only country where bad and overbearing manners be a political crime the government have be oblige to take measure of repression they may be oblige to take more but we have not contented ourselves with measure of repression those of you who have follow indian matter at all during the last two or three month be aware there be a reform scheme a scheme to give the indian chance of come more closely and responsibly into a share of the government of they country the government of indium issue certain proposal expressly mark as provisional and tentative there be no secret hatching of a new constitution they circular be send about to obtain a expression of indian opinion official and non-official plenty of time have be give and be to be give for a examination and discussion of these proposal we shall not be call upon to give a official decision until spring next year and i shall not personally be call upon for a decision before the middle of next session one step we have take to which i attach the greatest importance two indian have for the first time be appoint to be member of the council of indium sit at whitehall i appoint these two gentleman not only to advise the secretary of state in council not only to help to keep he in touch with indian opinion and indian interest but as a marked and conspicuous proof on the highest scale by place they on this important and ruling body that we no longer mean to keep indian at arm 's length or shut the door of the council chamber of the paramount power against they let I press this important point upon you the root of the unrest discontent and sedition so far as i can make out after constant communication with those who have better chance of know the problem at first hand than i could have have -- the root of the matter be racial and social not political that be so it be of a kind that be the very hardest to reach you can reach political sentiment this go deeper racial dislike be a dislike not of political domination but of racial domination and my object in make that conspicuous change in the constitution of the council of indium which advise the secretary of state for indium be to do something and if rightly understand and interpret to do a great deal to teach all english officer and governor in indium from the youngest competition wallah who arrive there that in the eye of the ruling government at home the indian be perfectly worthy of a place be it small or great in the counsel of those who make and carry on the law and the administration of the community to which he belong we stand by this position not in word alone we have show it in act and shall show it further there be one more difficulty -- there be two difficulty -- and i must ask you for a couple of minute i only need name they -- famine and plague at this moment when you have think and argue out all these political thing the government of indium still remain a grim business if there be no rain this month the spectre of famine seem to be approach and nobody can blame we for that nobody expect the viceroy and the secretary of state to play the part of elijah on mount carmel who pray and see a little cloud like a man 's hand until the heaven become black with wind and cloud and there be a great rain that be beyond the reach of government all we can say be that never before be the government in all its branch and member find more ready than it be now to do the very best to face the prospect large suspension of revenue and rent will be grant allowance will be make to distressed cultivator no stone will be leave unturn the plague figure be terrible enough at this season plague mortality be generally quiescent but this year even if the last three month of it show no rise the plague mortality will still be the worst that have ever be know i think in indium 's record annals pestilence during the last nine month have stalk through the land waste she city and village uncontrolled and uncontrollable so far as we can tell by human forethought or care when i read some of these figure in the house of common a few perturb cry of shame accompany they these cry come from the natural sympathy horror amazement and commiseration with which we all listen to such ghastly story the shame do not lie with the government if you see anything in you newspaper about these plague figure remember that they be not like a epidemic here in try to remedy plague you have to encounter the habit and prejudice of hundred of year suppose you find plague be convey by a flea upon a rat and suppose you be deal with a population who object to the take away of life you see for yourselve the difficulty the government of indium have apply themselves with great energy with fresh activity and they believe they have get the secret of this fall disaster they have lay down a large policy of medical sanitary and financial aid i be a hardened niggard of public money i watch the expenditure of indian revenue as the ferocious dragon of the old mythology watch the golden apple i do not forget that i come from a constituency which so far as i have know it if it be most generous be also most prudent nevertheless though i have to be thrifty almost parsimonious upon this matter the council of indium and myself will i be sure not stint or grudge i can only say in conclusion that i think i have say enough to convince you that i be do what i believe you would desire I to do -- conduct administration in the spirit which i believe you will approve listen with impartiality to all i can learn desirous to support all those who be toiling at arduous work in indium and that we shall not be deter from pursue to the end a policy of firmness on the one hand and of liberal and steady reform on the other we shall not see all the fruit of it in we day so be it we shall at least have make not only a beginning but a marked advance both in order and progress by resolute patience and a unflagging spirit of conciliation iii a amendment to the address -lrb- house of common jan 31 1908 -rrb- dr rutherford -lrb- middlesex brentford -rrb- rise to move as a amendment to the address at the end to add -- but humbly submit that the present condition of affair in indium demand the immediate and serious attention of he majesty 's government that the present proposal of the government of indium be inadequate to allay the exist and grow discontent and that comprehensive measure of reform be imperatively necessary in the direction of give the people of indium control over they own affair mr deputy-speaker i think the house will allow I in the remark that i wish to make to refer to a communication that i have receive namely the decision arrive at by the transvaal government in respect to the question of asiatic everybody in the house be aware of the enormous interest even passionate interest that have be take in this subject especially in indium and for very good reason without further preface let I say this be the statement receive by lord elgin from the government of the transvaal last night : -- gandhus and other leader of the indian and chinese community have offer voluntary registration in a body within three month provide signature only be take of educate propertied or well-known asiatic and finger-print of the other and that no question against which asiatic have religious objection be press the transvaal government have accept this offer and undertake pend registration not to enforce the penalty under the act against all those who register the sentence of all asiatic in prison will be remit to-morrow lord selborne add this course be agree to by both political party i be sure that everybody in the house will think that very welcome news i do not like to let the matter drop without say a word -- i be sure lord elgin would like I to say it -- in recognition of the good spirit show by the transvaal government in reference to the amendment now before the house i have listen to the debate with keen lively and close interest i be not one of those who have usually complain of these grave topic be raise when fair opportunity offer in this house on the whole look back over my parliamentary lifetime which be now pretty long i think there have be too little indian discussion before i come here there be powerful mind like mr fawcett and mr bradlaugh and other who constantly raise indian question in a truly serious and practical way though i do not at all commit myself to the various point of view that be then adopt but of course this be a vote of confidence i be not go to ask member to vote for the government on that ground but i must submit that he majesty 's present government in the indian department have the confidence both of the house and of the country i believe we have a important suggestion be make by my hon friend now sit below the gangway that a parliamentary committee should sit -- i presume a joint committee of the two house -- and my hon friend who speak last say that the fact of the existence of that committee would bring parliament into closer contact with the mind of indium well ever since i have be at the indium office i have rather incline in the direction of one of the old parliamentary committee i will not argue the question now i can only assure my hon friend that the question have be consider by I and i see what its advantage might be yet i also perceive serious disadvantage in the old day they be able to command the service on the indian committee of ex-minister of member of this house and member of another place who have have much experience of indian administration and i be doubtful consider the preoccupation of public man whether we should now be able to call a large body of experienced administrator with the necessary balance between the two house to sit on one of these committee and then i would point out another disadvantage you would have to call away from the performance of they duty in indium a large body of man whose duty ought to occupy and i believe do occupy all they mind and all they time still it be a idea and i will only say that i do not entirely banish it from my own mind two interesting speech and significant speech have be make this afternoon one be make by my hon friend the mover and the other by the hon member for east leed those two speech raise a really important issue my hon friend the member for leed say that democracy be entirely oppose to and would resist the doctrine of the settle fact -lrb- 1 -rrb- my hon friend tell you democracy will have nothing to do with settled fact though he do not quite put it as plainly as that now if that be so i be very sorry for democracy i do not agree with my hon friend i think democracy will be just as reasonable as any other sensible form of government and i do not believe democracy will for a moment think that you be to rip up a settlement of a administrative or constitutional question because it jar with some abstract _ a priori _ idea i for one certainly say that i would not remain at the indium office or any other powerful and responsible departmental office on condition that i make short work of settled fact hurry on with my catalogue of first principle and arrange on those principle the whole duty of government then my hon friend the member for brentford quote a expression of mine use in a speech in the country about the impatient idealist and he reprove I for say that some of the worst tragedy of history have be work by the impatient idealist he be kind enough to say that it be i among other people who have make he a idealist and therefore i ought not to be ashamed of my spiritual and intellectual progeny i certainly have no right whatever to say that i be ashamed of my hon friend who make a speech full of interesting view full of vision of a millennial future and i do not quarrel with he for make he speech my hon friend say that he be for a imperial duma the hon gentleman have have the advantage of a visit to indium which i have never have i think he be there for six whole long week he polish off the indian population at the heroic rate of sixty million a week and this make he we especially competent instructor he imperial duma be to be elect as i understand by universal suffrage -lrb- footnote 1 : the secretary of state have on a earlier occasion speak of the petition of bengal as a settle fact -rrb- dr rutherford : no not universal suffrage i say educational suffrage and also pecuniary suffrage -- taxpayer and ratepayer mr morley : in the same speech the hon gentleman make a great charge against we system of education in indium -- that we have not educate they at all therefore he exclude at once a enormous part of the population the imperial duma as i understand from my hon friend be to be subject to the veto of the viceroy that be not democracy we be to send out from great britain once in five year a viceroy who be to be confront by a imperial duma just as the tsar be confront by the duma in russium surely that be not a very ripe idea of democracy my hon friend visit the state of baroda and think it well govern well there be no duma of he sort there i will state frankly my own opinion even though i have not spend one single week-end in indium if i have to frame a new system of government for indium i declare i would multiply the baroda system of government rather than have a imperial duma and universal suffrage the speech of my hon friend with whom i be sorry to find myself not in collision but in difference illustrate what be to my mind one of the grossest of all the fallacy in practical politics -- namely that you can cut out frame and shape one system of government for community with absolutely different set of social religious and economic condition -- that you can cut they all out by a sort of standardised pattern and say that what be good for we here the point of view the line of argument the method of solution -- that all these thing be to be apply right off to a community like indium i must tell my hon friend that i regard that as a most fatal and mischievous fallacy and i need not say more i be bind after what i have say to add that i do not think that it be at all involve in liberalism i have have the great good fortune and honor and privilege to have know some of the great liberal of my time and there be not one of those great man gambetta bright gladstone mazzinus who would have accept for one single moment the doctrine on which my hon friend really base he visionary proposition for a duma be there any rational man who hold that if you can lay down political principle and maxim of government that apply equally to scotland or to england or to ireland or to france or to spain therefore they must be just as true for the punjab and the united province and bengal dr rutherford : i quote mr bright as make the very proposal i have make with the exception of the duma -- namely provincial parliament mr morley : i be afraid i must traverse my hon friend 's description of mr bright 's view with which i think i be pretty well acquaint mr bright be i believe on the right track at the time when in 1858 the government of indium be transfer to the crown he be not in favor of universal suffrage -- he be rather old-fashioned -- but mr bright 's proposal be perfectly different from that of my hon friend sir henry maine and other who have be concern with indian affair come to the conclusion that mr bright 's idea be right -- that to put one man a viceroy assist as he might be with a effective executive council in charge of such a area as indium and its 300 million of population with all its different race creed mode of thought be to put on a viceroy 's shoulder a load that no man of whatever power however gigantic they might be could be expect effectively to support my hon friend and other who sometimes favor I with criticism in the same sense seem to suggest that i be a false brother that i do not know what liberalism be i think i do and i must even say that i do not think i have anything to learn of the principle or maxim or the practice of liberal doctrine even from my hon friend you be bind to look at the whole mass of the difficulty and perplexing problem connect with indium from a common-sense plane and it be not common sense if i may say so without discourtesy to talk of imperial duma i have not have a word of thanks from that quarter in the midst of a shower of reproach for what i regard in all its direct and indirect result and bearing as one of the most important move that have be make in connection with the relation between great britain and indium for a long time -- i mean the admission of two indian gentleman to the council of the secretary of state a hon friend want I to appoint a indian gentleman to the viceroy 's executive council well that be a different thing but i be perfectly sure that if a occasion offer neither lord minto nor i would fall short of some such application of democratic principle in itself it be something that we have a viceroy and a secretary of state thoroughly alive to the great change in temperature and atmosphere that have be go on in indium for the last five or six year and i do not think we ought to be too impatiently judge we come in at a perturb time we do not find balmy breeze and smooth water it be notorious that we come into enormous difficulty which we have not create how they be create be a long story that have nothing whatever to do with the present discussion but what i submit with the utmost confidence be that the situation to-day be a considerable improvement on the situation that we find when we assume power two year ago there have be heavy and black cloud over the indian horizon during those two year by we policy those cloud have be to some extent disperse i be not so unwise as to say that the cloud will never come back again but what have be do by we have be justify in my opinion by the event some fault be find and i do not in the least complain with the deportation of two native gentleman i do not quarrel with the man who find fault with that proceed to take anybody and deport he without bring any charge against he and with no intention of bring he to trial be a step that i think the house be perfectly justified in call I to account for i have do my best to account for it and to-day anyone who know the punjab would agree that whatever may happen at some remote period its state be comparatively quiet and satisfactory i be not go to repeat my justification of that strong measure of deportation but i should like to read to the house the word of the viceroy in the legislative council in November last when he be talk about the circumstance with which we have to deal he say address lord kitchener -- i hope that you excellency will on my behalf as viceroy and as represent the king convey to he majesty 's indian troops my thanks for the contempt with which they have receive the disgraceful overture which i know have be make to they the seed of sedition have be unscrupulously scatter throughout indium even amongst the hill of the frontier tribe we be grateful that they have fall on much barren ground but we can no longer allow they dissemination will anybody say that in view of the possible danger point to in that language of the viceroy two or three month ago we do wrong in use the regulation which apply to the case no one can say what mischief might have follow if we have take any other course than that which we actually take let I beseech my hon friend at least to try for some sense of balanced proportion instead of allow they wrath at one particular incident of policy to blot out from they vision all the wide and durable operation to which we have set firm and persistent hand after all this absence of a sense of proportion be what more than any other one thing make a man a wretched politician now as to the reform that be mention in my hon friend 's amendment it be a extraordinary amendment it -- submit that the present condition of affair in indium demand the immediate and serious attention of he majesty 's government i could cordially vote for that only remark that the hon member must think the secretary of state and the viceroy and other person immediately concern in the government of indium very curious people if he suppose that the state of affair in indium do not always demand they immediate and very serious attention then the amendment say -- the present proposal of the government of indium be inadequate to allay the exist and grow discontent i hope it be not presumptuous to say so but i should have expect a definition from my hon friend of what he guess these proposal be i should like to set a little examination paper to my hon friend i have study they for many month yet would rather not be examine for chapter and verse but my hon friend after he famous six week of travel know all about they and the state of affair for which we plan be the inadequate remedy i do not want to hold he up as a formidable example : but in he speech to-day he go over -- and it do credit to he industry -- every single one of the most burn and controversial question of the whole system of indian government and seem to say i will tell you how far this be wrong and exactly what ought to be do to put what be wrong right i think i have get from he twenty _ ipse dixit _ on all these topic on which we slow dull people at the indium office be wear ourselves to piece when it be say as i often hear it say that i for example be fall into the hand of my official it should be remember that those gentleman who go to indium also get into the hand of other people dr rutherford : i be in the hand both of official and of indian mr morley : then let I assure he perhaps to he amazement that he come out of the hand of both of they still with something to learn i wonder whether when this house be ask to condemn the present proposal of the government of indium as be inadequate to allay the exist and grow discontent it be realize exactly how the case stand i will repeat what i say in the debate on the indian budget the government of indium send over to the indium office they proposal -- they various scheme for advisory council and so forth we at the indium office subject they to a careful scrutiny and laborious examination as a result of this careful scrutiny and examination they be send back to the government of indium with the request that they would submit they to discussion in various quarter the instruction to the government of indium be that by the end of march the indium office be to learn what the general view be at which the government of indium have themselves arrive upon the plan with all they complexity and variation we want to know what they would tell we it will be for we to consider how far the report so arrive at how far these proposal ripen by indian opinion carry out the policy which he majesty 's government have in view surely that be a reasonable and simple way of proceed when you have to deal with complex community of varied race and all the other peculiarity of indium you have to think out how you proposal will work democracy do not always think how thing will work sir henry cotton make a speech that interested and strike I by its moderation and reasonableness he make a number of remark in perfect good faith about official which i receive in a chastened spirit for he have be for a very long time a very distinguished official himself therefore he know all about it he go on to talk of the great problem of the separation of the executive and judicial function which be one of the living problem of indium i can only assure my hon friend that that be engage we attention both in indium and here another of the subject to which the attention of the indian government have be specifically direct have regard to the mitigation of flog the restriction of civil flogging and the limitation of military flogging to specific case in this we be make a marked advance in humanity and common sense -- which be itself a kind of humanity my hon friend appeal to I say that all will be well in indium if the secretary of state will make a statement which will show the indian people that in he relation with they he hope for they and he effort for they he be move by a kindly sympathetic and friendly feeling show they that he heart be with they all i have get to say be that i have never show myself anything else my heart be with they what be bureaucracy to I it be a great machine in indium yes a splendid machine for perform the most difficult task that ever be commit to the charge of any nation but show I where it fail -- that it be perfect in every respect no sensible man would contend for a moment -- but show I at any point let any of my hon friend show I from day to day as this session pass where this bureaucracy as they call it have be at fault do they suppose it possible that i will not show my recognition of that failure and do all that i can to remedy it although the government of indium be complicate and intricate they can not suppose that i shall fail for one moment in do all in my power to demonstrate that we be move by a kindly a sympathetic a friendly a energetic and what i will call a govern spirit in the highest form and sense of that sovereign and inspiring word iv indian civil service -lrb- london July 1908 -rrb- gentleman -- i have first of all to thank you for what i understand be a rare honor -- and a honor it assuredly be -- of be invite to be you guest to-night the position of a secretary of state in the presence of the indian civil service be not a entirely simple one you gentleman who be still in the service and the veteran i see around I who have be in that great service naturally and properly look first of all and almost altogether upon indium a secretary of state have to look also upon great britain and upon parliament -- and that be not always a perfectly easy situation to adjust i forget who it be that say about the ruler of indium in indium : -- it be no easy thing for a man to keep he watch in two longitude at once at the same time that be the case of the secretary of state it be not the business of the secretary of state to look exclusively at indium though i will confess to you for myself that during the moderately short time i have hold my present office i have keep my eye upon indium constantly steadfastly and with every desire to learn the whole truth upon every situation as it arise but there must be a thorough comprehension in the mind of the secretary of state of two thing -- first of all of the indian point of view and secondly the point of view as it appear to those who be the master of I and of you do not forget that adjustment have to be make it would be impertinent of I to pay compliment to the civil service to whom i propose this toast -- the health of the indian civil service you might think for a moment that it be a amateur propose prosperity and success to expert i have have in my day a good deal to do with expert of one kind and another and i assure you that i do not think a expert be at all the worse when he get a candid-minded and reasonably well trained amateur now this year be a memorable anniversary it be fifty year within a month or two since the crown take over the government of indium from the old east indium company whether that be a good move or a bad move it would not become I to discuss the move be make -lrb- a voice it be a good move -rrb- my veteran friend say that it be a good move i hope so but at the end of fifty year we be at rather a critical moment i read in _ the time _ the other day that the present viceroy and secretary of state have to deal with condition such as the british in indium never before be call upon to face -lrb- a voice that be so -rrb- now many of you sit around I at this table be far better able to test the weight of that statement than i can pretend to be be it true that at the end of fifty year since the transfer to the crown we have to deal with condition such as the british in indium never before be call upon to face -lrb- yes -rrb- i can not undertake to measure that but what be clear be that decidedly heavy cloud have suddenly rise in we horizon and be darkly sail over we indian sky that can not be deny but gentleman have pay the utmost attention that a man can in office with access to all the papers and see all the observer he be able to see i do not feel for a moment that this discovery of a secret society or a secret organization involve any question of a earthquake i prefer to look upon it to revert to my own figure as cloud sail through the sky i do not say you will not have to take pretty strong measure of one sort and another yes but strong measure in the right direction and with the right qualification i think any man who lay down a firm proposition that all be well or any man who say that all be ill -- either of those two man be probably wrong now this room be fill and genially fill with man who have have enormous experience vast and wide experience and not merely passive experience but that splendid active experience which be the real training and education of man in responsibility this room be full of gentleman with these qualification and i will venture to say that the theory and explanation that could be hear in the palace of truth from all of you gentleman here would be countless in they difference i hear explanation of the present state of thing all day long i like to hear they you think it may become monotonous no : not at all because there be so much i will not say of random variety but there be so much independent use of mind upon the fact that we have to deal with that i listen with endless edification and instruction but i think and i wish i could think otherwise with all my heart -- that to sum up all these theory and explanation of the state of thing with which we have to deal you can hardly resist a painful impression that there be now astir in some quarter a certain estrangement and alienation of race -lrb- no no -rrb- gentleman bear with I patiently it be we share in the asiatic question a difficult problem i be try to feel my way through the most difficult problem the most difficult situation that a responsible government can have to face of course i be dependent upon information but as i read it as i listen to serious indian expert with large experience it all sound estrangement and alienation even though it be no worse than superficial now that be the problem that we have to deal with gentleman i should very badly repay you kindness in ask I to come among you to-night if i be to attempt for a minute to analyze or to prove all the condition that have lead to this state of thing it would need hour and day this be not i think the occasion nor the moment we first duty -- the first duty of any government -- be to keep order but just remember this it would be idle to deny and i be not sure that any of you gentleman would deny that there be at this moment and there have be for some little time past and very likely there will be for some time to come a living movement in the mind of the people for whom you be responsible a living movement and a movement for what a movement for object which we ourselves have all teach they to think desirable object and unless we somehow or other can reconcile order with satisfaction of those idea and aspiration gentleman the fault will not be theirs it will be ours it will mark the breakdown of what have never yet break down in any part of the world -- the breakdown of british statesmanship that be what it will do now i do not believe anybody -- either in this room or out of this room -- believe that we can now enter upon a era of pure repression you can not enter at this date and with english public opinion mind you watch you upon a era of pure repression and i do not believe really that anybody desire any such thing i do not believe so gentleman we have see attempt in the lifetime of some of we here to-night attempt in continental europe to govern by pure repression have one of they really succeed they have all fail there may be now and again a spurious semblance of success but in truth they have all fail whether we with we enormous power and resolution should fail i do not know but i do not believe anybody in this room represent so powerfully as you do dominant sentiment that be not always feel in england -- that in this room there be anybody who be for a era of pure repression gentleman i would just digress for a moment if i be not tire you -lrb- go on -rrb- about the same time as the transfer about fifty year ago of the government of indium from the old east indium company to the crown another very important step be take a step which i have often think since i have be concern with the government of indium be far more momentous one almost deeper than the transfer to the crown and what do you think that be that be the first establishment -- i think i be right in my date -- of university we in this country be so accustomed to look upon political change as the only important change that we very often forget such a change as the establishment of university and if any of you be incline to prophesy i should like to read to you something that be write by that great and famous man lord macaulay in the year 1836 long before the university be think of what do he say what a warn it be gentleman he write in the year 1836 : -- at the single town of hooghly 1400 boy be learn english the effect of this education on the hindu be prodigious it be my firm belief that if we plan of education be follow up there will not be a single idolater among the respectable class in bengal thirty year hence and this will be effect merely by the natural operation of knowledge and reflection ah gentleman the natural operation of knowledge and reflection carry man of a different structure of mind different belief different habit and custom of life -- it carry they into strange and unexpected path i be not go to embark you to-night upon these vast controversy but when we talk about education be we not get very near the root of the case now to-night we be not in the humor -- i be sure you be not i certainly be not -- for philosophise somebody be glad of it i will tell you what i think of -- as i have for a good many month past -- i think first of the burden of responsibility weigh on the govern man at calcutta and simlum and the other main centre of power and of labor we think of the anxiety of those in indium and in england as well who have relative in remote place and under condition that be very familiar to you all i have a great admiration for the self-command for the freedom from anything like panic which have hitherto mark the attitude of the european population of calcutta and some other place and i confess i have say to myself that if they have find here in london bomb in the railway carriage bomb under the prime minister 's house and so forth we should have have tremendous scare headline and all the other phenomenon of excitement and panic so far as i be inform though very serious in calcutta -- the feeling be serious how could it be anything else -- they have exercise the great and noble virtue in all rank and class of self-command now the government -- if you will allow I for a very few moment to say a word on behalf of the government not here alone but at simlum -- we and they for after all we be one -- have be assail for a certain want of courage and what be call often grossly miscall vigor we be tell the other day -- and this bring we to the root of policy -- that there have be a momentary flash of courage in the government a momentary flash of courage when the government of indium and we here assent to the deportation of two man and it be make a matter of complaint that they be release immediately well they be not release immediately but after six or eight month -- i forget exactly how many month -- of detention they be there with no charge no trial nor intention of bring they to trial how long be we to keep they there not a day i answer nor one hour after the specific and particular mischief with a view to which this drastic proceeding be adopt have abate specific mischief mind you i will not go into that argument to-night : another day i will i will only say one thing to strain the meaning and the spirit of a exceptional law like the old regulation of the year 1818 in such a fashion as this what would it do such a strain press upon we in the perverse imagination of headstrong man be no better than a suggestion for provoke lawless and criminal reprisal -lrb- no -rrb- you may not agree with I you be kindly allow I as you guest to say thing with which perhaps you do not agree -lrb- cry of go on -rrb- after all we understand one another -- we speak the same language and i tell you that a proceeding of that kind indefinite detention be a thing that would not be endure in this country -lrb- a voice of disorder -rrb- yes if there be great and clear connection between the detention and the outbreak of disorder certainly but as the disorder have abate it would have be intolerable for we to continue the incarceration last Monday what be call a press act be pass by the government of indium in connection with and simultaneously with a explosive act which ought to have be pass i should think twenty year ago what be the purport of the press act i do not attempt to give it in technical language where the local government find a newspaper article incite to murder and violence or resort to explosive for the purpose of murder or violence that local government may apply to a magistrate of a certain status to issue a order for the seizure of the press by which that incitement have be print and if the owner of the press feel himself aggrieved he may within fifteen day ask the high court to reverse the order and direct the restoration of the press that be a statement of the law that have be pass in indium and to which i do not doubt we shall give we assent there have be the usual outcry raise -- usual in all these case certain people say oh you be too late other say you be too early i will say to you first of all and to any other audience afterwards that i have no apology to make for be a party to the passing of this law now and i have no apology to make for not pass it before i do not believe in short cut and i believe that the government in these difficult circumstance be wise not to be in too great a hurry i have no apology to make for introduce executive action into what would normally be a judicial process neither on the other hand have i any apology to make for temper executive action with judicial element and i be very glad to say that a evening newspaper last night which be not of the politics to which i belong entirely approve of that it say : you must show that you be not afraid of refer you semi-executive semi-judicial action to the high court this act meddle with no criticism however strong of government measure it discourage the advocacy of no practical policy social political or economic yet i see to my great regret and astonishment that this act be describe as a act for judge case of seditious libel without a jury it be contend by some -- and i respect the contention -- that the imperial parliament ought to have be consult before this act be pass and ought to be consult now -lrb- cry of no no -rrb- my veteran friend live before the day of household suffrage well it be say that the voice of parliament ought to be hear in so grave a matter as this but the principle of the proposal be fully consider as be quite right not only by the secretary of state in council but by the cabinet it be a matter of public urgency i stand by it but it be perfectly natural to ask : should the imperial parliament have no voice i have direct the government of indium to report to the secretary of state all the proceedings take under this act and i undertake as long as i hold the office of secretary of state to present to parliament from time to time the report of the proceedings take under this somewhat drastic act when i be tell that a act of this kind be a restriction on the freedom of the press i do not accept it for a moment i do not believe that there be a man in england who be more jealous of the freedom of the press than i be but let we see what we mean it be say oh these incendiary article -- for they be incendiary and murderous -- be mere froth yes they be froth but they be froth stain with bloodsh when you have man admit that they deliberately write these article and promote these newspaper with a view of further murderous action to talk of the freedom of the press in connection with that be wicked moonshine we have now get a very radical house of common so much the better for you if i be still a member of the house of common i should not mind for a moment go down to the house -- and i be sure that my colleague will not mind -- to say that when you find these article on the avowal of those concerned expressly design to promote murderous action and when you find as a fact that murderous action have come about it be moonshine to talk of the freedom of the press there be no use in indulge in heroics they be not wanted but a incendiary article be part and parcel of the murderous act you may put picric acid in the ink and pen just as much as in any steel bomb i have one or two extract here with which i will not trouble you but when i be tell that we should recognize it as one of the chief aim of good government that there may be as much public discussion as possible i read that sentence with proper edification and then i turn to what i have telegraph for from indium -- extract from _ yugantar _ to talk of public discussion in connection with mischief of that kind be really push thing intolerably far i will not be in a hurry to believe that there be not a great body in indium of reasonable people not only among the quiet humble law-abiding class but among the educate class i do not care what they call themselves or what organization they may form themselves into but i will not be in a hurry to believe that there be no such people and that we can never depend on they when we believe this -- that we have no body of organise reasonable people on we side in indium -- when you gentleman who know the country say this -- then i say that on the day when we believe that we shall be confront with as awkward as embarrassing and as hazardous a situation as have ever confront the ruler of any of the most complex and gigantic state in human history i be confident that if the crisis come it will find we ready but let we keep we mind clear in advance there have be many dark and ugly moment -- see gentleman around I who have go through dark and ugly date -- in we relation with indium before now we have a clouded moment before we now we shall get through it -- but only with self-command and without any quackery or cant whether it be the quackery of blind violence disguise as love of order or the cant of unsound and misapply sentiment divorce from knowledge and untouched by any cool consideration of the fact v on propose reform -lrb- house of lord December 17 1908 -rrb- i feel that i owe a very sincere apology to the house for the disturbance in the business arrangement of the house of which i have be the cause though the innocent cause it have be say that in the delay in bring forward this subject i have be anxious to burke discussion that be not in the least true the reason that make it seem desirable to I that the discussion on this most important and far-reaching range of topic should be postpone be -- i believe the house will agree with I -- reason of common sense in the first place discussion without anybody have see the papers to be discuss would evidently have be ineffective in the second place it would have be impossible to discuss those papers with good effect -- the papers that i be go this afternoon to present to parliament -- until we know at all event in some degree what they reception have be in the country most immediately concerned and then thirdly my lord i can not but apprehend that discussion here -- i mean in parliament -- would be calculate to prejudice the reception in indium of the proposal that he majesty 's government in concert with the government of indium be now make my lord i submit those be three very essential reason why discussion in my view and i hope in the view of this house be to be deprecate this afternoon you lordship will be present with a very modest blue-book of 100 or 150 page but i should like to promise noble lord that to-morrow morning there will be ready for they a series of papers on the same subject of a size so enormous that the most voracious or even carnivorous appetite for blue-book will have ample food for augment the joy of the christmas holiday the observation that i shall ask you lordship to allow I to make be the opening of a very important chapter in the history of the relation of great britain and indium and i shall ask the indulgence of the house if i take a little time not so much in dissect the contents of the papers which the house will be able to do for itself by and by as in indicate the general spirit that animate he majesty 's government here and my noble friend the governor-general in make the proposal that i shall in a moment describe i suppose like other secretary of state for indium i find my first idea be to have what they use to have in the old day -- a parliamentary committee to inquire into indian government i see that a predecessor of mine in the indium office lord randolph churchill -- he be there for too short a time -- in 1885 have very strongly conceive that idea on the whole i think there be a great deal at the present day to be say against it therefore what we have do be in concert with the government of indium first to open a chapter of constitutional reform of which i will speak in a moment and next to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the internal relation between the government of indium and all its subordinate and co-ordinate part that commission will report i believe in February or march next -- February i hope -- and that again will involve the government of indium and the indium office in whitehall in pretty laborious and careful inquiry it can not be expect -- and it ought not to be expect -- that a act pass as the organic act of 1858 be pass amidst intense excitement and most disturbing circumstance should have be in existence for half a century without disclose flaw and imperfection or that its operation would not be the better for supervision or incapable of improvement i speak of delay in these observation and unfortunately delay have not make the sky any brighter but my lord do not let we make the indian sky cloudier than it really be do not let we consider the cloud to be darker than they really be let I invite you lordship to look at the formidable difficulty that now encumber we in indium with a due sense of proportion what be the state of thing as it appear to person of authority and of ample knowledge in indium one very important and well-known friend of mine in indium say this -- the anarchist be few but on the other hand they be apparently prepare to go any length and to run any risk it must also be bear in mind that the ordinary man or lad in indium have not too much courage and that the loyal be terrorise by the ruthless extremist it be a curious incident that on the very day before the attempt to assassinate sir andrew fraser be make he have a reception in the college where the would-be assassin be educate and he reception be of the most enthusiastic and spontaneous kind i only mention that to show the curious and subtle atmosphere in which thing now be at calcutta i will not dwell on that because although i have a mass of material this be not the occasion for develop it i will only add this from a correspondent of great authority -- there be no fear of anything in the nature of a rise but if murder continue a general panic may arise and greatly increase the danger of the situation we can not hope that any machinery will completely stop outrage at once we must be prepare to meet they there be grow indication that the native population itself be alarmed and that we shall have the strong support of native public opinion the view of important person in the government of indium be that in substance the position of we government in indium be as sound and as well-founded as it have ever be i shall be ask have not the government of indium be oblige to pass a measure introduce pretty drastic machinery that be quite true and i for one have no fault whatever to find with they for introduce such machinery and for take that step on the contrary my lord i wholly approve and i share of course to the full the responsibility for it i understand that i be expose to some obloquy on this account -- i be charge with inconsistency that be a matter on which i be very well able to take care of myself and i should be ashamed to detain you lordship for one single moment in argue about it quite early after my come to the indium office pressure be put on I to repeal the regulation of 1818 under which man be now be summarily detain without trial and without charge and without intention to try or to charge that of course be a tremendous power to place in the hand of a executive government but i say to myself then and i say now that i decline to take out of the hand of the government of indium any weapon that they have get in circumstance so formidable so obscure and so impenetrable as be the circumstance that surround british government in indium there be two path of folly in these matter one be to regard all indian matter indian procedure and indian policy as if it be great britain or ireland and to insist that all the robe and apparel that suit great britain or ireland must necessarily suit indium the other be to think that all you have get to do be what i see suggest to my amazement in english print -- to blow a certain number of man from gun and then you business will be do either of these path of folly lead to as great disaster as the other i would like to say this about the summary jurisdiction bill -- i have no illusion whatever i do not ignore and i do not believe that lord lansdowne opposite or anyone else can ignore the frightful risk involve in transfer in any form or degree what should be the ordinary power under the law to arbitrary personal discretion i be alive too to the temptation under summary procedure of various kind to the danger of mistake a headstrong exercise of force for energy again i do not for a instant forget and i hope those who so loudly applaud legislation of this kind do not forget the tremendous price that you pay for all operation of this sort in the reaction and the excitement that they provoke if there be a man who know all these drawback i think i be he but there be situation in which a responsible government be compel to run these risk and to pay this possible price however high it may appear to be it be like war a hateful thing from which however some of the most ardent lover of peace and some of those ruler of the world whose name the most ardent lover of peace most honor and revere -- it be one of the thing from which these man have not shrink the only question for we be whether there be such a situation in indium to-day as to warrant the passing of the act the other day and to justify resort to the regulation of 1818 i can not imagine anybody read the speech -- especially the unexaggerated remark of the viceroy -- and the list of crime perpetrate and attempt that be read out last Friday in calcutta -- i can not imagine that anybody reading that list and think what they stand for would doubt for a single moment that summary procedure of some kind or another be justified and call for i discern a tendency to criticise this legislation on grounds that strike I as extraordinary after all it be not we fault that we have have to bring in this measure you must protect the life of you officer you must protect peaceful and harmless people both indian and european from the blood-stained havoc of anarchic conspiracy we deplore the necessity but we be bind to face the fact i myself recognize this necessity with infinite regret and with something perhaps rather deeper than regret but it be not the government either here or in indium who be the author of this necessity and i should not at all mind if it be not impertinent and unbecoming in I to say so stand up in another place and say exactly what i say here that i approve of these proceedings and will do my best to support the government of indium now a very important question arise for which i would for a moment ask the close attention of you lordship because i be sure that both here and elsewhere it will be argue that the necessity and the fact that cause the necessity of bring forward strong repressive machinery should arrest we policy of reform that have be state and i dare say many people will assent to it well the government of indium and myself have from the very first beginning of this unsettled state of thing never vary in we determination to persevere in the policy of reform i put two plain question to you lordship i be sick of all the retrograde commonplace about the weakness of concession to violence and so on persevere in we plan of reform be not a concession to violence reform that we have publicly announce adopt and work out for more than two year -- how be it a concession to violence to persist in those reform it be simply stand to you gun a number of gentleman of whom i wish to speak with all respect address a very courteous letter to I the other day that appear in the public print exhort I to remember that oriental country inevitably and invariably interpret kindness as fear i do not believe it the founder of christianity arise in a oriental country and when i be tell that oriental always mistake kindness for fear i must repeat that i do not believe it any more than i believe the stranger say of carlyle that after all the fundamental question between any two human being be -- can i kill thee or canst thou kill I i do not agree that any organised society have ever subsist upon either of those principle or that brutality be always present as a fundamental postulate in the relation between ruler and rule my first question be this there be alternative course open to we we can either withdraw we reform or we can persevere in they which would be the more flagrant sign of weakness -- to go steadily on with you policy of reform in spite of bomb or to let yourself openly be force by bomb and murder club to drop you policy my second question be -- who would be best please if i be to announce to you lordship that the government have determine to drop the reform why it be notorious that those who would be best please would be the extremist and irreconcilable just because they know well that for we to do anything to soften estrangement and appease alienation between the european and native population would be the very best way that could be adopt to deprive they of fuel for they sinister and mischievous design i hope you lordship will agree in that and i should like to add one reason which i be sure will weigh very much with you i do not know whether you lordship have read the speech make last Friday by sir norman baker the new lieutenant-governor of bengal in the council at calcutta deal with the point that i be endeavor to present in a speech of great power and force he say that these repressive measure do not represent even the major part of the true policy deal with the situation the greater task he say be to adjust the machinery of government so that they indian fellow-subject might be allot part which a self-respecting people could fill and that when the constitutional reform be announce as they would be shortly he believe that the task of restore order would be on the road to accomplishment for a man hold such a position to make such a statement at that moment be all the corroboration that we need for persist in we policy of reform i have talk with indian expert of all kind concern reform i admit that some have shake they head they do not like reform very warmly but when i have ask shall we stand still then there be not one of those experienced man who have not say that be quite impossible whatever else we do we can not stand still i should not be surprise if there be here some who say : you ought to have some very strong machinery for put down a free press a long time ago a great indian authority sir thoma munro use language which i will venture to quote not merely for the purpose of this afternoon 's exposition but in order that everybody who listen and read may feel the formidable difficulty that we predecessor have overcome and that we in we turn mean to try to overcome sir thoma munro say -- we be try a experiment never yet try in the world -- maintain a foreign dominion by means of a native army and teaching that army through a free press that they ought to expel we and deliver they country he go on to say -- a tremendous revolution may overtake we originate in a free press i recognize to the full the enormous force of a declaration of that kind but let we look at it as practical man who have get to deal with the government of the country suppose you abolish freedom of the press or suspend it that will not end the business you will have to shut up school and college for what would be the use of suppress newspaper if you do not shut the school and college nor will that be all you will have to stop the printing of unlicensed book the possession of a copy of milton or burke or macaulay or of bright 's speech and all that flash array of writer and orator who be the glory of we grand we noble english tongue -- the possession of one of these book will on this peculiar and puerile notion of government be like the possession of a bomb and we shall have to direct the passing of a explosive book act all this and its various sequel and complement make a policy if you please but after such a policy have produce a mute sullen muzzled lifeless indium we could hardly call it as we do now the brightest jewel in the imperial crown no english parliament will ever permit such a thing i do not think i need go through all the contents of the dispatch of the governor-general and my reply contain the plan of he majesty 's government which will be in you lordship ' hand very shortly i think you lordship will find in they a well-guarded expansion of principle that be recognize in 1861 and be still more directly and closely connect with we now by the action of lord lansdowne in 1892 i have he word and they be really as true a key to the papers in we hand as they be to the policy of the noble marquess at that date he say -- we hope however that we have succeed in give to we proposal a form sufficiently definite to secure a satisfactory advance in the representation of the people in we legislative council and to give effect to the principle of selection as far as possible on the advice of such section of the community as be likely to be capable of assist we in that manner then you will find that another governor-general in council in indium whom i greatly rejoice to see still among we my noble friend the marquess of ripon say in 1882 -- it be not primarily with a view to the improvement of administration that this measure be put forward it be chiefly desirable as a instrument of political and popular education the doctrine announce by the noble marquess opposite and by my noble friend be the standpoint from which we approach the situation and frame we proposal i will not trouble the house by go through the history of the course of the proceedings -- that will be find in the papers i believe the house will be satisfied just as i be satisfy with the candor and patience that have be bestow on the preparation of the scheme in indium and i hope i may add it have be treat with equal patience and candor here and the end of it be that though some point of difference arise though the government of indium agree to drop certain point of they scheme -- the advisory council for example -- on the whole there be remarkable agreement between the government of indium and myself as to the best way of deal with these proceedings as to legislative council i will enumerate the point very shortly and though i be afraid it may be tedious i hope you lordship will not find the tedium unbearable because after all what you be begin to consider to-day be the turn over of a fresh leaf in the history of british responsibility to indium there be only a handful of distinguished member of this house who understand the detail of indian administration but i will explain they as shortly as i can this be a list of the power which we shall have to acquire from parliament when we bring in a bill i may say that we do not propose to bring in a bill this session that would be idle i propose to bring in a bill next year this be the first power we shall come to parliament for at present the maximum and minimum number of legislative council be fix by statute we shall come to parliament to authorise a increase in the number of those council both the viceroy 's council and the provincial council secondly the member be now nominate by the head of the government either the viceroy or the lieutenant-governor no election take place in the strict sense of the term the nearest approach to it be the nomination by the viceroy upon the recommendation of a majority of voter of certain public body we do not propose to ask parliament to abolish nomination we do propose to ask parliament in a very definite way to introduce election work alongside of nomination with a view to the aim admit in all previous scheme include that of the noble marquess opposite -- the due representation of the different class of the community third the indian council act of 1892 forbid -- and this be no doubt a most important prohibition -- either resolution or division of the council in financial discussion we shall ask parliament to repeal this prohibition fourth we shall propose to invest legislative council with power to discuss matter of public and general importance and to pass recommendation or resolution to the indian government that government will deal with they as carefully or as carelessly as they think fit -- just as a government do here fifth to extend the power that at present exist to appoint a member of the council to preside sixth bombay and madra have now executive council numbering two i propose to ask parliament to double the number of ordinary member seventh the lieutenant-governor have no executive council we shall ask parliament to sanction the creation of such council consist of not more than two ordinary member and to define the power of the lieutenant-governor to overrule he council i be perfectly sure there may be difference of opinion as to these proposal i only want you lordship to believe that they have be well think out and that they be accept by the governor-general in council there be one point of extreme importance which no doubt though it may not be over diplomatic for I to say so at this stage will create some controversy i mean the matter of the official majority the house know what a official majority be it be a device by which the governor-general or the governor of bombay or madra may secure a majority in he legislative council by means of official and nominee and the official of course for very good reason just like a cabinet minister or a under-secretary whatever the man 's private opinion may be would still vote for the best of reason and i be bind to think with perfect wisdom with the government but anybody can see how directly how palpably how injuriously a arrangement of this kind tend to weaken and i think i may say even to deaden the sense both of trust and responsibility in the non-official member of these council anybody can see how the system tend to throw the non-official member into a attitude of peevish sulky permanent opposition and therefore have a injurious effect on the mind and character of member of these legislative council i know it will be say -- i will not weary the house by argue it but i only desire to meet at once the objection that will be take -- that these council will if you take away the safeguard of the official majority pass any number of wild-cat bill the answer to that be that the head of the government can veto the wild-cat bill the governor-general can withhold he assent and the withholding of the assent of the governor-general be no defunct power only the other day since i have be at the indium office the governor-general disallow a bill pass by a local government which i need not name with the most advantageous effect i be quite convinced that if that local government have have a unofficial majority the bill would never have be pass and the governor-general would not have have to refuse he assent but so he do and so he would if these gentleman whose number we propose to increase and whose power we propose to widen choose to pass wild-cat bill and it must be remember that the range of subject within the sphere of provincial legislative council be rigorously limit by statutory exclusion i will not labor the point now anybody who care in a short compass can grasp the argument of which we shall hear a great deal in paragraph 17 to 20 of my reply to the government of indium in the papers that will speedily be in you lordship ' hand there be one proviso in this matter of the official majority in which you lordship may perhaps find a surprise we be not prepare to divest the governor-general in he council of a official majority in the provincial council we propose to dispense with it but in the viceroy 's legislative council we propose to adhere to it only let I say that here we may seem to lag a stage behind the government of indium themselves -- so little violent be we -- because that government say in they despatch -- on all ordinary occasion we be ready to dispense with a official majority in the imperial legislative council and to rely on the public spirit of non-official member to enable we to carry on the ordinary work of legislation my lord that be what we propose to do in the provincial council but in the imperial council we consider a official majority essential it may be say that this be a most flagrant logical inconsistency so it would be on one condition if i be attempt to set up a parliamentary system in indium or if it could be say that this chapter of reform lead directly or necessarily up to the establishment of a parliamentary system in indium i for one would have nothing at all to do with it i do not believe -- it be not of very great consequence what i believe because the fulfilment of my vaticination could not come off very soon -- in spite of the attempt in oriental country at this moment interesting attempt to which we all wish well to set up some sort of parliamentary system -- it be no ambition of mine at all event to have any share in begin that operation in indium if my existence either officially or corporeally be prolonged twenty time longer than either of they be likely to be a parliamentary system in indium be not at all the goal to which i would for one moment aspire one point more it be the question of a indian member on the viceroy 's executive council the absence of a indian member from the viceroy 's executive council can no longer i think be defend there be no legal obstacle or statutory exclusion the secretary of state can to-morrow if he like if there be a vacancy on the viceroy 's council recommend he majesty to appoint a indian member all i want to say be that if during my tenure of office there should be a vacancy on the viceroy 's executive council i should feel it a duty to tender my advice to the king that a indian member should be appoint if it be on my own authority only i might hesitate to take that step because i be not very fond of innovation in dark and obscure ground but here i have the absolute and the zealous approval and concurrence of lord minto himself it be at lord minto 's special instigation that i begin to think seriously of this step anyhow this be how it stand that you have at this moment a secretary of state and a viceroy who both concur in such a recommendation i suppose -- if i may be allow to give a personal turn to these matter -- that lord minto and i have have as different experience of life and the world as possible and we belong i daresay to different school of national politics because lord minto be appoint by the party opposite it be a rather remarkable thing that two man differ in this way in political antecedent should agree in this proposal we need not discuss what particular portfolio should be assign to a indian member that will be settle by the viceroy on the merit of the individual the great object the main object be that the merit of individual be to be consider and to be decisive irrespective and independent of race and color we be not altogether without experience because a year ago or somewhat more it be my good fortune to be able to appoint two indian gentleman to the council of indium sit at the indian office many apprehension reach I as to what might happen so far at all event those apprehension have be utterly dissipate the concord between the two indian member of the council and they colleague have be unbroken they work have be excellent and you will readily believe I when i say that the advantage to I of be able to ask one of these two gentleman to come and tell I something about a indian question from a indian point of view be enormous i find in it a chance of get the indian angle of vision and i feel sometimes as if i be actually in the street of calcutta i do not say there be not some argument on the other side but this at all event must be common sense -- for the governor-general and the european member of he council to have at they side a man who know the country well who belong to the country and who can give he the point of view of a indian surely my lord that can not but prove a enormous advantage let I say further on the judicial bench in indium everybody recognize the enormous service that it be to have indian member of abundant learning and who add to that abundant learn a complete knowledge of the condition and life of the country i propose at once if parliament agree to acquire power to double the executive council in bombay and madra and to appoint at least one indian member in each of those case as well as in the governor-general 's council nor as the papers will show shall i be backward in advance towards a similar step as occasion may require in respect of at least four of the major province i wish that this chapter have be open at a more fortunate moment : but as i say when i rise i repeat -- do not let we for a moment take too gloomy a view there be not the slightest occasion none of those who be responsible take gloomy view they know the difficulty they be prepare to grapple with they they will do they best to keep down mutinous opposition they hope to attract that good will which must after all be the real foundation of we prosperity and strength in indium we believe that this admission of the indian to a larger and more direct share in the government of they country and in all the affair of they country without for a moment take from the central power its authority will fortify the foundation of we position it will require great steadiness constant pursuit of the same object and the maintenance of we authority which will be all the more effective if we have along with we authority the aid and assistance in responsible circumstance of the indian themselves military strength material strength we have in abundance what we still want to acquire be moral strength -- moral strength in guide and control the people of indium in the course on which time be launch they i should like to read a few line from a great orator about indium it be a speech deliver by mr bright in 1858 when the government of indium bill be in another place mr bright say -- we do not know how to leave indium and therefore let we see if we know how to govern it let we abandon all that system of calumny against native of indium which have lately prevail have that people not be docile the most governable race in the world how could you have maintain you power there for 100 year be they not industrious be they not intelligent be they not upon the evidence of the most distinguished man the indian service ever produce endowed with many quality which make they respect by all englishman who mix with they i would not permit any man in my presence without rebuke to indulge in the calumny and expression of contempt which i have recently hear pour forth without measure upon the whole population of indium the people of indium do not like we but they would scarcely know where to turn if we leave they they be sheep literally without a shepherd however that may be we at least at westminster here have no choice and no option as a illustrious member of this house write -- we find a society in a state of decomposition and we have undertake the serious and stupendous process of reconstruct it macaulay for it be he say -- indium now be like europe in the fifth century yes a stupendous process indeed the process have go on with marvellous success and if we all accord to we various light be true to we color that process will go on whatever be say i for one -- though i be not what be commonly call a imperialist -- so far from deny i most emphatically affirm that for we to preside over this transition from the fifth european century in some part in slow uneven stage up to the twentieth -- so that you have before you all the century at once as it be -- for we to preside over that and to be the guide of people in that condition be if conduct with humanity and sympathy with wisdom with political courage not only a human duty but what have be often and most truly call one of the most glorious task ever confide to any powerful state in the history of civilised mankind vi hindu and mahometan -lrb- at the indium office January 1909 -rrb- -lrb- a deputation of the london branch of the all-indian moslem league wait upon the secretary of state in order to represent to he the view of the mussulman of indium on the project indian reform -rrb- i be delighted to meet you to-day because i have always feel in my political experience now pretty long that it be when face answer to face that you come best to point of controversial issue i have listen to the able speech of my friend mr ameer alus and to the speech that follow with close attention not merely for the sake of the argument upon the special point raise but because the underlie feeling and the animate spirit of the two speech be full of encouragement why because instead of any hostile attitude to we reform as a whole i find that you welcome they cordially and with gratitude i can not say with what satisfaction i receive that announcement if you will allow I i will before i come to the special point say a few word upon the general position it be only five week i think since we scheme be launch and i be bind to say that at the end of those five week the position may fairly be describe as hopeful and promising i do not think that the millennium will come in five more week nor in fifty week but i do say that for a scheme of so wide a scope to be receive as this scheme have be receive be a highly encouraging sign it do not follow that because we have launch we ship with a slant of fair wind this mean the same thing as get into harbor there be plenty of difficult point that we have get to settle but when i try from my conning-tower in this office to read the sign in the political sky i be full of confidence the great thing be that in every party both in indium and at home -- in every party and every section and every group -- there be a recognition of the magnitude and the gravity of the enterprise on which we have embark i study very closely the proceedings at madra and the proceedings at amritsar and in able speech make in both those place i find a truly political spirit in the right sense of the word -- in the sense of perspective and proportion -- which i sometimes wish could be imitate by some of my political friend nearer home i mean that issue important enough but upon which there be some difference be put aside -- for the time only if you like but still put aside -- in face of the magnitude of the issue that we present to you in these reform on Monday in _ the time _ newspaper there be a long and most interesting communication from bombay write i believe by a gentleman of very wide indian knowledge and level-headed humor what do he say he take account of the general position as he find it in indium shortly after my despatch arrive i might have dwell he say upon the fact that i have not meet a single official who do not admit that some change which should gratify indian longing be necessary and i might have expatiate upon the abound evidence that lord morley 's despatch and speech have unquestionably ease a tension which have become exceedingly alarming that be a most important thing and i believe parliament have fully recognize it we can not fold we arm and say that thing be to go on as they do before and i rejoice to see what this gentleman say he be talk of official and i always feel from the beginning that if we do not succeed in carry with we the goodwill of that powerful service there would be reason for suspect that we be wrong upon the merit and even if we be not wrong on the merit there would be reason for apprehend formidable difficulty i have myself complete confidence in they i see in some journal of my own party suspicion throw upon the loyalty of that service to he majesty 's government of the day it be absurd to think anything of the kind if we policy and we proposal receive the approval of parliament and the approval of official such as those speak of in _ the time _ the other day i be perfectly sure there will be no more want of goodwill and zeal on the part of the indian civil service than there would be in the officer of he majesty 's fleet or he majesty 's army it would be just the same i should like to read another passage from _ the time _ letter : -- it would probably be incorrect to say that the bulk of the civil service in the bombay presidency be gravely apprehensive most of they be not unnaturally anxious -- i agree it be perfectly natural that they should be anxious -- but the main official in whose judgment most confidence can be place regard the future with the buoyant hopefulness without which a englishman in indium be lose indeed all that be reassure and no sign nor whisper reach I that any responsible man or any responsible section or creed either in indium or here have any desire whatever to wreck we scheme and let I go further statesman abroad show themselves capable of reflection be watch we with interest and wish we well take the remarkable utterance of president roosevelt the other day at washington and if we turn from washington to eastern europe i know very well that any injustice any suspicion that we be capable of be unjust to mahomedan in indium would certainly provoke a severe and injurious reaction in constantinople i be alive to all these thing mr ameer alus say he be sure the secretary of state would mete out just and equitable treatment to all interest if they view be fairly lay before he he do I no more than justice the government be entirely zealous and in earnest act in thorough good faith in the desire to press forward these proposal i may tell you that we bill be now quite ready i shall introduce it at the first minute after the address be over and when it reach the common it will be press forward with all the force and resolution that parliamentary condition permit these be not mere pious opinion or academic reform they be proposal that be to take parliamentary shape at the earliest possible moment and after take parliamentary shape no time will i know be lose in indium in bring they as rapidly as possible into practical operation now the first point mr ameer alus make be upon the unfairness to the member of the mahomedan community cause by reckon in the hindu census a large multitude of man who be not entitle to be there i submit that it be not very easy -- and i have go into the question very carefully -- to divide these lower caste and to classify they statistician would be charge with put too many into either one or the other division wherever you choose to draw the line i know the force of the argument and be willing to attach to it whatever weight it deserve i wish some of my friend in this country would study the figure of what be call the lower caste because they would then see the enormous difficulty and absurdity of apply to india the same principle that be excellent guide to we western who have be breed on the pure milk of the benthamite word -- one man one vote and every man a vote that dream by the way be not quite realize even in this country but the idea of insist on a principle of that sort be irrational to anybody who reflect on this multiplicity and variety of race and caste then there be the question of the joint electorate -- what be call the mixed electoral college i be very glad to read this paragraph in the paper that you be good enough to send to I you recognize the very principle that be at the back of we mind when we come to the conclusion about mixed electoral college you say : -- in common with other well-wisher of indium the committee look forward to a time when the development of a true spirit of compromise or the fusion of the race may make principle indicate by he lordship capable of practical application without sacrifice the interest of any of the nationality or give political ascendency to one to the disadvantage of the other but the committee venture to think that however ready the country may be for constitutional reform the interest of the two great community of indium must be consider and deal with separately therefore to begin with the difference between we in principle about the joint electorate be only this : we be guilty of nothing worse than that we be premature in the view of these gentleman -- we be impatient idealist you say to I it be very fine we hope it will all come true but you be premature we must wait still though premature i observe that you own suggestion in one of those papers adopt and accept the principle of the scheme outline in we despatch it be quite true to say oh but you be vague in you despatch yes a despatch be not a bill a minister write a despatch do not put in all the clause and section and subsection and schedule it be the business of a minister compose a despatch like mine of November 27 1908 to indicate only general line -- general enough to make the substance and body of the scheme intelligible but still general i should like to say a word about the despatch it be constantly assume that in the despatch we prescribe and order the introduction of the joint electoral college if any of you will be good enough to look at the word you will find that no language of that sort -- no law of the mede and persian -- be to be find in it if you refer to paragraph 12 you will see that we language be this : -- i suggest for you consideration that the object in view might be better secure at any rate in the more advanced province in indium by a modification of the system of popular electorate found on the principle of electoral college you see it be merely a suggestion throw out for the government of indium not a direction of the mede and persian stamp you say that for the purpose of elect member to the provincial council electoral college should be constitute on line suggest by he lordship compose exclusively of mahomedan whose number and mode of group should be fix by executive authority this come within the principle of my despatch and we shall see -- i hope very speedily -- whether the government of indium discover objection to its practicability mark electoral college compose exclusively of mahomedan whose member and mode of group should be fix by executive authority -- that be a proposition which be not outside the despatch whether practicable or not it be a matter for discussion between we here and the government in indium the aim of the government and yours be identical -- that there shall be -lrb- to quote mr ameer alus 's word -rrb- adequate real and genuine mahomedan representation now where be the difference between we the machinery we commend you do not think possible as i have tell you the language of the despatch do not insist upon a mixed electoral college it would be no departure in substance from the purpose of we suggestion that there should be a separate mahomedan electorate -- a electorate exclusively mahomedan and in view of the wide and remote distance and difficulty of organization in consequence of those distance in the area constitute a large province i be not sure that this be not one of those case where election by two stage would not be convenient and so there might be a separate electoral college exclusively mahomedan that be i take it in accordance with you own proposal there be various method by which it could be do in the first place a election exclusively mahomedan might be direct into the legislative council to this it may be say that it would be impossible by reason of distance in the second place you could have a election by separate community to a local board and the local board should be the electoral college the mahomedan separate themselves from the other member of the board for that purpose thirdly the member of the local board the community be separate in the same way could return a member for the electoral college fourthly you might have a direct election to a electoral college by the community and this electoral college would return a representative to the legislative council these you see be four different expedient which well deserve consideration for attain we end i go to the next point the apprehension lest if we base we system on numerical strength alone a great injustice would be do to you community of course we all consider that from the viceroy downward whether you apprehension be well found or not it be the business of those who call themselves statesman to take those apprehension into account and to do the best we can in set up a work system to allay and meet such apprehension if you take numerical strength as you basis in the punjab and eastern bengal mahomedan be in a decisive majority in the punjab the moslem population be 53 per cent to 38 per cent hindu in eastern bengal 58 per cent be moslem and 37 per cent be hindu therefore in those two province on the numerical basis alone the mahomedan will secure sufficient representation in madras on the other hand the hindu be 89 per cent against 6 per cent of moslem and therefore number would give no adequate representation to moslem opinion in bombay the moslem be in the ratio of 3-3\/4 to 14 million -- 20 per cent to 77 per cent the condition be very complex in bombay and i need not labor the detail of this complexity i be incline to agree with those who think that it might be leave to the local government to take other element into view require or suggest by local condition come to the united province there the moslem be 6-3\/4 million to 40-3\/4 hindu -- 14 per cent to 85 per cent this ratio of numerical strength no more represent the proportion in the element of weight and importance than in eastern bengal do the hindu ratio of 37 per cent to 58 per cent of moslem you may set off each of those two case against the other then there be the great province of bengal where the moslem be one-quarter of the hindu -- 9 million to 39 million -- 18 per cent to 77 per cent we all see then that the problem present extraordinary difficulty how be you go in a case like the united province for example to secure that adequate and substantial representation which it be the interest and the desire of the government for its own sake to secure no fair-minded moslem would deny in eastern bengal any more than a fair-minded non-moslem would deny it in the united province that there be no easy solution you see gentleman i do not despair of find a fair-minded man in a controversy of this kind from information that reach I i do not at all despair of meeting fair-minded critic of both community in spite of the sharp antagonism that exist on many matter between they but whatever may be the case with mahomedan and hindu there be one body of man who be bind to keep a fair mind and that be the government the government be bind whatever you may do among yourselve strictly and i will even say sternly to insist on overcome all obstacle in a spirit of absolute equity now what be the object of the government it be that the legislative council should represent truly and effectively with a reasonable approach to the balance of real social force the wish and need of the community themselves that be the object of the government and in face of a great problem of that kind algebra arithmetic geometry logic -- none of these thing will do you business for you you have to look at it widely and away from those science excellent in they place but not of much service when you be solve awkward political riddle i think if you allow some method of leave to a local authority the power of add to the number of representative from the mahomedan community or the hindu community as the case may be that might be a possible and prudent way of get through this embarrassment let we all be clear of one thing namely -- and i think of this when i hear one or two observation that fall from mr ameer alus -- that no general proposition can be wisely base on the possession by either community either of superior civil quality or superior personal claim if you begin to introduce that element you perceive the peril to that peace and mutual goodwill which we hope to emerge by-and-by though it may take longer than some think i repeat that i see no harm from the point of view of a practical work compromise in the principle that population or numerical strength should be the main factor in determine how many representative should sit for this or the other community but modify influence may be both wisely and equitably take into account in allot the number of such representative as regard indian member on the executive council if you will allow I to say so i think it be dubious tactic in you to bring that question forward we be tell by those who object for instance to my recommend to the crown a indian member of the viceroy 's executive -- that it will never do that if you choose a man of one community the other will demand a second the executive council in all -- this will not be in the bill -- consist of six member suppose there be to be two vacancy and i be to recommend to the crown the appointment of one mahomedan and one hindu the effect would be that of the six gentleman one-third would be non-english you may think that all right but it would be a decidedly serious step suppose you say you will bring in a bill then for the purpose of appoint a extra member always to be a indian that be much more easily say than do i be talk perfectly plainly you would not get such a bill i want to talk even more plainly i want to say that reference to the hindu community or the mahomedan community in respect to the position of the viceroy 's executive be entirely wide of the mark in the view i know both of the viceroy and of myself if as i have already say i expect it may be my duty by-and-by to recommend to the crown the name of a indian member it will not be solely for the sake of place on the viceroy 's executive council a indian member simply as either a hindu or a mahomedan decidedly we be of opinion that the governor-general in council will be all the more likely to transact business wisely if he have a responsible indian adviser at he elbow but the principle in make such a recommendation to the crown would be to remove the apparent disability in practice -- for there be no disability in law -- of a indian hold a certain appointment because he be a indian that be a principle we do not accept and the principle i should go upon -- and i know lord minto would say exactly the same -- be the desirability of demonstrate that we hold to the famous promise make in the proclamation of queen victorium in 1858 that if a man be fully qualify in prove ability and character to fill a certain post he shall not be shut out by race or religious faith there be a very great deal more to be say on this most important subject but to-day i need only tell you -- which i do with all respect without complain of what you have say and without deny that in practical usage some day there may be means of alternation for meet you difficulty -- i see no chance whatever of we be able to comply with you present request i have endeavor to meet you as fairly as i possibly could i assure you again we be act in earnest with zeal and entire good faith and any suggestion that any member of the government either in this office or the government of indium have any prejudice whatever against mahomedan for the purpose of political administration in indium be one of the idlest and most wicked misapprehension that could possibly enter into the political mind i be greatly encourage by have meet you i be sure that you speak in the name of important body of you own countryman and of you own community i be sure that you be go to look at we proposal in a fair and reasonable spirit and give we credit for a desire to do the best that we possibly can in the interest of all the community in indium include also the interest of the british government i can only tell you further that if this action of ours fail miscarry and be wreck it will be a considerable time before another opportunity occur you will never again -- i do not care whether the time be long or be short -- you will never again have the combination of a secretary of state and a viceroy who be more thoroughly in earnest in they desire to improve indian government and to do full justice to every element of the indian population vii second reading of indian council bill -lrb- house of lord February 23 1909 -rrb- my lord i invite the house to take to-day the first definite and operative step in carry out the policy that i have the honor of describe to you lordship just before christmas and that have occupy the active consideration both of the home government and of the government of indium for very nearly three year the statement be await in indium with a expectancy that with time become impatience and it be receive in indium -- and that after all be the point to which i look with the most anxiety -- with intense interest and attention and various degree of approval from warm enthusiasm to cool assent and acquiescence a few day after the arrival of my despatch a deputation wait upon the viceroy unique in its comprehensive character both hindu and mahomedan be represent and they wait upon the viceroy to offer warm expression of gratitude for the scheme that be unfold before they a few day later at madras the congress meet they too express they thanks to the home government and to the government of indium the moslem league meet at amritsar they be warm in they approval of the policy which they take to be foreshadow in the despatch though they find fault with the defect they think they have discover in the scheme and implore the government both in indium and here to remedy those defect so far as i know -- and i do beg you lordship to note these detail of the reception of we policy in indium -- there have be no sign in any quarter save in the irreconcilable camp of anything like organise hostile opinion among either indian or anglo-indian the indian civil service i will speak of very shortly i will pass they by for the moment lord lansdowne say truly the other night that when i speak at the end of December i use the word formidable and obscure as describe the situation and he desire to know whether i think the situation be still obscure and formidable i will not abandon the word but i think the situation be less formidable and less obscure neither repression on the one hand nor reform on the other could possibly be expect to cut the root of anarchical crime in a few week but with unfaltering repression on the one hand and vigor and good faith in reform on the other we see solid reason to hope that we shall weaken even if we can not destroy those baleful force there be i take it three class of people that we have to consider in deal with a scheme of this kind there be the extremist who nurse fantastic dream that some day they will drive we out of indium in this group there be academic extremist and physical force extremist and i have see it state on a certain authority -- it can not be more than a guess -- that they do not number whether academic or physical force extremist more than one-tenth or even three per cent of what be call the educate class in indium the second group nourish no hope of this sort they hope for autonomy or self-government of the colonial species and pattern the third section in this classification ask for no more than to be admit to co-operation in we administration and to find a free and effective voice in express the interest and need of they people i believe the effect of the reform have be be be and will be to draw the second class who hope for colonial autonomy into the rank of the third class who will be content with admission to a fair and workable co-operation a correspondent write to I the other day and say : -- we seem to have catch many discontented people on the rebound and to have give they a excuse for a loyalty which they have badly want in spite of all this it be a difficult and critical situation still by almost universal admission it have lose the tension that strain indium two or three month ago and public feeling be tranquillise certainly beyond any expectation that either i or the viceroy venture to entertain the atmosphere have change from dark and sullen to hopeful and i be sure you lordship will allow I to be equally confident that nothing will be do at westminster to overcloud that promising sky the noble marquess the other day say -- and i be delighted to hear it -- that he at all event would give we with all the reservation that examination of the scheme might demand from he a whole-hearted support here and he best encouragement to the man in indium i accept that and i lean upon it because if anything be do at westminster either by delay or otherwise to show a breach in what ought to be the substantial unity of parliamentary opinion in face of the indian situation it would be a marked disaster i would venture on the point of delay to say this you lordship will not suspect I of have any desire to hurry the bill but i remember that when lord cross bring in the bill of 1892 lord kimberley so well know and so popular in this house use language which i venture to borrow from he and to press upon you lordship to-day -- i think it almost dangerous to leave a subject of this kind hang up to be perpetually discuss by all manner of person and have once allow that at all event some amendment be necessary in regard to the mode of constitute the legislative council it be incumbent upon the government and parliament to pass the bill which they may think expedient as speedily as possible into law consideration of social order and social urgency in indium make that just as useful to be remembered to-day as it be useful then the noble marquess the other day in a very courteous manner administer to I a exhortation and a admonition -- i have almost say a lecture -- as to the propriety of defer to the man on the spot and the danger of quarrel with the man on the spot i listen with become meekness and humility but then it occur to I that the language of the noble marquess be not original those noble lord who share the bench with he give deep murmur of approval to the homily that be administer to I they forget that they once have a man on the spot the man then be that eminent and distinguished personage whom i may be allow to congratulate upon he restoration to health and to he place in this assembly he say this which the noble marquess will see be a fair original for he own little discourse it be say after the noble lord have throw up the rein -- what i wish to say to high officer of state and member of government be this as far as you can trust the man on the spot do not weary or fret or nag he with you superior wisdom they claim no immunity from error of opinion or judgment but they error be nothing compare with yours the remonstrance therefore of lord curzon address to the noble lord sit near he be identical with the warning which i have lay to heart from the noble marquess the house will pardon I if for a moment i dwell upon what by application be a innuendo convey in the admonition of the noble marquess i have a suspicion that he consider he advice be need he express the hope that all who be responsible for administration in indium would have all the power for which they have a right to ask upon that i can -- though i be half reluctant to do it -- completely clear my character in December last shortly before i address you lordship lord minto have observe there be some talk of my interference with he and he council telegraph these word and desire that i should make use of they whenever i think fit -- i hope you will say from I in as strong language as you may choose to use that in all we dealings with sedition i could not be more strongly support than i have be by you the question of the control of indian administration by the secretary of state mix up as it be with the old difficulty of centralisation we may very possibly look at from different point of view but that have nothing to do with the support the secretary of state give to the viceroy and which you have give to I in a time of great difficulty and for which i shall always be warmly grateful the marquess of lansdowne : i think the noble viscount will see from the report of my speech that the part he have quote have reference to measure of repression and that what i say be that justice should be prompt that it be undesirable that there should be appeal from one court to another or from provincial government to the government in calcutta or from the government at calcutta to the secretary of state for indium i do not mean to imply merely the viceroy but the man responsible for local government viscount morley : i do not think that when the noble marquess refer to the report of he speech he will find i have misrepresent he at all event he will i do believe gladly agree that in deal with sedition i have on the whole give all the support the government of indium or anybody else concern have a right to ask for i will now say a word about the indian civil service three year ago when we begin these operation i feel that a vital condition of success be that we should carry the indian civil service with we and that if we do not do this we should fail but human nature be what it be and temperament vary as they do it be natural to expect a certain amount of criticism minute criticism and observation i have have that but will content myself with one quotation from the lieutenant-governor of bengal well know to the noble lord opposite what do he say address the legislative council a few week ago -- i hold that a solemn duty rest upon the officer of government in all branch and more particularly upon the officer of the civil service so to comport themselves in the inception and working of the new measure as to make the task of the people and they leader easy it be incumbent upon they loyally to accept the principle that these measure involve the surrender of some portion of the authority and control which they now exercise and some modification of the method of administration if that task be approach in a grudging or reluctant spirit we shall be sowing the seed of failure and shall forfeit we claim to receive the friendly co-operation of the representative of the people we must be prepare to support defend and carry through the administrative policy and in a certain degree even the executive act of the government in the council in much the same way as be now prescribe in regard to measure of legislation and we must further be prepare to discharge this task without the aid of a standing majority behind we we will have to resort to the more difficult art of persuasion and conciliation in the place of the easier method of autocracy this be no small demand to make on the resource of a service whose training and tradition have hitherto lead its member rather to work for the people than through the people or they representative but i be nevertheless confident that the demand will not be make in vain for more than a hundred year in the time of the company and under the rule of the crown the indian civil service have never fail to respond to whatever call have be make upon it or to adapt itself to the change environment of the time i feel no doubt that officer will be find who possess the natural gift the loyalty the imagination and the force of character which will be requisite for the conduct of the administration under the more advanced form of government to which we be about to succeed these word i commend to you lordship they breathe a fine and high spirit they admirably express the feeling of a sincere man and i do not believe anybody who be acquaint with the service doubt that this spirit so admirably express will pervade the service in the admittedly difficult task that now confront they the bill be a short one and will speak for itself i shall be brief in refer to it for in December last i make what be practically a second-reading speech i may point out that there be two rival school and that the noble lord opposite -lrb- lord curzon -rrb- may be say to represent one of they there be two rival school one of which believe that better government of indium depend on efficiency and that efficiency be in fact the main end of we rule in indium the other school while not neglect efficiency look also to what be call political concession i think i be do the noble lord no injustice in say that during he remarkable vice-royalty he do not accept the necessity for political concession but trust to efficiency i hope it will not be bad taste to say in the noble lord 's presence that you will never send to indium and you have never send to india a viceroy he superior if indeed he equal in force of mind in unsparing and remorseless industry in passionate and devoted interest in all that concern the well-being of indium with a imagination fire by the grandeur of the political problem that indium present -- you never send a man with more of all these attribute than when you send lord curzon but splendidly design as be he work from the point of view of efficiency he still leave in indium a state of thing when we look back upon it that could not be hold a satisfactory crowning of a brilliant and ambitious career i be as much for efficiency as the noble lord but i do not believe -- and this be the difference between he and myself -- that you can now have true solid endurable efficiency without what be call political concession i know the risk the late lord salisbury speak on the last indian council bill speak of the risk of apply occidental machinery in indium well we ought to have think of that before we apply occidental education we apply that and a measure of occidental machinery must follow legislative council once call into existence then it be inevitable that you would have gradually in lord salisbury 's own phrase to popularize they so as to bring they into harmony with the dominant sentiment of the people in indium the bill of 1892 admittedly contain the elective principle and we bill to-day extend that principle the noble lord -lrb- viscount cross -rrb- will remember the bill of 1892 of which he have charge in the house of common i want the house to be good enough to follow the line take by mr gladstone because i base myself on that there be a amendment move and it be go to a division but mr gladstone beg he friend not to divide because he say it be very important that we should present a substantial unity to india this be upon the question of either house consider a bill like the bill that be now on the table -- a mere skeleton of a bill if you like i see it have be call vague and sketchy it can not be anything else on the broad principle set out by mr gladstone -- it be the intention of the government -lrb- that be the conservative government -rrb- that a serious effort shall be make to consider carefully those element which india in its present condition may furnish for the introduction into the council of indium of the elective principle if that effort be seriously to be make by whom be it to be make i do not think it can be make by this house except through the medium of empower provision the best course we could take would be to commend to the authority of indium what be a clear indication of the principle on which we desire they to proceed it be not we business to devise machinery for the purpose of indian government it be we business to give to those who represent she majesty in indium ample information as to what we believe to be sound principle of government : and it be of course the function of this house to comment upon any case in which we may think they have fail to give due effect to those principle i only allude to mr gladstone 's word in order to let the house know that i be take no unusual course in leave the bulk of the work the detail of the work to the government of indium discussion therefore in parliament will necessarily not and can not turn substantially upon detail but no doubt it be desirable that the main head of the regulation rule and proclamation to be make by the government of indium under sanction of the indium office should be more or less place within the reach and knowledge of the house so far as they be complete the principle of the bill be in the bill and will be affirm if you lordship be pleased to read it a second time the committee point important as they be can well be deal with in committee the view of mr gladstone be cheerfully accept by the house of common then and i hope it will be accept by you lordship to-day there be one very important chapter in these regulation which i think now on the second reading of the bill without wait for committee i ought to say a few word to you lordship about -- i mean the mahomedan that be a part of the bill and scheme that have no doubt attract a great deal of criticism and excite a great deal of feeling in that important community we suggest to the government of indium a certain plan we do not prescribe it we do not order it but we suggest and recommend this plan for they consideration -- no more than that it be the plan of a mixed or composite electoral college in which mahomedan and hindu should pool they vote so to say the wording of the recommendation in my despatch be as i soon discover ambiguous -- a grievous defect of which i make bold to hope i be not very often in public business guilty but to the best of my belief under any construction the plan of hindu and mahomedan vote together in a mixed and composite electorate would have secure to the mahomedan elector wherever they be so mind the chance of return they own representative in they due proportion the political idea at the bottom of this recommendation which have find so little favor be that such composite action would bring the two great community more closely together and this hope of promote harmony be hold by man of high indian authority and experience who be among my adviser at the indium office but the mahomedan protest that the hindu would elect a pro-hindu upon it just as i suppose in a mixed college of say seventy-five catholic and twenty-five protestant vote together the protestant might suspect that the catholic vote for the protestant would choose what be call a romanise protestant and as a little of a protestant as they could find suppose the other way in ireland there be a expression a shoneen catholic -- that be to say a catholic who though a catholic be too friendly with english conservatism and other influence which the nationalist dislike and it might be say if there be seventy-five protestant against twenty-five catholic that the protestant when give a vote in the way of catholic representation would return shoneen i be not go to take you lordship ' time up by argue this to-day with regard to scheme of proportional representation as calvin say of another study excessive study of the apocalypse either find a man mad or make he so at any rate the government of indium doubt whether we plan would work and we have abandon it i do not think it be a bad plan but it be no use if you be make a earnest attempt in good faith at a general pacification to let parental fondness for a clause interrupt that good process by sit obstinately tight the mahomedans demand three thing i have the pleasure of receive a deputation from they and i know very well what be in they mind they demand the election of they own representative to these council in all the stage just as in cyprus where i think the mahomedans vote by themselves they have nine vote and the non-mahomedan have three or the other way about so in bohemia where the german vote alone and have they own register therefore we be not without a precedent and a parallel for the idea of a separate register secondly they want a number of seat somewhat in excess of they numerical strength those two demand we be quite ready and intend to meet in full there be a third demand that if there be a hindu on the viceroy 's executive council -- a subject on which i will venture to say something to you lordship before i sit down -- there should be two indian member on the viceroy 's council and one should be a mahomedan well as i tell they and as i now tell you lordship i see no chance whatever of meet they view in that way to go back to the point of the register some may be shock at the idea of a religious register at all a register frame on the principle of religious belief we may wish -- we do wish -- that it be otherwise we hope that time with careful and impartial statesmanship will make thing otherwise only let we not forget that the difference between mahomedanism and hinduism be not a mere difference of article of religious faith or dogma it be a difference in life in tradition in history in all the social thing as well as article of belief that constitute a community do not let we forget what make it interesting and even exciting do not let we forget that in talking of hindu and mahomedan we be deal with and be bring face to face with vast historic issue we be deal with the very mightiest force that through all the century and age have mould the fortune of great state and the destiny of countless million of mankind thought of that kind my lord be what give to indian politics and to indian work extraordinary fascination though at the same time they impose the weight of a extraordinary burden i come to the question which i think have excite certainly in this country more interest than anything else in the scheme before you -- i mean the question of a indian member on the viceroy 's executive council the noble marquess say here the other day that he hope a opportunity would be give for discuss it whether it be in order or not -- be too little verse in you lordship ' procedure to be quite sure -- but i be tell that the rule of order in this house be of a elastic description and that i shall not be trespassing beyond what be right if i introduce the point to-night i thoroughly understand lord lansdowne 's anxiety for a chance of discussion it be quite true and the house should not forget it that this question be in no way whatever touch by the bill if this bill be reject by parliament it would be a grievous disaster to peace and contentment in indium but it would not prevent the secretary of state the very next morning from advise he majesty to appoint a indian member of the viceroy 's executive council the noble marquess the other day fall into a slight error if he will forgive I for say so he say that the government of indium have use cautious and tentative word indicate that it would be premature to decide at once this question of the indian member until after further experience have be gain i think the noble marquess must have lose he way in the maze of that enormous blue-book which as he tell we cause he so much inconvenience and add so much to he excess luggage during the christmas holiday the despatch as far as i can discover be silent altogether on the topic of the indian member of the viceroy 's council and deal only with the council of bombay and madra and the propose council for the lieutenant-governorship perhaps i might be allow to remind you lordship of the act of 1833 -- certainly the most extensive and important measure of indian government between mr pitt 's famous act of 1784 and queen victorium 's assumption of the government of indium in 1858 there be nothing more important than that act it lay down in the broadest way possible the desire of parliament that there should be no difference in appoint to office in indium between one race and another and the cover despatch write by that memorable man jame mill wind up by say that -- for the future fitness be to be the criterion of eligibility i need not quote the famous paragraph in the queen 's proclamation of 1858 every member of the house who take a interest in indium know that by heart now the noble marquess say that he anxiety be that nothing shall be do to impair the efficiency of the viceroy 's council i share that anxiety with all my heart i hope the noble marquess will do I the justice to remember that in these plan i have go beyond the government of indium in resolve that a permanent official majority shall remain in the viceroy 's council lord macdonnell say the other day : -- i believe you can not find any individual native gentleman who be enjoy general confidence who would be able to give advice and assistance to the governor-general in council well for that matter it have be my lot twice to fill the not very exhilarating post of chief secretary for ireland and i do not believe i can truly say i ever meet in ireland a single individual native gentleman who enjoy general confidence and yet i receive at dublin castle most excellent and competent advice therefore i be not much impress by that argument the question be whether there be no one of the 300 million of the population of indium who be competent to be the officially-constituted adviser of the governor-general in council in the administration of indian affair you make a indian a judge of the high court and indian have even be act chief justice as to capacity who can deny that they have distinguish themselves as administrator of native state where a very full demand be make on they resource intellectual and moral it be say that the presence of a indian member would cause restraint in the language of discussion for a year and a half we have have two indian on the council of indium and we have none of we ever find the slightest restraint then there be the question what be you go to do about the hindu and the mahomedan when indian be first admit to the high court for a long time the hindu be more fit and competent than the mahomedan but now i be tell the mahomedan have they full share the same sort of operation would go on in quinquennial period in respect of the viceroy 's council opinion amongst the great anglo-indian officer now at home be divide but i know at least one not at all behind lord macdonnell in experience or mental grasp who be strongly in favor of this proposal one circumstance that can not but strike you lordship as remarkable be the comparative absence of hostile criticism of this idea by the anglo-indian press and as i be tell in calcutta society i be apprehensive at one time that it might be otherwise i should like to give a concrete illustration of my case the noble marquess opposite say the other day that there be go to be a vacancy in one of the post on the viceroy 's executive council -- that be the legal member 's time would soon be up now suppose there be in calcutta a indian lawyer of large practice and great experience in he profession -- a man of unstained professional and personal repute in close touch with european society and much respected and the actual holder of important legal office be i to say to this man -- in spite of all these excellent circumstance to you credit in spite of you undisputed fitness in spite of the emphatic declaration of 1833 that fitness be to be the criterion of eligibility in spite of the noble promise in queen victorium 's proclamation of 1858 -- a promise of which every englishman ought to be for ever proud if he try to adhere to it and ashamed if he try to betray or to mock it -- in spite of all this usage and prejudice be so strong that i dare not appoint you but must instead fish up a stranger to indium from lincoln 's inn or the temple be there one of you lordship who would envy the secretary of state who have to hold language of that kind to a meritorious candidate one of the king 's equal subject i press it on you lordship in that concrete way abstract general argument be slippery i do not say there be no force in they but there be deeper question at issue to which both i and the governor-general attach the greatest importance my lord i thank you for you attention and i beg to move the second reading viii indian probationer -lrb- oxford June 13 1909 -rrb- -lrb- the vice chancellor of oxford university and the teacher of the indian civil service probationer give a dinner to the probationer on Saturday at the new masonic hall oxford to meet the secretary of state for indium the vice chancellor be in the chair -rrb- it be a great honor that it should fall to I to be the first secretary of state to address this body of probationer and other personally i be always delight at any reason good or bad that bring I to oxford a great deal of cherwell water have flow under magdalen bridge since i be a undergraduate here and i have a feeling of nostalgia when i think of oxford and come to oxford the reminiscence of one 's younger day be apt to have in older time a ironical tinge but that be not for any of you to-day to consider i be glad to know that of the fifty odd member of the civil service who be go out this autumn not less than half be oxford man nearly all of they oxford breed and even the three or four who be not oxford breed be practically so far as can be oxford man now i will go a little wider a indian minister be rather isolate in the public eye amid the press and bustle of the political energy perplexity interest and partisan passion that stir and concentrate attention on we own home affair yet let I assure you that there be no ordinary compensation for that isolation in the breast of a indian minister he find the richest compensation in the enormous magnitude and endless variety of all the vast field of interest present and still more future that be commit to he temporary charge though he charge may be temporary i should think every secretary of state remember that even in that fugitive span he may either do some good or if he be unhappy he may do much harm this week london have be enormously excite by the imperial press conference i be rather strike by the extraordinarily small attention almost amount to nothing that be give to the dominion that you here be concern with no doubt a imperial conference raise one or two very delicate question as to whether common citizenship be to be observe or whether the relation between indium and the colony should remain what they be i be not go to expatiate upon that to-night but it do occur to I in read all these proceedings that the part of hamlet be rather omit because indium after all be the only real empire you there have a immense dominion a almost countless population govern by foreign ruler that be what constitute a empire i observe it all with a rather grim feeling in my mind that if anything go wrong in indium the whole of what we be talk about now the material and military condition of the empire as a whole might be strangely altered and convulse one of the happy quality of youth -- and there be no pleasure greater than to see you in that blissful stage for one who have pass beyond long beyond it -- be not to be i think i be right in a hurry not to be too anxious either for the present or future measure of the responsibility of life and a career you will forgive I if i remind you of what i be sure you all know -- that the civil government of 230000000 person in british indium be in the hand of some 1200 man who belong to the indian civil service let we follow that any member of a body so small must be rapidly place in a position of command and it be almost startling to I when i look round on the fresh physiognomy of those who be go out and the not less fresh physiognomy of those who have return to think of the contrast between you position and that we will say of some of you oxford contemporary who be lawyer and who have to spend ever so many year in chamber in lincoln 's inn or the temple wait for briefs that do not come contrast you position with that of member who enter the home civil service a admirable phalanx but still for a very long time a member who enter that service have to pursue the minor and slightly mechanical routine of whitehall you will not misunderstand I because nobody know better than a minister how tremendous be the debt that he owe to the permanent official of he department certainly i have every reason to be the last man to underrate that well any of you may be rapidly place in a position of real command with inexorable responsibility i be speak in the presence of man who know better than i do all the detail but it be true that one of you in a few year may be place in command of a district and have 1000000 human being commit to he charge he may have to deal with a famine he may have to deal with a riot he may take a decision on which the life of thousand of people may depend well i think that early call to responsibility to a display of energy to the exercise of individual decision and judgment be what make the indian civil service a grand career and that be what have produce a extraordinary proportion of remarkable man in that service there be another elevate thought that i should suppose be present to all of you to those who be already in important post and those who be by-and-by go to take they up the good name of england be in you keep you conduct and the conduct of you colleague in other branch of the indian service decide what the people of indium be to think of british government and of those who represent it of course you can not expect the simple villager to care anything or to know anything about the abstraction call the _ raj _ what he know be the particular officer who stand in front of he and with whom he have dealings if the officer be harsh or overbearing or incompetent the government get the discredit of it the villager assume that government be also harsh overbearing and incompetent there be this peculiarity which strike I about the indian civil servant i be not sure that all of you will at once welcome it but it go to the root of the matter he be always more or less on duty it be not merely when he be do he office work he be always on duty the great man of the service have always recognize this obligation that official relation be not to be the beginning and the end of the duty of a indian administrator it have be my pleasure and privilege during the three or four year i have be at the indium office to see a stream of important indian official i gather from they that one of the worst drawback of the modern speeding up of the huge wheel of the machine of indian government be that the indian civil servant have less time and less opportunity than he use to have of bring himself into close contact with those with whose interest he be concerned one of these important official tell I the other day this story a retired veteran a indian soldier have come to he and say this be a odd state of thing the other day so-and-so a commissioner or what not be come down to my village or district we do the best we could to get a good camping-ground for he we be all eagerly on the look-out for he he arrive with he attendant he go into he tent he immediately begin to write he go on write we think he have get very urgent business to do we go away we arrive in the morning soon after dawn he be still write or he have begin again so concerned be he both in the evening and in the morning with he write that we really have nothing from he but a polite _ salaam _ this may or may not be typical but i can imagine it be possible at all event that must be pure mischief if i be go to remain indian secretary for some time to come my every effort would be devote to a abatement of that enormous amount of write you applaud that sentiment now and you will applaud it more by-and-by upon this point of less time be devote to write and more time to cultivate social relation with the people it be very easy for we here no doubt to say you ought to cultivate social relation yet i can imagine a man who have do a hard day 's office work -- i be sure i should feel it myself -- be not incline to launch out upon talk and inquiry among the people with whom he be immediately concern it may be ask almost in a way too much from human nature still that be the thing to aim at the thing to aim at be -- all civilian who write and speak say the same -- to cultivate social amenity so far as you can i do not mean in the town but in the local community with which many of you be go to be concerned i see the other day a letter from a lady not i fancy particularly sentimental about the matter and she say this : there would be great improvement if only better social relation could be establish with indian personally i do wish that all young official could be prime before they come out with the proper idea on this question well i have no illusion whatever as to my right or power of priming you i think each of we can see for himself the desirability of every one who go out there have certain idea in he head as to he own relation with the people whom he be call upon to govern that be the mission with which we have to charge you and it be as momentous a mission as be ever confide to any great military commander or admiral of the fleet -- this mission of yours to place yourself in touch with the people whom you have to govern i be under no illusion that i can plant new idea in you mind compare with the idea that may be plant by experienced head of indian government the other day i see a letter of instruction from a very eminent lieutenant-governor to those of the next stage below he as to the attitude that they be to take to the new civilian when they arrive and you 24 or 25 gentleman will get the benefit of those instruction if you be go to that province i do not think there be any reason why i should not mention he name -- it be sir andrew fraser the retire lieutenant-governor of bengal -- and those instruction as to the temper that be to be inculcate upon newcomer be mark by a force a fulness and a first-hand aptitude that not even the keenest secretary of state could venture to approach i know that exile be hard it be very easy for we here to preach exile be and must be hard but i feel confident that under the guidance of the high officer there under whom you will find yourselve you will take care not to ignore the indian not to hold apart and aloof from the indian life and way not to believe that you will not learn anything by conversation with educate indian and while you be in indium and among indian and responsible to indian because you be as responsible to they as you be to we here while you be in that position gentleman do not live in europe all the time whether or not -- if i may be quite candid -- it be a blessing either for indium or for great britain that this great responsibility fall upon we whatever the ultimate destiny and end of all this be to be at any rate i know of no more impose and momentous transaction than the government of indium by you and those like you i know of no more impose and momentous transaction in the vast scroll of the history of human government we have be within the past two year in a position of considerable difficulty but the difficulty of indian government be not the result -- be sure of this -- of any single incident or set of incident you see it say that all the present difficulty arise from the partition of bengal i have never believe that i do not think well of the operation but that do not matter i be turn the other day to the history of the oxford mission to calcutta in 1899 -- the partition of bengal as you know be much later -- what do they say there exist at present -- at present in 1899 -- a increase hostility to what be european and english among the educate class no one can have this oxford report go on any real knowledge of indium without a deep sense of the splendid work do by the indian civil service the work be recognize by the indian people they thoroughly appreciate the benefit of we rule they be bind to we by self-interest but they do not like we it be intelligible but that be a result to be carefully guard against by demeanor by temper by action -- to be guard against at every turn every one would agree that anything like a decisive and permanent estrangement between the indian and the european would end in dire failure and a overwhelming catastrophe i be come to other ground the history of the last six month have be important anxious and try eight month ago there certainly be severe tension that tension have now relax and the great responsible official on the spot assure I that the position of the hour and the prospects be reassure we have keep the word which be give by the sovereign on November 1 last year in the message to the people of indium commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assumption of the power of government in indium by the crown the transfer of the power from the old company to the crown we have keep we word we have introduce and carry through parliament a measure as everybody will admit of the highest order of importance it be carry through both house with excellent deliberation i have be in parliament a great many year i have never know a project discuss and conduct with such knowledge and such a desire to avoid small petty personal incident the whole proceeding be worthy of the reputation of parliament you be enter upon you duty at a stage of intense interest sir charle elliott who be lieutenant-governor of bengal write the other day that this be the most momentous change ever effect by parliament in the constitution of the government of indium since 1858 he go on to say that no prudent man would prophesy no and i do not prophesy how could i it depend upon two thing it depend first of all upon the civil service it depend on the civil service and it depend on the power of indian with the sense and instinct of government to control wilder spirit without the sense or the instinct of government as for the civil service which be the other branch on which all depend it be impossible not to be strike with the warmest admiration of the loyal and manful tone in which lead member of the civil service have express they resolution to face the new task that this legislation will impose upon they i have not get it with I now but certain language be use by sir norman baker who be now the lieutenant-governor of bengal i think i quote it in the house of lord and if i could read it to you it would be far better than any speech of mine in support of the toast i be go to propose to you there never be a more manful and admirable expression of the devotion of the service than the promise of they cordial whole-hearted and laborious support of the policy which they have now get to carry through i be certain there be not one of you who will fall short and i be speak in the presence of those who be not probationer but person prove there be not one of you who when the time come will not respond to the call in the same spirit in which sir norman baker respond i be now go to take you if you will allow I for a moment to a point of immediate and i can almost say personal interest everybody will agree as i say that we have fulfil within the last six or eight month the pledge that be give by the sovereign in November a indian gentleman have be place on the council of the viceroy -- not a everyday transaction it need some courage to do it but it be do before that two indian be place on the council of indium that sit in my own office at whitehall we have pass through parliament as i have already describe to you the council act those be great thing but i be tell great uneasiness be grow in the house of common as to the matter of deportation you know what deportation mean it mean that nine indian gentleman on December 13 last be arrest and be now detain -- arrest under a law which be as good a law as any law on we own statute-book you will forgive I for detain you with this but it be a actual and pressing point some of the most respected member of my own party write a letter to the prime minister protest a bill have be bring in and the first reading of it be carry two or three day ago of which i can only say -- with all responsibility for what i be say -- that it be nothing less if you consider the source from which it come and if you consider the argument by which it be support than a vote of distinct censure on I and lord minto the bill be also support by a very clever and rise member of the opposition now word of a extraordinary character have be use in support of this severe criticism of the policy of myself and lord minto in a motion not in connection with the bill but earlier in the session word be read from _ magna charta _ with the insinuation that the present secretary of state be as dubious a character as the sovereign against whom _ magna charta _ be direct gloomy reference be actually make to king charle i and it be show that we be exercise power that when attempt to be exercise by charle i lead to the civil war and cost charle i he head this be at the beginning of the present session i doubt if they will get through to the end of the session whenever that may be without comparison be institute between the secretary of state for example and strafford or even cromwell in he worst moment as they would think if cromwell be mention i shall know where to point out how cromwell be trouble by fifth monarchy man praise-god barebone venner saxby and other in historical parallel i be fairly prepare for the worst i will take my chance let we look at this seriously because serious mind be exercise by deportation and quite naturally on December 13 nine indian be arrest under a certain indian regulation of the year 1818 and they who reproach we with violate the glory of 1215 -lrb- which be magna charta -rrb- and the petition of rights complain that 1818 be far too remote for we to be at all affect by anything that be then make law now what be the regulation i will ask you to follow I pretty closely for a minute or two the regulation of 1818 say : -- reason of state occasionally render it necessary to place under personal restraint individual against whom there may not be sufficient grounds to institute any judicial proceedings and the governor-general in council be able for good and sufficient reason to determine that ab shall be place under personal restraint there be no trial there be no charge there be no fixed limit of time of detention and in short it be equivalent to a suspension of _ habeas corpus _ that be a broad statement but substantially that be what it be now i do not deny for a moment that if proceedings of this kind such as take place on December 13 last year be normal or frequent if they take place every day of the week or every week of the month it would be dangerous and in the highest degree discreditable to we whole government in indium it would be detestable and dangerous but be there to be no such thing as a emergency power i be not talk about england scotland or ireland i be talk about indium be there to be no such thing as a emergency power my view be that the power give under the regulation of 1818 do constitute a emergency power which may be lawfully apply if a emergency present itself be there a emergency last December the government of indium find in December a movement that be a grave menace to the very foundation of public peace and security the list of crime for twelve month be formidable show the determine and daring character of the supporter of this movement the crime be not all terrorism prevent evidence the ordinary process of law be no longer adequate and the fatal impression prevail that the government could be defy with impunity the government of indium do not need to pass a new law we find a law in the armoury and we apply it very disagreeable but still we should have be perfectly unworthy of hold the position we do -- i be speak now of the government of indium and myself -- if we have not take that weapon out of the armoury and use it against these evildoer it be vital that we should stamp out the impression that the government of indium could be defy with impunity not in matter of opinion mark you but in matter affect peace order life and property -- that the government in those elementary condition of social existence could be defy with impunity i say then -- it be vital in that week of December that these severe proceedings should be take if there be to be any fair and reasonable chance for those reform which have since be laboriously hammer out which have be for very many month upon the anvil and to which we look as we look now for a real pacification it be not the first time that this arbitrary power -- for it be that i never disguise it -- be use it be use some year ago -- i forget how many i be talk the other day to a officer who be greatly concern in it in poona and he describe the condition and tell I the effect be magical i do not say the effect of we proceedings the other day be magical i do not say that bomb and knife and pistol be at a end none of the officer in indium think that we may not have some of these over again but at any rate for the moment and i believe for much more than the moment we have secure order and tranquillity and acquiescence and a warm approval of and interest in we reform i have say we have have acceptance of we reform what a curious thing it be that after the reform be announce and after the deportation have take place still there come to lord minto deputation and to I many telegram convey they appreciation and gratitude for the reform and other thing we have do we good friend who move a vote of censure upon we be better indian than the indian themselves i can not imagine a more mistaken proceeding let I say one more word about deportation it be true that there be no definite charge that could be produce in a court of law that be the very essence of the whole transaction then it be say -- oh but you look to the police you get all you evidence from the police that be not so the government of indium get they information not evidence in a technical sense -- that be the root of the matter -- from important district officer but it be say then who be to decide the value of the information i hear that one gentleman in the house of common say privately in ordinary talk if english country gentleman be to decide this we would not mind who do decide do you think this be do by a police sergeant in a box on the contrary every one of these nine case of deportation have be examine and investigate -- by whom by lord minto by the late lieutenant-governor of bengal by the present lieutenant-governor of bengal by two or three member of the viceroy 's executive council be we to suppose for a minute that man of this great station and authority and responsibility be go to issue a _ lettre de cachet _ for ab cd or ef without troubling themselves whether that _ lettre de cachet _ be wisely issue or not then it be say of a man who be arrest under this law oh he ought not to be harshly treat he be not harshly treat if he be one of these nine deport man he be not put into contact with criminal person he family be look after he subsist under condition which be to a indian perfectly conformable to he social position and to the ordinary comfort and convenience of he life the greatest difference be draw between these nine man and other man against whom charge to be judicially try be bring all these case come up for reconsideration from time to time they will come up shortly and that consideration will be conduct with justice and with firmness there can be no attempt at all to look at this transaction of the nine deport man otherwise than as a disagreeable measure but one impose upon we by a sense of public duty and a measure that event justify what do mr gokhale who be a leader of a considerable body of important political opinion in indium say do he move a vote of censure he say in the legislative council the other day in calcutta that lord minto and the secretary of state have save indium from drift into chaos i owe you a apology mr vice-chancellor and gentleman for press upon you attention point suggest by criticism from politician of generous but unbalanced impulse but they be important and i be glad you have allow I to say what i have say upon they appendix a _ extract from the dispatch of the board of director of the east indium company to the government of indium December 10 1834 accompany the government of indium act _ 1833 -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : tradition ascribe this piece to the pen of jame mill he son j mill be the author of the protest by the company against the transfer to the crown in 1858 -rrb- 103 by clause 87 of the act it be provide that no person by reason of he birth creed or color shall be disqualify from hold any office in we service 104 it be fitting that this important enactment should be understand in order that its full spirit and intention may be transfuse through we whole system of administration 105 you will observe that its object be not to ascertain qualification but to remove disqualification it do not break down or derange the scheme of we government as conduct principally through the instrumentality of we regular servant civil and military to do this would be to abolish or impair the rule which the legislature have establish for secure the fitness of the functionary in whose hand the main duty of indian administration be to be repose -- rule to which the present act make a material addition in the provision relate to the college at haileybury but the meaning of the enactment we take to be that there shall be no govern caste in british indium that whatever other test of qualification may be adopt distinction of race or religion shall not be of the number that no subject of the king whether of indian or british or mixed descent shall be exclude either from the post usually confer on we uncovenanted servant in indium or from the covenanted service itself provide he be otherwise eligible consistently with the rule and agreeably to the condition observe and exact in the one case and in the other 106 in the application of this principle that which will chiefly fall to you share will be the employment of native whether of the whole or the mixed blood in official situation so far as respects the former class -- we mean native of the whole blood -- it be hardly necessary to say that the purpose of the legislature have in a considerable degree be anticipate you well know and indeed have in some important respects carry into effect we desire that native should be admit to place of trust as freely and extensively as a regard for the due discharge of the function attach to such place will permit even judicial duty of magnitude and importance be now confide to they hand partly no doubt from consideration of economy but partly also on the principle of a liberal and comprehensive policy still a line of demarcation to some extent in favor of the native to some extent in exclusion of they have be maintain certain office be appropriate to they from certain other they be debar -- not because these latter belong to the covenanted service and the former do not belong to it but professedly on the ground that the average amount of native qualification can be presume only to rise to a certain limit it be this line of demarcation which the present enactment obliterate or rather for which it substitute another wholly irrespective of the distinction of race fitness be henceforth to be the criterion of eligibility 107 to this altered rule it will be necessary that you should both in you act and you language conform practically perhaps no very marked difference of result will be occasion the distinction between situation allot to the covenanted service and all other situation of a official or public nature will remain generally as at present 108 into a more particular consideration of the effect that may result from the great principle which the legislature have now for the first time recognize and establish we do not enter because we would avoid disquisition of a speculative nature but there be one practical lesson which often as we have on former occasion inculcate it on you the present subject suggest to we once more to enforce while on the one hand it may be anticipate that the range of public situation accessible to the native and mixed race will gradually be enlarged it be on the other hand to be recollect that as settler from europe find they way into the country this class of person will probably furnish candidate for those very situation to which the native and mixed race will have admittance man of european enterprise and education will appear in the field and it be by the prospect of this event that we be lead particularly to impress the lesson already allude to on you attention in every view it be important that the indigenous people of indium or those among they who by they habit character or position may be induce to aspire to office should as far as possible be qualify to meet they european competitor thence then arise a powerful argument for the promotion of every design tend to the improvement of the native whether by confer on they the advantage of education or by diffuse among they the treasure of science knowledge and moral culture for these desirable result we be well aware that you like ourselves be anxious and we doubt not that in order to impel you to increase exertion for the promotion of they you will need no stimulant beyond a simple reference to the consideration we have here suggest 109 while however we entertain these wish and opinion we must guard against the supposition that it be chiefly by hold out means and opportunity of official distinction that we expect we government to benefit the million subject to they authority we have repeatedly express to you a very different sentiment facility of official advancement can little affect the bulk of the people under any government and perhaps least under a good government it be not by hold out incentive to official ambition but by repress crime by secure and guard property by create confidence by ensure to industry the fruit of its labor by protect man in the undisturbed enjoyment of they rights and in the unfettered exercise of they faculty that government best minister to the public wealth and happiness in effect the free access to office be chiefly valuable when it be a part of general freedom b _ proclamation
