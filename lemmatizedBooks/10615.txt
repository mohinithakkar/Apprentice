and have venture into the world by you order do now by a natural kind of right come to you lordship for that protection which you several year since promise it it be not that i think any name how great soever set at the beginning of a book will be able to cover the fault that be to be find in it thing in print must stand and fall by they own worth or the reader 's fancy but there be nothing more to be desire for truth than a fair unprejudiced hearing nobody be more likely to procure I that than you lordship who be allow to have get so intimate a acquaintance with she in she more retired recess you lordship be know to have so far advanced you speculation in the most abstract and general knowledge of thing beyond the ordinary reach or common method that you allowance and approbation of the design of this treatise will at least preserve it from be condemn without reading and will prevail to have those part a little weigh which might otherwise perhaps be think to deserve no consideration for be somewhat out of the common road the imputation of novelty be a terrible charge amongst those who judge of man 's head as they do of they peruke by the fashion and can allow none to be right but the receive doctrine truth scarce ever yet carry it by vote anywhere at its first appearance : new opinion be always suspect and usually oppose without any other reason but because they be not already common but truth like gold be not the less so for be newly bring out of the mine it be trial and examination must give it price and not any antique fashion and though it be not yet current by the public stamp yet it may for all that be as old as nature and be certainly not the less genuine you lordship can give great and convincing instance of this whenever you please to oblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive discovery you have make of truth hitherto unknown unless to some few from whom you lordship have be please not wholly to conceal they this alone be a sufficient reason be there no other why i should dedicate this essay to you lordship and its have some little correspondence with some part of that nobler and vast system of the science you lordship have make so new exact and instructive a draught of i think it glory enough if you lordship permit I to boast that here and there i have fall into some thought not wholly different from yours if you lordship think fit that by you encouragement this should appear in the world i hope it may be a reason some time or other to lead you lordship further and you will allow I to say that you here give the world a earnest of something that if they can bear with this will be truly worth they expectation this my lord show what a present i here make to you lordship just such as the poor man do to he rich and great neighbor by whom the basket of flower or fruit be not ill take though he have more plenty of he own growth and in much greater perfection worthless thing receive a value when they be make the offering of respect esteem and gratitude : these you have give I so mighty and peculiar reason to have in the highest degree for you lordship that if they can add a price to what they go along with proportionable to they own greatness i can with confidence brag i here make you lordship the richest present you ever receive this i be sure i be under the greatest obligation to seek all occasion to acknowledge a long train of favor i have receive from you lordship favor though great and important in themselves yet make much more so by the forwardness concern and kindness and other oblige circumstance that never fail to accompany they to all this you be pleased to add that which give yet more weight and relish to all the rest : you vouchsafe to continue I in some degree of you esteem and allow I a place in you good thought i have almost say friendship this my lord you word and action so constantly show on all occasion even to other when i be absent that it be not vanity in I to mention what everybody know : but it would be want of good manners not to acknowledge what so many be witness of and every day tell I i be indebted to you lordship for i wish they could as easily assist my gratitude as they convince I of the great and grow engagement it have to you lordship this i be sure i should write of the understanding without have any if i be not extremely sensible of they and do not lay hold on this opportunity to testify to the world how much i be oblige to be and how much i be my lord you lordship 's most humble and most obedient servant john locke 2 dorset court 24th of may 1689 the epistle to the reader reader i have put into thy hand what have be the diversion of some of my idle and heavy hour if it have the good luck to prove so of any of thine and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as i have in write it thou wilt as little think thy money as i do my pain ill bestow mistake not this for a commendation of my work nor conclude because i be please with the do of it that therefore i be fondly take with it now it be do he that hawk at lark and sparrow have no less sport though a much less considerable quarry than he that fly at nobler game : and he be little acquaint with the subject of this treatise -- the understanding -- who do not know that as it be the most elevated faculty of the soul so it be employ with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other its search after truth be a sort of hawk and hunting wherein the very pursuit make a great part of the pleasure every step the mind take in its progress towards knowledge make some discovery which be not only new but the best too for the time at least for the understanding like the eye judge of object only by its own sight can not but be please with what it discover have less regret for what have escape it because it be unknown thus he who have raise himself above the alms-basket and not content to live lazily on scrap of begged opinion set he own thought on work to find and follow truth will -lrb- whatever he light on -rrb- not miss the hunter 's satisfaction every moment of he pursuit will reward he pain with some delight and he will have reason to think he time not ill spend even when he can not much boast of any great acquisition this reader be the entertainment of those who let loose they own thought and follow they in write which thou oughtest not to envy they since they afford thee a opportunity of the like diversion if thou wilt make use of thy own thought in read it be to they if they be thy own that i refer myself : but if they be take upon trust from other it be no great matter what they be they be not follow truth but some meaner consideration and it be not worth while to be concern what he say or think who say or think only as he be direct by another if thou judgest for thyself i know thou wilt judge candidly and then i shall not be harm or offend whatever be thy censure for though it be certain that there be nothing in this treatise of the truth whereof i be not fully persuade yet i consider myself as liable to mistake as i can think thee and know that this book must stand or fall with thee not by any opinion i have of it but thy own if thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee thou art not to blame I for it it be not mean for those that have already master this subject and make a thorough acquaintance with they own understanding but for my own information and the satisfaction of a few friend who acknowledge themselves not to have sufficiently consider it be it fit to trouble thee with the history of this essay i should tell thee that five or six friend meet at my chamber and discourse on a subject very remote from this find themselves quickly at a stand by the difficulty that rise on every side after we have awhile puzzle ourselves without come any nearer a resolution of those doubt which perplex we it come into my thought that we take a wrong course and that before we set ourselves upon inquiry of that nature it be necessary to examine we own ability and see what object we understanding be or be not fit to deal with this i propose to the company who all readily assented and thereupon it be agree that this should be we first inquiry some hasty and undigested thought on a subject i have never before consider which i set down against we next meeting give the first entrance into this discourse which have be thus begin by chance be continue by intreaty write by incoherent parcel and after long interval of neglect resume again as my humor or occasion permit and at last in a retirement where a attendance on my health give I leisure it be bring into that order thou now seest it this discontinued way of write may have occasion besides other two contrary fault viz that too little and too much may be say in it if thou findest anything want i shall be glad that what i have write give thee any desire that i should have go further if it seem too much to thee thou must blame the subject for when i put pen to paper i think all i should have to say on this matter would have be contain in one sheet of paper but the further i go the larger prospect i have new discovery lead I still on and so it grow insensibly to the bulk it now appear in i will not deny but possibly it might be reduce to a narrower compass than it be and that some part of it might be contract the way it have be writ in by catch and many long interval of interruption be apt to cause some repetition but to confess the truth i be now too lazy or too busy to make it shorter i be not ignorant how little i herein consult my own reputation when i knowingly let it go with a fault so apt to disgust the most judicious who be always the nicest reader but they who know sloth be apt to content itself with any excuse will pardon I if mine have prevail on I where i think i have a very good one i will not therefore allege in my defense that the same notion have different respects may be convenient or necessary to prove or illustrate several part of the same discourse and that so it have happen in many part of this : but waive that i shall frankly avow that i have sometimes dwell long upon the same argument and express it different way with a quite different design i pretend not to publish this essay for the information of man of large thought and quick apprehension to such master of knowledge i profess myself a scholar and therefore warn they beforehand not to expect anything here but what be spin out of my own coarse thought be fit to man of my own size to whom perhaps it will not be unacceptable that i have take some pain to make plain and familiar to they thought some truth which establish prejudice or the abstractedness of the idea themselves might render difficult some object have need be turn on every side and when the notion be new as i confess some of these be to I or out of the ordinary road as i suspect they will appear to other it be not one simple view of it that will gain it admittance into every understanding or fix it there with a clear and lasting impression there be few i believe who have not observe in themselves or other that what in one way of propose be very obscure another way of express it have make very clear and intelligible though afterwards the mind find little difference in the phrase and wonder why one fail to be understand more than the other but everything do not hit alike upon every man 's imagination we have we understanding no less different than we palate and he that think the same truth shall be equally relish by every one in the same dress may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort of cookery : the meat may be the same and the nourishment good yet every one not be able to receive it with that seasoning and it must be dress another way if you will have it go down with some even of strong constitution the truth be those who advise I to publish it advise I for this reason to publish it as it be : and since i have be bring to let it go abroad i desire it should be understand by whoever give himself the pain to read it i have so little affection to be in print that if i be not flatter this essay might be of some use to other as i think it have be to I i should have confine it to the view of some friend who give the first occasion to it my appear therefore in print be on purpose to be as useful as i may i think it necessary to make what i have to say as easy and intelligible to all sort of reader as i can and i have much rather the speculative and quick-sighted should complain of my be in some part tedious than that any one not accustom to abstract speculation or prepossess with different notion should mistake or not comprehend my mean it will possibly be censure as a great piece of vanity or insolence in I to pretend to instruct this we know age it amount to little less when i own that i publish this essay with hope it may be useful to other but if it may be permit to speak freely of those who with a feigned modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write methink it savor much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book for any other end and he fail very much of that respect he owe the public who print and consequently expect man should read that wherein he intend not they should meet with anything of use to themselves or other : and should nothing else be find allowable in this treatise yet my design will not cease to be so and the goodness of my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my present it be that chiefly which secure I from the fear of censure which i expect not to escape more than better writer man 's principle notion and relish be so different that it be hard to find a book which please or displease all man i acknowledge the age we live in be not the least know and therefore not the most easy to be satisfy if i have not the good luck to please yet nobody ought to be offend with I i plainly tell all my reader except half a dozen this treatise be not at first intend for they and therefore they need not be at the trouble to be of that number but yet if any one think fit to be angry and rail at it he may do it securely for i shall find some better way of spending my time than in such kind of conversation i shall always have the satisfaction to have aim sincerely at truth and usefulness though in one of the meanest way the commonwealth of learning be not at this time without master-builder whose mighty design in advance the science will leave lasting monument to the admiration of posterity : but every one must not hope to be a boyle or a sydenham and in a age that produce such master as the great huygenius and the incomparable mr newton with some other of that strain it be ambition enough to be employ as a under-labourer in clear the ground a little and remove some of the rubbish that lie in the way to knowledge -- which certainly have be very much more advance in the world if the endeavor of ingenious and industrious man have not be much cumber with the learn but frivolous use of uncouth affect or unintelligible term introduce into the science and there make a art of to that degree that philosophy which be nothing but the true knowledge of thing be think unfit or incapable to be bring into well-bred company and polite conversation vague and insignificant form of speech and abuse of language have so long pass for mystery of science and hard and misapply word with little or no meaning have by prescription such a right to be mistake for deep learning and height of speculation that it will not be easy to persuade either those who speak or those who hear they that they be but the cover of ignorance and hindrance of true knowledge to break in upon the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be i suppose some service to human understanding though so few be apt to think they deceive or be deceive in the use of word or that the language of the sect they be of have any fault in it which ought to be examine or correct that i hope i shall be pardon if i have in the third book dwelt long on this subject and endeavor to make it so plain that neither the inveterateness of the mischief nor the prevalency of the fashion shall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the meaning of they own word and will not suffer the significancy of they expression to be inquire into i have be tell that a short epitome of this treatise which be print in 1688 be by some condemn without reading because innate idea be deny in it they too hastily conclude that if innate idea be not suppose there would be little left either of the notion or proof of spirit if any one take the like offence at the entrance of this treatise i shall desire he to read it through and then i hope he will be convince that the take away false foundation be not to the prejudice but advantage of truth which be never injure or endanger so much as when mix with or build on falsehood in the second edition i add as followeth : -- the bookseller will not forgive I if i say nothing of this new edition which he have promise by the correctness of it shall make amends for the many fault commit in the former he desire too that it should be know that it have one whole new chapter concern identity and many addition and amendment in other place these i must inform my reader be not all new matter but most of they either further confirmation of what i have say or explication to prevent other be mistake in the sense of what be formerly print and not any variation in I from it i must only except the alteration i have make in book ii chap xxi what i have there write concern liberty and the will i think deserve as accurate a view as i be capable of those subject have in all age exercise the learn part of the world with question and difficulty that have not a little perplexed morality and divinity those part of knowledge that man be most concerned to be clear in upon a closer inspection into the working of man 's mind and a stricter examination of those motive and view they be turn by i have find reason somewhat to alter the thought i formerly have concern that which give the last determination to the will in all voluntary action this i can not forbear to acknowledge to the world with as much freedom and readiness as i at first publish what then seem to I to be right thinking myself more concerned to quit and renounce any opinion of my own than oppose that of another when truth appear against it for it be truth alone i seek and that will always be welcome to I when or from whencesoever it come but what forwardness soever i have to resign any opinion i have or to recede from anything i have writ upon the first evidence of any error in it yet this i must own that i have not have the good luck to receive any light from those exception i have meet with in print against any part of my book nor have from anything that have be urge against it find reason to alter my sense in any of the point that have be question whether the subject i have in hand require often more think and attention than cursory reader at least such as be prepossess be willing to allow or whether any obscurity in my expression cast a cloud over it and these notion be make difficult to other ' apprehension in my way of treat they so it be that my meaning i find be often mistaken and i have not the good luck to be everywhere rightly understand of this the ingenious author of the discourse concern the nature of man have give I a late instance to mention no other for the civility of he expression and the candor that belong to he order forbid I to think that he would have close he preface with a insinuation as if in what i have say book ii ch xxvii concern the third rule which man refer they action to i go about to make virtue vice and vice virtue unless he have mistake my meaning which he could not have do if he have give himself the trouble to consider what the argument be i be then upon and what be the chief design of that chapter plainly enough set down in the fourth section and those follow for i be there not lay down moral rule but show the original and nature of moral idea and enumerate the rule man make use of in moral relation whether these rule be true or false : and pursuant thereto i tell what be everywhere call virtue and vice which alter not the nature of thing though man generally do judge of and denominate they action accord to the esteem and fashion of the place and sect they be of if he have be at the pain to reflect on what i have say bk i ch ii sect 18 and bk ii ch xxviii sect 13 14 15 and 20 he would have know what i think of the eternal and unalterable nature of right and wrong and what i call virtue and vice and if he have observe that in the place he quote i only report as a matter of fact what other call virtue and vice he would not have find it liable to any great exception for i think i be not much out in say that one of the rule make use of in the world for a ground or measure of a moral relation be -- that esteem and reputation which several sort of action find variously in the several society of man accord to which they be there call virtue or vice and whatever authority the learn mr lowde place in he old english dictionary i daresay it nowhere tell he -lrb- if i should appeal to it -rrb- that the same action be not in credit call and count a virtue in one place which be in disrepute pass for and under the name of vice in another the take notice that man bestow the name of ` virtue ' and ` vice ' accord to this rule of reputation be all i have do or can be lay to my charge to have do towards the make vice virtue or virtue vice but the good man do well and as become he call to be watchful in such point and to take the alarm even at expression which standing alone by themselves might sound ill and be suspect ` tis to this zeal allowable in he function that i forgive he cite as he do these word of mine -lrb- ch xxviii sect ii -rrb- : even the exhortation of inspired teacher have not fear to appeal to common repute philip iv 8 without take notice of those immediately precede which introduce they and run thus : whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundary of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice be pretty well preserve so that even the exhortation of inspired teacher & c by which word and the rest of that section it be plain that i bring that passage of st paul not to prove that the general measure of what man call virtue and vice throughout the world be the reputation and fashion of each particular society within itself but to show that though it be so yet for reason i there give man in that way of denominate they action do not for the most part much stray from the law of nature which be that standing and unalterable rule by which they ought to judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of they action and accordingly denominate they virtue or vice have mr lowde consider this he would have find it little to he purpose to have quote this passage in a sense i use it not and would i imagine have spare the application he subjoin to it as not very necessary but i hope this second edition will give he satisfaction on the point and that this matter be now so express as to show he there be no cause for scruple though i be force to differ from he in these apprehension he have express in the latter end of he preface concern what i have say about virtue and vice yet we be better agree than he think in what he say in he third chapter -lrb- p 78 -rrb- concern natural inscription and innate notion i shall not deny he the privilege he claim -lrb- p 52 -rrb- to state the question as he please especially when he state it so as to leave nothing in it contrary to what i have say for accord to he innate notion be conditional thing depend upon the concurrence of several other circumstance in order to the soul 's exert they all that he say for innate imprinted impressed notion -lrb- for of innate idea he say nothing at all -rrb- amount at last only to this -- that there be certain proposition which though the soul from the beginning or when a man be bear do not know yet by assistance from the outward sens and the help of some previous cultivation it may afterwards come certainly to know the truth of which be no more than what i have affirm in my first book for i suppose by the soul 's exert they he mean its beginning to know they or else the soul 's ` exert of notion ' will be to I a very unintelligible expression and i think at best be a very unfit one in this it misleading man 's thought by a insinuation as if these notion be in the mind before the ` soul exert they ' i e before they be know -- whereas truly before they be know there be nothing of they in the mind but a capacity to know they when the ` concurrence of those circumstance ' which this ingenious author think necessary ` in order to the soul 's exert they ' bring they into we knowledge p 52 i find he express it thus : ` these natural notion be not so imprinted upon the soul as that they naturally and necessarily exert themselves -lrb- even in child and idiot -rrb- without any assistance from the outward sens or without the help of some previous cultivation ' here he say they ` exert themselves ' as p 78 that the ` soul exert they ' when he have explain to himself or other what he mean by ` the soul 's exert innate notion ' or they ` exert themselves ' and what that ` previous cultivation and circumstance ' in order to they be exert be -- he will i suppose find there be so little of controversy between he and I on the point bate that he call that ` exert of notion ' which i in a more vulgar style call ` know ' that i have reason to think he bring in my name on this occasion only out of the pleasure he have to speak civilly of I which i must gratefully acknowledge he have do everywhere he mention I not without confer on I as some other have do a title i have no right to there be so many instance of this that i think it justice to my reader and myself to conclude that either my book be plainly enough write to be rightly understand by those who peruse it with that attention and indifferency which every one who will give himself the pain to read ought to employ in reading or else that i have write mine so obscurely that it be in vain to go about to mend it whichever of these be the truth it be myself only be affect thereby and therefore i shall be far from trouble my reader with what i think might be say in answer to those several objection i have meet with to passage here and there of my book since i persuade myself that he who think they of moment enough to be concerned whether they be true or false will be able to see that what be say be either not well found or else not contrary to my doctrine when i and my opposer come both to be well understand if any other author careful that none of they good thought should be lose have publish they censure of my essay with this honor do to it that they will not suffer it to be a essay i leave it to the public to value the obligation they have to they critical pen and shall not waste my reader 's time in so idle or ill-natured a employment of mine as to lessen the satisfaction any one have in himself or give to other in so hasty a confutation of what i have write the bookseller prepare for the fourth edition of my essay give I notice of it that i might if i have leisure make any addition or alteration i should think fit whereupon i think it convenient to advertise the reader that besides several correction i have make here and there there be one alteration which it be necessary to mention because it run through the whole book and be of consequence to be rightly understand what i thereupon say be this : -- clear and distinct idea be term which though familiar and frequent in man 's mouth i have reason to think every one who use do not perfectly understand and possibly ` tis but here and there one who give himself the trouble to consider they so far as to know what he himself or other precisely mean by they i have therefore in most place choose to put determinate or determine instead of clear and distinct as more likely to direct man 's thought to my meaning in this matter by those denomination i mean some object in the mind and consequently determine i e such as it be there see and perceive to be this i think may fitly be call a determinate or determine idea when such as it be at any time objectively in the mind and so determine there it be annex and without variation determine to a name or articulate sound which be to be steadily the sign of that very same object of the mind or determinate idea to explain this a little more particularly by determinate when apply to a simple idea i mean that simple appearance which the mind have in its view or perceive in itself when that idea be say to be in it : by determine when apply to a complex idea i mean such a one as consist of a determinate number of certain simple or less complex idea join in such a proportion and situation as the mind have before its view and see in itself when that idea be present in it or should be present in it when a man give a name to it i say should be because it be not every one nor perhaps any one who be so careful of he language as to use no word till he view in he mind the precise determine idea which he resolve to make it the sign of the want of this be the cause of no small obscurity and confusion in man 's thought and discourse i know there be not word enough in any language to answer all the variety of idea that enter into man 's discourse and reasoning but this hinder not but that when any one use any term he may have in he mind a determine idea which he make it the sign of and to which he should keep it steadily annex during that present discourse where he do not or can not do this he in vain pretend to clear or distinct idea : it be plain he be not so and therefore there can be expect nothing but obscurity and confusion where such term be make use of which have not such a precise determination upon this ground i have think determine idea a way of speak less liable to mistake than clear and distinct : and where man have get such determine idea of all that they reason inquire or argue about they will find a great part of they doubt and dispute at a end the greatest part of the question and controversy that perplex mankind depend on the doubtful and uncertain use of word or -lrb- which be the same -rrb- indetermined idea which they be make to stand for i have make choice of these term to signify -lrb- 1 -rrb- some immediate object of the mind which it perceive and have before it distinct from the sound it use as a sign of it -lrb- 2 -rrb- that this idea thus determine ie which the mind have in itself and know and see there be determine without any change to that name and that name determine to that precise idea if man have such determine idea in they inquiry and discourse they would both discern how far they own inquiry and discourse go and avoid the greatest part of the dispute and wrangling they have with other besides this the bookseller will think it necessary i should advertise the reader that there be a addition of two chapter wholly new the one of the association of idea the other of enthusiasm these with some other larger addition never before print he have engage to print by themselves after the same manner and for the same purpose as be do when this essay have the second impression in the sixth edition there be very little add or alter the greatest part of what be new be contain in the twenty-first chapter of the second book which any one if he think it worth while may with a very little labor transcribe into the margin of the former edition essay concern human understanding introduction 1 a inquiry into the understanding pleasant and useful since it be the understanding that set man above the rest of sensible being and give he all the advantage and dominion which he have over they it be certainly a subject even for its nobleness worth we labor to inquire into the understanding like the eye whilst it make we see and perceive all other thing take no notice of itself and it require and art and pain to set it at a distance and make it its own object but whatever be the difficulty that lie in the way of this inquiry whatever it be that keep we so much in the dark to ourselves sure i be that all the light we can let in upon we mind all the acquaintance we can make with we own understanding will not only be very pleasant but bring we great advantage in direct we thought in the search of other thing 2 design this therefore be my purpose -- to inquire into the original certainty and extent of human knowledge together with the grounds and degree of belief opinion and assent -- i shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the mind or trouble myself to examine wherein its essence consist or by what motion of we spirit or alteration of we body we come to have any sensation by we organ or any idea in we understanding and whether those idea do in they formation any or all of they depend on matter or not these be speculation which however curious and entertaining i shall decline as lie out of my way in the design i be now upon it shall suffice to my present purpose to consider the discerning faculty of a man as they be employ about the object which they have to do with and i shall imagine i have not wholly misemployed myself in the thought i shall have on this occasion if in this historical plain method i can give any account of the way whereby we understanding come to attain those notion of thing we have and can set down any measure of the certainty of we knowledge or the grounds of those persuasion which be to be find amongst man so various different and wholly contradictory and yet assert somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence that he that shall take a view of the opinion of mankind observe they opposition and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they be embrace the resolution and eagerness wherewith they be maintain may perhaps have reason to suspect that either there be no such thing as truth at all or that mankind have no sufficient means to attain a certain knowledge of it 3 method it be therefore worth while to search out the bound between opinion and knowledge and examine by what measure in thing whereof we have no certain knowledge we ought to regulate we assent and moderate we persuasion in order whereunto i shall pursue this follow method : -- first i shall inquire into the original of those idea notion or whatever else you please to call they which a man observe and be conscious to himself he have in he mind and the way whereby the understanding come to be furnish with they secondly i shall endeavor to show what knowledge the understanding have by those idea and the certainty evidence and extent of it thirdly i shall make some inquiry into the nature and grounds of faith or opinion : whereby i mean that assent which we give to any proposition as true of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledge and here we shall have occasion to examine the reason and degree of assent 4 useful to know the extent of we comprehension if by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding i can discover the power thereof how far they reach to what thing they be in any degree proportionate and where they fail we i suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in meddle with thing exceed its comprehension to stop when it be at the utmost extent of its tether and to sit down in a quiet ignorance of those thing which upon examination be find to be beyond the reach of we capacity we should not then perhaps be so forward out of a affectation of a universal knowledge to raise question and perplex ourselves and other with dispute about thing to which we understanding be not suit and of which we can not frame in we mind any clear or distinct perception or whereof -lrb- as it have perhaps too often happen -rrb- we have not any notion at all if we can find out how far the understanding can extend its view how far it have faculty to attain certainty and in what case it can only judge and guess we may learn to content ourselves with what be attainable by we in this state 5 we capacity suit to we state and concern for though the comprehension of we understanding come exceed short of the vast extent of thing yet we shall have cause enough to magnify the bountiful author of we be for that proportion and degree of knowledge he have bestow on we so far above all the rest of the inhabitant of this we mansion man have reason to be well satisfy with what god have think fit for they since he have give they -lrb- as st peter say -rrb- -lrb- word in greek -rrb- whatsoever be necessary for the convenience of life and information of virtue and have put within the reach of they discovery the comfortable provision for this life and the way that lead to a better how short soever they knowledge may come of a universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever be it yet secure they great concernment that they have light enough to lead they to the knowledge of they maker and the sight of they own duty man may find matter sufficient to busy they head and employ they hand with variety delight and satisfaction if they will not boldly quarrel with they own constitution and throw away the blessing they hand be fill with because they be not big enough to grasp everything we shall not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of we mind if we will but employ they about what may be of use to we for of that they be very capable and it will be a unpardonable as well as childish peevishness if we undervalue the advantage of we knowledge and neglect to improve it to the end for which it be give we because there be some thing that be set out of the reach of it it will be no excuse to a idle and untoward servant who would not attend he business by candle light to plead that he have not broad sunshine the candle that be set up in we shine bright enough for all we purpose the discovery we can make with this ought to satisfy we and we shall then use we understanding right when we entertain all object in that way and proportion that they be suit to we faculty and upon those grounds they be capable of be propose to we and not peremptorily or intemperately require demonstration and demand certainty where probability only be to be have and which be sufficient to govern all we concernment if we will disbelieve everything because we can not certainly know all thing we shall do much what as wisely as he who would not use he leg but sit still and perish because he have no wing to fly 6 knowledge of we capacity a cure of scepticism and idleness when we know we own strength we shall the better know what to undertake with hope of success and when we have well survey the power of we own mind and make some estimate what we may expect from they we shall not be incline either to sit still and not set we thought on work at all in despair of know anything nor on the other side question everything and disclaim all knowledge because some thing be not to be understand it be of great use to the sailor to know the length of he line though he can not with it fathom all the depths of the ocean it be well he know that it be long enough to reach the bottom at such place as be necessary to direct he voyage and caution he against run upon shoal that may ruin he we business here be not to know all thing but those which concern we conduct if we can find out those measure whereby a rational creature put in that state in which man be in this world may and ought to govern he opinion and action depend thereon we need not to be trouble that some other thing escape we knowledge 7 occasion of this essay this be that which give the first rise to this essay concern the understanding for i think that the first step towards satisfy several inquiry the mind of man be very apt to run into be to take a survey of we own understanding examine we own power and see to what thing they be adapt till that be do i suspect we begin at the wrong end and in vain seek for satisfaction in a quiet and sure possession of truth that most concerned we whilst we let loose we thought into the vast ocean of be as if all that boundless extent be the natural and undoubted possession of we understanding wherein there be nothing exempt from its decision or that escape its comprehension thus man extend they inquiry beyond they capacity and let they thought wander into those depths where they can find no sure footing it be no wonder that they raise question and multiply dispute which never come to any clear resolution be proper only to continue and increase they doubt and to confirm they at last in perfect scepticism whereas be the capacity of we understanding well consider the extent of we knowledge once discover and the horizon find which set the bound between the enlighten and dark part of thing between what be and what be not comprehensible by we man would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one and employ they thought and discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other 8 what idea stand for thus much i think necessary to say concern the occasion of this inquiry into human understanding but before i proceed on to what i have think on this subject i must here in the entrance beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word idea which he will find in the follow treatise it be that term which i think serve best to stand for whatsoever be the object of the understanding when a man think i have use it to express whatever be mean by phantasm notion species or whatever it be which the mind can be employ about in think and i could not avoid frequently use it i presume it will be easily grant I that there be such idea in man 's mind : every one be conscious of they in himself and man 's word and action will satisfy he that they be in other we first inquiry then shall be -- how they come into the mind book i neither principle nor idea be innate chapter i no innate speculative principle 1 the way show how we come by any knowledge sufficient to prove it not innate it be a established opinion amongst some man that there be in the understand certain innate principle some primary notion koivai evvoiaus character as it be stamp upon the mind of man which the soul receive in its very first be and bring into the world with it it would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced reader of the falseness of this supposition if i should only show -lrb- as i hope i shall in the follow part of this discourse -rrb- how man barely by the use of they natural faculty may attain to all the knowledge they have without the help of any innate impression and may arrive at certainty without any such original notion or principle for i imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the idea of color innate in a creature to whom god have give sight and a power to receive they by the eye from external object : and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truth to the impression of nature and innate character when we may observe in ourselves faculty fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of they as if they be originally imprint on the mind but because a man be not permit without censure to follow he own thought in the search of truth when they lead he ever so little out of the common road i shall set down the reason that make I doubt of the truth of that opinion as a excuse for my mistake if i be in one which i leave to be consider by those who with I dispose themselves to embrace truth wherever they find it 2 general assent the great argument there be nothing more commonly take for grant than that there be certain principle both speculative and practical -lrb- for they speak of both -rrb- universally agree upon by all mankind : which therefore they argue must need be the constant impression which the soul of man receive in they first being and which they bring into the world with they as necessarily and really as they do any of they inherent faculty 3 universal consent prove nothing innate this argument draw from universal consent have this misfortune in it that if it be true in matter of fact that there be certain truth wherein all mankind agree it would not prove they innate if there can be any other way show how man may come to that universal agreement in the thing they do consent in which i presume may be do 4 what be be and it be possible for the same thing to be and not to be not universally assent to but which be worse this argument of universal consent which be make use of to prove innate principle seem to I a demonstration that there be none such : because there be none to which all mankind give a universal assent i shall begin with the speculative and instance in those magnify principle of demonstration whatsoever be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be which of all other i think have the most allow title to innate these have so settle a reputation of maxim universally receive that it will no doubt be think strange if any one should seem to question it but yet i take liberty to say that these proposition be so far from have a universal assent that there be a great part of mankind to whom they be not so much as known 5 not on mind naturally imprint because not know to child idiot & c for first it be evident that all child and idiot have not the least apprehension or thought of they and the want of that be enough to destroy that universal assent which must need be the necessary concomitant of all innate truth : it seem to I near a contradiction to say that there be truth imprint on the soul which it perceive or understand not : imprint if it signify anything be nothing else but the make certain truth to be perceive for to imprint anything on the mind without the mind 's perceive it seem to I hardly intelligible if therefore child and idiot have soul have mind with those impression upon they they must unavoidably perceive they and necessarily know and assent to these truth which since they do not it be evident that there be no such impression for if they be not notion naturally imprint how can they be innate and if they be notion imprinted how can they be unknown to say a notion be imprint on the mind and yet at the same time to say that the mind be ignorant of it and never yet take notice of it be to make this impression nothing no proposition can be say to be in the mind which it never yet know which it be never yet conscious of for if any one may then by the same reason all proposition that be true and the mind be capable ever of assent to may be say to be in the mind and to be imprint : since if any one can be say to be in the mind which it never yet know it must be only because it be capable of know it and so the mind be of all truth it ever shall know nay thus truth may be imprint on the mind which it never do nor ever shall know for a man may live long and die at last in ignorance of many truth which he mind be capable of know and that with certainty so that if the capacity of know be the natural impression contend for all the truth a man ever come to know will by this account be every one of they innate and this great point will amount to no more but only to a very improper way of speaking which whilst it pretend to assert the contrary say nothing different from those who deny innate principle for nobody i think ever deny that the mind be capable of know several truth the capacity they say be innate the knowledge acquire but then to what end such contest for certain innate maxim if truth can be imprint on the understanding without be perceive i can see no difference there can be between any truth the mind be capable of know in respect of they original : they must all be innate or all adventitious : in vain shall a man go about to distinguish they he therefore that talk of innate notion in the understanding can not -lrb- if he intend thereby any distinct sort of truth -rrb- mean such truth to be in the understanding as it never perceive and be yet wholly ignorant of for if these word to be in the understanding have any propriety they signify to be understand so that to be in the understanding and not to be understand to be in the mind and never to be perceive be all one as to say anything be and be not in the mind or understanding if therefore these two proposition whatsoever be be and it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be by nature imprinted child can not be ignorant of they : infant and all that have soul must necessarily have they in they understanding know the truth of they and assent to it 6 that man know they when they come to the use of reason answer to avoid this it be usually answer that all man know and assent to they when they come to the use of reason and this be enough to prove they innate i answer : 7 doubtful expression that have scarce any signification go for clear reason to those who be prepossess take not the pain to examine even what they themselves say for to apply this answer with any tolerable sense to we present purpose it must signify one of these two thing : either that as soon as man come to the use of reason these suppose native inscription come to be know and observe by they or else that the use and exercise of man 's reason assist they in the discovery of these principle and certainly make they know to they 8 if reason discover they that would not prove they innate if they mean that by the use of reason man may discover these principle and that this be sufficient to prove they innate they way of argue will stand thus viz that whatever truth reason can certainly discover to we and make we firmly assent to those be all naturally imprint on the mind since that universal assent which be make the mark of they amount to no more but this -- that by the use of reason we be capable to come to a certain knowledge of and assent to they and by this mean there will be no difference between the maxim of the mathematician and theorem they deduce from they : all must be equally allow innate they be all discovery make by the use of reason and truth that a rational creature may certainly come to know if he apply he thought rightly that way 9 it be false that reason discover they but how can these man think the use of reason necessary to discover principle that be suppose innate when reason -lrb- if we may believe they -rrb- be nothing else but the faculty of deduce unknown truth from principle or proposition that be already know that certainly can never be think innate which we have need of reason to discover unless as i have say we will have all the certain truth that reason ever teach we to be innate we may as well think the use of reason necessary to make we eye discover visible object as that there should be need of reason or the exercise thereof to make the understanding see what be originally engraven on it and can not be in the understanding before it be perceive by it so that to make reason discover those truth thus imprint be to say that the use of reason discover to a man what he know before : and if man have those innate impressed truth originally and before the use of reason and yet be always ignorant of they till they come to the use of reason it be in effect to say that man know and know they not at the same time 10 no use make of reasoning in the discovery of these two maxim it will here perhaps be say that mathematical demonstration and other truth that be not innate be not assent to as soon as propose wherein they be distinguish from these maxim and other innate truth i shall have occasion to speak of assent upon the first propose more particularly by and by i shall here only and that very readily allow that these maxim and mathematical demonstration be in this different : that the one have need of reason use of proof to make they out and to gain we assent but the other as soon as understand be without any the least reasoning embrace and assent to but i withal beg leave to observe that it lay open the weakness of this subterfuge which require the use of reason for the discovery of these general truth : since it must be confess that in they discovery there be no use make of reasoning at all and i think those who give this answer will not be forward to affirm that the knowledge of this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be a deduction of we reason for this would be to destroy that bounty of nature they seem so fond of whilst they make the knowledge of those principle to depend on the labor of we thought for all reasoning be search and cast about and require pain and application and how can it with any tolerable sense be suppose that what be imprint by nature as the foundation and guide of we reason should need the use of reason to discover it 11 and if there be this would prove they not innate those who will take the pain to reflect with a little attention on the operation of the understanding will find that this ready assent of the mind to some truth depend not either on native inscription or the use of reason but on a faculty of the mind quite distinct from both of they as we shall see hereafter reason therefore have nothing to do in procure we assent to these maxim if by say that man know and assent to they when they come to the use of reason be mean that the use of reason assist we in the knowledge of these maxim it be utterly false and be it true would prove they not to be innate 12 the come of the use of reason not the time we come to know these maxim if by know and assent to they when we come to the use of reason be mean that this be the time when they come to be take notice of by the mind and that as soon as child come to the use of reason they come also to know and assent to these maxim this also be false and frivolous first it be false because it be evident these maxim be not in the mind so early as the use of reason and therefore the come to the use of reason be falsely assign as the time of they discovery how many instance of the use of reason may we observe in child a long time before they have any knowledge of this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and a great part of illiterate people and savage pass many year even of they rational age without ever think on this and the like general proposition i grant man come not to the knowledge of these general and more abstract truth which be think innate till they come to the use of reason and i add nor then neither which be so because till after they come to the use of reason those general abstract idea be not frame in the mind about which those general maxim be which be mistake for innate principle but be indeed discovery make and verity introduce and bring into the mind by the same way and discover by the same step as several other proposition which nobody be ever so extravagant as to suppose innate this i hope to make plain in the sequel of this discourse i allow therefore a necessity that man should come to the use of reason before they get the knowledge of those general truth but deny that man 's come to the use of reason be the time of they discovery 13 by this they be not distinguish from other knowable truth in the mean time it be observable that this say that man know and assent to these maxim when they come to the use of reason amount in reality of fact to no more but this -- that they be never know nor take notice of before the use of reason but may possibly be assent to some time after during a man 's life but when be uncertain and so may all other knowable truth as well as these which therefore have no advantage nor distinction from other by this note of be know when we come to the use of reason nor be thereby prove to be innate but quite the contrary 14 if come to the use of reason be the time of they discovery it would not prove they innate but secondly be it true that the precise time of they be know and assent to be when man come to the use of reason neither would that prove they innate this way of argue be as frivolous as the supposition itself be false for by what kind of logic will it appear that any notion be originally by nature imprint in the mind in its first constitution because it come first to be observe and assent to when a faculty of the mind which have quite a distinct province begin to exert itself and therefore the come to the use of speech if it be suppose the time that these maxim be first assent to -lrb- which it may be with as much truth as the time when man come to the use of reason -rrb- would be as good a proof that they be innate as to say they be innate because man assent to they when they come to the use of reason i agree then with these man of innate principle that there be no knowledge of these general and self-evident maxim in the mind till it come to the exercise of reason : but i deny that the come to the use of reason be the precise time when they be first take notice of and if that be the precise time i deny that it would prove they innate all that can with any truth be mean by this proposition that man ` assent to they when they come to the use of reason ' be no more but this -- that the making of general abstract idea and the understanding of general name be a concomitant of the rational faculty and grow up with it child commonly get not those general idea nor learn the name that stand for they till have for a good while exercise they reason about familiar and more particular idea they be by they ordinary discourse and action with other acknowledge to be capable of rational conversation if assent to these maxim when man come to the use of reason can be true in any other sense i desire it may be show or at least how in this or any other sense it prove they innate 15 the step by which the mind attain several truth the sens at first let in particular idea and furnish the yet empty cabinet and the mind by degree grow familiar with some of they they be lodge in the memory and name get to they afterwards the mind proceed further abstract they and by degree learn the use of general name in this manner the mind come to be furnish with idea and language the material about which to exercise its discursive faculty and the use of reason become daily more visible as these material that give it employment increase but though the have of general idea and the use of general word and reason usually grow together yet i see not how this any way prove they innate the knowledge of some truth i confess be very early in the mind but in a way that show they not to be innate for if we will observe we shall find it still to be about idea not innate but acquire it be about those first which be imprint by external thing with which infant have earliest to do which make the most frequent impression on they sens in idea thus get the mind discover that some agree and other differ probably as soon as it have any use of memory as soon as it be able to retain and perceive distinct idea but whether it be then or no this be certain it do so long before it have the use of word or come to that which we commonly call the use of reason for a child know as certainly before it can speak the difference between the idea of sweet and bitter -lrb- ie that sweet be not bitter -rrb- as it know afterwards -lrb- when it come to speak -rrb- that wormwood and sugarplum be not the same thing 16 assent to suppose innate truth depend on have clear and distinct idea of what they term mean and not on they innateness a child know not that three and four be equal to seven till he come to be able to count seven and have get the name and idea of equality and then upon explain those word he presently assent to or rather perceive the truth of that proposition but neither do he then readily assent because it be a innate truth nor be he assent want till then because he want the use of reason but the truth of it appear to he as soon as he have settle in he mind the clear and distinct idea that these name stand for and then he know the truth of that proposition upon the same ground and by the same means that he know before that a rod and a cherry be not the same thing and upon the same ground also that he may come to know afterwards that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be as shall be more fully show hereafter so that the later it be before any one come to have those general idea about which those maxim be or to know the signification of those generic term that stand for they or to put together in he mind the idea they stand for the later also will it be before he come to assent to those maxim -- whose term with the idea they stand for be no more innate than those of a cat or a weasel he must stay till time and observation have acquaint he with they and then he will be in a capacity to know the truth of these maxim upon the first occasion that shall make he put together those idea in he mind and observe whether they agree or disagree accord as be express in those proposition and therefore it be that a man know that eighteen and nineteen be equal to thirty-seven by the same self-evidence that he know one and two to be equal to three : yet a child know this not so soon as the other not for want of the use of reason but because the idea the word eighteen nineteen and thirty-seven stand for be not so soon get as those which be signify by one two and three 17 assent as soon as propose and understand prove they not innate this evasion therefore of general assent when man come to the use of reason fail as it do and leave no difference between those suppose innate and other truth that be afterwards acquire and learn man have endeavor to secure a universal assent to those they call maxim by say they be generally assent to as soon as propose and the term they be propose in understand : see all man even child as soon as they hear and understand the term assent to these proposition they think it be sufficient to prove they innate for since man never fail after they have once understand the word to acknowledge they for undoubted truth they would infer that certainly these proposition be first lodge in the understanding which without any teach the mind at the very first proposal immediately close with and assent to and after that never doubt again 18 if such a assent be a mark of innate then that one and two be equal to three that sweetness if not bitterness and a thousand the like must be inate in answer to this i demand whether ready assent give to a proposition upon first hearing and understand the term be a certain mark of a innate principle if it be not such a general assent be in vain urge as a proof of they : if it be say that it be a mark of innate they must then allow all such proposition to be innate which be generally assent to as soon as hear whereby they will find themselves plentifully store with innate principle for upon the same ground viz of assent at first hearing and understand the term that man would have those maxim pass for innate they must also admit several proposition about number to be innate and thus that one and two be equal to three that two and two be equal to four and a multitude of other the like proposition in number that everybody assent to at first hearing and understand the term must have a place amongst these innate axiom nor be this the prerogative of number alone and proposition make about several of they but even natural philosophy and all the other science afford proposition which be sure to meet with assent as soon as they be understand that two body can not be in the same place be a truth that nobody any more stick at than at these maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that white be not black that a square be not a circle that bitterness be not sweetness these and a million of such other proposition as many at least as we have distinct idea of every man in he wit at first hearing and know what the name stand for must necessarily assent to if these man will be true to they own rule and have assent at first hearing and understand the term to be a mark of innate they must allow not only as many innate proposition as man have distinct idea but as many as man can make proposition wherein different idea be deny one of another since every proposition wherein one different idea be deny of another will as certainly find assent at first hearing and understand the term as this general one it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or that which be the foundation of it and be the easier understand of the two the same be not different by which account they will have legion of innate proposition of this one sort without mention any other but since no proposition can be innate unless the _ idea _ about which it be be innate this will be to suppose all we idea of color sound taste figure & c innate than which there can not be anything more opposite to reason and experience universal and ready assent upon hearing and understand the term be i grant a mark of self-evidence but self-evidence depend not on innate impression but on something else -lrb- as we shall show hereafter -rrb- belong to several proposition which nobody be yet so extravagant as to pretend to be innate 19 such less general proposition know before these universal maxim nor let it be say that those more particular self-evident proposition which be assent to at first hearing as that one and two be equal to three that green be not red & c be receive as the consequence of those more universal proposition which be look on as innate principle since any one who will but take the pain to observe what pass in the understanding will certainly find that these and the like less general proposition be certainly know and firmly assent to by those who be utterly ignorant of those more general maxim and so be earlier in the mind than those -lrb- as they be call -rrb- first principle can not owe to they the assent wherewith they be receive at first hearing 20 one and one equal to two & c not general nor useful answer if it be say that these proposition viz two and two be equal to four red be not blue & c be not general maxim nor of any great use i answer that make nothing to the argument of universal assent upon hearing and understanding for if that be the certain mark of innate whatever proposition can be find that receive general assent as soon as hear understand that must be admit for a innate proposition as well as this maxim that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be they be upon this ground equal and as to the difference of be more general that make this maxim more remote from be innate those general and abstract idea be more stranger to we first apprehension than those of more particular self-evident proposition and therefore it be longer before they be admit and assent to by the grow understanding and as to the usefulness of these magnify maxim that perhaps will not be find so great as be generally conceive when it come in its due place to be more fully consider 21 these maxim not be know sometimes till propose prove they not innate but we have not yet do with assent to proposition at first hearing and understand they term it be fit we first take notice that this instead of be a mark that they be innate be a proof of the contrary since it suppose that several who understand and know other thing be ignorant of these principle till they be propose to they and that one may be unacquainted with these truth till he hear they from other for if they be innate what need they be propose in order to gain assent when by be in the understanding by a natural and original impression -lrb- if there be any such -rrb- they could not but be know before or doth the propose they print they clearer in the mind than nature do if so then the consequence will be that a man know they better after he have be thus teach they than he do before whence it will follow that these principle may be make more evident to we by other ' teaching than nature have make they by impression : which will ill agree with the opinion of innate principle and give but little authority to they but on the contrary make they unfit to be the foundation of all we other knowledge as they be pretend to be this can not be deny that man grow first acquaint with many of these self-evident truth upon they be propose : but it be clear that whosoever do so find in himself that he then begin to know a proposition which he know not before and which from thenceforth he never question not because it be innate but because the consideration of the nature of the thing contain in those word would not suffer he to think otherwise how or whensoever he be bring to reflect on they and if whatever be assent to at first hearing and understand the term must pass for a innate principle every well-grounded observation draw from particulars into a general rule must be innate when yet it be certain that not all but only sagacious head light at first on these observation and reduce they into general proposition : not innate but collect from a precede acquaintance and reflection on particular instance these when observe man have make they unobserving man when they be propose to they can not refuse they assent to 22 implicitly know before propose signify that the mind be capable of understand they or else signify nothing if it be say the understanding have a implicit knowledge of these principle but not a explicit before this first hearing -lrb- as they must who will say that they be in the understanding before they be know -rrb- it will be hard to conceive what be mean by a principle imprint on the understanding implicitly unless it be this -- that the mind be capable of understanding and assent firmly to such proposition and thus all mathematical demonstration as well as first principle must be receive as native impression on the mind which i fear they will scarce allow they to be who find it harder to demonstrate a proposition than assent to it when demonstrate and few mathematician will be forward to believe that all the diagram they have draw be but copy of those innate character which nature have engraven upon they mind 23 the argument of assent on first hearing be upon a false supposition of no precedent teaching there be i fear this further weakness in the foregoing argument which would persuade we that therefore those maxim be to be think innate which man admit at first hearing because they assent to proposition which they be not teach nor do receive from the force of any argument or demonstration but a bare explication or understanding of the term under which there seem to I to lie this fallacy that man be suppose not to be teach nor to learn anything de novo when in truth they be teach and do learn something they be ignorant of before for first it be evident that they have learn the term and they signification neither of which be bear with they but this be not all the acquire knowledge in the case : the idea themselves about which the proposition be be not bear with they no more than they name but get afterwards so that in all proposition that be assent to at first hear the term of the proposition they standing for such idea and the idea themselves that they stand for be neither of they innate i would fain know what there be remain in such proposition that be innate for i would gladly have any one name that proposition whose term or idea be either of they innate we by degree get idea and name and learn they appropriate connexion one with another and then to proposition make in such term whose signification we have learn and wherein the agreement or disagreement we can perceive in we idea when put together be express we at first hearing assent though to other proposition in themselves as certain and evident but which be concern idea not so soon or so easily get we be at the same time no way capable of assent for though a child quickly assent to this proposition that a apple be not fire when by familiar acquaintance he have get the idea of those two different thing distinctly imprint on he mind and have learn that the name apple and fire stand for they yet it will be some year after perhaps before the same child will assent to this proposition that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be because that though perhaps the word be as easy to be learn yet the signification of they be more large comprehensive and abstract than of the name annex to those sensible thing the child have to do with it be longer before he learn they precise meaning and it require more time plainly to form in he mind those general idea they stand for till that be do you will in vain endeavor to make any child assent to a proposition make up of such general term but as soon as ever he have get those idea and learn they name he forwardly close with the one as well as the other of the forementioned proposition : and with both for the same reason viz because he find the idea he have in he mind to agree or disagree accord as the word stand for they be affirm or deny one of another in the proposition but if proposition be bring to he in word which stand for idea he have not yet in he mind to such proposition however evidently true or false in themselves he afford neither assent nor dissent but be ignorant for word be but empty sound any further than they be sign of we idea we can not but assent to they as they correspond to those idea we have but no further than that but the showing by what step and way knowledge come into we mind and the grounds of several degree of assent be the business of the follow discourse it may suffice to have only touch on it here as one reason that make I doubt of those innate principle 24 not innate because not universally assent to to conclude this argument of universal consent i agree with these defender of innate principle -- that if they be innate they must need have universal assent for that a truth should be innate and yet not assent to be to I as unintelligible as for a man to know a truth and be ignorant of it at the same time but then by these man 's own confession they can not be innate since they be not assent to by those who understand not the term nor by a great part of those who do understand they but have yet never hear nor think of those proposition which i think be at least one half of mankind but be the number far less it would be enough to destroy universal assent and thereby show these proposition not to be innate if child alone be ignorant of they 25 these maxim not the first known but that i may not be accuse to argue from the thought of infant which be unknown to we and to conclude from what pass in they understanding before they express it i say next that these two general proposition be not the truth that first possess the mind of child nor be antecedent to all acquire and adventitious notion : which if they be innate they must need be whether we can determine it or no it matter not there be certainly a time when child begin to think and they word and action do assure we that they do so when therefore they be capable of thought of knowledge of assent can it rationally be suppose they can be ignorant of those notion that nature have imprint be there any such can it be imagine with any appearance of reason that they perceive the impression from thing without and be at the same time ignorant of those character which nature itself have take care to stamp within can they receive and assent to adventitious notion and be ignorant of those which be suppose weave into the very principle of they be and imprint there in indelible character to be the foundation and guide of all they acquire knowledge and future reasoning this would be to make nature take pain to no purpose or at least to write very ill since its character could not be read by those eye which see other thing very well : and those be very ill suppose the clearest part of truth and the foundation of all we knowledge which be not first know and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other thing may be have the child certainly know that the nurse that feed it be neither the cat it play with nor the blackmoor it be afraid of : that the wormseed or mustard it refuse be not the apple or sugar it cry for : this it be certainly and undoubtedly assure of : but will any one say it be by virtue of this principle that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that it so firmly assent to these and other part of its knowledge or that the child have any notion or apprehension of that proposition at a age wherein yet it be plain it know a great many other truth he that will say child join in these general abstract speculation with they sucking-bottle and they rattle may perhaps with justice be think to have more passion and zeal for he opinion but less sincerity and truth than one of that age 26 and so not innate though therefore there be several general proposition that meet with constant and ready assent as soon as propose to man grow up who have attain the use of more general and abstract idea and name stand for they yet they not be to be find in those of tender year who nevertheless know other thing they can not pretend to universal assent of intelligent person and so by no means can be suppose innate -- it be impossible that any truth which be innate -lrb- if there be any such -rrb- should be unknown at least to any one who know anything else since if they be innate truth they must be innate thought : there be nothing a truth in the mind that it have never think on whereby it be evident if there be any innate truth they must necessarily be the first of any think on the first that appear 27 not innate because they appear least where what be innate show itself clearest that the general maxim we be discourse of be not know to child idiot and a great part of mankind we have already sufficiently prove : whereby it be evident they have not a universal assent nor be general impression but there be this further argument in it against they be innate : that these character if they be native and original impression should appear fairest and clearest in those person in whom yet we find no footstep of they and it be in my opinion a strong presumption that they be not innate since they be least know to those in whom if they be innate they must need exert themselves with most force and vigor for child idiot savage and illiterate people be of all other the least corrupt by custom or borrow opinion learn and education have not cast they native thought into new mould nor by superinduce foreign and study doctrine confound those fair character nature have write there one might reasonably imagine that in they mind these innate notion should lie open fairly to every one 's view as it be certain the thought of child do it might very well be expect that these principle should be perfectly know to natural which be stamp immediately on the soul -lrb- as these man suppose -rrb- can have no dependence on the constitution or organ of the body the only confess difference between they and other one would think accord to these man 's principle that all these native beam of light -lrb- be there any such -rrb- should in those who have no reserve no art of concealment shine out in they full lustre and leave we in no more doubt of they be there than we be of they love of pleasure and abhorrence of pain but alas amongst child idiot savage and the grossly illiterate what general maxim be to be find what universal principle of knowledge they notion be few and narrow borrow only from those object they have have most to do with and which have make upon they sens the frequentest and strongest impression a child know he nurse and he cradle and by degree the plaything of a little more advanced age and a young savage have perhaps he head fill with love and hunting accord to the fashion of he tribe but he that from a child untaught or a wild inhabitant of the wood will expect these abstract maxim and reputed principle of science will i fear find himself mistaken such kind of general proposition be seldom mention in the hut of indian : much less be they to be find in the thought of child or any impression of they on the mind of natural they be the language and business of the school and academy of learn nation accustom to that sort of conversation or learn where dispute be frequent these maxim be suit to artificial argumentation and useful for conviction but not much conduce to the discovery of truth or advancement of knowledge but of they small use for the improvement of knowledge i shall have occasion to speak more at large l4 c 7 28 recapitulation i know not how absurd this may seem to the master of demonstration and probably it will hardly go down with anybody at first hearing i must therefore beg a little truce with prejudice and the forbearance of censure till i have be hear out in the sequel of this discourse be very willing to submit to better judgment and since i impartially search after truth i shall not be sorry to be convince that i have be too fond of my own notion which i confess we be all apt to be when application and study have warm we head with they upon the whole matter i can not see any ground to think these two speculative maxim innate : since they be not universally assent to and the assent they so generally find be no other than what several proposition not allow to be innate equally partake in with they : and since the assent that be give they be produce another way and come not from natural inscription as i doubt not but to make appear in the follow discourse and if these first principle of knowledge and science be find not to be innate no other speculative maxim can -lrb- i suppose -rrb- with better right pretend to be so chapter ii no innate practical principle 1 no moral principle so clear and so generally receive as the foremention speculative maxim if those speculative maxim whereof we discourse in the foregoing chapter have not a actual universal assent from all mankind as we there prove it be much more visible concern practical principle that they come short of a universal reception : and i think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready a assent as what be be or to be so manifest a truth as this that it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be whereby it be evident that they be further remove from a title to be innate and the doubt of they be native impression on the mind be stronger against those moral principle than the other not that it bring they truth at all in question they be equally true though not equally evident those speculative maxim carry they own evidence with they : but moral principle require reasoning and discourse and some exercise of the mind to discover the certainty of they truth they lie not open as natural character engrave on the mind which if any such be they must need be visible by themselves and by they own light be certain and know to everybody but this be no derogation to they truth and certainty no more than it be to the truth or certainty of the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one because it be not so evident as the whole be bigger than a part nor so apt to be assent to at first hearing it may suffice that these moral rule be capable of demonstration : and therefore it be we own fault if we come not to a certain knowledge of they but the ignorance wherein many man be of they and the slowness of assent wherewith other receive they be manifest proof that they be not innate and such as offer themselves to they view without search 2 faith and justice not own as principle by all man whether there be any such moral principle wherein all man do agree i appeal to any who have be but moderately conversant in the history of mankind and look abroad beyond the smoke of they own chimney where be that practical truth that be universally receive without doubt or question as it must be if innate justice and keep of contract be that which most man seem to agree in this be a principle which be think to extend itself to the den of thief and the confederacy of the greatest villain and they who have go furthest towards the put off of humanity itself keep faith and rule of justice one with another i grant that outlaw themselves do this one amongst another : but it be without receive these as the innate law of nature they practice they as rule of convenience within they own community : but it be impossible to conceive that he embrace justice as a practical principle who act fairly with he fellow-highwayman and at the same time plunder or kill the next honest man he meet with justice and truth be the common tie of society and therefore even outlaw and robber who break with all the world besides must keep faith and rule of equity amongst themselves or else they can not hold together but will any one say that those that live by fraud or rapine have innate principle of truth and justice which they allow and assent to 3 objection : though man deny they in they practice yet they admit they in they thought answer perhaps it will be urge that the tacit assent of they mind agree to what they practice contradict i answer first i have always think the action of man the best interpreter of they thought but since it be certain that most man 's practice and some man 's open profession have either question or deny these principle it be impossible to establish a universal consent -lrb- though we should look for it only amongst grow man -rrb- without which it be impossible to conclude they innate secondly it be very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principle that terminate only in contemplation practical principle derive from nature be there for operation and must produce conformity of action not barely speculative assent to they truth or else they be in vain distinguish from speculative maxim nature i confess have put into man a desire of happiness and a aversion to misery : these indeed be innate practical principle which -lrb- as practical principle ought -rrb- do continue constantly to operate and influence all we action without cease : these may be observe in all person and all age steady and universal but these be inclination of the appetite to good not impression of truth on the understanding i deny not that there be natural tendency imprint on the mind of man and that from the very first instance of sense and perception there be some thing that be grateful and other unwelcome to they some thing that they incline to and other that they fly : but this make nothing for innate character on the mind which be to be the principle of knowledge regulate we practice such natural impression on the understanding be so far from be confirm hereby that this be a argument against they since if there be certain character imprint by nature on the understanding as the principle of knowledge we could not but perceive they constantly operate in we and influence we knowledge as we do those other on the will and appetite which never cease to be the constant spring and motive of all we action to which we perpetually feel they strongly impel we 4 moral rule need a proof ergo not innate another reason that make I doubt of any innate practical principle be that i think there can not any one moral rule be propose whereof a man may not justly demand a reason : which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd if they be innate or so much as self-evident which every innate principle must need be and not need any proof to ascertain its truth nor want any reason to gain it approbation he would be think void of common sense who ask on the one side or on the other side go to give a reason why it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be it carry its own light and evidence with it and need no other proof : he that understand the term assent to it for its own sake or else nothing will ever be able to prevail with he to do it but should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue that should do as he would be do unto be propose to one who never hear of it before but yet be of capacity to understand its meaning might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why and be not he that propose it bind to make out the truth and reasonableness of it to he which plainly show it not to be innate for if it be it could neither want nor receive any proof but must need -lrb- at least as soon as hear and understand -rrb- be receive and assent to as a unquestionable truth which a man can by no means doubt of so that the truth of all these moral rule plainly depend upon some other antecedent to they and from which they must be deduce which could not be if either they be innate or so much as self-evident 5 instance in keep compact that man should keep they compact be certainly a great and undeniable rule in morality but yet if a christian who have the view of happiness and misery in another life be ask why a man must keep he word he will give this as a reason : -- because god who have the power of eternal life and death require it of we but if a hobbist be ask why he will answer : -- because the public require it and the leviathan will punish you if you do not and if one of the old philosopher have be ask he would have answer : -- because it be dishonest below the dignity of a man and opposite to virtue the highest perfection of human nature to do otherwise 6 virtue generally approve not because innate but because profitable hence naturally flow the great variety of opinion concern moral rule which be to be find among man accord to the different sort of happiness they have a prospect of or propose to themselves which could not be if practical principle be innate and imprinted in we mind immediately by the hand of god i grant the existence of god be so many way manifest and the obedience we owe he so congruous to the light of reason that a great part of mankind give testimony to the law of nature : but yet i think it must be allow that several moral rule may receive from mankind a very general approbation without either know or admit the true ground of morality which can only be the will and law of a god who see man in the dark have in he hand reward and punishment and power enough to call to account the proudest offender for god have by a inseparable connexion join virtue and public happiness together and make the practice thereof necessary to the preservation of society and visibly beneficial to all with whom the virtuous man have to do it be no wonder that every one should not only allow but recommend and magnify those rule to other from whose observance of they he be sure to reap advantage to himself he may out of interest as well as conviction cry up that for sacred which if once trample on and profane he himself can not be safe nor secure this though it take nothing from the moral and eternal obligation which these rule evidently have yet it show that the outward acknowledgment man pay to they in they word prove not that they be innate principle : nay it prove not so much as that man assent to they inwardly in they own mind as the inviolable rule of they own practice since we find that self-interest and the convenience of this life make many man own a outward profession and approbation of they whose action sufficiently prove that they very little consider the lawgiver that prescribe these rule nor the hell that he have ordain for the punishment of those that transgress they 7 man 's action convince we that the rule of virtue be not they internal principle for if we will not in civility allow too much sincerity to the profession of most man but think they action to be the interpreter of they thought we shall find that they have no such internal veneration for these rule nor so full a persuasion of they certainty and obligation the great principle of morality ` to do as one would be do to ' be more commend than practice but the breach of this rule can not be a greater vice than to teach other that it be no moral rule nor obligatory would be think madness and contrary to that interest man sacrifice to when they break it themselves perhaps conscience will be urge as check we for such breach and so the internal obligation and establishment of the rule be preserve 8 conscience no proof of any innate moral rule to which i answer that i doubt not but without be write on they heart many man may by the same way that they come to the knowledge of other thing come to assent to several moral rule and be convince of they obligation other also may come to be of the same mind from they education company and custom of they country which persuasion however get will serve to set conscience on work which be nothing else but we own opinion or judgment of the moral rectitude or gravity of we own action and if conscience be a proof of innate principle contrary may be innate principle since some man with the same bent of conscience prosecute what other avoid 9 instance of enormity practice without remorse but i can not see how any man should ever transgress those moral rule with confidence and serenity be they innate and stamped upon they mind view but a army at the sack of a town and see what observation or sense of moral principle or what touch of conscience for all the outrage they do robbery murder rape be the sport of man set at liberty from punishment and censure have there not be whole nation and those of the most civilized people amongst whom the expose they child and leave they in the field to perish by want or wild beast have be the practice as little condemn or scruple as the beget they do they not still in some country put they into the same grave with they mother if they die in childbirth or despatch they if a pretended astrologer declare they to have unhappy star and be there not place where at a certain age they kill or expose they parent without any remorse at all in a part of asia the

among the mingrelian a people profess christianity to bury they child alive without scruple there be place where they eat they own child the caribbee be wont to geld they child on purpose to fat and eat they and garcilasso de la vega tell we of a people in peru which be wont to fat and eat the child they get on they female captive whom they keep as concubine for that purpose and when they be past

then be those innate principle of justice piety gratitude equity chastity or where be that universal consent that assure we there be such inbred rule murder in duel when fashion have make they honorable be commit without remorse of conscience : nay in many place innocence in this case be the greatest ignominy and if we look abroad to take a view of man as they be we shall find that they have remorse in one place for do or omit that which other in another place think they merit by 10 man have contrary practical principle he that will carefully peruse the history of mankind and look abroad into the several tribe of man and with indifferency survey they action will be able to satisfy himself that there be scarce that principle of morality to be name or rule of virtue to be think on -lrb- those only excepted that be absolutely necessary to hold society together which commonly too be neglect betwixt distinct society -rrb- which be not somewhere or other slight and condemn by the general fashion of whole society of man govern by practical opinion and rule of live quite opposite to other 11 whole nation reject several moral rule here perhaps it will be object that it be no argument that the rule be not know because it be broken i grant the objection good where man though they transgress yet disown not the law where fear of shame censure or punishment carry the mark of some awe it have upon they but it be impossible to conceive that a whole nation of man should all publicly reject and renounce what every one of they certainly and infallibly know to be a law for so they must who have it naturally imprint on they mind it be possible man may sometimes own rule of morality which in they private thought they do not believe to be true only to keep themselves in reputation and esteem amongst those who be persuade of they obligation but it be not to be imagine that a whole society of man should publicly and professedly disown and cast off a rule which they could not in they own mind but be infallibly certain be a law nor be ignorant that all man they should have to do with know it to be such : and therefore must every one of they apprehend from other all the contempt and abhorrence due to one who profess himself void of humanity : and one who confound the known and natural measure of right and wrong can not but be look on as the profess enemy of they peace and happiness whatever practical principle be innate can not but be know to every one to be just and good it be therefore little less than a contradiction to suppose that whole nation of man should both in they profession and practice unanimously and universally give the lie to what by the most invincible evidence every one of they know to be true right and good this be enough to satisfy we that no practical rule which be anywhere universally and with public approbation or allowance transgress can be suppose innate -- but i have something further to add in answer to this objection 12 the generally allow breach of a rule proof that it be not innate the breaking of a rule say you be no argument that it be unknown i grant it : but the generally allow breach of it anywhere i say be a proof that it be not innate for example : let we take any of these rule which be the most obvious deduction of human reason and conformable to the natural inclination of the greatest part of man fewest people have have the impudence to deny or inconsideration to doubt of if any can be think to be naturally imprint none i think can have a fairer pretence to be innate than this : parent preserve and cherish you child when therefore you say that this be a innate rule what do you mean either that it be a innate principle which upon all occasion excite and direct the action of all man or else that it be a truth which all man have imprint on they mind and which therefore they know and assent to but in neither of these sens be it innate first that it be not a principle which influence all man 's action be what i have prove by the example before cite : nor need we seek so far as the mingrelium or peru to find instance of such as neglect abuse nay and destroy they child or look on it only as the more than brutality of some savage and barbarous nation when we remember that it be a familiar and uncondemned practice amongst the greek and roman to expose without pity or remorse they innocent infant secondly that it be a innate truth know to all man be also false for parent preserve you child be so far from a innate truth that it be no truth at all : it be a command and not a proposition and so not capable of truth or falsehood to make it capable of be assent to as true it must be reduce to some such proposition as this : it be the duty of parent to preserve they child but what duty be can not be understand without a law nor a law be know or suppose without a lawmaker or without reward and punishment so that it be impossible that this or any other practical principle should be innate ie be imprint on the mind as a duty without suppose the idea of god of law of obligation of punishment of a life after this innate : for that punishment follow not in this life the breach of this rule and consequently that it have not the force of a law in country where the generally allow practice run counter to it be in itself evident but these idea -lrb- which must be all of they innate if anything as a duty be so -rrb- be so far from be innate that it be not every studious or think man much less every one that be bear in whom they be to be find clear and distinct and that one of they which of all other seem most likely to be innate be not so -lrb- i mean the idea of god -rrb- i think in the next chapter will appear very evident to any consider man 13 if man can be ignorant of what be innate certainty be not describe by innate principle from what have be say i think we may safely conclude that whatever practical rule be in any place generally and with allowance break can not be suppose innate it be impossible that man should without shame or fear confidently and serenely break a rule which they could not but evidently know that god have set up and would certainly punish the breach of -lrb- which they must if it be innate -rrb- to a degree to make it a very ill bargain to the transgressor without such a knowledge as this a man can never be certain that anything be he duty ignorance or doubt of the law hope to escape the knowledge or power of the law-maker or the like may make man give way to a present appetite but let any one see the fault and the rod by it and with the transgression a fire ready to punish it a pleasure tempting and the hand of the almighty visibly hold up and prepare to take vengeance -lrb- for this must be the case where any duty be imprint on the mind -rrb- and then tell I whether it be possible for people with such a prospect such a certain knowledge as this wantonly and without scruple to offend against a law which they carry about they in indelible character and that stare they in the face whilst they be break it whether man at the same time that they feel in themselves the imprinted edict of a omnipotent law-maker can with assurance and gaiety slight and trample underfoot he most sacred injunction and lastly whether it be possible that whilst a man thus openly bid defiance to this innate law and supreme lawgiver all the bystander yea even the governor and ruler of the people full of the same sense both of the law and law-maker should silently connive without testify they dislike or lay the least blame on it principle of action indeed there be lodge in man 's appetite but these be so far from be innate moral principle that if they be leave to they full swing they would carry man to the overturn of all morality moral law be set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant desire which they can not be but by reward and punishment that will overbalance the satisfaction any one shall propose to himself in the breach of the law if therefore anything be imprint on the mind of all man as a law all man must have a certain and unavoidable knowledge that certain and unavoidable punishment will attend the breach of it for if man can be ignorant or doubtful of what be innate innate principle be insist on and urge to no purpose truth and certainty -lrb- the thing pretend -rrb- be not at all secure by they but man be in the same uncertain float estate with as without they a evident indubitable knowledge of unavoidable punishment great enough to make the transgression very uneligible must accompany a innate law unless with a innate law they can suppose a innate gospel too i would not here be mistake as if because i deny a innate law i think there be none but positive law there be a great deal of difference between a innate law and a law of nature between something imprint on we mind in they very original and something that we be ignorant of may attain to the knowledge of by the use and due application of we natural faculty and i think they equally forsake the truth who run into contrary extreme either affirm a innate law or deny that there be a law knowable by the light of nature ie without the help of positive revelation 14 those who maintain innate practical principle tell we not what they be the difference there be amongst man in they practical principle be so evident that i think i need say no more to evince that it will be impossible to find any innate moral rule by this mark of general assent and it be enough to make one suspect that the supposition of such innate principle be but a opinion take up at pleasure since those who talk so confidently of they be so spare to tell we which they be this might with justice be expect from those man who lay stress upon this opinion and it give occasion to distrust either they knowledge or charity who declare that god have imprint on the mind of man the foundation of knowledge and the rule of living be yet so little favourable to the information of they neighbor or the quiet of mankind as not to point out to they which they be in the variety man be distract with but in truth be there any such innate principle there would be no need to teach they do man find such innate proposition stamp on they mind they would easily be able to distinguish they from other truth that they afterwards learn and deduce from they and there would be nothing more easy than to know what and how many they be there could be no more doubt about they number than there be about the number of we finger and it be like then every system would be ready to give they we by tale but since nobody that i know have venture yet to give a catalogue of they they can not blame those who doubt of these innate principle since even they who require man to believe that there be such innate proposition do not tell we what they be it be easy to foresee that if different man of different sect should go about to give we a list of those innate practical principle they would set down only such as suit they distinct hypothesis and be fit to support the doctrine of they particular school or church a plain evidence that there be no such innate truth nay a great part of man be so far from find any such innate moral principle in themselves that by deny freedom to mankind and thereby make man no other than bare machine they take away not only innate but all moral rule whatsoever and leave not a possibility to believe any such to those who can not conceive how anything can be capable of a law that be not a free agent and upon that ground they must necessarily reject all principle of virtue who can not put morality and mechanism together which be not very easy to be reconcile or make consistent 15 lord herbert 's innate principle examine when i have write this be inform that my lord herbert have in he book de veritate assign these innate principle i presently consult he hope to find in a man of so great part something that might satisfy I in this point and put a end to my inquiry in he chapter de instinctu naturalus i meet with these six mark of he notitice commune : -- 1 priorita 2 independentium 3 universalita 4 certitudo 5 necessita i e as he explain it faciunt ad homini conservationem 6 modus conformationi ie assensus nulla interposita mora and at the latter end of he little treatise de religione laicus he say this of these innate principle : adeo ut non uniuscujusvis religioni confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritate sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae nullisque traditionibus sive scripti sive non scripti obnoxia p3 and veritate nostrae catholica quae tanquam indubia dei emata in foro interiorus descripta thus have give the mark of the innate principle or common notion and assert they be imprint on the mind of man by the hand of god he proceed to set they down and they be these : -- 1 esse aliquod supremum numan 2 numan illud coli debere 3 virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimum esse rationem cultus divinus 4 resipiscendum esse a peccati 5 darus praemium vel paenam post hanc vitam transactam though i allow these to be clear truth and such as if rightly explain a rational creature can hardly avoid give he assent to yet i think he be far from prove they innate impression in foro interiorus descripta for i must take leave to observe : -- 16 these five either not all or more than all if there be any first that these five proposition be either not all or more than all those common notion write on we mind by the finger of god if it be reasonable to believe any at all to be so write since there be other proposition which even by he own rule have as just a pretence to such a original and may be as well admit for innate principle as at least some of these five he enumerate viz ` do as thou wouldst be do unto ' and perhaps some hundred of other when well consider 17 the suppose mark want secondly that all he mark be not to be find in each of he five proposition viz he first second and third mark agree perfectly to neither of they and the first second third fourth and sixth mark agree but ill to he third fourth and fifth proposition for besides that we be assure from history of many man nay whole nation who doubt or disbelieve some or all of they i can not see how the third viz that virtue join with piety be the best worship of god can be a innate principle when the name or sound virtue be so hard to be understand liable to so much uncertainty in its signification and the thing it stand for so much contend about and difficult to be know and therefore this can not be but a very uncertain rule of human practice and serve but very little to the conduct of we life and be therefore very unfit to be assign as a innate practical principle 18 of little use if they be innate for let we consider this proposition as to its meaning -lrb- for it be the sense and not sound that be and must be the principle or common notion -rrb- viz virtue be the best worship of god ie be most acceptable to he which if virtue be take as most commonly it be for those action which accord to the different opinion of several country be account laudable will be a proposition so far from be certain that it will not be true if virtue be take for action conformable to god 's will or to the rule prescribe by god -- which be the true and only measure of virtue when virtue be use to signify what be in its own nature right and good -- then this proposition that virtue be the best worship of god will be most true and certain but of very little use in human life : since it will amount to no more but this viz that god be please with the do of what he command -- which a man may certainly know to be true without know what it be that god doth command and so be as far from any rule or principle of he action as he be before and i think very few will take a proposition which amount to no more than this viz that god be please with the do of what he himself command for a innate moral principle write on the mind of all man -lrb- however true and certain it may be -rrb- since it teach so little whosoever do so will have reason to think hundred of proposition innate principle since there be many which have as good a title as this to be receive for such which nobody yet ever put into that rank of innate principle 19 scarce possible that god should engrave principle in word of uncertain meaning nor be the fourth proposition -lrb- viz man must repent of they sin -rrb- much more instructive till what those action be that be mean by sin be set down for the word pecca or sin be put as it usually be to signify in general ill action that will draw punishment upon the doer what great principle of morality can that be to tell we we should be sorry and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon we without know what those particular action be that will do so indeed this be a very true proposition and fit to be inculcate on and receive by those who be suppose to have be teach what action in all kind be sin : but neither this nor the former can be imagine to be innate principle nor to be of any use if they be innate unless the particular measure and bound of all virtue and vice be engraven in man 's mind and be innate principle also which i think be very much to be doubt and therefore i imagine it will scarcely seem possible that god should engrave principle in man 's mind in word of uncertain signification such as virtue and sin which amongst different man stand for different thing : nay it can not be suppose to be in word at all which be in most of these principle very general name can not be understand but by know the particulars comprehend under they and in the practical instance the measure must be take from the knowledge of the action themselves and the rule of they -- abstract from word and antecedent to the knowledge of name which rule a man must know what language soever he chance to learn whether english or japan or if he should learn no language at all or never should understand the use of word as happen in the case of dumb and deaf man when it shall be make out that man ignorant of word or untaught by the law and custom of they country know that it be part of the worship of god not to kill another man not to know more woman than one not to procure abortion not to expose they child not to take from another what be he though we want it ourselves but on the contrary relieve and supply he want and whenever we have do the contrary we ought to repent be sorry and resolve to do so no more -- when i say all man shall be prove actually to know and allow all these and a thousand other such rule all of which come under these two general word make use of above viz virtute et peccata virtue and sin there will be more reason for admit these and the like for common notion and practical principle yet after all universal consent -lrb- be there any in moral principle -rrb- to truth the knowledge whereof may be attain otherwise would scarce prove they to be innate which be all i contend for 20 objection innate principle may be corrupt answer nor will it be of much moment here to offer that very ready but not very material answer viz that the innate principle of morality may by education and custom and the general opinion of those amongst whom we converse be darken and at last quite worn out of the mind of man which assertion of theirs if true quite take away the argument of universal consent by which this opinion of innate principle be endeavor to be prove unless those man will think it reasonable that they private persuasion or that of they party should pass for universal consent -- a thing not unfrequently do when man presume themselves to be the only master of right reason cast by the vote and opinion of the rest of mankind as not worthy the reckoning and then they argument stand thus : -- the principle which all mankind allow for true be innate those that man of right reason admit be the principle allow by all mankind we and those of we mind be man of reason therefore we agree we principle be innate -- which be a very pretty way of argue and a short cut to infallibility for otherwise it will be very hard to understand how there be some principle which all man do acknowledge and agree in and yet there be none of those principle which be not by depraved custom and ill education blot out of the mind of many man : which be to say that all man admit but yet many man do deny and dissent from they and indeed the supposition of such first principle will serve we to very little purpose and we shall be as much at a loss with as without they if they may by any human power -- such as the will of we teacher or opinion of we companion -- be alter or lose in we : and notwithstanding all this boast of first principle and innate light we shall be as much in the dark and uncertainty as if there be no such thing at all : it be all one to have no rule and one that will warp any way or amongst various and contrary rule not to know which be the right but concern innate principle i desire these man to say whether they can or can not by education and custom be blur and blot out if they can not we must find they in all mankind alike and they must be clear in everybody and if they may suffer variation from adventitious notion we must then find they clearest and most perspicuous nearest the fountain in child and illiterate people who have receive least impression from foreign opinion let they take which side they please they will certainly find it inconsistent with visible matter of fact and daily observation 21 contrary principle in the world i easily grant that there be great number of opinion which by man of different country education and temper be receive and embrace as first and unquestionable principle many whereof both for they absurdity as well opposition to one another it be impossible should be true but yet all those proposition how remote soever from reason be so sacred somewhere or other that man even of good understanding in other matter will sooner part with they life and whatever be dearest to they than suffer themselves to doubt or other to question the truth of they 22 how man commonly come by they principle this however strange it may seem be that which every day 's experience confirm and will not perhaps appear so wonderful if we consider the way and step by which it be bring about and how really it may come to pass that doctrine that have be derive from no better original than the superstition of a nurse or the authority of a old woman may by length of time and consent of neighbor grow up to the dignity of principle in religion or morality for such who be careful -lrb- as they call it -rrb- to principle child well -lrb- and few there be who have not a set of those principle for they which they believe in -rrb- instil into the unwary and as yet unprejudiced understanding -lrb- for white paper receive any character -rrb- those doctrine they would have they retain and profess these be teach they as soon as they have any apprehension and still as they grow up confirm to they either by the open profession or tacit consent of all they have to do with or at least by those of whose wisdom knowledge and piety they have a opinion who never suffer those proposition to be otherwise mention but as the basis and foundation on which they build they religion and manners come by these means to have the reputation of unquestionable self-evident and innate truth 23 principle suppose innate because we do not remember when we begin to hold they to which we may add that when man so instruct be grow up and reflect on they own mind they can not find anything more ancient there than those opinion which be teach they before they memory begin to keep a register of they action or date the time when any new thing appear to they and therefore make no scruple to conclude that those proposition of whose knowledge they can find in themselves no original be certainly the impress of god and nature upon they mind and not teach they by any one else these they entertain and submit to as many do to they parent with veneration not because it be natural : nor do child do it where they be not so teach but because have be always so educate and have no remembrance of the beginning of this respect they think it be natural 24 how such principle come to be hold this will appear very likely and almost unavoidable to come to pass if we consider the nature of mankind and the constitution of human affair wherein most man can not live without employ they time in the daily labor of they calling nor be at quiet in they mind without some foundation or principle to rest they thought on there be scarcely any one so float and superficial in he understanding who have not some reverenced proposition which be to he the principle on which he bottom he reasoning and by which he judgeth of truth and falsehood right and wrong which some want skill and leisure and other the inclination and some be teach that they ought not to examine there be few to be find who be not expose by they ignorance laziness education or precipitancy to take they upon trust 25 further explain this be evidently the case of all child and young folk and custom a greater power than nature seldom fail to make they worship for divine what she have inure they to bow they mind and submit they understanding to it be no wonder that grow man either perplexed in the necessary affair of life or hot in the pursuit of pleasure should not seriously sit down to examine they own tenet especially when one of they principle be that principle ought not to be question and have man leisure part and will who be there almost that dare shake the foundation of all he past thought and action and endure to bring upon himself the shame of have be a long time wholly in mistake and error who be there hardy enough to contend with the reproach which be everywhere prepare for those who dare venture to dissent from the receive opinion of they country or party and where be the man to be find that can patiently prepare himself to bear the name of whimsical sceptical or atheist which he be sure to meet with who do in the least scruple any of the common opinion and he will be much more afraid to question those principle when he shall think they as most man do the standard set up by god in he mind to be the rule and touchstone of all other opinion and what can hinder he from think they sacred when he find they the earliest of all he own thought and the most reverenced by other 26 a worship of idol it be easy to imagine how by these mean it come to pass that man worship the idol that have be set up in they mind grow fond of the notion they have be long acquaint with there and stamp the character of divinity upon absurdity and error become zealous votary to bull and monkey and contend too fight and die in defense of they opinion _ dum solo credit habendo esse deo quo ipse colit _ for since the reasoning faculty of the soul which be almost constantly though not always warily nor wisely employ would not know how to move for want of a foundation and footing in most man who through laziness or avocation do not or for want of time or true help or for other cause can not penetrate into the principle of knowledge and trace truth to its fountain and original it be natural for they and almost unavoidable to take up with some borrow principle which be repute and presume to be the evident proof of other thing be think not to need any other proof themselves whoever shall receive any of these into he mind and entertain they there with the reverence usually pay to principle never venture to examine they but accustom himself to believe they because they be to be believe may take up from he education and the fashion of he country any absurdity for innate principle and by long pore on the same object so dim he sight as to take monster lodge in he own brain for the image of the deity and the workmanship of he hand 27 principle must be examine by this progress how many there be who arrive at principle which they believe innate may be easily observe in the variety of opposite principle hold and contend for by all sort and degree of man and he that shall deny this to be the method wherein most man proceed to the assurance they have of the truth and evidence of they principle will perhaps find it a hard matter any other way to account for the contrary tenet which be firmly believe confidently assert and which great number be ready at any time to seal with they blood and indeed if it be the privilege of innate principle to be receive upon they own authority without examination i know not what may not be believe or how any one 's principle can be question if they may and ought to be examine and try i desire to know how first and innate principle can be try or at least it be reasonable to demand the mark and character whereby the genuine innate principle may be distinguish from other : that so amidst the great variety of pretender i may be keep from mistake in so material a point as this when this be do i shall be ready to embrace such welcome and useful proposition and till then i may with modesty doubt since i fear universal consent which be the only one produce will scarcely prove a sufficient mark to direct my choice and assure I of any innate principle from what have be say i think it past doubt that there be no practical principle wherein all man agree and therefore none innate chapter iii other consideration concern innate principle both speculative and practical 1 principle not innate unless they idea be innate have those who would persuade we that there be innate principle not take they together in gross but consider separately the part out of which those proposition be make they would not perhaps have be so forward to believe they be innate since if the idea which make up those truth be not it be impossible that the proposition make up of they should be innate or we knowledge of they be bear with we for if the idea be not innate there be a time when the mind be without those principle and then they will not be innate but be derive from some other original for where the idea themselves be not there can be no knowledge no assent no mental or verbal proposition about they 2 idea especially those belong to principle not bear with child if we will attentively consider new-born child we shall have little reason to think that they bring many idea into the world with they for bate perhaps some faint idea of hunger and thirst and warmth and some pain which they may have feel in the womb there be not the least appearance of any settle idea at all in they especially of idea answer the term which make up those universal proposition that be esteem innate principle one may perceive how by degree afterwards idea come into they mind and that they get no more nor other than what experience and the observation of thing that come in they way furnish they with which might be enough to satisfy we that they be not original character stamp on the mind 3 impossibility and identity not innate idea it be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be be certainly -lrb- if there be any such -rrb- a innate principle but can any one think or will any one say that impossibility and identity be two innate idea be they such as all mankind have and bring into the world with they and be they those which be the first in child and antecedent to all acquire one if they be innate they must need be so have a child a idea of impossibility and identity before it have of white or black sweet or bitter and be it from the knowledge of this principle that it conclude that wormwood rub on the nipple have not the same taste that it use to receive from thence be it the actual knowledge of impossibile est idem esse et non esse that make a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger or that make it fond of the one and flee the other or do the mind regulate itself and its assent by idea that it never yet have or the understanding draw conclusion from principle which it never yet know or understand the name impossibility and identity stand for two idea so far from be innate or bear with we that i think it require great care and attention to form they right in we understanding they be so far from be bring into the world with we so remote from the thought of infancy and childhood that i believe upon examination it will be find that many grown man want they 4 identity a idea not innate if identity -lrb- to instance that alone -rrb- be a native impression and consequently so clear and obvious to we that we must need know it even from we cradle i would gladly be resolve by any one of seven or seventy year old whether a man be a creature consist of soul and body be the same man when he body be change whether euphorbus and pythagora have have the same soul be the same man though they live several age asunder nay whether the cock too which have the same soul be not the same with both of they whereby perhaps it will appear that we idea of sameness be not so settled and clear as to deserve to be think innate in we for if those innate idea be not clear and distinct so as to be universally know and naturally agree on they can not be subject of universal and undoubted truth but will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty for i suppose every one 's idea of identity will not be the same that pythagora and thousand of he follower have and which then shall be true which innate or be there two different idea of identity both innate 5 what make the same man nor let any one think that the question i have here propose about the identity of man be bare empty speculation which if they be would be enough to show that there be in the understanding of man no innate idea of identity he that shall with a little attention reflect on the resurrection and consider that divine justice will bring to judgment at the last day the very same person to be happy or miserable in the other who do well or ill in this life will find it perhaps not easy to resolve with himself what make the same man or wherein identity consist and will not be forward to think he and every one even child themselves have naturally a clear idea of it 6 whole and part not innate idea let we examine that principle of mathematics viz that the whole be bigger than a part this i take it be reckon amongst innate principle i be sure it have as good a title as any to be think so which yet nobody can think it to be when he consider the idea it comprehend in it whole and part be perfectly relative but the positive idea to which they properly and immediately belong be extension and number of which alone whole and part be relation so that if whole and part be innate idea extension and number must be so too it be impossible to have a idea of a relation without have any at all of the thing to which it belong and in which it be found now whether the mind of man have naturally imprint on they the idea of extension and number i leave to be consider by those who be the patron of innate principle 7 idea of worship not innate that god be to be worship be without doubt as great a truth as any that can enter into the mind of man and deserve the first place amongst all practical principle but yet it can by no means be think innate unless the idea of god and worship be innate that the idea the term worship stand for be not in the understanding of child and a character stamp on the mind in its first original i think will be easily grant by any one that consider how few there be amongst grow man who have a clear and distinct notion of it and i suppose there can not be anything more ridiculous than to say that child have this practical principle innate that god be to be worship and yet that they know not what that worship of god be which be they duty but to pass by this 8 idea of god not innate if any idea can be imagine innate the idea of god may of all other for many reason be think so since it be hard to conceive how there should be innate moral principle without a innate idea of a deity without a notion of a law-maker it be impossible to have a notion of a law and a obligation to observe it besides the atheist take notice of amongst the ancient and leave brand upon the record of history have not navigation discover in these later age whole nation at the bay of soldanium in brazil and in the caribbee island & c amongst whom there be to be find no notion of a god no religion nicholaus del techo in literis ex paraquaria de caiguarum conversione have these word : reperus eam gentem nullum nomen habere quod deum et hominis animam significet nullum sacra habet nulla idola and perhaps if we should with attention mind the life and discourse of people not so far off we should have too much reason to fear that many in more civilized country have no very strong and clear impression of a deity upon they mind and that the complaint of atheism make from the pulpit be not without reason and though only some profligate wretch own it too barefacedly now yet perhaps we should hear more than we do of it from other do not the fear of the magistrate 's sword or they neighbor 's censure tie up people 's tongue which be the apprehension of punishment or shame take away would as openly proclaim they atheism as they life do 9 the name of god not universal or obscure in mean but have all mankind everywhere a notion of a god -lrb- whereof yet history tell we the contrary -rrb- it would not from thence follow that the idea of he be innate for though no nation be to be find without a name and some few dark notion of he yet that would not prove they to be natural impression on the mind no more than the name of fire or the sun heat or number do prove the idea they stand for to be innate because the name of those thing and the idea of they be so universally receive and know amongst mankind nor on the contrary be the want of such a name or the absence of such a notion out of man 's mind any argument against the being of a god any more than it would be a proof that there be no loadstone in the world because a great part of mankind have neither a notion of any such thing nor a name for it or be any show of argument to prove that there be no distinct and various species of angel or intelligent being above we because we have no idea of such distinct species or name for they for man be furnish with word by the common language of they own country can scarce avoid have some kind of idea of those thing whose name those they converse with have occasion frequently to mention to they and if they carry with it the notion of excellency greatness or something extraordinary if apprehension and concernment accompany it if the fear of absolute and irresistible power set it on upon the mind -- the idea be likely to sink the deeper and spread the further especially if it be such a idea as be agreeable to the common light of reason and naturally deducible from every part of we knowledge as that of a god be for the visible mark of extraordinary wisdom and power appear so plainly in all the work of the creation that a rational creature who will but seriously reflect on they can not miss the discovery of a deity and the influence that the discovery of such a be must necessarily have on the mind of all that have but once hear of it be so great and carry such a weight of thought and communication with it that it seem stranger to I that a whole nation of man should be anywhere find so brutish as to want the notion of a god than that they should be without any notion of number or fire 10 idea of god and idea of fire the name of god be once mention in any part of the world to express a superior powerful wise invisible be the suitableness of such a notion to the principle of common reason and the interest man will always have to mention it often must necessarily spread it far and wide and continue it down to all generation : though yet the general reception of this name and some imperfect and unsteady notion convey thereby to the unthinking part of mankind prove not the idea to be innate but only that they who make the discovery have make a right use of they reason think maturely of the cause of thing and trace they to they original from whom other less consider people have once receive so important a notion it could not easily be lose again 11 idea of god not innate this be all could be infer from the notion of a god be it to be find universally in all the tribe of mankind and generally acknowledge by man grow to maturity in all country for the generality of the acknowledge of a god as i imagine be extend no further than that which if it be sufficient to prove the idea of god innate will as well prove the idea of fire innate since i think it may be truly say that there be not a person in the world who have a notion of a god who have not also the idea of fire i doubt not but if a colony of young child should be place in a island where no fire be they would certainly neither have any notion of such a thing nor name for it how generally soever it be receive and know in all the world besides and perhaps too they apprehension would be as far remove from any name or notion of a god till some one amongst they have employ he thought to inquire into the constitution and cause of thing which would easily lead he to the notion of a god which have once teach to other reason and the natural propensity of they own thought would afterwards propagate and continue amongst they 12 suitable to god 's goodness that all man should have a idea of he therefore naturally imprint by he answer indeed it be urge that it be suitable to the goodness of god to imprint upon the mind of man character and notion of himself and not to leave they in the dark and doubt in so grand a concernment and also by that mean to secure to himself the homage and veneration due from so intelligent a creature as man and therefore he have do it this argument if it be of any force will prove much more than those who use it in this case expect from it for if we may conclude that god have do for man all that man shall judge be best for they because it be suitable to he goodness so to do it will prove not only that god have imprint on the mind of man a idea of himself but that he have plainly stamp there in fair character all that man ought to know or believe of he all that they ought to do in obedience to he will and that he have give they a will and affection conformable to it this no doubt every one will think better for man than that they should in the dark grope after knowledge as st paul tell we all nation do after god -lrb- act xvii 27 -rrb- than that they will should clash with they understanding and they appetite cross they duty the romanist say it be best for man and so suitable to the goodness of god that there should be a infallible judge of controversy on earth and therefore there be one and i by the same reason say it be better for man that every man himself should be infallible i leave they to consider whether by the force of this argument they shall think that every man be so i think it a very good argument to say -- the infinitely wise god have make it so and therefore it be best but it seem to I a little too much confidence of we own wisdom to say -- ' i think it best and therefore god have make it so ' and in the matter in hand it will be in vain to argue from such a topic that god have do so when certain experience show we that he have not but the goodness of god have not be want to man without such original impression of knowledge or idea stamp on the mind since he have furnished man with those faculty which will serve for the sufficient discovery of all thing requisite to the end of such a be and i doubt not but to show that a man by the right use of he natural ability may without any innate principle attain a knowledge of a god and other thing that concern he god have endue man with those faculty of knowledge which he have be no more oblige by he goodness to plant those innate notion in he mind than that have give he reason hand and material he should build he bridge or house -- which some people in the world however of good part do either totally want or be but ill provide of as well as other be wholly without idea of god and principle of morality or at least have but very ill one the reason in both case be that they never employ they part faculty and power industriously that way but contented themselves with the opinion fashion and thing of they country as they find they without look any further have you or i be bear at the bay of soldanium possibly we thought and notion have not exceed those brutish one of the hottentot that inhabit there and have the virginia king apochancana be educate in england he have be perhaps as know a divine and as good a mathematician as any in it the difference between he and a more improved englishman lie barely in this that the exercise of he faculty be bound within the way mode and notion of he own country and never direct to any other or further inquiry and if he have not any idea of a god it be only because he pursue not those thought that would have lead he to it 13 idea of god various in different man i grant that if there be any idea to be find imprint on the mind of man we have reason to expect it should be the notion of he maker as a mark god set on he own workmanship to mind man of he dependence and duty and that herein should appear the first instance of human knowledge but how late be it before any such notion be discoverable in child and when we find it there how much more do it resemble the opinion and notion of the teacher than represent the true god he that shall observe in child the progress whereby they mind attain the knowledge they have will think that the object they do first and most familiarly converse with be those that make the first impression on they understanding nor will he find the least footstep of any other it be easy to take notice how they thought enlarge themselves only as they come to be acquaint with a greater variety of sensible object to retain the idea of they in they memory and to get the skill to compound and enlarge they and several way put they together how by these means they come to frame in they mind a idea man have of a deity i shall hereafter show 14 contrary and inconsistent idea of god under the same name can it be think that the idea man have of god be the character and mark of himself engraven in they mind by he own finger when we see that in the same country under one and the same name man have far different nay often contrary and inconsistent idea and conception of he they agree in a name or sound will scarce prove a innate notion of he 15 gross idea of god what true or tolerable notion of a deity could they have who acknowledge and worship hundred every deity that they own above one be a infallible evidence of they ignorance of he and a proof that they have no true notion of god where unity infinity and eternity be exclude to which if we add they gross conception of corporeity express in they image and representation of they deity the amours marriage copulation lust quarrel and other mean quality attribute by they to they god we shall have little reason to think that the heathen world ie the greatest part of mankind have such idea of god in they mind as he himself out of care that they should not be mistake about he be author of and this universality of consent so much argue if it prove any native impression it will be only this : -- that god imprint on the mind of all man speak the same language a name for himself but not any idea since those people who agree in the name have at the same time far different apprehension about the thing signify if they say that the variety of deity worship by the heathen world be but figurative way of express the several attribute of that incomprehensible be or several part of he providence i answer : what they might be in the original i will not here inquire but that they be so in the thought of the vulgar i think nobody will affirm and he that will consult the voyage of the bishop of beryte c 13 -lrb- not to mention other testimony -rrb- will find that the theology of the siamite professedly own a plurality of god : or as the abbe de choisy more judiciously remark in he journal du voyage de siam 107\/177 it consist properly in acknowledge no god at all 16 idea of god not innate although wise man of all nation come to have it if it be say that wise man of all nation come to have true conception of the unity and infinity of the deity i grant it but then this first exclude universality of consent in anything but the name for those wise man be very few perhaps one of a thousand this universality be very narrow secondly it seem to I plainly to prove that the truest and best notion man have of god be not imprint but acquire by thought and meditation and a right use of they faculty : since the wise and considerate man of the world by a right and careful employment of they thought and reason attain true notion in this as well as other thing whilst the lazy and inconsiderate part of man make far the greater number take up they notion by chance from common tradition and vulgar conception without much beat they head about they and if it be a reason to think the notion of god innate because all wise man have it virtue too must be think innate for that also wise man have always have 17 odd low and pitiful idea of god common among man this be evidently the case of all gentilism nor have even amongst jew christian and mahometan who acknowledge but one god this doctrine and the care take in those nation to teach man to have true notion of a god prevail so far as to make man to have the same and the true idea of he how many even amongst we will be find upon inquiry to fancy he in the shape of a man sit in heaven and to have many other absurd and unfit conception of he christian as well as turk have have whole sect own and contend earnestly for it -- that the deity be corporeal and of human shape : and though we find few now amongst we who profess themselves anthropomorphite -lrb- though some i have meet with that own it -rrb- yet i believe he that will make it he business may find amongst the ignorant and uninstructed christian many of that opinion talk but with country people almost of any age or young people almost of any condition and you shall find that though the name of god be frequently in they mouth yet the notion they apply this name to be so odd low and pitiful that nobody can imagine they be teach by a rational man much less that they be character write by the finger of god himself nor do i see how it derogate more from the goodness of god that he have give we mind unfurnished with these idea of himself than that he have send we into the world with body unclothed and that there be no art or skill bear with we for be fit with faculty to attain these it be want of industry and consideration in we and not of bounty in he if we have they not it be as certain that there be a god as that the opposite angle make by the intersection of two straight line be equal there be never any rational creature that set himself sincerely to examine the truth of these proposition that could fail to assent to they though yet it be past doubt that there be many man who have not apply they thought that way be ignorant both of the one and the other if any one think fit to call this -lrb- which be the utmost of its extent -rrb- universal consent such a one i easily allow but such a universal consent as this prove not the idea of god any more than it do the idea of such angle innate 18 if the idea of god be not innate no other can be suppose innate since then though the knowledge of a god be the most natural discovery of human reason yet the idea of he be not innate as i think be evident from what have be say i imagine there will be scarce any other idea find that can pretend to it since if god have set any impression any character on the understanding of man it be most reasonable to expect it should have be some clear and uniform idea of himself as far as we weak capacity be capable to receive so incomprehensible and infinite a object but we mind be at first void of that idea which we be most concerned to have it be a strong presumption against all other innate character i must own as far as i can observe i can find none and would be glad to be inform by any other 19 idea of substance not innate i confess there be another idea which would be of general use for mankind to have as it be of general talk as if they have it and that be the idea of substance which we neither have nor can have by sensation or reflection if nature take care to provide we any idea we might well expect they should be such as by we own faculty we can not procure to ourselves but we see on the contrary that since by those way whereby other idea be bring into we mind this be not we have no such clear idea at all and therefore signify nothing by the word substance but only a uncertain supposition of we know not what i e of something whereof we have no idea which we take to be the substratum or support of those idea we do know 20 no proposition can be innate since no idea be innate whatever then we talk of innate either speculative or practical principle it may with as much probability be say that a man have 100 pound sterling in he pocket and yet deny that he have there either penny shilling crown or other coin out of which the sum be to be make up as to think that certain proposition be innate when the idea about which they be can by no means be suppose to be so the general reception and assent that be give doth not at all prove that the idea express in they be innate for in many case however the idea come there the assent to word express the agreement or disagreement of such idea will necessarily follow every one that have a true idea of god and worship will assent to this proposition ` that god be to be worship ' when express in a language he understand and every rational man that have not think on it to-day may be ready to assent to this proposition to-morrow and yet million of man may be well suppose to want one or both those idea to-day for if we will allow savage and most country people to have idea of god and worship -lrb- which conversation with they will not make one forward to believe -rrb- yet i think few child can be suppose to have those idea which therefore they must begin to have some time or other and then they will also begin to assent to that proposition and make very little question of it ever after but such a assent upon hearing no more prove the idea to be innate than it do that one bear blind -lrb- with cataract which will be couch to-morrow -rrb- have the innate idea of the sun or light or saffron or yellow because when he sight be clear he will certainly assent to this proposition that the sun be lucid or that saffron be yellow and therefore if such a assent upon hearing can not prove the idea innate it can much less the proposition make up of those idea if they have any innate idea i would be glad to be tell what and how many they be 21 no innate idea in the memory to which let I add : if there be any innate idea any idea in the mind which the mind do not actually think on they must be lodge in the memory and from thence must be bring into view by remembrance i e must be know when they be remember to have be perception in the mind before unless remembrance can be without remembrance for to remember be to perceive anything with memory or with a consciousness that it be perceive or know before without this whatever idea come into the mind be new and not remember this consciousness of its have be in the mind before be that which distinguish remember from all other way of think whatever idea be never perceive by the mind be never in the mind whatever idea be in the mind be either a actual perception or else have be a actual perception be so in the mind that by the memory it can be make a actual perception again whenever there be the actual perception of any idea without memory the idea appear perfectly new and unknown before to the understanding whenever the memory bring any idea into actual view it be with a consciousness that it have be there before and be not wholly a stranger to the mind whether this be not so i appeal to every one 's observation and then i desire a instance of a idea pretend to be innate which -lrb- before any impression of it by way hereafter to be mention -rrb- any one could revive and remember as a idea he have formerly know without which consciousness of a former perception there be no remembrance and whatever idea come into the mind without that consciousness be not remembered or come not out of the memory nor can be say to be in the mind before that appearance for what be not either actually in view or in the memory be in the mind no way at all and be all one as if it have never be there suppose a child have the use of he eye till he know and distinguish color but then cataract shut the window and he be forty or fifty year perfectly in the dark and in that time perfectly lose all memory of the idea of color he once have this be the case of a blind man i once talk with who lose he sight by the small-pox when he be a child and have no more notion of color than one bear blind i ask whether any one can say this man have then any idea of color in he mind any more than one bear blind and i think nobody will say that either of they have in he mind any idea of color at all he cataract be couch and then he have the idea -lrb- which he remember not -rrb- of color de novo by he restore sight convey to he mind and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance and these now he can revive and call to mind in the dark in this case all these idea of color which when out of view can be revive with a consciousness of a former acquaintance be thus in the memory be say to be in the mind the use i make of this be -- that whatever idea be not actually in view be in the mind be there only by be in the memory and if it be not in the memory it be not in the mind and if it be in the memory it can not by the memory be bring into actual view without a perception that it come out of the memory which be this that it have be know before and be now remember if therefore there be any innate idea they must be in the memory or else nowhere in the mind and if they be in the memory they can be revive without any impression from without and whenever they be bring into the mind they be remembered i e they bring with they a perception of they not be wholly new to it this be a constant and distinguishing difference between what be and what be not in the memory or in the mind -- that what be not in the memory whenever it appear there appear perfectly new and unknown before and what be in the memory or in the mind whenever it be suggest by the memory appear not to be new but the mind find it in itself and know it be there before by this it may be try whether there be any innate idea in the mind before impression from sensation or reflection i would fain meet with the man who when he come to the use of reason or at any other time remember any of they and to whom after he be bear they be never new if any one will say there be idea in the mind that be not in the memory i desire he to explain himself and make what he say intelligible 22 principle not innate because of little use or little certainty besides what i have already say there be another reason why i doubt that neither these nor any other principle be innate i that be fully persuade that the infinitely wise god make all thing in perfect wisdom can not satisfy myself why he should be suppose to print upon the mind of man some universal principle whereof those that be pretended innate and concern speculation be of no great use and those that concern practice not self-evident and neither of they distinguishable from some other truth not allow to be innate for to what purpose should character be grave on the mind by the finger of god which be not clearer there than those which be afterwards introduce or can not be distinguish from they if any one think there be such innate idea and proposition which by they clearness and usefulness be distinguishable from all that be adventitious in the mind and acquire it will not be a hard matter for he to tell we which they be and then every one will be a fit judge whether they be so or no since if there be such innate idea and impression plainly different from all other perception and knowledge every one will find it true in himself of the evidence of these suppose innate maxim i have speak already : of they usefulness i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter 23 difference of man 's discovery depend upon the different application of they faculty to conclude : some idea forwardly offer themselves to all man 's understanding and some sort of truth result from any idea as soon as the mind put they into proposition : other truth require a train of idea place in order a due compare of they and deduction make with attention before they can be discover and assent to some of the first sort because of they general and easy reception have be mistake for innate : but the truth be idea and notion be no more bear with we than art and science though some of they indeed offer themselves to we faculty more readily than other and therefore be more generally receive : though that too be accord as the organ of we body and power of we mind happen to be employ god have fit man with faculty and mean to discover receive and retain truth accord as they be employ the great difference that be to be find in the notion of mankind be from the different use they put they faculty to whilst some -lrb- and those the most -rrb- take thing upon trust misemploy they power of assent by lazily enslave they mind to the dictate and dominion of other in doctrine which it be they duty carefully to examine and not blindly with a implicit faith to swallow other employ they thought only about some few thing grow acquaint sufficiently with they attain great degree of knowledge in they and be ignorant of all other have never let they thought loose in the search of other inquiry thus that the three angle of a triangle be quite equal to two right one be a truth as certain as anything can be and i think more evident than many of those proposition that go for principle and yet there be million however expert in other thing who know not this at all because they never set they thought on work about such angle and he that certainly know this proposition may yet be utterly ignorant of the truth of other proposition in mathematics itself which be as clear and evident as this because in he search of those mathematical truth he stop he thought short and go not so far the same may happen concern the notion we have of the being of a deity for though there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to himself than the existence of a god yet he that shall content himself with thing as he find they in this world as they minister to he pleasure and passion and not make inquiry a little further into they cause end and admirable contrivance and pursue the thought thereof with diligence and attention may live long without any notion of such a be and if any person have by talk put such a notion into he head he may perhaps believe it but if he have never examine it he knowledge of it will be no perfecter than he who have be tell that the three angle of a triangle be equal to two right one take it upon trust without examine the demonstration and may yield he assent as a probable opinion but have no knowledge of the truth of it which yet he faculty if carefully employ be able to make clear and evident to he but this only by the by to show how much we knowledge depend upon the right use of those power nature have bestow upon we and how little upon such innate principle as be in vain suppose to be in all mankind for they direction which all man could not but know if they be there or else they would be there to no purpose and which since all man do not know nor can distinguish from other adventitious truth we may well conclude there be no such 24 man must think and know for themselves what censure doubting thus of innate principle may deserve from man who will be apt to call it pull up the old foundation of knowledge and certainty i can not tell -- i persuade myself at least that the way i have pursue be conformable to truth lay those foundation surer this i be certain i have not make it my business either to quit or follow any authority in the ensue discourse truth have be my only aim and wherever that have appear to lead my thought have impartially follow without mind whether the footstep of any other lay that way or not not that i want a due respect to other man 's opinion but after all the greatest reverence be due to truth : and i hope it will not be think arrogance to say that perhaps we should make greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative knowledge if we seek it in the fountain in the consideration of thing themselves and make use rather of we own thought than other man 's to find it for i think we may as rationally hope to see with other man 's eye as to know by other man 's understanding so much as we ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason so much we possess of real and true knowledge the float of other man 's opinion in we brain make we not one jot the more know though they happen to be true what in they be science be in we but opiniatrety whilst we give up we assent only to reverend name and do not as they do employ we own reason to understand those truth which give they reputation aristotle be certainly a know man but nobody ever think he so because he blindly embrace and confidently vent the opinion of another and if the take up of another 's principle without examine they make not he a philosopher i suppose it will hardly make anybody else so in the science every one have so much as he really know and comprehend what he believe only and take upon trust be but shred which however well in the whole piece make no considerable addition to he stock who gather they such borrow wealth like fairy money though it be gold in the hand from which he receive it will be but leave and dust when it come to use 25 whence the opinion of innate principle when man have find some general proposition that could not be doubt of as soon as understand it be i know a short and easy way to conclude they innate this be once receive it ease the lazy from the pain of search and stop the inquiry of the doubtful concern all that be once style innate and it be of no small advantage to those who affect to be master and teacher to make this the principle of principle -- that principle must not be question for have once establish this tenet -- that there be innate principle it put they follower upon a necessity of receive some doctrine as such which be to take they off from the use of they own reason and judgment and put they on believe and take they upon trust without further examination : in which posture of blind credulity they might be more easily govern by and make useful to some sort of man who have the skill and office to principle and guide they nor be it a small power it give one man over another to have the authority to be the dictator of principle and teacher of unquestionable truth and to make a man swallow that for a innate principle which may serve to he purpose who teacheth they whereas have they examine the way whereby man come to the knowledge of many universal truth they would have find they to result in the mind of man from the being of thing themselves when duly consider and that they be discover by the application of those faculty that be fit by nature to receive and judge of they when duly employ about they 26 conclusion to show how the understanding proceed herein be the design of the follow discourse which i shall proceed to when i have first premise that hitherto -- to clear my way to those foundation which i conceive be the only true one whereon to establish those notion we can have of we own knowledge -- it have be necessary for I to give a account of the reason i have to doubt of innate principle and since the argument which be against they do some of they rise from common receive opinion i have be force to take several thing for grant which be hardly avoidable to any one whose task be to show the falsehood or improbability of any tenet -- it happen in controversial discourse as it do in assault of town where if the ground be but firm whereon the battery be erect there be no further inquiry of whom it be borrow nor whom it belong to so it afford but a fit rise for the present purpose but in the future part of this discourse design to raise a edifice uniform and consistent with itself as far as my own experience and observation will assist I i hope to erect it on such a basis that i shall not need to shore it up with prop and buttress lean on borrow or beg foundation : or at least if mine prove a castle in the air i will endeavor it shall be all of a piece and hang together wherein i warn the reader not to expect undeniable cogent demonstration unless i may be allow the privilege not seldom assume by other to take my principle for grant and then i doubt not but i can demonstrate too all that i shall say for the principle i proceed on be that i can only appeal to man 's own unprejudiced experience and observation whether they be true or not and this be enough for a man who profess no more than to lay down candidly and freely he own conjecture concern a subject lie somewhat in the dark without any other design than a unbiassed inquiry after truth book ii of idea chapter i of idea in general and they original 1 idea be the object of think every man be conscious to himself that he think and that which he mind be apply about whilst think be the idea that be there it be past doubt that man have in they mind several idea -- such as be those express by the word whiteness hardness sweetness think motion man elephant army drunkenness and other : it be in the first place then to be inquire how he come by they i know it be a receive doctrine that man have native idea and original character stamp upon they mind in they very first be this opinion i have at large examine already and i suppose what i have say in the foregoing book will be much more easily admit when i have show whence the understanding may get all the idea it have and by what way and degree they may come into the mind -- for which i shall appeal to every one 's own observation and experience 2 all idea come from sensation or reflection let we then suppose the mind to be as we say white paper void of all character without any idea : -- how come it to be furnished whence come it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man have paint on it with a almost endless variety whence have it all the material of reason and knowledge to this i answer in one word from experience in that all we knowledge be found and from that it ultimately derive itself we observation employ either about external sensible object or about the internal operation of we mind perceive and reflect on by ourselves be that which supply we understanding with all the material of think these two be the fountain of knowledge from whence all the idea we have or can naturally have do spring 3 the object of sensation one source of idea first we sens conversant about particular sensible object do convey into the mind several distinct perception of thing accord to those various way wherein those object do affect they and thus we come by those idea we have of yellow white heat cold soft hard bitter sweet and all those which we call sensible quality which when i say the sens convey into the mind i mean they from external object convey into the mind what produce there those perception this great source of most of the idea we have depend wholly upon we sens and derive by they to the understanding i call sensation 4 the operation of we mind the other source of they secondly the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with idea be -- the perception of the operation of we own mind within we as it be employ about the idea it have get -- which operation when the soul come to reflect on and consider do furnish the understanding with another set of idea which could not be have from thing without and such be perception think doubt believe reasoning know willing and all the different acting of we own mind -- which we be conscious of and observe in ourselves do from these receive into we understanding as distinct idea as we do from body affect we sens this source of idea every man have wholly in himself and though it be not sense as have nothing to do with external object yet it be very like it and might properly enough be call internal sense but as i call the other sensation so i call this reflection the idea it afford be such only as the mind get by reflect on its own operation within itself by reflection then in the follow part of this discourse i would be understand to mean that notice which the mind take of its own operation and the manner of they by reason whereof there come to be idea of these operation in the understand these two i say viz external material thing as the object of sensation and the operation of we own mind within as the object of reflection be to I the only original from whence all we idea take they beginning the term operation here i use in a large sense as comprehend not barely the action of the mind about its idea but some sort of passion arise sometimes from they such as be the satisfaction or uneasiness arise from any thought 5 all we idea be of the one or of the other of these the understanding seem to I not to have the least glimmering of any idea which it doth not receive from one of these two external object furnish the mind with the idea of sensible quality which be all those different perception they produce in we and the mind furnish the understanding with idea of its own operation these when we have take a full survey of they and they several mode and the composition make out of they we shall find to contain all we whole stock of idea and that we have nothing in we mind which do not come in one of these two way let any one examine he own thought and thoroughly search into he understanding and then let he tell I whether all the original idea he have there be any other than of the object of he sens or of the operation of he mind consider as object of he reflection and how great a mass of knowledge soever he imagine to be lodge there he will upon take a strict view see that he have not any idea in he mind but what one of these two have imprint -- though perhaps with infinite variety compound and enlarged by the understanding as we shall see hereafter 6 observable in child he that attentively consider the state of a child at he first come into the world will have little reason to think he store with plenty of idea that be to be the matter of he future knowledge it be by degree he come to be furnish with they and though the idea of obvious and familiar quality imprint themselves before the memory begin to keep a register of time or order yet it be often so late before some unusual quality come in the way that there be few man that can not recollect the beginning of they acquaintance with they and if it be worth while no doubt a child might be so order as to have but a very few even of the ordinary idea till he be grow up to a man but all that be bear into the world be surround with body that perpetually and diversely affect they variety of idea whether care be take of it or not be imprint on the mind of child light and color be busy at hand everywhere when the eye be but open sound and some tangible quality fail not to solicit they proper sens and force a entrance to the mind -- but yet i think it will be grant easily that if a child be keep in a place where he never see any other but black and white till he be a man he would have no more idea of scarlet or green than he that from he childhood never taste a oyster or a pine-apple have of those particular relish 7 man be differently furnish with these accord to the different object they converse with man then come to be furnish with fewer or more simple idea from without accord as the object they converse with afford greater or less variety and from the operation of they mind within accord as they more or less reflect on they for though he that contemplate the operation of he mind can not but have plain and clear idea of they yet unless he turn he thought that way and consider they attentively he will no more have clear and distinct idea of all the operation of he mind and all that may be observe therein than he will have all the particular idea of any landscape or of the part and motion of a clock who will not turn he eye to it and with attention heed all the part of it the picture or clock may be so place that they may come in he way every day but yet he will have but a confused idea of all the part they be make up of till he apply himself with attention to consider they each in particular 8 idea of reflection later because they need attention and hence we see the reason why it be pretty late before most child get idea of the operation of they own mind and some have not any very clear or perfect idea of the greatest part of they all they life because though they pass there continually yet like float vision they make not deep impression enough to leave in they mind clear distinct lasting idea till the understanding turn inward upon itself reflect on its own operation and make they the object of its own contemplation child when they come first into it be surround with a world of new thing which by a constant solicitation of they sens draw the mind constantly to they forward to take notice of new and apt to be delighted with the variety of change object thus the first year be usually employ and divert in look abroad man 's business in they be to acquaint themselves with what be to be find without and so grow up in a constant attention to outward sensation seldom make any considerable reflection on what pass within they till they come to be of riper year and some scarce ever at all 9 the soul begin to have idea when it begin to perceive to ask at what time a man have first any idea be to ask when he begin to perceive -- have idea and perception be the same thing i know it be a opinion that the soul always think and that it have the actual perception of idea in itself constantly as long as it exist and that actual thinking be as inseparable from the soul as actual extension be from the body which if true to inquire after the beginning of a man 's idea be the same as to inquire after the beginning of he soul for by this account soul and its idea as body and its extension will begin to exist both at the same time 10 the soul think not always for this want proof but whether the soul be suppose to exist antecedent to or coeval with or some time after the first rudiment of organization or the beginning of life in the body i leave to be dispute by those who have better thought of that matter i confess myself to have one of those dull soul that doth not perceive itself always to contemplate idea nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to think than for the body always to move : the perception of idea be -lrb- as i conceive -rrb- to the soul what motion be to the body not its essence but one of its operation and therefore though think be suppose never so much the proper action of the soul yet it be not necessary to suppose that it should be always think always in action that perhaps be the privilege of the infinite author and preserver of all thing who never slumber nor sleep but be not competent to any finite be at least not to the soul of man we know certainly by experience that we sometimes think and thence draw this infallible consequence -- that there be something in we that have a power to think but whether that substance perpetually think or no we can be no further assure than experience inform we for to say that actual thinking be essential to the soul and inseparable from it be to beg what be in question and not to prove it by reason -- which be necessary to be do if it be not a self-evident proposition but whether this that the soul always think be a self-evident proposition that everybody assent to at first hearing i appeal to mankind it be doubt whether i think at all last night or no the question be about a matter of fact it be beg it to bring as a proof for it a hypothesis which be the very thing in dispute : by which way one may prove anything and it be but suppose that all watch whilst the balance beat think and it be sufficiently prove and past doubt that my watch think all last night but he that would not deceive himself ought to build he hypothesis on matter of fact and make it out by sensible experience and not presume on matter of fact because of he hypothesis that be because he suppose it to be so which way of prove amount to this that i must necessarily think all last night because another suppose i always think though i myself can not perceive that i always do so but man in love with they opinion may not only suppose what be in question but allege wrong matter of fact how else could any one make it a inference of mine that a thing be not because we be not sensible of it in we sleep i do not say there be no soul in a man because he be not sensible of it in he sleep but i do say he can not think at any time wake or sleep without be sensible of it we be sensible of it be not necessary to anything but to we thought and to they it be and to they it always will be necessary till we can think without be conscious of it 11 it be not always conscious of it i grant that the soul in a wake man be never without thought because it be the condition of be awake but whether sleep without dream be not a affection of the whole man mind as well as body may be worth a wake man 's consideration it be hard to conceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it if the soul doth think in a sleep man without be conscious of it i ask whether during such think it have any pleasure or pain or be capable of happiness or misery i be sure the man be not no more than the bed or earth he lie on for to be happy or miserable without be conscious of it seem to I utterly inconsistent and impossible or if it be possible that the soul can whilst the body be sleep have its think enjoyment and concern its pleasure or pain apart which the man be not conscious of nor partake in -- it be certain that socrate asleep and socrate awake be not the same person but he soul when he sleep and socrate the man consist of body and soul when he be wake be two person : since wake socrate have no knowledge of or concernment for that happiness or misery of he soul which it enjoy alone by itself whilst he sleep without perceive anything of it no more than he have for the happiness or misery of a man in the indy whom he know not for if we take wholly away all consciousness of we action and sensation especially of pleasure and pain and the concernment that accompany it it will be hard to know wherein to place personal identity 12 if a sleep man think without know it the sleep and wake man be two person the soul during sound sleep think say these man whilst it think and perceive it be capable certainly of those of delight or trouble as well as any other perception and it must necessarily be conscious of its own perception but it have all this apart : the sleep man it be plain be conscious of nothing of all this let we suppose then the soul of castor while he be sleep retire from he body which be no impossible supposition for the man i have here to do with who so liberally allow life without a think soul to all other animal these man can not then judge it impossible or a contradiction that the body should live without the soul nor that the soul should subsist and think or have perception even perception of happiness or misery without the body let we then i say suppose the soul of castor separate during he sleep from he body to think apart let we suppose too that it choose for its scene of think the body of another man v g pollux who be sleep without a soul for if castor 's soul can think whilst castor be asleep what castor be never conscious of it be no matter what place it choose to think in we have here then the body of two man with only one soul between they which we will suppose to sleep and wake by turn and the soul still think in the wake man whereof the sleep man be never conscious have never the least perception i ask then whether castor and pollux thus with only one soul between they which think and perceive in one what the other be never conscious of nor be concern for be not two as distinct person as castor and hercule or as socrate and plato be and whether one of they might not be very happy and the other very miserable just by the same reason they make the soul and the man two person who make the soul think apart what the man be not conscious of for i suppose nobody will make identity of person to consist in the soul 's be unite to the very same numerical particle of matter for if that be necessary to identity it will be impossible in that constant flux of the particle of we body that any man should be the same person two day or two moment together 13 impossible to convince those that sleep without dream that they think thus methink every drowsy nod shake they doctrine who teach that the soul be always think those at least who do at any time sleep without dream can never be convince that they thought be sometimes for four hour busy without they know of it and if they be take in the very act wake in the middle of that sleep contemplation can give no manner of account of it 14 that man dream without remember it in vain urge it will perhaps be say -- that the soul think even in the soundest sleep but the memory retain it not that the soul in a sleep man should be this moment busy a thinking and the next moment in a wake man not remember nor be able to recollect one jot of all those thought be very hard to be conceive and would need some better proof than bare assertion to make it be believe for who can without any more ado but be barely tell so imagine that the greatest part of man do during all they life for several hour every day think of something which if they be ask even in the middle of these thought they could remember nothing at all of most man i think pass a great part of they sleep without dream i once know a man that be breed a scholar and have no bad memory who tell I he have never dream in he life till he have that fever he be then newly recover of which be about the five or six and twentieth year of he age i suppose the world afford more such instance : at least every one 's acquaintance will furnish he with example enough of such as pass most of they night without dream 15 upon this hypothesis the thought of a sleep man ought to be most rational to think often and never to retain it so much as one moment be a very useless sort of thinking and the soul in such a state of think do very little if at all excel that of a looking-glass which constantly receive variety of image or idea but retain none they disappear and vanish and there remain no footstep of they the looking-glass be never the better for such idea nor the soul for such thought perhaps it will be say that in a wake man the material of the body be employ and make use of in think and that the memory of thought be retain by the impression that be make on the brain and the trace there leave after such thinking but that in the thinking of the soul which be not perceive in a sleep man there the soul think apart and make no use of the organ of the body leave no impression on it and consequently no memory of such thought not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct person which follow from this supposition i answer further -- that whatever idea the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body it be reasonable to conclude it can retain without the help of the body too or else the soul or any separate spirit will have but little advantage by think if it have no memory of its own thought if it can not lay they up for its own use and be able to recall they upon occasion if it can not reflect upon what be past and make use of its former experience reasoning and contemplation to what purpose do it think they who make the soul a think thing at this rate will not make it a much more noble be than those do whom they condemn for allow it to be nothing but the subtilist part of matter character draw on dust that the first breath of wind efface or impression make on a heap of atom or animal spirit be altogether as useful and render the subject as noble as the thought of a soul that perish in think that once out of sight be go for ever and leave no memory of themselves behind they nature never make excellent thing for mean or no use : and it be hardly to be conceive that we infinitely wise creator should make so admirable a faculty as the power of think that faculty which come nearest the excellency of he own incomprehensible be to be so idly and uselessly employ at least a fourth part of its time here as to think constantly without remember any of those thought without do any good to itself or other or be any way useful to any other part of the creation if we will examine it we shall not find i suppose the motion of dull and senseless matter any where in the universe make so little use of and so wholly throw away 16 on this hypothesis the soul must have idea not derive from sensation or reflection of which there be no appearance it be true we have sometimes instance of perception whilst we be asleep and retain the memory of those thought : but how extravagant and incoherent for the most part they be how little conformable to the perfection and order of a rational be those who be acquaint with dream need not be tell this i would willingly be satisfy in -- whether the soul when it think thus apart and as it be separate from the body act less rationally than when conjointly with it or no if its separate thought be less rational then these man must say that the soul owe the perfection of rational thinking to the body : if it do not it be a wonder that we dream should be for the most part so frivolous and irrational and that the soul should retain none of its more rational soliloquy and meditation 17 if i think when i know it not nobody else can know it those who so confidently tell we that the soul always actually think i would they would also tell we what those idea be that be in the soul of a child before or just at the union with the body before it have receive any by sensation the dream of sleep man be as i take it all make up of the wake man 's idea though for the most part oddly put together it be strange if the soul have idea of its own that it derive not from sensation or reflection -lrb- as it must have if it think before it receive any impression from the body -rrb- that it should never in its private thinking -lrb- so private that the man himself perceive it not -rrb- retain any of they the very moment it wake out of they and then make the man glad with new discovery who can find it reason that the soul should in its retirement during sleep have so many hour ' thought and yet never light on any of those idea it borrow not from sensation or reflection or at least preserve the memory of none but such which be occasion from the body must need be less natural to a spirit it be strange the soul should never once in a man 's whole life recall over any of its pure native thought and those idea it have before it borrow anything from the body never bring into the wake man 's view any other idea but what have a tang of the cask and manifestly derive they original from that union if it always think and so have idea before it be unite or before it receive any from the body it be not to be suppose but that during sleep it recollect its native idea and during that retirement from communicate with the body whilst it think by itself the idea it be busy about should be sometimes at least those more natural and congenial one which it have in itself underive from the body or its own operation about they : which since the wake man never remember we must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remember something that the man do not or else that memory belong only to such idea as be derive from the body or the mind 's operation about they 18 how know any one that the soul always think for if it be not a self-evident proposition it need proof i would be glad also to learn from these man who so confidently pronounce that the human soul or which be all one that a man always think how they come to know it nay how they come to know that they themselves think when they themselves do not perceive it this i be afraid be to be sure without proof and to know without perceive it be i suspect a confused notion take up to serve a hypothesis and none of those clear truth that either they own evidence force we to admit or common experience make it impudence to deny for the most that can be say of it be that it be possible the soul may always think but not always retain it in memory and i say it be as possible that the soul may not always think and much more probable that it should sometimes not think than that it should often think and that a long while together and not be conscious to itself the next moment after that it have think 19 that a man should be busy in think and yet not retain it the next moment very improbable to suppose the soul to think and the man not to perceive it be as have be say to make two person in one man and if one consider well these man 's way of speak one should be lead into a suspicion that they do so for those who tell we that the soul always think do never that i remember say that a man always think can the soul think and not the man or a man think and not be conscious of it this perhaps would be suspect of jargon in other if they say the man think always but be not always conscious of it they may as well say he body be extend without have part for it be altogether as intelligible to say that a body be extend without part as that anything think without be conscious of it or perceive that it do so they who talk thus may with as much reason if it be necessary to they hypothesis say that a man be always hungry but that he do not always feel it whereas hunger consist in that very sensation as think consist in be conscious that one think if they say that a man be always conscious to himself of think i ask how they know it consciousness be the perception of what pass in a man 's own mind can another man perceive that i be conscious of anything when i perceive it not myself no man 's knowledge here can go beyond he experience wake a man out of a sound sleep and ask he what he be that moment thinking of if he himself be conscious of nothing he then think on he must be a notable diviner of thought that can assure he that he be think may he not with more reason assure he he be not asleep this be something beyond philosophy and it can not be less than revelation that discover to another thought in my mind when i can find none there myself and they must need have a penetrate sight who can certainly see that i think when i can not perceive it myself and when i declare that i do not and yet can see that dog or elephant do not think when they give all the demonstration of it imaginable except only tell we that they do so this some may suspect to be a step beyond the rosicrucian it seem easier to make one 's self invisible to other than to make another 's thought visible to I which be not visible to himself but it be but define the soul to be a substance that always think and the business be do if such definition be of any authority i know not what it can serve for but to make many man suspect that they have no soul at all since they find a good part of they life pass away without think for no definition that i know no supposition of any sect be of force enough to destroy constant experience and perhaps it be the affectation of know beyond what we perceive that make so much useless dispute and noise in the world 20 no idea but from sensation and reflection evident if we observe child i see no reason therefore to believe that the soul think before the sens have furnish it with idea to think on and as those be increase and retain so it come by exercise to improve its faculty of think in the several part of it as well as afterwards by compound those idea and reflect on its own operation it increase its stock as well as facility in remember imagine reasoning and other mode of think 21 state of a child on the mother 's womb he that will suffer himself to be inform by observation and experience and not make he own hypothesis the rule of nature will find few sign of a soul accustom to much thinking in a new-born child and much fewer of any reasoning at all and yet it be hard to imagine that the rational soul should think so much and not reason at all and he that will consider that infant newly come into the world spend the greatest part of they time in sleep and be seldom awake but when either hunger call for the teat or some pain -lrb- the most importunate of all sensation -rrb- or some other violent impression on the body force the mind to perceive and attend to it -- he i say who consider this will perhaps find reason to imagine that a foetus in the mother 's womb differ not much from the state of a vegetable but pass the greatest part of its time without perception or think do very little but sleep in a place where it need not seek for food and be surround with liquor always equally soft and near of the same temper where the eye have no light and the ear so shut up be not very susceptible of sound and where there be little or no variety or change of object to move the sens 22 the mind think in proportion to the matter it get from experience to think about follow a child from its birth and observe the alteration that time make and you shall find as the mind by the sens come more and more to be furnish with idea it come to be more and more awake think more the more it have matter to think on after some time it begin to know the object which be most familiar with it have make lasting impression thus it come by degree to know the person it daily converse with and distinguish they from stranger which be instance and effect of its come to retain and distinguish the idea the sens convey to it and so we may observe how the mind by degree improve in these and advance to the exercise of those other faculty of enlarge compounding and abstract its idea and of reasoning about they and reflect upon all these of which i shall have occasion to speak more hereafter 23 a man begin to have idea when he first have sensation what sensation be if it shall be demand then when a man begin to have any idea i think the true answer be -- when he first have any sensation for since there appear not to be any idea in the mind before the sens have convey any in i conceive that idea in the understanding be coeval with sensation which be such a impression or motion make in some part of the body as make it be take notice of in the understanding 24 the original of all we knowledge the impression then that be make on we sense by outward object that be extrinsical to the mind and its own operation about these impression reflect on by itself as proper object to be contemplate by it be i conceive the original of all knowledge thus the first capacity of human intellect be -- that the mind be fit to receive the impression make on it either through the sens by outward object or by its own operation when it reflect on they this be the first step a man make towards the discovery of anything and the groundwork whereon to build all those notion which ever he shall have naturally in this world all those sublime thought which tower above the cloud and reach as high as heaven itself take they rise and footing here : in all that great extent wherein the mind wander in those remote speculation it may seem to be elevated with it stir not one jot beyond those idea which sense or reflection have offer for its contemplation 25 in the reception of simple idea the understanding be for the most part passive in this part the understanding be merely passive and whether or no it will have these beginning and as it be material of knowledge be not in its own power for the object of we sens do many of they obtrude they particular idea upon we mind whether we will or not and the operation of we mind will not let we be without at least some obscure notion of they no man can be wholly ignorant of what he do when he think these simple idea when offer to the mind the understanding can no more refuse to have nor alter when they be imprint nor blot they out and make new one itself than a mirror can refuse alter or obliterate the image or idea which the object set before it do therein produce as the body that surround we do diversely affect we organ the mind be force to receive the impression and can not avoid the perception of those idea that be annex to they chapter ii of simple idea 1 uncompounded appearance the better to understand the nature manner and extent of we knowledge one thing be carefully to be observe concern the idea we have and that be that some of they be simple and some complex though the quality that affect we sens be in the thing themselves so united and blended that there be no separation no distance between they yet it be plain the idea they produce in the mind enter by the sens simple and unmixed for though the sight and touch often take in from the same object at the same time different idea -- as a man see at once motion and color the hand feel softness and warmth in the same piece of wax : yet the simple idea thus unite in the same subject be as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different sens the coldness and hardness which a man feel in a piece of ice be as distinct idea in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily or as the taste of sugar and smell of a rose and there be nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he have of those simple idea which be each in itself uncompounded contain in it nothing but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind and be not distinguishable into different idea 2 the mind can neither make nor destroy they these simple idea the material of all we knowledge be suggest and furnish to the mind only by those two way above mention viz sensation and reflection when the understanding be once store with these simple idea it have the power to repeat compare and unite they even to a almost infinite variety and so can make at pleasure new complex idea but it be not in the power of the most exalted wit or enlarged understanding by any quickness or variety of think to invent or frame one new simple idea in the mind not take in by the way before mention : nor can any force of the understanding destroy those that be there the dominion of man in this little world of he own understanding be much what the same as it be in the great world of visible thing wherein he power however manage by art and skill reach no farther than to compound and divide the material that be make to he hand but can do nothing towards the make the least particle of new matter or destroy one atom of what be already in be the same inability will every one find in himself who shall go about to fashion in he understand one simple idea not receive in by he sens from external object or by reflection from the operation of he own mind about they i would have any one try to fancy any taste which have never affect he palate or frame the idea of a scent he have never smell : and when he can do this i will also conclude that a blind man have idea of color and a deaf man true distinct notion of sound 3 only the quality that affect the sens be imaginable this be the reason why -- though we can not believe it impossible to god to make a creature with other organ and more way to convey into the understand the notice of corporeal thing than those five as they be usually count which he have give to man -- yet i think it be not possible for any man to imagine any other quality in body howsoever constitute whereby they can be take notice of besides sound taste smell visible and tangible quality and have mankind be make but with four sens the quality then which be the object of the fifth sense have be as far from we notice imagination and conception as now any belong to a sixth seventh or eighth sense can possibly be -- which whether yet some other creature in some other part of this vast and stupendous universe may not have will be a great presumption to deny he that will not set himself proudly at the top of all thing but will consider the immensity of this fabric and the great variety that be to be find in this little and inconsiderable part of it which he have to do with may be apt to think that in other mansion of it there may be other and different intelligent being of whose faculty he have as little knowledge or apprehension as a worm shut up in one drawer of a cabinet have of the sens or understanding of a man such variety and excellency be suitable to the wisdom and power of the maker i have here follow the common opinion of man 's have but five sens though perhaps there may be justly count more -- but either supposition serve equally to my present purpose chapter iii of simple idea of sense 1 division of simple idea the better to conceive the idea we receive from sensation it may not be amiss for we to consider they in reference to the different way whereby they make they approach to we mind and make themselves perceivable by we first then there be some which come into we mind by one sense only secondly there be other that convey themselves into the mind by more sens than one thirdly other that be have from reflection only fourthly there be some that make themselves way and be suggest to the mind by all the way of sensation and reflection we shall consider they apart under these several head idea of one sense there be some idea which have admittance only through one sense which be peculiarly adapt to receive they thus light and color as white red yellow blue with they several degree or shades and mixture as green scarlet purple sea-green and the rest come in only by the eye all kind of noise sound and tone only by the ear the several taste and smell by the nose and palate and if these organ or the nerve which be the conduit to convey they from without to they audience in the brain -- the mind 's presence-room -lrb- as i may so call it -rrb- -- be any of they so disorder as not to perform they function they have no postern to be admit by no other way to bring themselves into view and be perceive by the understand the most considerable of those belong to the touch be heat and cold and solidity : all the rest consist almost wholly in the sensible configuration as smooth and rough or else more or less firm adhesion of the part as hard and soft tough and brittle be obvious enough 2 few simple idea have name i think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple idea belong to each sense nor indeed be it possible if we would there be a great many more of they belong to most of the sens than we have name for the variety of smell which be as many almost if not more than species of body in the world do most of they want name sweet and stinking commonly serve we turn for these idea which in effect be little more than to call they please or displease though the smell of a rose and violet both sweet be certainly very distinct idea nor be the different taste that by we palate we receive idea of much better provide with name sweet bitter sour harsh and salt be almost all the epithet we have to denominate that numberless variety of relish which be to be find distinct not only in almost every sort of creature but in the different part of the same plant fruit or animal the same may be say of color and sound i shall therefore in the account of simple idea i be here give content myself to set down only such as be most material to we present purpose or be in themselves less apt to be take notice of though they be very frequently the ingredient of we complex idea amongst which i think i may well account solidity which therefore i shall treat of in the next chapter chapter iv idea of solidity 1 we receive this idea from touch the idea of solidity we receive by we touch : and it arise from the resistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it possess till it have leave it there be no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity whether we move or rest in what posture soever we be we always feel something under we that support we and hinder we further sinking downward and the body which we daily handle make we perceive that whilst they remain between they they do by a insurmountable force hinder the approach of the part of we hand that press they that which thus hinder the approach of two body when they be move one towards another i call solidity i will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematician use it in it suffice that i think the common notion of solidity will allow if not justify this use of it but if any one think it better to call it impenetrability he have my consent only i have think the term solidity the more proper to express this idea not only because of its vulgar use in that sense but also because it carry something more of positive in it than impenetrability which be negative and be perhaps more a consequence of solidity than solidity itself this of all other seem the idea most intimately connect with and essential to body so as nowhere else to be find or imagine but only in matter and though we sens take no notice of it but in mass of matter of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in we : yet the mind have once get this idea from such grosser sensible body trace it further and consider it as well as figure in the minutest particle of matter that can exist and find it inseparably inherent in body wherever or however modify 2 solidity fill space this be the idea which belong to body whereby we conceive it to fill space the idea of which filling of space be -- that where we imagine any space take up by a solid substance we conceive it so to possess it that it exclude all other solid substance and will for ever hinder any other two body that move towards one another in a straight line from come to touch one another unless it remove from between they in a line not parallel to that which they move in this idea of it the body which we ordinarily handle sufficiently furnish we with 3 distinct from space this resistance whereby it keep other body out of the space which it possess be so great that no force how great soever can surmount it all the body in the world press a drop of water on all side will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will make soft as it be to they approach one another till it be remove out of they way : whereby we idea of solidity be distinguish both from pure space which be capable neither of resistance nor motion and from the ordinary idea of hardness for a man may conceive two body at a distance so as they may approach one another without touch or displace any solid thing till they superficies come to meet whereby i think we have the clear idea of space without solidity for -lrb- not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body -rrb- i ask whether a man can not have the idea of the motion of one single body alone without any other succeed immediately into its place i think it be evident he can : the idea of motion in one body no more include the idea of motion in another than the idea of a square figure in one body include the idea of a square figure in another i do not ask whether body do so exist that the motion of one body can not really be without the motion of another to determine this either way be to beg the question for or against a vacuum but my question be -- whether one can not have the idea of one body move whilst other be at rest and i think this no one will deny if so then the place it desert give we the idea of pure space without solidity whereinto any other body may enter without either resistance or protrusion of anything when the sucker in a pump be draw the space it fill in the tube be certainly the same whether any other body follow the motion of the sucker or not : nor do it imply a contradiction that upon the motion of one body another that be only contiguous to it should not follow it the necessity of such a motion be build only on the supposition that the world be full but not on the distinct idea of space and solidity which be as different as resistance and not resistance protrusion and not protrusion and that man have idea of space without a body they very dispute about a vacuum plainly demonstrate as be show in another place 4 from hardness solidity be hereby also difference from hardness in that solidity consist in repletion and so a utter exclusion of other body out of the space it possess : but hardness in a firm cohesion of the part of matter make up mass of a sensible bulk so that the whole do not easily change its figure and indeed hard and soft be name that we give to thing only in relation to the constitution of we own body that be generally call hard by we which will put we to pain sooner than change figure by the pressure of any part of we body and that on the contrary soft which change the situation of its part upon a easy and unpainful touch but this difficulty of change the situation of the sensible part amongst themselves or of the figure of the whole give no more solidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest nor be a adamant one jot more solid than water for though the two flat side of two piece of marble will more easily approach each other between which there be nothing but water or air than if there be a diamond between they yet it be not that the part of the diamond be more solid than those of water or resist more but because the part of water be more easily separable from each other they will by a side motion be more easily remove and give way to the approach of the two piece of marble but if they could be keep from make place by that side motion they would eternally hinder the approach of these two piece of marble as much as the diamond and it would be as impossible by any force to surmount they resistance as to surmount the resistance of the part of a diamond the softest body in the world will as invincibly resist the come together of any other two body if it be not put out of the way but remain between they as the hardest that can be find or imagine he that shall fill a yield soft body well with air or water will quickly find its resistance and he that think that nothing but body that be hard can keep he hand from approach one another may be please to make a trial with the air inclose in a football the experiment i have be tell be make at florence with a hollow globe of gold fill with water and exactly close which further show the solidity of so soft a body as water for the golden globe thus fill be put into a press which be drive by the extreme force of screw the water make itself way through the pore of that very close metal and finding no room for a nearer approach of its particle within get to the outside where it rise like a dew and so fall in drop before the side of the globe could be make to yield to the violent compression of the engine that squeeze it 5 on solidity depend impulse resistance and protrusion by this idea of solidity be the extension of body distinguish from the extension of space : -- the extension of body be nothing but the cohesion or continuity of solid separable movable part and the extension of space the continuity of unsolid inseparable and immovable part upon the solidity of body also depend they mutual impulse resistance and protrusion of pure space then and solidity there be several -lrb- amongst which i confess myself one -rrb- who persuade themselves they have clear and distinct idea and that they can think on space without anything in it that resist or be protrude by body this be the idea of pure space which they think they have as clear as any idea they can have of the extension of body : the idea of the distance between the opposite part of a concave superficies be equally as clear without as with the idea of any solid part between : and on the other side they persuade themselves that they have distinct from that of pure space the idea of something that fill space that can be protrude by the impulse of other body or resist they motion if there be other that have not these two idea distinct but confound they and make but one of they i know not how man who have the same idea under different name or different idea under the same name can in that case talk with one another any more than a man who not be blind or deaf have distinct idea of the color of scarlet and the sound of a trumpet could discourse concern scarlet color with the blind man i mention in another place who fancy that the idea of scarlet be like the sound of a trumpet 6 what solidity be if any one ask I what this solidity be i send he to he sens to inform he let he put a flint or a football between he hand and then endeavor to join they and he will know if he think this not a sufficient explication of solidity what it be and wherein it consist i promise to tell he what it be and wherein it consist when he tell I what thinking be or wherein it consist or explain to I what extension or motion be which perhaps seem much easier the simple idea we have be such as experience teach they we but if beyond that we endeavor by word to make they clearer in the mind we shall succeed no better than if we go about to clear up the darkness of a blind man 's mind by talk and to discourse into he the idea of light and color the reason of this i shall show in another place chapter v of simple idea of diver sens idea receive both by see and touch the idea we get by more than one sense be of space or extension figure rest and motion for these make perceivable impression both on the eye and touch and we can receive and convey into we mind the idea of the extension figure motion and rest of body both by see and feel but have occasion to speak more at large of these in another place i here only enumerate they chapter vi of simple idea of reflection simple idea be the operation of mind about its other idea the mind receive the idea mention in the foregoing chapter from without when it turn its view inward upon itself and observe its own action about those idea it have take from thence other idea which be as capable to be the object of its contemplation as any of those it receive from foreign thing the idea of perception and idea of willing we have from reflection the two great and principal action of the mind which be most frequently consider and which be so frequent that every one that please may take notice of they in himself be these two : -- perception or thinking and volition or willing the power of thinking be call the understanding and the power of volition be call the will and these two power or ability in the mind be denominate faculty of some of the mode of these simple idea of reflection such as be remembrance discerning reasoning judge knowledge faith & c i shall have occasion to speak hereafter chapter vii of simple idea of both sensation and reflection 1 idea of pleasure and pain there be other simple idea which convey themselves into the mind by all the way of sensation and reflection viz pleasure or delight and its opposite pain or uneasiness power existence unity mix with almost all we other idea 2 delight or uneasiness one or other of they join themselves to almost all we idea both of sensation and reflection : and there be scarce any affection of we sens from without any retired thought of we mind within which be not able to produce in we pleasure or pain by pleasure and pain i would be understand to signify whatsoever delight or molest we whether it arise from the thought of we mind or anything operate on we body for whether we call it satisfaction delight pleasure happiness & c on the one side i or uneasiness trouble pain torment anguish misery & c the other they be still but different degree of the same thing and belong to the idea of pleasure and pain delight or uneasiness which be the name i shall most commonly use for those two sort of idea 3 as motive of we action the infinite wise author of we be have give we the power over several part of we body to move or keep they at rest as we think fit and also by the motion of they to move ourselves and other contiguous body in which consist all the action of we body : have also give a power to we mind in several instance to choose amongst its idea which it will think on and to pursue the inquiry of this or that subject with consideration and attention to excite we to these action of think and motion that we be capable of -- have be please to join to several thought and several sensation a perception of delight if this be wholly separate from all we outward sensation and inward thought we should have no reason to prefer one think or action to another negligence to attention or motion to rest and so we should neither stir we body nor employ we mind but let we thought -lrb- if i may so call it -rrb- run adrift without any direction or design and suffer the idea of we mind like unregarded shadow to make they appearance there as it happen without attend to they in which state man however furnish with the faculty of understanding and will would be a very idle inactive creature and pass he time only in a lazy lethargic dream it have therefore pleased we wise creator to annex to several object and the idea which we receive from they as also to several of we thought a concomitant pleasure and that in several object to several degree that those faculty which he have endow we with might not remain wholly idle and unemployed by we 4 a end and use of pain pain have the same efficacy and use to set we on work that pleasure have we be as ready to employ we faculty to avoid that as to pursue this : only this be worth we consideration that pain be often produce by the same object and idea that produce pleasure in we this they near conjunction which make we often feel pain in the sensation where we expect pleasure give we new occasion of admire the wisdom and goodness of we maker who design the preservation of we being have annex pain to the application of many thing to we body to warn we of the harm that they will do and as advice to withdraw from they but he not design we preservation barely but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection have in many case annex pain to those very idea which delight we thus heat that be very agreeable to we in one degree by a little greater increase of it prove no ordinary torment : and the most pleasant of all sensible object light itself if there be too much of it if increase beyond a due proportion to we eye cause a very painful sensation which be wisely and favourably so order by nature that when any object do by the vehemency of its operation disorder the instrument of sensation whose structure can not but be very nice and delicate we might by the pain be warn to withdraw before the organ be quite put out of order and so be unfitted for its proper function for the future the consideration of those object that produce it may well persuade we that this be the end or use of pain for though great light be insufferable to we eye yet the highest degree of darkness do not at all disease they : because that cause no disorderly motion in it leave that curious organ unarmed in its natural state but yet excess of cold as well as heat pain we : because it be equally destructive to that temper which be necessary to the preservation of life and the exercise of the several function of the body and which consist in a moderate degree of warmth or if you please a motion of the insensible part of we body confine within certain bound 5 another end beyond all this we may find another reason why god have scatter up and down several degree of pleasure and pain in all the thing that environ and affect we and blended they together in almost all that we thought and sens have to do with -- that we find imperfection dissatisfaction and want of complete happiness in all the enjoyment which the creature can afford we might be lead to seek it in the enjoyment of he with whom there be fullness of joy and at whose right hand be pleasure for evermore 6 goodness of god in annex pleasure and pain to we other idea though what i have here say may not perhaps make the idea of pleasure and pain clearer to we than we own experience do which be the only way that we be capable of have they yet the consideration of the reason why they be annex to so many other idea serve to give we due sentiment of the wisdom and goodness of the sovereign disposer of all thing may not be unsuitable to the main end of these inquiry : the knowledge and veneration of he be the chief end of all we thought and the proper business of all understanding 7 idea of existence and unity existence and unity be two other idea that be suggest to the understanding by every object without and every idea within when idea be in we mind we consider they as be actually there as well as we consider thing to be actually without we -- which be that they exist or have existence and whatever we can consider as one thing whether a real be or idea suggest to the understand the idea of unity 8 idea of power power also be another of those simple idea which we receive from sensation and reflection for observe in ourselves that we do and can think and that we can at pleasure move several part of we body which be at rest the effect also that natural body be able to produce in one another occur every moment to we sens -- we both these way get the idea of power 9 idea of succession besides these there be another idea which though suggest by we sens yet be more constantly offer to we by what pass in we mind and that be the idea of succession for if we look immediately into ourselves and reflect on what be observable there we shall find we idea always whilst we be awake or have any thought pass in train one go and another come without intermission 10 simple idea the material of all we knowledge these if they be not all be at least -lrb- as i think -rrb- the most considerable of those simple idea which the mind have out of which be make all its other knowledge all which it receive only by the two foremention way of sensation and reflection nor let any one think these too narrow bound for the capacious mind of man to expatiate in which take its flight further than the star and can not be confine by the limit of the world that extend its thought often even beyond the utmost expansion of matter and make excursion into that incomprehensible inane i grant all this but desire any one to assign any simple idea which be not receive from one of those inlet before mention or any complex idea not make out of those simple one nor will it be so strange to think these few simple idea sufficient to employ the quickest thought or largest capacity and to furnish the material of all that various knowledge and more various fancy and opinion of all mankind if we consider how many word may be make out of the various composition of twenty-four letter or if go one step further we will but reflect on the variety of combination that may be make with barely one of the above-mentioned idea viz number whose stock be inexhaustible and truly infinite : and what a large and immense field doth extension alone afford the mathematician chapter viii some further consideration concern we simple idea of sensation 1 positive idea from privative cause concern the simple idea of sensation it be to be consider -- that whatsoever be so constitute in nature as to be able by affect we sens to cause any perception in the mind doth thereby produce in the understand a simple idea which whatever be the external cause of it when it come to be take notice of by we discerning faculty it be by the mind look on and consider there to be a real positive idea in the understanding as much as any other whatsoever though perhaps the cause of it be but a privation of the subject 2 idea in the mind distinguish from that in thing which give rise to they thus the idea of heat and cold light and darkness white and black motion and rest be equally clear and positive idea in the mind though perhaps some of the cause which produce they be barely privation in those subject from whence we sens derive those idea these the understanding in its view of they consider all as distinct positive idea without take notice of the cause that produce they : which be a inquiry not belong to the idea as it be in the understanding but to the nature of the thing exist without we these be two very different thing and carefully to be distinguish it be one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black and quite another to examine what kind of particle they must be and how range in the superficies to make any object appear white or black 3 we may have the idea when we be ignorant of they physical cause a painter or dyer who never inquire into they cause have the idea of white and black and other color as clearly perfectly and distinctly in he understanding and perhaps more distinctly than the philosopher who have busy himself in consider they nature and think he know how far either of they be in its cause positive or privative and the idea of black be no less positive in he mind than that of white however the cause of that color in the external object may be only a privation 4 why a privative cause in nature may occasion a positive idea if it be the design of my present undertaking to inquire into the natural cause and manner of perception i should offer this as a reason why a privative cause might in some case at least produce a positive idea viz that all sensation be produce in we only by different degree and mode of motion in we animal spirit variously agitate by external object the abatement of any former motion must as necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of it and so introduce a new idea which depend only on a different motion of the animal spirit in that organ 5 negative name need not be meaningless but whether this be so or not i will not here determine but appeal to every one 's own experience whether the shadow of a man though it consist of nothing but the absence of light -lrb- and the more the absence of light be the more discernible be the shadow -rrb- do not when a man look on it cause as clear and positive idea in he mind as a man himself though cover over with clear sunshine and the picture of a shadow be a positive thing indeed we have negative name to which there be no positive idea but they consist wholly in negation of some certain idea as silence invisible but these signify not any idea in the mind but they absence 6 whether any idea be due to cause really private and thus one may truly be say to see darkness for suppose a hole perfectly dark from whence no light be reflect it be certain one may see the figure of it or it may be paint or whether the ink i write with make any other idea be a question the privative cause i have here assign of positive idea be accord to the common opinion but in truth it will be hard to determine whether there be really any idea from a privative cause till it be determine whether rest be any more a privation than motion 7 idea in the mind quality in body to discover the nature of we idea the better and to discourse of they intelligibly it will be convenient to distinguish they as they be idea or perception in we mind and as they be modification of matter in the body that cause such perception in we : that so we may not think -lrb- as perhaps usually be do -rrb- that they be exactly the image and resemblance of something inherent in the subject most of those of sensation be in the mind no more the likeness of something exist without we than the name that stand for they be the likeness of we idea which yet upon hear they be apt to excite in we 8 we idea and the quality of body whatsoever the mind perceive in itself or be the immediate object of perception think or understand that i call idea and the power to produce any idea in we mind i call quality of the subject wherein that power be thus a snowball have the power to produce in we the idea of white cold and round -- the power to produce those idea in we as they be in the snowball i call quality and as they be sensation or perception in we understanding i call they idea which idea if i speak of sometimes as in the thing themselves i would be understand to mean those quality in the object which produce they in we 9 primary quality of body concern these quality we i think observe these primary one in body that produce simple idea in we viz solidity extension motion or rest nubmer or figure these which i call original or primary quality of body be wholly inseperable from it and such as in all the alteration and change it suffer all the force can be use upon it it constantly keep and such as sense constantly find in every particle of matter which have bulk enough to be perceive and the mind find inseparable from every particle of matter though less than to make itself singly be perceive by we sens : vg take a grain of wheat divide it into two part each part have still solidity extension figure and mobility : divide it again and it retain still the same quality and so divide it on till the part become insensible they must retain still each of they all those quality for division -lrb- which be all that a mill or pestle or any other body do upon another in reduce it to insensible part -rrb- can never take away either solidity extension figure or mobility from any body but only make two or more distinct separate mass of matter of that which be but one before all which distinct mass reckon as so many distinct body after division make a certain number 10 -lrb- not in early edition -rrb- 11 how body produce idea in we the next thing to be consider be how body operate one upon another and that be manifestly by impulse and nothing else it be impossible to conceive that body should operate on what it do not touch -lrb- which be all one as to imagine it can operate where it be not -rrb- or when it do touch operate any other way than by motion 12 by motion external and in we organism if then external object be not unite to we mind when they produce idea therein and yet we perceive these original quality in such of they as singly fall under we sens it be evident that some motion must be thence continue by we nerve or animal spirit by some part of we body to the brain or the seat of sensation there to produce in we mind the particular idea we have of they and since the extension figure number and motion of body of a observable bigness maybe perceive at a distance by the sight it be evident some singly imperceptible body must come from they to the eye and thereby convey to the brain some motion which produce these idea which we have of they in we 13 how secondary quality produce they idea after the same manner that the idea of these original quality be produce in we we may conceive that the idea of secondary quality be also produce viz by the operation of insensible particle on we sens for it be manifest that there be body and good store of body each whereof be so small that we can not by any of we sens discover either they bulk figure or motion -- as be evident in the particle of the air and water and other extremely smaller than those perhaps as much smaller than the particle of air and water as the particle of air and water be smaller than pea or hail-stone -- let we suppose at present that the different motion and figure bulk and number of such particle affect the several organ of we sens produce : in we those different sensation which we have from the color and smell of body vg that a violet by the impulse of such insensible particle of matter of peculiar figure and bulk and in different degree and modification of they motion cause the idea of the blue color and sweet scent of that flower to be produce in we mind it be no more impossible to conceive that god should annex such idea to such motion with which they have no similitude than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel divide we flesh with which that idea have no resemblance 14 they depend on the primary quality what i have say concern color and smell may be understand also of taste and sound and other the like sensible quality which whatever reality we by mistake attribute to they be in truth nothing in the object themselves but power to produce various sensation in we and depend on those primary quality viz bulk figure texture and motion of part and therefore i call they secondary quality 15 idea of primary quality be resemblance of secondary not from whence i think it easy to draw this observation -- that the idea of primary quality of body be resemblance of they and they pattern do really exist in the body themselves but the idea produce in we by these secondary quality have no resemblance of they at all there be nothing like we idea exist in the body themselves they be in the body we denominate from they only a power to produce those sensation in we : and what be sweet blue or warm in idea be but the certain bulk figure and motion of the insensible part in the body themselves which we call so 16 example flame be denominate hot and light snow white and cold and manna white and sweet from the idea they produce in we which quality be commonly think to be the same in those body that those idea be in we the one the perfect resemblance of the other as they be in a mirror and it would by most man be judge very extravagant if one should say otherwise and yet he that will consider that the same fire that at one distance produce in we the sensation of warmth do at a nearer approach produce in we the far different sensation of pain ought to bethink himself what reason he have to say -- that this idea of warmth which be produce in he by the fire be actually in the fire and he idea of pain which the same fire produce in he the same way be not in the fire why be whiteness and coldness in snow and pain not when it produce the one and the other idea in we and can do neither but by the bulk figure number and motion of its solid part 17 the idea of the primary alone really exist the particular bulk number figure and motion of the part of fire or snow be really in they -- whether any one 's sens perceive they or no : and therefore they may be call real quality because they really exist in those body but light heat whiteness or coldness be no more really in they than sickness or pain be in manna take away the sensation of they let not the eye see light or color nor the can hear sound let the palate not taste nor the nose smell and all color taste odour and sound as they be such particular idea vanish and cease and be reduce to they cause ie bulk figure and motion of part 18 the secondary exist in thing only as mode of the primary a piece of manna of a sensible bulk be able to produce in we the idea of a round or square figure and by be remove from one place to another the idea of motion this idea of motion represent it as it really be in manna moving : a circle or square be the same whether in idea or existence in the mind or in the manna and this both motion and as figure be really in the manna whether we take notice of primary they or no : this everybody be ready to agree to besides manna by the bulk figure texture and motion of its part have a power to produce the sensation of sickness and sometimes of acute pain or griping in we that these idea of sickness and pain be not in the manna but effect of its operation on we and be nowhere when we feel they not this also every one readily agree to and yet man be hardly to be bring to think that sweetness and whiteness be not really in manna which be but the effect of the operation of manna by the motion size and figure of its particle on the eye and palate : as the pain and sickness cause by manna be confessedly nothing but the effect of its operation on the stomach and gut by the size motion and figure of its insensible part -lrb- for by nothing else can a body operate as have be prove -rrb- : as if it could not operate on the eye and palate and thereby produce in the mind particular distinct idea which in itself it have not as well as we allow it can operate on the gut and stomach and thereby produce distinct idea which in itself it have not these idea be all effect of the operation of manna on several part of we body by the size figure number and motion of its part -- why those produce by the eye and palate should rather be think to be really in the manna than those produce by the stomach and gut or why the pain and sickness idea that be the effect of manna should be think to be nowhere when they be not feel and yet the sweetness and whiteness effect of the same manna on other part of the body by way equally as unknown should be think to exist in the manna when they be not see or taste would need some reason to explain 19 example let we consider the red and white color in porphyry hinder light from striking on it and its color vanish it no longer produce any such idea in we : upon the return of light it produce these appearance on we again can any one think any real alteration be make in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light and that those idea of whiteness and redness be really in porphryry in the light when it be plain it have no color in the dark it have indeed such a configuration of particle both night and day as be apt by the ray of light rebound from some part of that hard stone to produce in we the idea of redness and from other the idea of whiteness but whiteness or redness be not in it at any time but such a texture that have the power to produce such a sensation in we 20 pound a almond and the clear white color will be alter into a dirty one and the sweet taste into a oily one what real alteration can the beating of the pestle make in a body but a alteration of the texture of it 21 explain how water feel as cold by one hand may be warm to the other idea be thus distinguish and understand we may be able to give a account how the same water at the same time may produce the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other : whereas it be impossible that the same water if those idea be really in it should at the same time be both hot and cold for if we imagine warmth as it be in we hand to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particle of we nerve or animal spirit we may understand how it be possible that the same water may at the same time produce the sensation of heat in one hand and cold in the other which yet figure never do that never produce the idea of a square by one hand which have produce the idea of a globe by another but if the sensation of heat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion of the minute part of we body cause by the corpuscle of any other body it be easy to be understand that if that motion be greater in one hand than in the other if a body be apply to the two hand which have in its minute particle a greater motion than in those of one of the hand and a less than in those of the other it will increase the motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other and so cause the different sensation of heat and cold that depend thereon 22 a excursion into natural philosophy i have in what just go before be engage in physical inquiry a little further than perhaps i intend but it be necessary to make the nature of sensation a little understood and to make the difference between the quality in body and the idea produce by they in the mind to be distinctly conceive without which it be impossible to discourse intelligibly of they -- i hope i shall be pardon this little excursion into natural philosophy it be necessary in we present inquiry to distinguish the primary and real quality of body which be always in they -lrb- viz solidity extension figure number and motion or rest and be sometimes perceive by we viz when the body they be in be big enough singly to be discern -rrb- from those secondary and imputed quality which be but the power of several combination of those primary one when they operate without be distinctly discern -- whereby we may also come to know what idea be and what be not resemblance of something really exist in the body we denominate from they 23 three sort of quality on body the quality then that be in body rightly consider be of three sort : -- first the bulk figure number situation and motion or rest of they solid part those be in they whether we perceive they or not and when they be of that size that we can discover they we have by these a idea of the thing as it be in itself as be plain in artificial thing these i call primary quality secondly the power that be in any body by reason of its insensible primary quality to operate after a peculiar manner on any of we sens and thereby produce in we the different idea of several color sound smell taste & c these be usually call sensible quality thirdly the power that be in any body by reason of the particular constitution of its primary quality to make such a change in the bulk figure texture and motion of another body as to make it operate on we sens differently from what it do before thus the sun have a power to make wax white and fire to make lead fluid the first of these as have be say i think may be properly call real original or primary quality because they be in the thing themselves whether they be perceive or not : and upon they different modification it be that the secondary quality depend the other two be only power to act differently upon other thing : which power result from the different modification of those primary quality 24 the first be resemblance the second thought to be resemblance but be not the third neither be nor be think so but though the two latter sort of quality be power barely and nothing but power relate to several other body and result from the different modification of the original quality yet they be generally otherwise think of for the second sort viz the power to produce several idea in we by we sens be look upon as real quality in the thing thus affect we : but the third sort be call and esteem barely power vg the idea of heat or light which we receive by we eye or touch from the sun be commonly think real quality exist in the sun and something more than mere power in it but when we consider the sun in reference to wax which it melt or blanch we look on the whiteness and softness produce in the wax not as quality in the sun but effect produce by power in it whereas if rightly consider these quality of light and warmth which be perception in I when i be warm or enlighten by the sun be no otherwise in the sun than the change make in the wax when it be blanch or melt be in the sun they be all of they equally power in the sun depend on its primary quality whereby it be able in the one case so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of some of the insensible part of my eye or hand as thereby to produce in I the idea of light or heat and in the other it be able so to alter the bulk figure texture or motion of the insensible part of the wax as to make they fit to produce in I the distinct idea of white and fluid 25 why the secondary be ordinarily take for real quality and not for bare power the reason why the one be ordinarily take for real quality and the other only for bare power seem to be because the idea we have of distinct color sound & c contain nothing at all in they of bulk figure or motion we be not apt to think they the effect of these primary quality which appear not to we sens to operate in they production and with which they have not any apparent congruity or conceivable connexion hence it be that we be so forward as to imagine that those idea be the resemblance of something really exist in the object themselves since sensation discover nothing of bulk figure or motion of part in they production nor can reason show how body by they bulk figure and motion should produce in the mind the idea of blue or yellow & c but in the other case in the operation of body change the quality one of another we plainly discover that the quality produce have commonly no resemblance with anything in the thing produce it wherefore we look on it as a bare effect of power for through receive the idea of heat or light from the sun we be apt to think it be a perception and resemblance of such a quality in the sun yet when we see wax or a fair face receive change of color from the sun we can not imagine that to be the reception or resemblance of anything in the sun because we find not those different color in the sun itself for we sens be able to observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible quality in two different external object we forwardly enough conclude the production of any sensible quality in any subject to be a effect of bare power and not the communication of any quality which be really in the efficient when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that produce it but we sens not be able to discover any unlikeness between the idea produce in we and the quality of the object produce it we be apt to imagine that we idea be resemblance of something in the object and not the effect of certain power place in the modification of they primary quality with which primary quality the idea produce in we have no resemblance 26 secondary quality twofold first immediately perceivable secondly mediately perceivable to conclude beside those before-mentioned primary quality in body viz bulk figure extension number and motion of they solid part all the rest whereby we take notice of body and distinguish they one from another be nothing else but several power in they depend on those primary quality whereby they be fit either by immediately operate on we body to produce several different idea in we or else by operate on other body so to change they primary quality as to render they capable of produce idea in we different from what before they do the former of these i think may be call secondary quality immediately perceivable : the latter secondary quality mediately perceivable chapter ix of perception 1 perception the first simple idea of reflection perception as it be the first faculty of the mind exercise about we idea so it be the first and simplest idea we have from reflection and be by some call thinking in general though think in the propriety of the english tongue signify that sort of operation in the mind about its idea wherein the mind be active where it with some degree of voluntary attention consider anything for in bare naked perception the mind be for the most part only passive and what it perceive it can not avoid perceive 2 reflection alone can give we the idea of what perception be what perception be every one will know better by reflect on what he do himself when he see hear feel & c or think than by any discourse of mine whoever reflect on what pass in he own mind can not miss it and if he do not reflect all the word in the world can not make he have any notion of it 3 arise in sensation only when the mind notice the organic impression this be certain that whatever alteration be make in the body if they reach not the mind whatever impression be make on the outward part if they be not take notice of within there be no perception fire may burn we body with no other effect than it do a billet unless the motion be continue to the brain and there the sense of heat or idea of pain be produce in the mind wherein consist actual perception 4 impulse on the organ insufficient how often may a man observe in himself that whilst he mind be intently employ in the contemplation of some object and curiously survey some idea that be there it take no notice of impression of sound body make upon the organ of hearing with the same alteration that use to be for the produce the idea of sound a sufficient impulse there may be on the organ but it not reach the observation of the mind there follow no perception : and though the motion that use to produce the idea of sound be make in the ear yet no sound be hear want of sensation in this case be not through any defect in the organ or that the man 's ear be less affected than at other time when he do hear but that which use to produce the idea though convey in by the usual organ not be take notice of in the understanding and so imprint no idea in the mind there follow no sensation so that wherever there be sense of perception there some idea be actually produce and present in the understanding 5 child though they may have idea in the womb have none innate therefore i doubt not but child by the exercise of they sens about object that affect they in the womb receive some few idea before they be bear as the unavoidable effect either of the body that environ they or else of those want or disease they suffer amongst which -lrb- if one may conjecture concern thing not very capable of examination -rrb- i think the idea of hunger and warmth be two : which probably be some of the first that child have and which they scarce ever part with again 6 the effect of sensation in the womb but though it be reasonable to imagine that child receive some idea before they come into the world yet these simple idea be far from those innate principle which some contend for and we above have reject these here mention be the effect of sensation be only from some affection of the body which happen to they there and so depend on something exterior to the mind no otherwise differ in they manner of production from other idea derive from sense but only in the precedency of time whereas those innate principle be suppose to be quite of another nature not come into the mind by any accidental alteration in or operation on the body but as it be original character impress upon it in the very first moment of its be and constitution 7 which idea appear first be not evident nor important as there be some idea which we may reasonably suppose may be introduce into the mind of child in the womb subservient to the necessity of they life and be there : so after they be bear those idea be the earliest imprinted which happen to be the sensible quality which first occur to they amongst which light be not the least considerable nor of the weakest efficacy and how covetous the mind be to be furnish with all such idea as have no pain accompany they may be a little guess by what be observable in child new-born who always turn they eye to that part from whence the light come lay they how you please but the idea that be most familiar at first be various accord to the diver circumstance of child 's first entertainment in the world the order wherein the several idea come at first into the mind be very various and uncertain also neither be it much material to know it 8 sensation often change by the judgment we be further to consider concern perception that the idea we receive by sensation be often in grown people alter by the judgment without we take notice of it when we set before we eye a round globe of any uniform color vg gold alabaster or jet it be certain that the idea thereby imprint on we mind be of a flat circle variously shadow with several degree of light and brightness come to we eye but we have by use be accustom to perceive what kind of appearance convex body be wont to make in we what alteration be make in the reflection of light by the difference of the sensible figure of body -- the judgment presently by a habitual custom alter the appearance into they cause so that from that which be truly variety of shadow or color collect the figure it make it pass for a mark of figure and frame to itself the perception of a convex figure and a uniform color when the idea we receive from thence be only a plane variously color as be evident in paint to which purpose i shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge the learn and worthy mr molineux which he be please to send I in a letter some month since and it be this : -- suppose a man bear blind and now adult and teach by he touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly of the same bigness so as to tell when he feel one and the other which be the cube which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere place on a table and the blind man be make to see : quaere whether by he sight before he touch they he could now distinguish and tell which be the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answer not for though he have obtain the experience of how a globe how a cube affect he touch yet he have not yet obtain the experience that what affect he touch so or so must affect he sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that press he hand unequally shall appear to he eye as it do in the cube -- i agree with this think gentleman whom i be proud to call my friend in he answer to this problem and be of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which be the globe which the cube whilst he only see they though he could unerringly name they by he touch and certainly distinguish they by the difference of they figure feel this i have set down and leave with my reader as a occasion for he to consider how much he may be beholden to experience improvement and acquire notion where he think he have not the least use of or help from they and the rather because this observe gentleman further add that have upon the occasion of my book propose this to diver very ingenious man he hardly ever meet with one that at first give the answer to it which he think true till by hear he reason they be convinced 9 this judgement apt to be mistake for direct perception but this be not i think usual in any of we idea but those receive by sight because sight the most comprehensive of all we sens convey to we mind the idea of light and color which be peculiar only to that sense and also the far different idea of space figure and motion the several variety whereof change the appearance of its proper object viz light and color we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other this in many case by a settle habit -- in thing whereof we have frequent experience be perform so constantly and so quick that we take that for the perception of we sensation which be a idea form by we judgment so that one viz that of sensation serve only to excite the other and be scarce take notice of itself -- as a man who read or hear with attention and understanding take little notice of the character or sound but of the idea that be excite in he by they 10 how by habit idea of sensation be unconsciously change into idea of judgment nor need we wonder that this be do with so little notice if we consider how quick the action of the mind be perform for as itself be think to take up no space to have no extension so its action seem to require no time but many of they seem to be crowd into a instant i speak this in comparison to the action of the body any one may easily observe this in he own thought who will take the pain to reflect on they how as it be in a instant do we mind with one glance see all the part of a demonstration which may very well be call a long one if we consider the time it will require to put it into word and step by step show it another secondly we shall not be so much surprised that this be do in we with so little notice if we consider how the facility which we get of do thing by a custom of do make they often pass in we without we notice habit especially such as be begin very early come at last to produce action in we which often escape we observation how frequently do we in a day cover we eye with we eyelid without perceive that we be at all in the dark man that by custom have get the use of a by-word do almost in every sentence pronounce sound which though take notice of by other they themselves neither hear nor observe and therefore it be not so strange that we mind should often change the idea of its sensation into that of its judgment and make one serve only to excite the other without we take notice of it 11 perception put the difference between animal and vegetable this faculty of perception seem to I to be that which put the distinction betwixt the animal kingdom and the inferior part of nature for however vegetable have many of they some degree of motion and upon the different application of other body to they do very briskly alter they figure and motion and so have obtain the name of sensitive plant from a motion which have some resemblance to that which in animal follow upon sensation : yet i suppose it be all bare mechanism and no otherwise produce than the turning of a wild oat-beard by the insinuation of the particle of moisture or the shorten of a rope by the affusion of water all which be do without any sensation in the subject or the have or receive any idea 12 perception in all animal perception i believe be in some degree in all sort of animal though in some possibly the avenue provide by nature for the reception of sensation be so few and the perception they be receive with so obscure and dull that it come extremely short of the quickness and variety of sensation which be in other animal but yet it be sufficient for and wisely adapt to the state and condition of that sort of animal who be thus make so that the wisdom and goodness of the maker plainly appear in all the part of this stupendous fabric and all the several degree and rank of creature in it 13 accord to they condition we may i think from the make of a oyster or cockle reasonably conclude that it have not so many nor so quick sens as a man or several other animal nor if it have would it in that state and incapacity of transfer itself from one place to another be better by they what good would sight and hearing do to a creature that can not move itself to or from the object wherein at a distance it perceive good or evil and would not quickness of sensation be a inconvenience to a animal that must lie still where chance have once place it and there receive the afflux of colder or warmer clean or foul water as it happen to come to it 14 decay of perception in old age but yet i can not but think there be some small dull perception whereby they be distinguish from perfect insensibility and that this may be so we have plain instance even in mankind itself take one in whom decrepit old age have blot out the memory of he past knowledge and clearly wipe out the idea he mind be formerly store with and have by destroy he sight hearing and smell quite and he taste to a great degree stop up almost all the passage for new one to enter or if there be some of the inlet yet half open the impression make be scarcely perceive or not at all retain how far such a one -lrb- notwithstanding all that be boast of innate principle -rrb- be in he knowledge and intellectual faculty above the condition of a cockle or a oyster i leave to be consider and if a man have pass sixty year in such a state as it be possible he might as well as three day i wonder what difference there would be in any intellectual perfection between he and the lowest degree of animal 15 perception the inlet of all material of knowledge perception then be the first step and degree towards knowledge and the inlet of all the material of it the fewer sens any man as well as any other creature have and the fewer and duller the impression be that be make by they and the duller the faculty be that be employ about they -- the more remote be they from that knowledge which be to be find in some man but this be in great variety of degree -lrb- as may be perceive amongst man -rrb- can not certainly be discover in the several species of animal much less in they particular individual it suffice I only to have remark here -- that perception be the first operation of all we intellectual faculty and the inlet of all knowledge in we mind and i be apt too to imagine that it be perception in the lowest degree of it which put the boundary between animal and the inferior rank of creature but this i mention only as my conjecture by the by it be indifferent to the matter in hand which way the learn shall determine of it chapter x of retention 1 contemplation the next faculty of the mind whereby it make a further progress towards knowledge be that which i call retention or the keep of those simple idea which from sensation or reflection it have receive this be do two way first by keep the idea which be bring into it for some time actually in view which be call contemplation 2 memory the other way of retention be the power to revive again in we mind those idea which after imprint have disappear or have be as it be lay aside out of sight and thus we do when we conceive heat or light yellow or sweet -- the object be remove this be memory which be as it be the storehouse of we idea for the narrow mind of man not be capable of have many idea under view and consideration at once it be necessary to have a repository to lay up those idea which at another time it might have use of but we idea be nothing but actual perception in the mind which cease to be anything when there be no perception of they this lay up of we idea in the repository of the memory signify no more but this -- that the mind have a power in many case to revive perception which it have once have with this additional perception annex to they that it have have they before and in this sense it be that we idea be say to be in we memory when indeed they be actually nowhere -- but only there be a ability in the mind when it will to revive they again and as it be paint they anew on itself though some with more some with less difficulty some more lively and other more obscurely and thus it be by the assistance of this faculty that we be say to have all those idea in we understanding which though we do not actually contemplate yet we can bring in sight and make appear again and be the object of we thought without the help of those sensible quality which first imprint they there 3 attention repetition pleasure and pain fix idea attention and repetition help much to the fix any idea in the memory but those which naturally at first make the deepest and most lasting impression be those which be accompany with pleasure or pain the great business of the sens be to make we take notice of what hurt or advantage the body it be wisely order by nature as have be show that pain should accompany the reception of several idea which supply the place of consideration and reasoning in child and act quicker than consideration in grown man make both the old and young avoid painful object with that haste which be necessary for they preservation and in both settle in the memory a caution for the future 4 idea fade in the memory concern the several degree of last wherewith idea be imprint on the memory we may observe -- that some of they have be produce in the understanding by a object affect the sens once only and no more than once other that have more than once offer themselves to the sens have yet be little take notice of : the mind either heedless as in child or otherwise employ as in man intent only on one thing not set the stamp deep into itself and in some where they be set on with care and repeat impression either through the temper of the body or some other fault the memory be very weak in all these case idea in the mind quickly fade and often vanish quite out of the understanding leave no more footstep or remain character of themselves than shadow do fly over field of corn and the mind be as void of they as if they have never be there 5 cause of oblivion thus many of those idea which be produce in the mind of child in the beginning of they sensation -lrb- some of which perhaps as of some pleasure and pain be before they be bear and other in they infancy -rrb- if in the future course of they life they be not repeat again be quite lose without the least glimpse remain of they this may be observe in those who by some mischance have lose they sight when they be very young in whom the idea of color have be but slightly take notice of and cease to be repeat do quite wear out so that some year after there be no more notion nor memory of color leave in they mind than in those of people bear blind the memory of some man it be true be very tenacious even to a miracle but yet there seem to be a constant decay of all we idea even of those which be strike deepest and in mind the most retentive so that if they be not sometimes renew by repeat exercise of the sens or reflection on those kind of object which at first occasion they the print wear out and at last there remain nothing to be see thus the idea as well as child of we youth often die before we : and we mind represent to we those tomb to which we be approach where though the brass and marble remain yet the inscription be efface by time and the imagery moulder away the picture draw in we mind be lay in fading color and if not sometimes refresh vanish and disappear how much the constitution of we body be concern in this and whether the temper of the brain make this difference that in some it retain the character draw on it like marble in other like freestone and in other little better than sand i shall here inquire though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body do sometimes influence the memory since we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its idea and the flame of a fever in a few day calcine all those image to dust and confusion which seem to be as lasting as if grave in marble 6 constantly repeat idea can scarce be lose but concern the idea themselves it be easy to remark that those that be oftenest refresh -lrb- amongst which be those that be convey into the mind by more way than one -rrb- by a frequent return of the object or action that produce they fix themselves best in the memory and remain clearest and longest there and therefore those which be of the original quality of body viz solidity extension figure motion and rest and those that almost constantly affect we body as heat and cold and those which be the affection of all kind of being as existence duration and number which almost every object that affect we sens every thought which employ we mind bring along with they -- these i say and the like idea be seldom quite lose whilst the mind retain any idea at all 7 in remember the mind be often active in this secondary perception as i may so call it or view again the idea that be lodge in the memory the mind be oftentimes more than barely passive the appearance of those dormant picture depend sometimes on the will the mind very often set itself on work in search of some hidden idea and turn as it be the eye of the soul upon it though sometimes too they start up in we mind of they own accord and offer themselves to the understanding and very often be rouse and tumble out of they dark cell into open daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passion we affection bring idea to we memory which have otherwise lie quiet and unregarded this further be to be observe concern idea lodge in the memory and upon occasion revive by the mind that they be not only -lrb- as the word revive import -rrb- none of they new one but also that the mind take notice of they as of a former impression and renew its acquaintance with they as with idea it have know before so that though idea formerly imprint be not all constantly in view yet in remembrance they be constantly know to be such as have be formerly imprinted ie in view and take notice of before by the understanding 8 two defect in the memory oblivion and slowness memory in a intellectual creature be necessary in the next degree to perception it be of so great moment that where it be want all the rest of we faculty be in a great measure useless and we in we thought reasoning and knowledge could not proceed beyond present object be it not for the assistance of we memory wherein there may be two defect : -- first that it lose the idea quite and so far it produce perfect ignorance for since we can know nothing further than we have the idea of it when that be go we be in perfect ignorance secondly that it move slowly and retrieve not the idea that it have and be lay up in store quick enough to serve the mind upon occasion this if it be to a great degree be stupidity and he who through this default in he memory have not the idea that be really preserve there ready at hand when need and occasion call for they be almost as good be without they quite since they serve he to little purpose the dull man who lose the opportunity whilst he be seek in he mind for those idea that should serve he turn be not much more happy in he knowledge than one that be perfectly ignorant it be the business therefore of the memory to furnish to the mind those dormant idea which it have present occasion for in the have they ready at hand on all occasion consist that which we call invention fancy and quickness of part 9 a defect which belong to the memory of man as finite these be defect we may observe in the memory of one man compare with another there be another defect which we may conceive to be in the memory of man in general -- compare with some superior create intellectual being which in this faculty may so far excel man that they may have constantly in view the whole scene of all they former action wherein no one of the thought they have ever have may slip out of they sight the omniscience of god who know all thing past present and to come and to whom the thought of man 's heart always lie open may satisfy we of the possibility of this for who can doubt but god may communicate to those glorious spirit he immediate attendant any of he perfection in what proportion he please as far as create finite being can be capable it be report of that prodigy of part monsieur pascal that till the decay of he health have impaired he memory he forget nothing of what he have do read or think in any part of he rational age this be a privilege so little known to most man that it seem almost incredible to those who after the ordinary way measure all other by themselves but yet when consider may help we to enlarge we thought towards greater perfection of it in superior rank of spirit for this of monsieur pascal be still with the narrowness that human mind be confine to here -- of have great variety of idea only by succession not all at once whereas the several degree of angel may probably have larger view and some of they be endow with capacity able to retain together and constantly set before they as in one picture all they past knowledge at once this we may conceive would be no small advantage to the knowledge of a think man -- if all he past thought and reasoning could be always present to he and therefore we may suppose it one of those way wherein the knowledge of separate spirit may exceedingly surpass ours 10 brute have memory this faculty of lay up and retain the idea that be bring into the mind several other animal seem to have to a great degree as well as man for to pass by other instance bird learning of tune and the endeavor one may observe in they to hit the note right put it past doubt with I that they have perception and retain idea in they memory and use they for pattern for it seem to I impossible that they should endeavor to conform they voice to note -lrb- as it be plain they do -rrb- of which they have no idea for though i should grant sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirit in the brain of those bird whilst the tune be actually play and that motion may be continue on to the muscle of the wing and so the bird mechanically be drive away by certain noise because this may tend to the bird 's preservation yet that can never be suppose a reason why it should cause mechanically -- either whilst the tune be play much less after it have cease -- such a motion of the organ in the bird 's voice as should conform it to the note of a foreign sound which imitation can be of no use to the bird 's preservation but which be more it can not with any appearance of reason be suppose -lrb- much less proved -rrb- that bird without sense and memory can approach they note nearer and nearer by degree to a tune play yesterday which if they have no idea of in they memory be now nowhere nor can be a pattern for they to imitate or which any repeat essay can bring they nearer to since there be no reason why the sound of a pipe should leave trace in they brain which not at first but by they after-endeavour should produce the like sound and why the sound they make themselves should not make trace which they should follow as well as those of the pipe be impossible to conceive chapter xi of discerning and other operation of the mind 1 no knowledge without discernment another faculty we may take notice of in we mind be that of discerning and distinguishing between the several idea it have it be not enough to have a confused perception of something in general unless the mind have a distinct perception of different object and they quality it would be capable of very little knowledge though the body that affect we be as busy about we as they be now and the mind be continually employ in think on this faculty of distinguish one thing from another depend the evidence and certainty of several even very general proposition which have pass for innate truth -- because man overlook the true cause why those proposition find universal assent impute it wholly to native uniform impression whereas it in truth depend upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind whereby it perceive two idea to be the same or different but of this more hereafter 2 the difference of wit and judgment how much the imperfection of accurately discriminate idea one from another lie either in the dulness or fault of the organ of sense or want of acuteness exercise or attention in the understanding or hastiness and precipitancy natural to some temper i will not here examine : it suffice to take notice that this be one of the operation that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself it be of that consequence to its other knowledge that so far as this faculty be in itself dull or not rightly make use of for the distinguish one thing from another -- so far we notion be confuse and we reason and judgment disturbed or mislead if in have we idea in the memory ready at hand consist quickness of part in this of have they unconfused and be able nicely to distinguish one thing from another where there be but the least difference consist in a great measure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason which be to be observe in one man above another and hence perhaps may be give some reason of that common observation -- that man who have a great deal of wit and prompt memory have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason for wit lie most in the assemblage of idea and put those together with quickness and variety wherein can be find any resemblance or congruity thereby to make up pleasant picture and agreeable vision in the fancy judgment on the contrary lie quite on the other side in separate carefully one from another idea wherein can be find the least difference thereby to avoid be mislead by similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another this be a way of proceed quite contrary to metaphor and allusion wherein for the most part lie that entertainment and pleasantry of wit which strike so lively on the fancy and therefore be so acceptable to all people because its beauty appear at first sight and there be require no labor of think to examine what truth or reason there be in it the mind without look any further rest satisfy with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy and it be a kind of affront to go about to examine it by the severe rule of truth and good reason whereby it appear that it consist in something that be not perfectly conformable to they 3 clearness alone hinder confusion to the well distinguish we idea it chiefly contribute that they be clear and determinate and when they be so it will not breed any confusion or mistake about they though the sens should -lrb- as sometimes they do -rrb- convey they from the same object differently on different occasion and so seem to err for though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste which at another time would produce a sweet one yet the idea of bitter in that man 's mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he have taste only gall nor do it make any more confusion between the two idea of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produce at one time one and at another time another idea by the taste than it make a confusion in two idea of white and sweet or white and round that the same piece of sugar produce they both in the mind at the same time and the idea of orange-colour and azure that be produce in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritmim be no less distinct idea than those of the same color take from two very different body 4 compare the compare they one with another in respect of extent degree time place or any other circumstance be another operation of the mind about its idea and be that upon which depend all that large tribe of idea comprehend under relation which of how vast a extent it be i shall have occasion to consider hereafter 5 brute compare but imperfectly how far brute partake in this faculty be not easy to determine i imagine they have it not in any great degree for though they probably have several idea distinct enough yet it seem to I to be the prerogative of human understanding when it have sufficiently distinguish any idea so as to perceive they to be perfectly different and so consequently two to cast about and consider in what circumstance they be capable to be compare and therefore i think beast compare not they idea further than some sensible circumstance annex to the object themselves the other power of compare which may be observe in man belong to general idea and useful only to abstract reasoning we may probably conjecture beast have not 6 compound the next operation we may observe in the mind about its idea be composition whereby it put together several of those simple one it have receive from sensation and reflection and combine they into complex one under this of composition may be reckon also that of enlarge wherein though the composition do not so much appear as in more complex one yet it be nevertheless a put several idea together though of the same kind thus by add several unit together we make the idea of a dozen and put together the repeat idea of several perch we frame that of a furlong 7 brute compound but little in this also i suppose brute come far short of man for though they take in and retain together several combination of simple idea as possibly the shape smell and voice of he master make up the complex idea a dog have of he or rather be so many distinct mark whereby he know he yet i do not think they do of themselves ever compound they and make complex idea and perhaps even where we think they have complex idea it be only one simple one that direct they in the knowledge of several thing which possibly they distinguish less by they sight than we imagine for i have be credibly inform that a bitch will nurse play with and be fond of young fox as much as and in place of she puppy if you can but get they once to suck she so long that she milk may go through they and those animal which have a numerous brood of young one at once appear not to have any knowledge of they number for though they be mightily concern for any of they young that be take from they whilst they be in sight or hearing yet if one or two of they be steal from they in they absence or without noise they appear not to miss they or to have any sense that they number be lessen 8 name when child have by repeat sensation get idea fix in they memory they begin by degree to learn the use of sign and when they have get the skill to apply the organ of speech to the framing of articulate sound they begin to make use of word to signify they idea to other these verbal sign they sometimes borrow from other and sometimes make themselves as one may observe among the new and unusual name child often give to thing in the first use of language 9 abstraction the use of word then be to stand as outward mark of we internal idea and those idea be take from particular thing if every particular idea that we take up should have a distinct name name must be endless to prevent this the mind make the particular idea receive from particular object to become general which be do by consider they as they be in the mind such appearance -- separate from all other existence and the circumstance of real existence as time place or any other concomitant idea this be call abstraction whereby idea take from particular being become general representative of all of the same kind and they name general name applicable to whatever exist conformable to such abstract idea such precise naked appearance in the mind without consider how whence or with what other they come there the understanding lay up -lrb- with name commonly annex to they -rrb- as the standard to rank real existence into sort as they agree with these pattern and to denominate they accordingly thus the same color be observe to-day in chalk or snow which the mind yesterday receive from milk it consider that appearance alone make it a representative of all of that kind and have give it the name whiteness it by that sound signify the same quality wheresoever to be imagine or meet with and thus universal whether idea or term be make 10 brute abstract not if it may be doubt whether beast compound and enlarge they idea that way to any degree this i think i may be positive in -- that the power of abstract be not at all in they and that the have of general idea be that which put a perfect distinction betwixt man and brute and be a excellency which the faculty of brute do by no means attain to for it be evident we observe no footstep in they of make use of general sign for universal idea from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstract or make general idea since they have no use of word or any other general sign 11 brute abstract not yet be nor bare machine nor can it be imputed to they want of fit organ to frame articulate sound that they have no use or knowledge of general word since many of they we find can fashion such sound and pronounce word distinctly enough but never with any such application and on the other side man who through some defect in the organ want word yet fail not to express they universal idea by sign which serve they instead of general word a faculty which we see beast come short in and therefore i think we may suppose that it be in this that the species of brute be discriminate from man : and it be that proper difference wherein they be wholly separated and which at last widen to so vast a distance for if they have any idea at all and be not bare machine -lrb- as some would have they -rrb- we can not deny they to have some reason it seem as evident to I that they do reason as that they have sense but it be only in particular idea just as they receive they from they sens they be the best of they tie up within those narrow bound and have not -lrb- as i think -rrb- the faculty to enlarge they by any kind of abstraction 12 idiot and madman how far idiot be concern in the want or weakness of any or all of the foregoing faculty a exact observation of they several way of faultering would no doubt discover for those who either perceive but dully or retain the idea that come into they mind but ill who can not readily excite or compound they will have little matter to think on those who can not distinguish compare and abstract would hardly be able to understand and make use of language or judge or reason to any tolerable degree but only a little and imperfectly about thing present and very familiar to they sens and indeed any of the forementioned faculty if want or out of order produce suitable defect in man 's understanding and knowledge 13 difference between idiot and madman in fine the defect in natural seem to proceed from want of quickness activity and motion in the intellectual faculty whereby they be deprive of reason whereas madman on the other side seem to suffer by the other extreme for they do not appear to I to have lose the faculty of reasoning but have join together some idea very wrongly they mistake they for truth and they err as man do that argue right from wrong principle for by the violence of they imagination have take they fancy for reality they make right deduction from they thus you shall find a distract man fancy himself a king with a right inference require suitable attendance respect and obedience : other who have think themselves make of glass have use the caution necessary to preserve such brittle body hence it come to pass that a man who be very sober and of a right understanding in all other thing may in one particular be as frantic as any in bedlam if either by any sudden very strong impression or long fix he fancy upon one sort of thought incoherent idea have be cement together so powerfully as to remain united but there be degree of madness as of folly the disorderly jumbling idea together be in some more and some less in short herein seem to lie the difference between idiot and madman : that madman put wrong idea together and so make wrong proposition but argue and reason right from they but idiot make very few or no proposition and reason scarce at all 14 method follow in this explication of faculty these i think be the first faculty and operation of the mind which it make use of in understanding and though they be exercise about all its idea in general yet the instance i have hitherto give have be chiefly in simple idea and i have subjoin the explication of these faculty of the mind to that of simple idea before i come to what i have to say concern complex one for these follow reason : -- first because several of these faculty be exercise at first principally about simple idea we might by follow nature in its ordinary method trace and discover they in they rise progress and gradual improvement secondly because observe the faculty of the mind how they operate about simple idea -- which be usually in most man 's mind much more clear precise and distinct than complex one -- we may the better examine and learn how the mind extract denominate compare and exercise in its other operation about those which be complex wherein we be much more liable to mistake thirdly because these very operation of the mind about idea receive from sensation be themselves when reflect on another set of idea derive from that other source of we knowledge which i call reflection and therefore fit to be consider in this place after the simple idea of sensation of compound compare abstract & c i have but just speak have occasion to treat of they more at large in other place 15 the true beginning of human knowledge and thus i have give a short and i think true history of the first beginning of human knowledge -- whence the mind have its first object and by what step it make its progress to the lay in and store up those idea out of which be to be frame all the knowledge it be capable of : wherein i must appeal to experience and observation whether i be in the right : the best way to come to truth be to examine thing as really they be and not to conclude they be as we fancy of ourselves or have be teach by other to imagine 16 appeal to experience to deal truly this be the only way that i can discover whereby the idea of thing be bring into the understanding if other man have either innate idea or infuse principle they have reason to enjoy they and if they be sure of it it be impossible for other to deny they the privilege that they have above they neighbor i can speak but of what i find in myself and be agreeable to those notion which if we will examine the whole course of man in they several age country and education seem to depend on those foundation which i have lay and to correspond with this method in all the part and degree thereof 17 dark room i pretend not to teach but to inquire and therefore can not but confess here again -- that external and internal sensation be the only passage i can find of knowledge to the understand these alone as far as i can discover be the window by which light be let into this dark room for methink the understanding be not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light with only some little opening leave to let in external visible resemblance or idea of thing without : which would they but stay there and lie so orderly as to be find upon occasion it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all object of sight and the idea of they these be my guess concern the means whereby the understanding come to have and retain simple idea and the mode of they with some other operation about they i proceed now to examine some of these simple idea a they mode a little more particularly chapter xii of complex idea 1 make by the mind out of simple one we have hitherto consider those idea in the reception whereof the mind be only passive which be those simple one receive from sensation and reflection before mention whereof the mind can not make one to itself nor have any idea which do not wholly consist of they as simple idea be observe to exist in several combination unite together so the mind have a power to consider several of they unite together as one idea and that not only as they be unite in external object but as itself have join they together idea thus make up of several simple one put together i call complex -- such as be beauty gratitude a man a army the universe which though complicate of various simple idea or complex idea make up of simple one yet be when the mind please consider each by itself as one entire thing signify by one name 2 make voluntarily in this faculty of repeat and join together its idea the mind have great power in vary and multiply the object of its thought infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnish it with : but all this still confine to those simple idea which it receive from those two source and which be the ultimate material of all its composition for simple idea be all from thing themselves and of these the mind can have no more nor other than what be suggest to it it can have no other idea of sensible quality than what come from without -lrb- \* drop word -rrb- the sens nor any idea of other kind of operation of a think substance than what it find in itself but when it have once get these simple idea it be not confine barely to observation and what offer itself from without it can by its own power put together those idea it have and make new complex one which it never receive so united 3 complex idea be either of mode substance or relation complex idea however compound and decompound though they number be infinite and the variety endless wherewith they fill and entertain the thought of man yet i think they may be all reduce under these three head : -- 1 mode 2 substance 3 relation 4 idea of mode first mode i call such complex idea which however compound contain not in they the supposition of subsist by themselves but be consider as dependence on or affection of substance -- such as be the idea signify by the word triangle gratitude murder & c and if in this i use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification i beg pardon it be unavoidable in discourse differ from the ordinary receive notion either to make new word or to use old word in somewhat a new signification the later whereof in we present case be perhaps the more tolerable of the two 5 simple and mixed mode of idea of these mode there be two sort which deserve distinct consideration : -- first there be some which be only variation or different combination of the same simple idea without the mixture of any other -- as a dozen or score which be nothing but the idea of so many distinct unit add together and these i call simple mode as be contain within the bound of one simple idea secondly there be other compound of simple idea of several kind put together to make one complex one -- vg beauty consist of a certain composition of color and figure cause delight to the beholder theft which be the conceal change of the possession of anything without the consent of the proprietor contain as be visible a combination of several idea of several kind : and these i call mixed mode 6 idea of substance single or collective secondly the idea of substance be such combination of simple idea as be take to represent distinct particular thing subsist by themselves in which the suppose or confuse idea of substance such as it be be always the first and chief thus if to substance be join the simple idea of a certain dull whitish color with certain degree of weight hardness ductility and fusibility we have the idea of lead and a combination of the idea of a certain sort of figure with the power of motion thought and reasoning join to substance make the ordinary idea of a man now of substance also there be two sort of idea : -- one of single substance as they exist separately as of a man or a sheep the other of several of those put together as a army of man or flock of sheep -- which collective idea of several substance thus put together be as much each of they one single idea as that of a man or a unit 7 idea of relation thirdly the last sort of complex idea be that we call relation which consist in the consideration and compare one idea with another of these several kind we shall treat in they order 8 the abstrusest idea we can have be all from two source if we trace the progress of we mind and with attention observe how it repeat add together and unite its simple idea receive from sensation or reflection it will lead we further than at first perhaps we should have imagine and i believe we shall find if we warily observe the original of we notion that even the most abstruse idea how remote soever they may seem from sense or from any operation of we own mind be yet only such as the understanding frame to itself by repeat and join together idea that it have either from object of sense or from its own operation about they : so that those even large and abstract idea be derive from sensation or reflection be no other than what the mind by the ordinary use of its own faculty employ about idea receive from object of sense or from the operation it observe in itself about they may and do attain unto this i shall endeavor to show in the idea we have of space time and infinity and some few other that seem the most remote from those original chapter xiii complex idea of simple mode : -- and first of the simple mode of idea of space 1 simple mode of simple idea though in the foregoing part i have often mention simple idea which be truly the material of all we knowledge yet have treat of they there rather in the way that they come into the mind than as distinguish from other more compound it will not be perhaps amiss to take a view of some of they again under this consideration and examine those different modification of the same idea which the mind either find in thing exist or be able to make within itself without the help of any extrinsical object or any foreign suggestion those modification of any one simple idea -lrb- which as have be say i call simple mode -rrb- be as perfectly different and distinct idea in the mind as those of the greatest distance or contrariety for the idea of two be as distinct from that of one as blueness from heat or either of they from any number : and yet it be make up only of that simple idea of a unit repeat and repetition of this kind join together make those distinct simple mode of a dozen a gross a million simple mode of idea of space 2 idea of space i shall begin with the simple idea of space i have show above chap 4 that we get the idea of space both by we sight and touch which i think be so evident that it would be as needless to go to prove that man perceive by they sight a distance between body of different color or between the part of the same body as that they see color themselves : nor be it less obvious that they can do so in the dark by feeling and touch 3 space and extension this space consider barely in length between any two being without consider anything else between they be call distance : if consider in length breadth and thickness i think it may be call capacity when consider between the extremity of matter which fill the capacity of space with something solid tangible and moveable it be properly call extension and so extension be a idea belong to body only but space may as be evident be consider without it at lest i think it most intelligible and the best way to avoid confusion if we use the word extension for a affection of matter or the distance of the extremity of particular solid body and space in the more general signification for distance with or without solid matter possess it 4 immensity each different distance be a different modification of space and each idea of any different distance or space be a simple mode of this idea man have by accustom themselves to state length of space which they use for measure other distance -- as a foot a yard or a fathom a league or diameter of the earth -- make those idea familiar to they thought can in they mind repeat they as often as they will without mix or join to they the idea of body or anything else and frame to themselves the idea of long square or cubic foot yard or fathom here amongst the body of the universe or else beyond the utmost bound of all body and by add these still one to another enlarge they idea of space as much as they please the power of repeat or double any idea we have of any distance and add it to the former as often as we will without be ever able to come to any stop or stint let we enlarge it as much as we will be that which give we the idea of immensity 5 figure there be another modification of this idea which be nothing but the relation which the part of the termination of extension or circumscribed space have amongst themselves this the touch discover in sensible body whose extremity come within we reach and the eye take both from body and color whose boundary be within its view : where observe how the extremity terminate -- either in straight line which meet at discernible angle or in crooked line wherein no angle can be perceive by consider these as they relate to one another in all part of the extremity of any body or space it have that idea we call figure which afford to the mind infinite variety for besides the vast number of different figure that do really exist in the coherent mass of matter the stock that the mind have in its power by vary the idea of space and thereby make still new composition by repeat its own idea and join they as it please be perfectly inexhaustible and so it can multiply figure in infinitum 6 endless variety of figure for the mind have a power to repeat the idea of any length directly stretch out and join it to another in the same direction which be to double the length of that straight line or else join another with what inclination it think fit and so make what sort of angle it please : and be able also to shorten any line it imagine by take from it one half one fourth or what part it please without be able to come to a end of any such division it can make a angle of any bigness so also the line that be its side of what length it please which join again to other line of different length and at different angle till it have wholly enclose any space it be evident that it can multiply figure both in they shape and capacity in infinitum all which be but so many different simple mode of space the same that it can do with straight line it can also do with crooked or crooked and straight together and the same it can do in line it can also in superficies by which we may be lead into farther thought of the endless variety of figure that the mind have a power to make and thereby to multiply the simple mode of space 7 place another idea come under this head and belong to this tribe be that we call place as in simple space we consider the relation of distance between any two body or point so in we idea of place we consider the relation of distance betwixt anything and any two or more point which be consider as keep the same distance one with another and so consider as at rest for when we find anything at the same distance now which it be yesterday from any two or more point which have not since change they distance one with another and with which we then compare it we say it have keep the same place : but if it have sensibly alter its distance with either of those point we say it have change its place : though vulgarly speak in the common notion of place we do not always exactly observe the distance from these precise point but from larger portion of sensible object to which we consider the thing place to bear relation and its distance from which we have some reason to observe 8 place relative to particular body thus a company of chess-men standing on the same square of the chess-board where we leave they we say they be all in the same place or unmoved though perhaps the chessboard have be in the mean time carry out of one room into another because we compare they only to the part of the chess-board which keep the same distance one with another the chess-board we also say be in the same place it be if it remain in the same part of the cabin though perhaps the ship which it be in sail all the while and the ship be say to be in the same place suppose it keep the same distance with the part of the neighbouring land though perhaps the earth have turn round and so both chess-men and board and ship have every one change place in respect of remoter body which have keep the same distance one with another but yet the distance from certain part of the board be that which determine the place of the chess-man and the distance from the fixed part of the cabin -lrb- with which we make the comparison -rrb- be that which determine the place of the chess-board and the fixed part of the earth that by which we determine the place of the ship -- these thing may be say to be in the same place in those respects : though they distance from some other thing which in this matter we do not consider be vary they have undoubtedly change place in that respect and we ourselves shall think so when we have occasion to compare they with those other 9 place relative to a present purpose but this modification of distance we call place be make by man for they common use that by it they might be able to design the particular position of thing where they have occasion for such designation man consider and determine of this place by reference to those adjacent thing which best serve to they present purpose without consider other thing which to another purpose would better determine the place of the same thing thus in the chess-board the use of the designation of the place of each chess-man be determine only within that chequered piece of wood it would cross that purpose to measure it by anything else but when these very chess-men be put up in a bag if any one should ask where the black king be it would be proper to determine the place by the part of the room it be in and not by the chessboard there be another use of design the place it be now in than when in play it be on the chessboard and so must be determine by other body so if any one should ask in what place be the verse which report the story of nisus and euryalus it would be very improper to determine this place by say they be in such a part of the earth or in bodley 's library : but the right designation of the place would be by the part of virgil 's work and the proper answer would be that these verse be about the middle of the ninth book of he aeneid and that they have be always constantly in the same place ever since virgil be print : which be true though the book itself have move a thousand time the use of the idea of place here be to know in what part of the book that story be that so upon occasion we may know where to find it and have recourse to it for use 10 place of the universe that we idea of place be nothing else but such a relative position of anything as i have before mention i think be plain and will be easily admit when we consider that we can have no idea of the place of the universe though we can of all the part of it because beyond that we have not the idea of any fix distinct particular being in reference to which we can imagine it to have any relation of distance but all beyond it be one uniform space or expansion wherein the mind find no variety no mark for to say that the world be somewhere mean no more than that it do exist this though a phrase borrow from place signify only its existence not location : and when one can find out and frame in he mind clearly and distinctly the place of the universe he will be able to tell we whether it move or stand still in the undistinguishable inane of infinite space : though it be true that the word place have sometimes a more confused sense and stand for that space which anybody take up and so the universe be in a place the idea therefore of place we have by the same means that we get the idea of space -lrb- whereof this be but a particular limited consideration -rrb- viz by we sight and touch by either of which we receive into we mind the idea of extension or distance 11 extension and body not the same there be some that would persuade we that body and extension be the same thing who either change the signification of word which i would not suspect they of -- they have so severely condemn the philosophy of other because it have be too much place in the uncertain meaning or deceitful obscurity of doubtful or insignificant term if therefore they mean by body and extension the same that other people do viz by body something that be solid and extended whose part be separable and movable different way and by extension only the space that lie between the extremity of those solid coherent part and which be possess by they -- they confound very different idea one with another for i appeal to every man 's own thought whether the idea of space be not as distinct from that of solidity as it be from the idea of scarlet color it be true solidity can not exist without extension neither can scarlet color exist without extension but this hinder not but that they be distinct idea many idea require other as necessary to they existence or conception which yet be very distinct idea motion can neither be nor be conceive without space and yet motion be not space nor space motion space can exist without it and they be very distinct idea and so i think be those of space and solidity solidity be so inseparable a idea from body that upon that depend its filling of space its contact impulse and communication of motion upon impulse and if it be a reason to prove that spirit be different from body because think include not the idea of extension in it the same reason will be as valid i suppose to prove that space be not body because it include not the idea of solidity in it space and solidity be as distinct idea as thinking and extension and as wholly separable in the mind one from another body then and extension it be evident be two distinct idea for 12 extension not solidity first extension include no solidity nor resistance to the motion of body as body do 13 the part of space inseparable both really and mentally secondly the part of pure space be inseparable one from the other so that the continuity can not be separate both neither really nor mentally for i demand of any one to remove any part of it from another with which it be continue even so much as in think to divide and separate actually be as i think by remove the part one from another to make two superficies where before there be a continuity : and to divide mentally be to make in the mind two superficies where before there be a continuity and consider they as remove one from the other which can only be do in thing consider by the mind as capable of be separate and by separation of acquire new distinct superficies which they then have not but be capable of but neither of these way of separation whether real or mental be as i think compatible to pure space it be true a man may consider so much of such a space as be answerable or commensurate to a foot without consider the rest which be indeed a partial consideration but not so much as mental separation or division since a man can no more mentally divide without consider two superficies separate one from the other than he can actually divide without make two superficies disjoin one from the other : but a partial consideration be not separate a man may consider light in the sun without its heat or mobility in body without its extension without thinking of they separation one be only a partial consideration terminate in one alone and the other be a consideration of both as exist separately 14 the part of space immovable thirdly the part of pure space be immovable which follow from they inseparability motion be nothing but change of distance between any two thing but this can not be between part that be inseparable which therefore must need be at perpetual rest one amongst another thus the determine idea of simple space distinguish it plainly and sufficiently from body since its part be inseparable immovable and without resistance to the motion of body 15 the definition of extension explain it not if any one ask I what this space i speak of be i will tell he when he tell I what he extension be for to say as be usually do that extension be to have parte extra parte be to say only that extension be extension for what be i the better inform in the nature of extension when i be tell that extension be to have part that be extend exterior to part that be extend i e extension consist of extended part as if one ask what a fiber be i should answer he -- that it be a thing make up of several fiber would he thereby be enable to understand what a fiber be better than he do before or rather would he not have reason to think that my design be to make sport with he rather than seriously to instruct he 16 division of being into body and spirit prove not space and body the same those who contend that space and body be the same bring this dilemma : -- either this space be something or nothing if nothing be between two body they must necessarily touch if it be allow to be something they ask whether it be body or spirit to which i answer by another question who tell they that there be or could be nothing but solid being which could not think and think being that be not extend -- which be all they mean by the term body and spirit 17 substance which we know not no proof against space without body if it be demand -lrb- as usually it be -rrb- whether this space void of body be substance or accident i shall readily answer i know not nor shall be ashamed to own my ignorance till they that ask show I a clear distinct idea of substance 18 different meaning of substance i endeavor as much as i can to deliver myself from those fallacy which we be apt to put upon ourselves by take word for thing it help not we ignorance to feign a knowledge where we have none by make a noise with sound without clear and distinct signification name make at pleasure neither alter the nature of thing nor make we understand they but as they be sign of and stand for determine idea and i desire those who lay so much stress on the sound of these two syllable substance to consider whether apply it as they do to the infinite incomprehensible god to finite spirit and to body it be in the same sense and whether it stand for the same idea when each of those three so different being be call substance if so whether it will thence follow -- that god spirit and body agree in the same common nature of substance differ not any otherwise than in a bare different modification of that substance as a tree and a pebble be in the same sense body and agree in the common nature of body differ only in a bare modification of that common matter which will be a very harsh doctrine if they say that they apply it to god finite spirit and matter in three different signification and that it stand for one idea when god be say to be a substance for another when the soul be call substance and for a third when body be call so -- if the name substance stand for three several distinct idea they would do well to make know those distinct idea or at least to give three distinct name to they to prevent in so important a notion the confusion and error that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of so doubtful a term which be so far from be suspect to have three distinct that in ordinary use it have scarce one clear distinct signification and if they can thus make three distinct idea of substance what hinder why another may not make a fourth 19 substance and accident of little use in philosophy they who first run into the notion of accident as a sort of real being that need something to inhere in be force to find out the word substance to support they have the poor indian philosopher -lrb- who imagine that the earth also want something to bear it up -rrb- but thought of this word substance he need not to have be at the trouble to find a elephant to support it and a tortoise to support he elephant : the word substance would have do it effectually and he that inquire might have take it for as good a answer from a indian philosopher -- that substance without know what it be be that which support the earth as take it for a sufficient answer and good doctrine from we european philosopher -- that substance without know what it be be that which support accident so that of substance we have no idea of what it be but only a confused obscure one of what it do 20 sticking on and under-propping whatever a learn man may do here a intelligent american who inquire into the nature of thing would scarce take it for a satisfactory account if desire to learn we architecture he should be tell that a pillar be a thing support by a basis and a basis something that support a pillar would he not think himself mock instead of teach with such a account as this and a stranger to they would be very liberally instruct in the nature of book and the thing they contain if he should be tell that all learn book consist of paper and letter and that letter be thing inher in paper and paper a thing that hold forth letter : a notable way of have clear idea of letter and paper but be the latin word inhaerentium and substantio put into the plain english one that answer they and be call sticking on and under-propping they would better discover to we the very great clearness there be in the doctrine of substance and accident and show of what use they be in decide of question in philosophy 21 a vacuum beyond the utmost bound of body but to return to we idea of space if body be not suppose infinite -lrb- which i think no one will affirm -rrb- i would ask whether if god place a man at the extremity of corporeal being he could not stretch he hand beyond he body if he could then he would put he arm where there be before space without body and if there he spread he finger there would still be space between they without body if he could not stretch out he hand it must be because of some external hindrance -lrb- for we suppose he alive with such a power of move the part of he body that he have now which be not in itself impossible if god so pleased to have it or at least it be not impossible for god so to move he : -rrb- and then i ask -- whether that which hinder he hand from move outwards be substance or accident something or nothing and when they have resolve that they will be able to resolve themselves -- what that be which be or may be between two body at a distance that be not body and have no solidity in the mean time the argument be at least as good that where nothing hinder -lrb- as beyond the utmost bound of all body -rrb- a body put in motion may move on as where there be nothing between there two body must necessarily touch for pure space between be sufficient to take away the necessity of mutual contact but bare space in the way be not sufficient to stop motion the truth be these man must either own that they think body infinite though they be loth to speak it out or else affirm that space be not body for i would fain meet with that think man that can in he thought set any bound to space more than he can to duration or by think hope to arrive at the end of either and therefore if he idea of eternity be infinite so be he idea of immensity they be both finite or infinite alike 22 the power of annihilation prove a vacuum farther those who assert the impossibility of space exist without matter must not only make body infinite but must also deny a power in god to annihilate any part of matter no one i suppose will deny that god can put a end to all motion that be in matter and fix all the body of the universe in a perfect quiet and rest and continue they so long as he please whoever then will allow that god can during such a general rest annihilate either this book or the body of he that read it must necessarily admit the possibility of a vacuum for it be evident that the space that be fill by the part of the annihilate body will still remain and be a space without body for the circumambient body be in perfect rest be a wall of adamant and in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other body to get into that space and indeed the necessary motion of one particle of matter into the place from whence another particle of matter be remove be but a consequence from the supposition of plenitude which will therefore need some better proof than a suppose matter of fact which experiment can never make out -- we own clear and distinct idea plainly satisfy that there be no necessary connexion between space and solidity since we can conceive the one without the other and those who dispute for or against a vacuum do thereby confess they have distinct idea of vacuum and plenum i e that they have a idea of extension void of solidity though they deny its existence or else they dispute about nothing at all for they who so much alter the signification of word as to call extension body and consequently make the whole essence of body to be nothing but pure extension without solidity must talk absurdly whenever they speak of vacuum since it be impossible for extension to be without extension for vacuum whether we affirm or deny its existence signify space without body whose very existence no one can deny to be possible who will not make matter infinite and take from god a power to annihilate any particle of it 23 motion prove a vacuum but not to go so far as beyond the utmost bound of body in the universe nor appeal to god 's omnipotency to find a vacuum the motion of body that be in we view and neighborhood seem to I plainly to evince it for i desire any one so to divide a solid body of any dimension he please as to make it possible for the solid part to move up and down freely every way within the bound of that superficies if there be not leave in it a void space as big as the least part into which he have divide the say solid body and if where the least particle of the body divide be as big as a mustard-seed a void space equal to the bulk of a mustard-seed be requisite to make room for the free motion of the part of the divide body within the bound of its superficies where the particle of matter be 100000000 less than a mustard-seed there must also be a space void of solid matter as big as 100000000 part of a mustard-seed for if it hold in the one it will hold in the other and so on in infinitum and let this void space be as little as it will it destroy the hypothesis of plenitude for if there can be a space void of body equal to the smallest separate particle of matter now exist in nature it be still space without body and make as great a difference between space and body as if it be mega chasma a distance as wide as any in nature and therefore if we suppose not the void space necessary to motion equal to the least parcel of the divide solid matter but to 1\/10 or 1\/1000 of it the same consequence will always follow of space without matter 24 the idea of space and body distinct but the question be here -- whether the idea of space or extension be the same with the idea of body it be not necessary to prove the real existence of a vacuum but the idea of it which it be plain man have when they inquire and dispute whether there be a vacuum or no for if they have not the idea of space without body they could not make a question about its existence : and if they idea of body do not include in it something more than the bare idea of space they could have no doubt about the plenitude of the world and it would be as absurd to demand whether there be space without body as whether there be space without space or body without body since these be but different name of the same idea 25 extension be inseparable from body prove it not the same it be true the idea of extension join itself so inseparably with all visible and most tangible quality that it suffer we to see no one or feel very few external object without take in impression of extension too this readiness of extension to make itself be take notice of so constantly with other idea have be the occasion i guess that some have make the whole essence of body to consist in extension which be not much to be wonder at since some have have they mind by they eye and touch -lrb- the busiest of all we sens -rrb- so fill with the idea of extension and as it be wholly possess with it that they allow no existence to anything that have not extension i shall not now argue with those man who take the measure and possibility of all be only from they narrow and gross imagination : but have here to do only with those who conclude the essence of body to be extension because they say they can not imagine any sensible quality of any body without extension -- i shall desire they to consider that have they reflect on they idea of taste and smell as much as on those of sight and touch nay have they examine they idea of hunger and thirst and several other pain they would have find that they include in they no idea of extension at all which be but a affection of body as well as the rest discoverable by we sens which be scarce acute enough to look into the pure essence of thing 26 essence of thing if those idea which be constantly join to all other must therefore be conclude to be the essence of those thing which have constantly those idea join to they and be inseparable from they then unity be without doubt the essence of everything for there be not any object of sensation or reflection which do not carry with it the idea of one : but the weakness of this kind of argument we have already show sufficiently 27 idea of space and solidity distinct to conclude : whatever man shall think concern the existence of a vacuum this be plain to I -- that we have as clear a idea of space distinct from solidity as we have of solidity distinct from motion or motion from space we have not any two more distinct idea and we can as easily conceive space without solidity as we can conceive body or space without motion though it be never so certain that neither body nor motion can exist without space but whether any one will take space to be only a relation result from the existence of other being at a distance or whether they will think the word of the most know king solomon ` the heaven and the heaven of heaven can not contain thee ' or those more emphatical one of the inspired philosopher st paul ` in he we live move and have we be ' be to be understand in a literal sense i leave every one to consider : only we idea of space be i think such as i have mention and distinct from that of body for whether we consider in matter itself the distance of its coherent solid part and call it in respect of those solid part extension or whether consider it as lie between the extremity of any body in its several dimension we call it length breadth and thickness or else consider it as lie between any two body or positive being without any consideration whether there be any matter or not between we call it distance -- however name or consider it be always the same uniform simple idea of space take from object about which we sens have be conversant whereof have settle idea in we mind we can revive repeat and add they one to another as often as we will and consider the space or distance so imagine either as fill with solid part so that another body can not come there without displace and thrust out the body that be there before or else as void of solidity so that a body of equal dimension to that empty or pure space may be place in it without the remove or expulsion of anything that be there 28 man differ little in clear simple idea the know precisely what we word stand for would i imagine in this as well as a great many other case quickly end the dispute for i be apt to think that man when they come to examine they find they simple idea all generally to agree though in discourse with one another they perhaps confound one another with different name i imagine that man who abstract they thought and do well examine the idea of they own mind can not much differ in think however they may perplex themselves with word accord to the way of speaking of the several school or sect they have be breed up in : though amongst unthinking man who examine not scrupulously and carefully they own idea and strip they not from the mark man use for they but confound they with word there must be endless dispute wrangling and jargon especially if they be learn bookish man devote to some sect and accustom to the language of it and have learn to talk after other but if it should happen that any two think man should really have different idea i do not see how they could discourse or argue one with another here i must not be mistake to think that every float imagination in man 's brain be presently of that sort of idea i speak of it be not easy for the mind to put off those confused notion and prejudice it have imbibe from custom inadvertency and common conversation it require pain and assiduity to examine its idea till it resolve they into those clear and distinct simple one out of which they be compound and to see which amongst its simple one have or have not a necessary connexion and dependence one upon another till a man doth this in the primary and original notion of thing he build upon float and uncertain principle and will often find himself at a loss chapter xiv idea of duration and its simple mode 1 duration be fleeting extension there be another sort of distance or length the idea whereof we get not from the permanent part of space but from the fleeting and perpetually perish part of succession this we call duration the simple mode whereof be any different length of it whereof we have distinct idea as hour day year & c time and eternity 2 its idea from reflection on the train of we idea the answer of a great man to one who ask what time be : si non roga intelligo -lrb- which amount to this the more i set myself to think of it the less i understand it -rrb- might perhaps persuade one that time which reveal all other thing be itself not to be discover duration time and eternity be not without reason think to have something very abstruse in they nature but however remote these may seem from we comprehension yet if we trace they right to they original i doubt not but one of those source of all we knowledge viz sensation and reflection will be able to furnish we with these idea as clear and distinct as many other which be think much less obscure and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself be derive from the same common original with the rest of we idea 3 nature and origin of the idea of duration to understand time and eternity aright we ought with attention to consider what idea it be we have of duration and how we come by it it be evident to any one who will but observe what pass in he own mind that there be a train of idea which constantly succeed one another in he understanding as long as he be awake reflection on these appearance of several idea one after another in we mind be that which furnish we with the idea of succession : and the distance between any part of that succession or between the appearance of any two idea in we mind be that we call duration for whilst we be think or whilst we receive successively several idea in we mind we know that we do exist and so we call the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or anything else commensurate to the succession of any idea in we mind the duration of ourselves or any such other thing co-existent with we think 4 proof that its idea be get from reflection on the train of we idea that we have we notion of succession and duration from this original viz from reflection on the train of idea which we find to appear one after another in we own mind seem plain to I in that we have no perception of duration but by consider the train of idea that take they turn in we understanding when that succession of idea cease we perception of duration cease with it which every one clearly experiment in himself whilst he sleep soundly whether a hour or a day a month or a year of which duration of thing while he sleep or think not he have no perception at all but it be quite lose to he and the moment wherein he leave off to think till the moment he begin to think again seem to he to have no distance and so i doubt not it would be to a wake man if it be possible for he to keep only one idea in he mind without variation and the succession of other and we see that one who fix he thought very intently on one thing so as to take but little notice of the succession of idea that pass in he mind whilst he be take up with that earnest contemplation let slip out of he account a good part of that duration and think that time shorter than it be but if sleep commonly unite the distant part of duration it be because during that time we have no succession of idea in we mind for if a man during he sleep dream and variety of idea make themselves perceptible in he mind one after another he have then during such dream a sense of duration and of the length of it by which it be to I very clear that man derive they idea of duration from they reflection on the train of the idea they observe to succeed one another in they own understanding without which observation they can have no notion of duration whatever may happen in the world 5 the idea of duration applicable to thing whilst we sleep indeed a man have from reflect on the succession and number of he own thought get the notion or idea of duration he can apply that notion to thing which exist while he do not think as he that have get the idea of extension from body by he sight or touch can apply it to distance where no body be see or feel and therefore though a man have no perception of the length of duration which pass whilst he sleep or think not yet have observe the revolution of day and night and find the length of they duration to be in appearance regular and constant he can upon the supposition that that revolution have proceed after the same manner whilst he be asleep or think not as it use to do at other time he can i say imagine and make allowance for the length of duration whilst he sleep but if adam and eve -lrb- when they be alone in the world -rrb- instead of they ordinary night 's sleep have pass the whole twenty-four hour in one continue sleep the duration of that twenty-four hour have be irrecoverably lose to they and be for ever leave out of they account of time 6 the idea of succession not from motion thus by reflect on the appear of various idea one after another in we understanding we get the notion of succession which if any one should think we do rather get from we observation of motion by we sens he will perhaps be of my mind when he consider that even motion produce in he mind a idea of succession no otherwise than as it produce there a continued train of distinguishable idea for a man look upon a body really move perceive yet no motion at all unless that motion produce a constant train of successive idea : vg a man becalm at sea out of sight of land in a fair day may look on the sun or sea or ship a whole hour together and perceive no motion at all in either though it be certain that two and perhaps all of they have move during that time a great way but as soon as he perceive either of they to have change distance with some other body as soon as this motion produce any new idea in he then he perceive that there have be motion but wherever a man be with all thing at rest about he without perceive any motion at all -- if during this hour of quiet he have be think he will perceive the various idea of he own thought in he own mind appear one after another and thereby observe and find succession where he could observe no motion 7 very slow motion unperceived and this i think be the reason why motion very slow though they be constant be not perceive by we because in they remove from one sensible part towards another they change of distance be so slow that it cause no new idea in we but a good while one after another and so not cause a constant train of new idea to follow one another immediately in we mind we have no perception of motion which consist in a constant succession we can not perceive that succession without a constant succession of vary idea arise from it 8 very swift motion unperceived on the contrary thing that move so swift as not to affect the sens distinctly with several distinguishable distance of they motion and so cause not any train of idea in the mind be not also perceive for anything that move round about in a circle in less time than we idea be wont to succeed one another in we mind be not perceive to move but seem to be a perfect entire circle of the matter or color and not a part of a circle in motion 9 the train of idea have a certain degree of quickness hence i leave it to other to judge whether it be not probable that we idea do whilst we be awake succeed one another in we mind at certain distance not much unlike the image in the inside of a lantern turn round by the heat of a candle this appearance of theirs in train though perhaps it may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower yet i guess vary not very much in a wake man : there seem to be certain bound to the quickness and slowness of the succession of those idea one to another in we mind beyond which they can neither delay nor hasten 10 real succession in swift motion without sense of succession the reason i have for this odd conjecture be from observe that in the impression make upon any of we sens we can but to a certain degree perceive any succession which if exceed quick the sense of succession be lose even in case where it be evident that there be a real succession let a cannon-bullet pass through a room and in its way take with it any limb or fleshy part of a man it be as clear as any demonstration can be that it must strike successively the two side of the room : it be also evident that it must touch one part of the flesh first and another after and so in succession : and yet i believe nobody who ever feel the pain of such a shot or hear the blow against the two distant wall could perceive any succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke such a part of duration as this wherein we perceive no succession be that which we call a instant and be that which take up the time of only one idea in we mind without the succession of another wherein therefore we perceive no succession at all 11 in slow motion this also happen where the motion be so slow as not to supply a constant train of fresh idea to the sens as fast as the mind be capable of receive new one into it and so other idea of we own thought have room to come into we mind between those offer to we sens by the move body there the sense of motion be lose and the body though it really move yet not change perceivable distance with some other body as fast as the idea of we own mind do naturally follow one another in train the thing seem to stand still as be evident in the hand of clock and shadow of sun-dial and other constant but slow motion where though after certain interval we perceive by the change of distance that it have move yet the motion itself we perceive not 12 this train the measure of other succession so that to I it seem that the constant and regular succession of idea in a wake man be as it be the measure and standard of all other succession whereof if any one either exceed the pace of we idea as where two sound or pain & c take up in they succession the duration of but one idea or else where any motion or succession be so slow as that it keep not pace with the idea in we mind or the quickness in which they take they turn as when any one or more idea in they ordinary course come into we mind between those which be offer to the sight by the different perceptible distance of a body in motion or between sound or smell follow one another -- there also the sense of a constant continued succession be lose and we perceive it not but with certain gap of rest between 13 the mind can not fix long on one invariable idea if it be so that the idea of we mind whilst we have any there do constantly change and shift in a continual succession it would be impossible may any one say for a man to think long of any one thing by which if it be mean that a man may have one self-same single idea a long time alone in he mind without any variation at all i think in matter of fact it be not possible for which -lrb- not know how the idea of we mind be frame of what material they be make whence they have they light and how they come to make they appearance -rrb- i can give no other reason but experience : and i would have any one try whether he can keep one unvaried single idea in he mind without any other for any considerable time together 14 proof for trial let he take any figure any degree of light or whiteness or what other he please and he will i suppose find it difficult to keep all other idea out of he mind but that some either of another kind or various consideration of that idea -lrb- each of which consideration be a new idea -rrb- will constantly succeed one another in he thought let he be as wary as he can 15 the extent of we power over the succession of we idea all that be in a man 's power in this case i think be only to mind and observe what the idea be that take they turn in he understanding or else to direct the sort and call in such as he have a desire or use of : but hinder the constant succession of fresh one i think he can not though he may commonly choose whether he will heedfully observe and consider they 16 idea however make include no sense of motion whether these several idea in a man 's mind be make by certain motion i will not here dispute but this i be sure that they include no idea of motion in they appearance and if a man have not the idea of motion otherwise i think he would have none at all which be enough to my present purpose and sufficiently show that the notice we take of the idea of we own mind appear there one after another be that which give we the idea of succession and duration without which we should have no such idea at all it be not then motion but the constant train of idea in we mind whilst we be wake that furnish we with the idea of duration whereof motion no otherwise give we any perception than as it cause in we mind a constant succession of idea as i have before show : and we have as clear a idea of succession and duration by the train of other idea succeed one another in we mind without the idea of any motion as by the train of idea cause by the uninterrupted sensible change of distance between two body which we have from motion and therefore we should as well have the idea of duration be there no sense of motion at all 17 time be duration set out by measure have thus get the idea of duration the next thing natural for the mind to do be to get some measure of this common duration whereby it might judge of its different length and consider the distinct order wherein several thing exist without which a great part of we knowledge would be confuse and a great part of history be render very useless this consideration of duration as set out by certain period and mark by certain measure or epoch be that i think which most properly we call time 18 a good measure of time must divide its whole duration into equal period in the measuring of extension there be nothing more required but the application of the standard or measure we make use of to the thing of whose extension we would be inform but in the measuring of duration this can not be do because no two different part of succession can be put together to measure one another and nothing be a measure of duration but duration as nothing be of extension but extension we can not keep by we any standing unvarying measure of duration which consist in a constant fleeting succession as we can of certain length of extension as inch foot yard & c mark out in permanent parcel of matter nothing then could serve well for a convenient measure of time but what have divide the whole length of its duration into apparently equal portion by constantly repeat period what portion of duration be not distinguish or consider as distinguish and measure by such period come not so properly under the notion of time as appear by such phrase as these viz ` before all time ' and ` when time shall be no more ' 19 the revolution of the sun and moon the properest measure of time for mankind the diurnal and annual revolution of the sun as have be from the beginning of nature constant regular and universally observable by all mankind and suppose equal to one another have be with reason make use of for the measure of duration but the distinction of day and year have depend on the motion of the sun it have bring this mistake with it that it have be think that motion and duration be the measure one of another for man in the measuring of the length of time have be accustom to the idea of minute hour day month year & c which they find themselves upon any mention of time or duration presently to think on all which portion of time be measure out by the motion of those heavenly body they be apt to confound time and motion or at least to think that they have a necessary connexion one with another whereas any constant periodical appearance or alteration of idea in seemingly equidistant space of duration if constant and universally observable would have as well distinguish the interval of time as those that have be make use of for suppose the sun which some have take to be a fire have be light up at the same distance of time that it now every day come about to the same meridian and then go out again about twelve hour after and that in the space of a annual revolution it have sensibly increase in brightness and heat and so decrease again -- would not such regular appearance serve to measure out the distance of duration to all that could observe it as well without as with motion for if the appearance be constant universally observable in equidistant period they would serve mankind for measure of time as well be the motion away 20 but not by they motion but periodical appearance for the freezing of water or the blowing of a plant return at equidistant period in all part of the earth would as well serve man to reckon they year by as the motion of the sun : and in effect we see that some people in america count they year by the come of certain bird amongst they at they certain season and leave they at other for a fit of a ague the sense of hunger or thirst a smell or a taste or any other idea return constantly at equidistant period and make itself universally be take notice of would not fail to measure out the course of succession and distinguish the distance of time thus we see that man bear blind count time well enough by year whose revolution yet they can not distinguish by motion that they perceive not and i ask whether a blind man who distinguish he year either by the heat of summer or cold of winter by the smell of any flower of the spring or taste of any fruit of the autumn would not have a better measure of time than the roman have before the reformation of they calendar by julius caesar or many other people whose year notwithstanding the motion of the sun which they pretend to make use of be very irregular and it add no small difficulty to chronology that the exact length of the year that several nation count by be hard to be know they differ very much one from another and i think i may say all of they from the precise motion of the sun and if the sun move from the creation to the flood constantly in the equator and so equally disperse its light and heat to all the habitable part of the earth in day all of the same length without its annual variation to the tropics as a late ingenious author suppose i do not think it very easy to imagine that -lrb- notwithstanding the motion of the sun -rrb- man should in the antediluvian world from the beginning count by year or measure they time by period that have no sensible mark very obvious to distinguish they by 21 no two part of duration can be certainly know to be equal but perhaps it will be say -- without a regular motion such as of the sun or some other how could it ever be know that such period be equal to which i answer -- the equality of any other return appearance might be know by the same way that that of day be know or presume to be so at first which be only by judge of they by the train of idea which have pass in man 's mind in the interval by which train of idea discover inequality in the natural day but none in the artificial day the artificial day or nuchthaemera be guess to be equal which be sufficient to make they serve for a measure though exacter search have since discover inequality in the diurnal revolution of the sun and we know not whether the annual also be not unequal these yet by they presume and apparent equality serve as well to reckon time by -lrb- though not to measure the part of duration exactly -rrb- as if they could be prove to be exactly equal we must therefore carefully distinguish betwixt duration itself and the measure we make use of to judge of its length duration in itself be to be consider as go on in one constant equal uniform course : but none of the measure of it which we make use of can be know to do so nor can we be assure that they assign part or period be equal in duration one to another for two successive length of duration however measure can never be demonstrate to be equal the motion of the sun which the world use so long and so confidently for a exact measure of duration have as i say be find in its several part unequal and though man have of late make use of a pendulum as a more steady and regular motion than that of the sun or -lrb- to speak more truly -rrb- of the earth -- yet if any one should be ask how he certainly know that the two successive swing of a pendulum be equal it would be very hard to satisfy he that they be infallibly so since we can not be sure that the cause of that motion which be unknown to we shall always operate equally and we be sure that the medium in which the pendulum move be not constantly the same : either of which vary may alter the equality of such period and thereby destroy the certainty and exactness of the measure by motion as well as any other period of other appearance the notion of duration still remain clear though we measure of it can not -lrb- any of they -rrb- be demonstrate to be exact since then no two portion of succession can be bring together it be impossible ever certainly to know they equality all that we can do for a measure of time be to take such as have continual successive appearance at seemingly equidistant period of which seeming equality we have no other measure but such as the train of we own idea have lodge in we memory with the concurrence of other probable reason to persuade we of they equality 22 time not the measure of motion one thing seem strange to I -- that whilst all man manifestly measure time by the motion of the great and visible body of the world time yet should be define to be the ` measure of motion ' : whereas it be obvious to every one who reflect ever so little on it that to measure motion space be as necessary to be consider as time and those who look a little farther will find also the bulk of the thing move necessary to be take into the computation by any one who will estimate or measure motion so as to judge right of it nor indeed do motion any otherwise conduce to the measuring of duration than as it constantly bring about the return of certain sensible idea in seem equidistant period for if the motion of the sun be as unequal as of a ship drive by unsteady wind sometimes very slow and at other irregularly very swift or if be constantly equally swift it yet be not circular and produce not the same appearance -- it would not at all help we to measure time any more than the seem unequal motion of a comet do 23 minute hour day and year be then no more minute hour day and year not necessary measure of duration necessary to time or duration than inch foot yard and mile mark out in any matter be to extension for though we in this part of the universe by the constant use of they as of period set out by the revolution of the sun or as known part of such period have fix the idea of such length of duration in we mind which we apply to all part of time whose length we would consider yet there may be other part of the universe where they no more use these measure of ours than in japan they do we inch foot or mile but yet something analogous to they there must be for without some regular periodical return we could not measure ourselves or signify to other the length of any duration though at the same time the world be as full of motion as it be now but no part of it dispose into regular and apparently equidistant revolution but the different measure that may be make use of for the account of time do not at all alter the notion of duration which be the thing to be measure no more than the different standard of a foot and a cubit alter the notion of extension to those who make use of those different measure 24 we measure of time applicable to duration before time the mind have once get such a measure of time as the annual revolution of the sun can apply that measure to duration wherein that measure itself do not exist and with which in the reality of its be it have nothing to do for should one say that abraham be bear in the two thousand seven hundred and twelfth year of the julian period it be altogether as intelligible as reckoning from the beginning of the world though there be so far back no motion of the sun nor any motion at all for though the julian period be suppose to begin several hundred year before there be really either day night or year mark out by any revolution of the sun -- yet we reckon as right and thereby measure duration as well as if really at that time the sun have exist and keep the same ordinary motion it doth now the idea of duration equal to a annual revolution of the sun be as easily applicable in we thought to duration where no sun or motion be as the idea of a foot or yard take from body here can be apply in we thought to duration where no sun or motion be as the idea of a foot or yard take from body here can be apply in we thought to distance beyond the confines of the world where be no body at all 25 as we can measure space in we thought where there be no body for suppose it be 5639 mile or million of mile from this place to the remotest body of the universe -lrb- for be finite it must be at a certain distance -rrb- as we suppose it to be 5639 year from this time to the first existence of any body in the beginning of the world -- we can in we thought apply this measure of a year to duration before the creation or beyond the duration of body or motion as we can this measure of a mile to space beyond the utmost body and by the one measure duration where there be no motion as well as by the other measure space in we thought where there be no body 26 the assumption that the world be neither boundless nor eternal if it be object to I here that in this way of explain of time i have beg what i should not viz that the world be neither eternal nor infinite i answer that to my present purpose it be not needful in this place to make use of argument to evince the world to be finite both in duration and extension but it be at least as conceivable as the contrary i have certainly the liberty to suppose it as well as any one have to suppose the contrary and i doubt not but that every one that will go about it may easily conceive in he mind the beginning of motion though not of all duration and so may come to a step and non ultra in he consideration of motion so also in he thought he may set limit to body and the extension belong to it but not to space where no body be the utmost bound of space and duration be beyond the reach of think as well as the utmost bound of number be beyond the largest comprehension of the mind and all for the same reason as we shall see in another place 27 eternity by the same means therefore and from the same original that we come to have the idea of time we have also that idea which we call eternity viz have get the idea of succession and duration by reflect on the train of we own idea cause in we either by the natural appearance of those idea come constantly of themselves into we wake thought or else cause by external object successively affect we sens and have from the revolution of the sun get the idea of certain length of duration -- we can in we thought add such length of duration to one another as often as we please and apply they so add to duration past or to come and this we can continue to do on without bound or limit and proceed in infinitum and apply thus the length of the annual motion of the sun to duration suppose before the sun 's or any other motion have its be which be no more difficult or absurd than to apply the notion i have of the moving of a shadow one hour to-day upon the sun-dial to the duration of something last night v g the burning of a candle which be now absolutely separate from all actual motion and it be as impossible for the duration of that flame for a hour last night to co-exist with any motion that now be or for ever shall be as for any part of duration that be before the beginning of the world to co exist with the motion of the sun now but yet this hinder not but that have the idea of the length of the motion of the shadow on a dial between the mark of two hour i can as distinctly measure in my thought the duration of that candle-light last night as i can the duration of anything that do now exist : and it be no more than to think that have the sun shone then on the dial and move after the same rate it doth now the shadow on the dial would have pass from one hour-line to another whilst that flame of the candle last 28 we measure of duration dependent on we idea the notion of a hour day or year be only the idea i have of the length of certain periodical regular motion neither of which motion do ever all at once exist but only in the idea i have of they in my memory derive from my sens or reflection i can with the same ease and for the same reason apply it in my thought to duration antecedent to all manner of motion as well as to anything that be but a minute or a day antecedent to the motion that at this very moment the sun be in all thing past be equally and perfectly at rest and to this way of consideration of they be all one whether they be before the beginning of the world or but yesterday : the measuring of any duration by some motion depend not at all on the real co-existence of that thing to that motion or any other period of revolution but the have a clear idea of the length of some periodical known motion or other interval of duration in my mind and apply that to the duration of the thing i would measure 29 the duration of anything need not be co-existent with the motion we measure it by hence we see that some man imagine the duration of of the world from its first existence to this present year 1689 to have be 5639 year or equal to 5639 annual revolution of the sun and other a great deal more as the egyptian of old who in the time of alexander count 23000 year from the reign of the sun and the chinese now who account the world 3269000 year old or more which longer duration of the world accord to they computation though i should not believe to be true yet i can equally imagine it with they and as truly understand and say one be longer than the other as i understand that methusalem 's life be longer than enoch 's and if the common reckoning of 5639 should be true -lrb- as it may be as well as any other assign -rrb- it hinder not at all my imagine what other mean when they make the world one thousand year older since every one may with the same facility imagine -lrb- i do not say believe -rrb- the world to be 50000 year old as 5639 and may as well conceive the duration of 50000 year as 5639 whereby it appear that to the measure the duration of anything by time it be not requisite that that thing should be co-existent to the motion we measure by or any other periodical revolution but it suffice to this purpose that we have the idea of the length of any regular periodical appearance which we can in we mind apply to duration with which the motion or appearance never co-exist 30 infinity in duration for as in the history of the creation deliver by mose i can imagine that light exist three day before the sun be or have any motion barely by think that the duration of light before the sun be create be so long as -lrb- if the sun have move then as it doth now -rrb- would have be equal to three of he diurnal revolution so by the same way i can have a idea of the chaos or angel be create before there be either light or any continued motion a minute a hour a day a year or one thousand year for if i can but consider duration equal to one minute before either the be or motion of any body i can add one minute more till i come to sixty and by the same way of add minute hour or year -lrb- ie such or such part of the sun 's revolution or any other period whereof i have the idea -rrb- proceed in infinitum and suppose a duration exceed as many such period as i can reckon let I add whilst i will which i think be the notion we have of eternity of whose infinity we have no other notion than we have of the infinity of number to which we can add for ever without end 31 origin of we idea of duration and of the measure of it and thus i think it be plain that from those two fountain of all knowledge before mention viz reflection and sensation we get the idea of duration and the measure of it for first by observe what pass in we mind how we idea there in train constantly some vanish and other begin to appear we come by the idea of succession secondly by observe a distance in the part of this succession we get the idea of duration thirdly by sensation observe certain appearance at certain regular and seeming equidistant period we get the idea of certain length or measure of duration as minute hour day year & c fourthly by be able to repeat those measure of time or idea of state length of duration in we mind as often as we will we can come to imagine duration -- where nothing do really endure or exist and thus we imagine to-morrow next year or seven year hence fifthly by be able to repeat idea of any length of time as of a minute a year or a age as often as we will in we own thought and add they one to another without ever come to the end of such addition any nearer than we can to the end of number to which we can always add we come by the idea of eternity as the future eternal duration of we soul as well as the eternity of that infinite be which must necessarily have always exist sixthly by consider any part of infinite duration as set out by periodical measure we come by the idea of what we call time in general chapter xv idea of duration and expansion consider together 1 both capable of greater and less though we have in the precedent chapter dwell pretty long on the consideration of space and duration yet they be idea of general concernment that have something very abstruse and peculiar in they nature the compare they one with another may perhaps be of use for they illustration and we may have the more clear and distinct conception of they by take a view of they together distance or space in its simple abstract conception to avoid confusion i call expansion to distinguish it from extension which by some be use to express this distance only as it be in the solid part of matter and so include or at least intimate the idea of body : whereas the idea of pure distance include no such thing i prefer also the word expansion to space because space be often apply to distance of fleeting successive part which never exist together as well as to those which be permanent in both these -lrb- viz expansion and duration -rrb- the mind have this common idea of continued length capable of greater or less quantity for a man have as clear a idea of the difference of the length of a hour and a day as of a inch and a foot 2 expansion not bound by matter the mind have get the idea of the length of any part of expansion let it be a span or a pace or what length you will can as have be say repeat that idea and so add it to the former enlarge its idea of length and make it equal to two span or two pace and so as often as it will till it equal the distance of any part of the earth one from another and increase thus till it amount to the distance of the sun or remotest star by such a progression as this set out from the place where it be or any other place it can proceed and pass beyond all those length and find nothing to stop its go on either in or without body it be true we can easily in we thought come to the end of solid extension the extremity and bound of all body we have no difficulty to arrive at : but when the mind be there it find nothing to hinder its progress into this endless expansion of that it can neither find nor conceive any end nor let any one say that beyond the bound of body there be nothing at all unless he will confine god within the limit of matter solomon whose understanding be fill and enlarged with wisdom seem to have other thought when he say ` heaven and the heaven of heaven can not contain thee ' and he i think very much magnify to himself the capacity of he own understanding who persuade himself that he can extend he thought further than god exist or imagine any expansion where he be not 3 nor duration by motion just so be it in duration the mind have get the idea of any length of duration can double multiply and enlarge it not only beyond its own but beyond the existence of all corporeal being and all the measure of time take from the great body of all the world and they motion but yet every one easily admit that though we make duration boundless as certainly it be we can not yet extend it beyond all be god every one easily allow fill eternity and it be hard to find a reason why any one should doubt that he likewise fill immensity he infinite be be certainly as boundless one way as another and methink it ascribe a little too much to matter to say where there be no body there be nothing 4 why man more easily admit infinite duration than infinite expansion hence i think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least hesitation speak of and suppose eternity and stick not to ascribe infinity to duration but it be with more doubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the infinity of space the reason whereof seem to I to be this -- that duration and extension be use as name of affection belong to other being we easily conceive in god infinite duration and we can not avoid do so : but not attribute to he extension but only to matter which be finite we be apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter of which alone we commonly suppose it a attribute and therefore when man pursue they thought of space they be apt to stop at the confines of body : as if space be there at a end too and reach no further or if they idea upon consideration carry they further yet they term what be beyond the limit of the universe imaginary space : as if it be nothing because there be no body exist in it whereas duration antecedent to all body and to the motion which it be measure by they never term imaginary : because it be never suppose void of some other real existence and if the name of thing may at all direct we thought towards the original of man 's idea -lrb- as i be apt to think they may very much -rrb- one may have occasion to think by the name duration that the continuation of existence with a kind of resistance to any destructive force and the continuation of solidity -lrb- which be apt to be confound with and if we will look into the minute anatomical part of matter be little different from hardness -rrb- be think to have some analogy and give occasion to word so near of kin as durare and durum esse and that durare be apply to the idea of hardness as well as that of existence we see in horace epod xvi ferro duravit seculum but be that as it will this be certain that whoever pursue he own thought will find they sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body into the infinity of space or expansion the idea whereof be distinct and separate from body and all other thing : which may -lrb- to those who please -rrb- be a subject of further meditation 5 time to duration be as place to expansion time in general be to duration as place to expansion they be so much of those boundless ocean of eternity and immensity as be set out and distinguish from the rest as it be by landmark and so be make use of to denote the position of finite real being in respect one to another in those uniform infinite ocean of duration and space these rightly consider be only idea of determinate distance from certain known point fix in distinguishable sensible thing and suppose to keep the same distance one from another from such point fix in sensible being we reckon and from they we measure we portion of those infinite quantity which so consider be that which we call time and place for duration and space be in themselves uniform and boundless the order and position of thing without such known settle point would be lose in they and all thing would lie jumble in a incurable confusion 6 time and place be take for so much of either as be set out by the existence and motion of body time and place take thus for determinate distinguishable portion of those infinite abyss of space and duration set out or suppose to be distinguish from the rest by mark and know boundary have each of they a twofold acceptation first time in general be commonly take for so much of infinite duration as be measure by and co-existent with the existence and motion of the great body of the universe as far as we know anything of they : and in this sense time begin and end with the frame of this sensible world as in these phrase before mention ` before all time ' or ` when time shall be no more ' place likewise be take sometimes for that portion of infinite space which be possess by and comprehend within the material world and be thereby distinguish from the rest of expansion though this may be more properly call extension than place within these two be confine and by the observable part of they be measure and determine the particular time or duration and the particular extension and place of all corporeal being 7 sometimes for so much of either as we design by measure take from the bulk or motion of body secondly sometimes the word time be use in a larger sense and be apply to part of that infinite duration not that be really distinguish and measure out by this real existence and periodical motion of body that be appoint from the begin to be for sign and for season and for day and year and be accordingly we measure of time but such other portion too of that infinite uniform duration which we upon any occasion do suppose equal to certain length of measure time and so consider they as bound and determine for if we should suppose the creation or fall of the angel be at the beginning of the julian period we should speak properly enough and should be understand if we say it be a longer time since the creation of angel than the creation of the world by 7640 year : whereby we would mark out so much of that undistinguished duration as we suppose equal to and would have admit 7640 annual revolution of the sun move at the rate it now do and thus likewise we sometimes speak of place distance or bulk in the great inane beyond the confines of the world when we consider so much of that space as be equal to or capable to receive a body of any assign dimension as a cubic foot or do suppose a point in it at such a certain distance from any part of the universe 8 they belong to all finite being where and when be question belong to all finite existence and be by we always reckon from some known part of this sensible world and from some certain epoch mark out to we by the motion observable in it without some such fixed part or period the order of thing would be lose to we finite understanding in the boundless invariable ocean of duration and expansion which comprehend in they all finite being and in they full extent belong only to the deity and therefore we be not to wonder that we comprehend they not and do so often find we thought at a loss when we would consider they either abstractly in themselves or as any way attribute to the first incomprehensible be but when apply to any particular finite being the extension of any body be so much of that infinite space as the bulk of the body take up and place be the position of any body when consider at a certain distance from some other as the idea of the particular duration of anything be a idea of that portion of infinite duration which pass during the existence of that thing so the time when the thing exist be the idea of that space of duration which pass between some known and fixed period of duration and the being of that thing one show the distance of the extremity of the bulk or existence of the same thing as that it be a foot square or last two year the other show the distance of it in place or existence from other fix point of space or duration as that it be in the middle of lincoln 's inn field or the first degree of taurus and in the year of we lord 1671 or the 1000th year of the julian period all which distance we measure by preconceived idea of certain length of space and duration -- as inch foot mile and degree and in the other minute day and year & c 9 all the part of extension be extension and all the part of duration be duration there be one thing more wherein space and duration have a great conformity and that be though they be justly reckon amongst we simple idea yet none of the distinct idea we have of either be without all manner of composition : it be the very nature of both of they to consist of part : but they part be all of the same kind and without the mixture of any other idea hinder they not from have a place amongst simple idea could the mind as in number come to so small a part of extension or duration as exclude divisibility that would be as it be the indivisible unit or idea by repetition of which it would make its more enlarged idea of extension and duration but since the mind be not able to frame a idea of any space without part instead thereof it make use of the common measure which by familiar use in each country have imprint themselves on the memory -lrb- as inch and foot or cubit and parasang and so seconds minute hour day and year in duration -rrb- -- the mind make use i say of such idea as these as simple one : and these be the component part of larger idea which the mind upon occasion make by the addition of such known length which it be acquaint with on the other side the ordinary smallest measure we have of either be look on as a unit in number when the mind by division would reduce they into less fraction though on both side both in addition and division either of space or duration when the idea under consideration become very big or very small its precise bulk become very obscure and confused and it be the number of its repeat addition or division that alone remain clear and distinct as will easily appear to any one who will let he thought loose in the vast expansion of space or divisibility of matter every part of duration be duration too and every part of extension be extension both of they capable of addition or division in infinitum but the least portion of either of they whereof we have clear and distinct idea may perhaps be fittest to be consider by we as the simple idea of that kind out of which we complex mode of space extension and duration be make up and into which they can again be distinctly resolve such a small part in duration may be call a moment and be the time of one idea in we mind in the train of they ordinary succession there the other want a proper name i know not whether i may be allow to call a sensible point meaning thereby the least particle of matter or space we can discern which be ordinarily about a minute and to the sharpest eye seldom less than thirty seconds of a circle whereof the eye be the center 10 they part inseparable expansion and duration have this further agreement that though they be both consider by we as have part yet they part be not separable one from another no not even in thought : though the part of body from whence we take we measure of the one and the part of motion or rather the succession of idea in we mind from whence we take the measure of the other may be interrupted and separated as the one be often by rest and the other be by sleep which we call rest too 11 duration be as a line expansion as a solid but there be this manifest difference between they -- that the idea of length which we have of expansion be turn every way and so make figure and breadth and thickness but duration be but as it be the length of one straight line extend in infinitum not capable of multiplicity variation or figure but be one common measure of all existence whatsoever wherein all thing whilst they exist equally partake for this present moment be common to all thing that be now in be and equally comprehend that part of they existence as much as if they be all but one single be and we may truly say they all exist in the same moment of time whether angel and spirit have any analogy to this in respect to expansion be beyond my comprehension : and perhaps for we who have understanding and comprehension suit to we own preservation and the end of we own being but not to the reality and extent of all other being it be near as hard to conceive any existence or to have a idea of any real be with a perfect negation of all manner of expansion as it be to have the idea of any real existence with a perfect negation of all manner of duration and therefore what spirit have to do with space or how they communicate in it we know not all that we know be that body do each singly possess its proper portion of it accord to the extent of solid part and thereby exclude all other body from have any share in that particular portion of space whilst it remain there 12 duration have never two part together expansion altogether duration and time which be a part of it be the idea we have of perish distance of which no two part exist together but follow each other in succession a expansion be the idea of lasting distance all whose part exist together and be not capable of succession and therefore though we can not conceive any duration without succession nor can put it together in we thought that any be do now exist to-morrow or possess at once more than the present moment of duration yet we can conceive the eternal duration of the almighty far different from that of man or any other finite be because man comprehend not in he knowledge or power all past and future thing : he thought be but of yesterday and he know not what to-morrow will bring forth what be once past he can never recal and what be yet to come he can not make present what i say of man i say of all finite being who though they may far exceed man in knowledge and power yet be no more than the meanest creature in comparison with god himself finite or any magnitude hold not any proportion to infinite god 's infinite duration be accompany with infinite knowledge and infinite power he see all thing past and to come and they be no more distant from he knowledge no further remove from he sight than the present : they all lie under the same view : and there be nothing which he can not make exist each moment he please for the existence of all thing depend upon he good pleasure all thing exist every moment that he think fit to have they exist to conclude : expansion and duration do mutually embrace and comprehend each other every part of space be in every part of duration and every part of duration in every part of expansion such a combination of two distinct idea be i suppose scarce to be find in all that great variety we do or can conceive and may afford matter to further speculation chapter xvi idea of number 1 number the simplest and most universal idea amongst all the idea we have as there be none suggest to the mind by more way so there be none more simple than that of unity or one : it have no shadow of variety or composition in it : every object we sens be employ about every idea in we understanding every thought of we mind bring this idea along with it and therefore it be the most intimate to we thought as well as it be in its agreement to all other thing the most universal idea we have for number apply itself to man angel action thought everything that either doth exist or can be imagine 2 its mode make by addition by repeat this idea in we mind and add the repetition together we come by the complex idea of the mode of it thus by add one to one we have the complex idea of a couple by put twelve unit together we have the complex idea of a dozen and so of a score or a million or any other number 3 each mode distinct the simple mode of number be of all other the most distinct every the least variation which be a unit make each combination as clearly different from that which approacheth nearest to it as the most remote two be as distinct from one as two hundred and the idea of two as distinct from the idea of three as the magnitude of the whole earth be from that of a mite this be not so in other simple mode in which it be not so easy nor perhaps possible for we to distinguish betwixt two approach idea which yet be really different for who will undertake to find a difference between the white of this paper and that of the next degree to it : or can form distinct idea of every the least excess in extension 4 therefore demonstration in number the most precise the clearness and distinctness of each mode of number from all other even those that approach nearest make I apt to think that demonstration in number if they be not more evident and exact than in extension yet they be more general in they use and more determinate in they application because the idea of number be more precise and distinguishable than in extension where every equality and excess be not so easy to be observe or measure because we thought can not in space arrive at any determine smallness beyond which it can not go as a unit and therefore the quantity or proportion of any the least excess can not be discover which be clear otherwise in number where as have be say 91 be as distinguishable from 90 as from 9000 though 91 be the next immediate excess to 90 but it be not so in extension where whatsoever be more than just a foot or a inch be not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or a inch and in line which appear of a equal length one may be longer than the other by innumerable part : nor can any one assign a angle which shall be the next biggest to a right one 5 name necessary to number by the repeat as have be say the idea of a unit and join it to another unit we make thereof one collective idea mark by the name two and whosoever can do this and proceed on still add one more to the last collective idea which he have of any number and give a name to it may count or have idea for several collection of unit distinguish one from another as far as he have a series of name for follow number and a memory to retain that series with they several name : all numeration be but still the add of one unit more and give to the whole together as comprehend in one idea a new or distinct name or sign whereby to know it from those before and after and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of unit so that he that can add one to one and so to two and so go on with he tale take still with he the distinct name belong to every progression and so again by subtract a unit from each collection retreat and lessen they be capable of all the idea of number within the compass of he language or for which he have name though not perhaps of more for the several simple mode of number be in we mind but so many combination of unit which have no variety nor be capable of any other difference but more or less name or mark for each distinct combination seem more necessary than in any other sort of idea for without such name or mark we can hardly well make use of number in reckoning especially where the combination be make up of any great multitude of unit which put together without a name or mark to distinguish that precise collection will hardly be keep from be a heap in confusion 6 another reason for the necessity of name to number this i think to be the reason why some american i have speak with -lrb- who be otherwise of quick and rational part enough -rrb- could not as we do by any means count to 1000 nor have any distinct idea of that number though they could reckon very well to 20 because they language be scanty and accommodate only to the few necessaries of a needy simple life unacquainted either with trade or mathematics have no word in it to stand for 1000 so that when they be discourse with of those greater number they would show the hair of they head to express a great multitude which they could not number which inability i suppose proceed from they want of name the tououpinambo have no name for number above 5 any number beyond that they make out by show they finger and the finger of other who be present and i doubt not but we ourselves might distinctly number in word a great deal further than we usually do would we find out but some fit denomination to signify they by whereas in the way we take now to name they by million of million of million & c it be hard to go beyond eighteen or at most four and twenty decimal progression without confusion but to show how much distinct name conduce to we well reckon or have useful idea of number let we see all these follow figure in one continue line as the mark of one number : v g nonillion 857324 octillion 162486 septillion 345896 sextillion 437918 quintrillion 423147 quartrillion 248106 trillion 235421 billion 261734 million 368149 unit 623137 the ordinary way of name this number in english will be the often repeat of million of million of million of million of million of million of million of million -lrb- which be the denomination of the second six figure -rrb- in which way it will be very hard to have any distinguishing notion of this number but whether by give every six figure a new and orderly denomination these and perhaps a great many more figure in progression might not easily be count distinctly and idea of they both get more easily to ourselves and more plainly signify to other i leave it to be consider this i mention only to show how necessary distinct name be to numbering without pretend to introduce new one of my invention 7 why child number not earlier thus child either for want of name to mark the several progression of number or not have yet the faculty to collect scattered idea into complex one and range they in a regular order and so retain they in they memory as be necessary to reckon do not begin to number very early nor proceed in it very far or steadily till a good while after they be well furnished with good store of other idea : and one may often observe they discourse and reason pretty well and have very clear conception of several other thing before they can tell twenty and some through the default of they memory who can not retain the several combination of number with they name annex in they distinct order and the dependence of so long a train of numeral progression and they relation one to another be not able all they lifetime to reckon or regularly go over any moderate series of number for he that will count twenty or have any idea of that number must know that nineteen go before with the distinct name or sign of every one of they as they stand marked in they order for wherever this fail a gap be make the chain break and the progress in numbering can go no further so that to reckon right it be require -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the mind distinguish carefully two idea which be different one from another only by the addition or subtraction of one unit : -lrb- 2 -rrb- that it retain in memory the name or mark of the several combination from a unit to that number and that not confusedly and at random but in that exact order that the number follow one another in either of which if it trip the whole business of numbering will be disturbed and there will remain only the confused idea of multitude but the idea necessary to distinct numeration will not be attain to 8 number measure all measurable this further be observable in number that it be that which the mind make use of in measure all thing that by we be measurable which principally be expansion and duration and we idea of infinity even when apply to those seem to be nothing but the infinity of number for what else be we idea of eternity and immensity but the repeat addition of certain idea of imagine part of duration and expansion with the infinity of number in which we can come to no end of addition for such a inexhaustible stock number -lrb- of all other we idea -rrb- most clearly furnish we with as be obvious to every one for let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he please this multitude how great soever lessen not one jot the power of add to it or bring he any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number where still there remain as much to be add as if none be take out and this endless addition or addibility -lrb- if any one like the word better -rrb- of number so apparent to the mind be that i think which give we the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity : of which more in the follow chapter chapter xvii of infinity 1 infinity in its original intention attribute to space duration and number he that would know what kind of idea it be to which we give the name of infinity can not do it better than by consider to what infinity be by the mind more immediately attribute and then how the mind come to frame it finite and infinite seem to I to be look upon by the mind as the mode of quantity and to be attribute primarily in they first designation only to those thing which have part and be capable of increase or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least part : and such be the idea of space duration and number which we have consider in the foregoing chapter it be true that we can not but be assure that the great god of whom and from whom be all thing be incomprehensibly infinite : but yet when we apply to that first and supreme be we idea of infinite in we weak and narrow thought we do it primarily in respect to he duration and ubiquity and i think more figuratively to he power wisdom and goodness and other attribute which be properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible & c for when we call they infinite we have no other idea of this infinity but what carry with it some reflection on and imitation of that number or extent of the act or object of god 's power wisdom and goodness which can never be suppose so great or so many which these attribute will not always surmount and exceed let we multiply they in we thought as far as we can with all the infinity of endless number i do not pretend to say how these attribute be in god who be infinitely beyond the reach of we narrow capacity : they do without doubt contain in they all possible perfection : but this i say be we way of conceive they and these we idea of they infinity 2 the idea of finite easily get finite then and infinite be by the mind look on as modification of expansion and duration the next thing to be consider be -- how the mind come by they as for the idea of finite there be no great difficulty the obvious portion of extension that affect we sens carry with they into the mind the idea of finite : and the ordinary period of succession whereby we measure time and duration as hour day and year be bound length the difficulty be how we come by those boundless idea of eternity and immensity since the object we converse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that largeness 3 how we come by the idea of infinity every one that have any idea of any state length of space as a foot find that he can repeat that idea and join it to the former make the idea of two foot and by the addition of a third three foot and so on without ever come to a end of he addition whether of the same idea of a foot or if he please of double it or any other idea he have of any length as a mile or diameter of the earth or of the orbi magnus : for whichever of these he take and how often soever he double or any otherwise multiply it he find that after he have continue he double in he thought and enlarged he idea as much as he please he have no more reason to stop nor be one jot nearer the end of such addition than he be at first set out : the power of enlarge he idea of space by further addition remain still the same he hence take the idea of infinite space 4 we idea of space boundless this i think be the way whereby the mind get the idea of infinite space it be a quite different consideration to examine whether the mind have the idea of such a boundless space actually exist since we idea be not always proof of the existence of thing : but yet since this come here in we way i suppose i may say that we be apt to think that space in itself be actually boundless to which imagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally lead we for it be consider by we either as the extension of body or as exist by itself without any solid matter take it up -lrb- for of such a void space we have not only the idea but i have prove as i think from the motion of body its necessary existence -rrb- it be impossible the mind should be ever able to find or suppose any end of it or be stop anywhere in its progress in this space how far soever it extend its thought any bound make with body even adamantine wall be so far from put a stop to the mind in its further progress in space and extension that it rather facilitate and enlarge it for so far as that body reach so far no one can doubt of extension and when we be come to the utmost extremity of body what be there that can there put a stop and satisfy the mind that it be at the end of space when it perceive that it be not nay when it be satisfied that body itself can move into it for if it be necessary for the motion of body that there should be a empty space though ever so little here amongst body and if it be possible for body to move in or through that empty space -- nay it be impossible for any particle of matter to move but into a empty space the same possibility of a body 's move into a void space beyond the utmost bound of body as well as into a void space intersperse amongst body will always remain clear and evident : the idea of empty pure space whether within or beyond the confines of all body be exactly the same differ not in nature though in bulk and there be nothing to hinder body from move into it so that wherever the mind place itself by any think either amongst or remote from all body it can in this uniform idea of space nowhere find any bound any end and so must necessarily conclude it by the very nature and idea of each part of it to be actually infinite 5 and so of duration as by the power we find in ourselves of repeat as often as we will any idea of space we get the idea of immensity so by be able to repeat the idea of any length of duration we have in we mind with all the endless addition of number we come by the idea of eternity for we find in ourselves we can no more come to a end of such repeat idea than we can come to the end of number which every one perceive he can not but here again it be another question quite different from we have a idea of eternity to know whether there be any real be whose duration have be eternal and as to this i say he that consider something now exist must necessarily come to something eternal but have speak of this in another place i shall say here no more of it but proceed on to some other consideration of we idea of infinity 6 why other idea be not capable of infinity if it be so that we idea of infinity be get from the power we observe in ourselves of repeat without end we own idea it may be demand -- why we do not attribute infinity to other idea as well as those of space and duration since they may be as easily and as often repeat in we mind as the other : and yet nobody ever think of infinite sweetness or infinite whiteness though he can repeat the idea of sweet or white as frequently as those of a yard or a day to which i answer -- all the idea that be consider as have part and be capable of increase by the addition of a equal or less part afford we by they repetition the idea of infinity because with this endless repetition there be continue a enlargement of which there can be no end but for other idea it be not so for to the largest idea of extension or duration that i at present have the addition of any the least part make a increase but to the perfectest idea i have of the whitest whiteness if i add another of a less equal whiteness -lrb- and of a whiter than i have i can not add the idea -rrb- it make no increase and enlarge not my idea at all and therefore the different idea of whiteness & c be call degree for those idea that consist of part be capable of be augment by every addition of the least part but if you take the idea of white which one parcel of snow yield yesterday to we sight and another idea of white from another parcel of snow you see to-day and put they together in you mind they embody as it be all run into one and the idea of whiteness be not at all increase and if we add a less degree of whiteness to a greater we be so far from increase that we diminish it those idea that consist not of part can not be augment to what proportion man please or be stretch beyond what they have receive by they sens but space duration and number be capable of increase by repetition leave in the mind a idea of endless room for more nor can we conceive anywhere a stop to a further addition or progression : and so those idea alone lead we mind towards the thought of infinity 7 difference between infinity of space and space infinite though we idea of infinity arise from the contemplation of quantity and the endless increase the mind be able to make in quantity by the repeat addition of what portion thereof it please yet i guess we cause great confusion in we thought when we join infinity to any suppose idea of quantity the mind can be think to have and so discourse or reason about a infinite quantity as a infinite space or a infinite duration for as we idea of infinity be as i think a endless grow idea but the idea of any quantity the mind have be at that time terminate in that idea -lrb- for be it as great as it will it can be no greater than it be -rrb- -- to join infinity to it be to adjust a standing measure to a grow bulk and therefore i think it be not a insignificant subtilty if i say that we be carefully to distinguish between the idea of the infinity of space and the idea of a space infinite the first be nothing but a suppose endless progression of the mind over what repeat idea of space it please but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space infinite be to suppose the mind already pass over and actually to have a view of all those repeat idea of space which a endless repetition can never totally represent to it which carry in it a plain contradiction 8 we have no idea of infinite space this perhaps will be a little plainer if we consider it in number the infinity of number to the end of whose addition every one perceive there be no approach easily appear to any one that reflect on it but how clear soever this idea of the infinity of number be there be nothing yet more evident than the absurdity of the actual idea of a infinite number whatsoever positive idea we have in we mind of any space duration or number let they be ever so great they be still finite but when we suppose a inexhaustible remainder from which we remove all bound and wherein we allow the mind a endless progression of thought without ever complete the idea there we have we idea of infinity : which though it seem to be pretty clear when we consider nothing else in it but the negation of a end yet when we would frame in we mind the idea of a infinite space or duration that idea be very obscure and confused because it be make up of two part very different if not inconsistent for let a man frame in he mind a idea of any space or number as great as he will it be plain the mind rest and terminate in that idea which be contrary to the idea of infinity which consist in a suppose endless progression and therefore i think it be that we be so easily confound when we come to argue and reason about infinite space or duration & c because the part of such a idea not be perceive to be as they be inconsistent the one side or other always perplex whatever consequence we draw from the other as a idea of motion not pass on would perplex any one who should argue from such a idea which be not better than a idea of motion at rest and such another seem to I to be the idea of a space or -lrb- which be the same thing -rrb- a number infinite i e of a space or number which the mind actually have and so view and terminate in and of a space or number which in a constant and endless enlarge and progression it can in think never attain to for how large soever a idea of space i have in my mind it be no larger than it be that instant that i have it though i be capable the next instant to double it and so on in infinitum for that alone be infinite which have no bound and that the idea of infinity in which we thought can find none 9 number afford we the clearest idea of infinity but of all other idea it be number as i have say which i think furnish we with the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity we be capable of for even in space and duration when the mind pursue the idea of infinity it there make use of the idea and repetition of number as of million and million of mile or year which be so many distinct idea -- keep best by number from run into a confused heap wherein the mind lose itself and when it have add together as many million & c as it please of know length of space or duration the clearest idea it can get of infinity be the confused incomprehensible remainder of endless addible number which afford no prospect of stop or boundary 10 we different conception of the infinity of number contrast with those of duration and expansion it will perhaps give we a little further light into the idea we have of infinity and discover to we that it be nothing but the infinity of number apply to determinate part of which we have in we mind the distinct idea if we consider that number be not generally think by we infinite whereas duration and extension be apt to be so which arise from hence -- that in number we be at one end as it be : for there be in number nothing less than a unit we there stop and be at a end but in addition or increase of number we can set no bound : and so it be like a line whereof one end terminate with we the other be extend still forwards beyond all that we can conceive but in space and duration it be otherwise for in duration we consider it as if this line of number be extend both way -- to a unconceivable undeterminate and infinite length which be evident to anyone that will but reflect on what consideration he have of eternity which i suppose will find to be nothing else but the turn this infinity of number both way a parte ante and a parte post as they speak for when we would consider eternity a parte ante what do we but begin from ourselves and the present time we be in repeat in we mind idea of year or age or any other assignable portion of duration past with a prospect of proceeding in such addition with all the infinity of number : and when we would consider eternity a parte post we just after the same rate begin from ourselves and reckon by multiply period yet to come still extend that line of number as before and these two be put together be that infinite duration we call eternity which as we turn we view either way forwards or backward appear infinite because we still turn that way the infinite end of number ie the power still of add more 11 how we conceive the infinity of space the same happen also in space wherein conceive ourselves to be as it be in the center we do on all side pursue those indeterminable line of number and reckon any way from ourselves a yard mile diameter of the earth or orbi magnus -- by the infinity of number we add other to they as often as we will and have no more reason to set bound to those repeat idea than we have to set bound to number we have that indeterminable idea of immensity 12 infinite divisibility and since in any bulk of matter we thought can never arrive at the utmost divisibility therefore there be a apparent infinity to we also in that which have the infinity also of number but with this difference -- that in the former consideration of the infinity of space and duration we only use addition of number whereas this be like the division of a unit into its fraction wherein the mind also can proceed in infinitum as well as in the former addition it be indeed but the addition still of new number : though in the addition of the one we can have no more the positive idea of a space infinitely great than in the division of the other we can have the positive idea of a body infinitely little -- we idea of infinity be as i may say a grow or fugitive idea still in a boundless progression that can stop nowhere 13 no positive idea of infinity though it be hard i think to find anyone so absurd as to say he have the positive idea of a actual infinite number -- the infinity whereof lie only in a power still of add any combination of unit to any former number and that as long and as much as one will the like also be in the infinity of space and duration which power leave always to the mind room for endless addition -- yet there be those who imagine they have positive idea of infinite duration and space it would i think be enough to destroy any such positive idea of infinite to ask he that have it -- whether he could add to it or no which would easily show the mistake of such a positive idea we can i think have no positive idea of any space or duration which be not make up of and commensurate to repeated number of foot or yard or day and year which be the common measure whereof we have the idea in we mind and whereby we judge of the greatness of this sort of quantity and therefore since a infinite idea of space or duration must need be make up of infinite part it can have no other infinity than that of number capable still of further addition but not a actual positive idea of a number infinite for i think it be evident that the addition of finite thing together -lrb- as be all length whereof we have the positive idea -rrb- can never otherwise produce the idea of infinite than as number do which consist of addition of finite unit one to another suggest the idea of infinite only by a power we find we have of still increase the sum and add more of the same kind without come one jot nearer the end of such progression 14 how we can not have a positive idea of infinity in quantity they who would prove they idea of infinite to be positive seem to I to do it by a pleasant argument take from the negation of a end which be negative the negation on it be positive he that consider that the end be in body but the extremity or superficies of that body will not perhaps be forward to grant that the end be a bare negative : and he that perceive the end of he pen be black or white will be apt to think that the end be something more than a pure negation nor be it when apply to duration the bare negation of existence but more properly the last moment of it but as they will have the end to be nothing but the bare negation of existence i be sure they can not deny but the beginning of the first instant of be and be not by any body conceive to be a bare negation and therefore by they own argument the idea of eternal  parte ante or of a duration without a beginning be but a negative idea 15 what be positive what negative in we idea of infinite the idea of infinite have i confess something of positive in all those thing we apply to it when we would think of infinite space or duration we at first step usually make some very large idea as perhaps of million of age or mile which possibly we double and multiply several time all that we thus amass together in we thought be positive and the assemblage of a great number of positive idea of space or duration but what still remain beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner have of the depth of the sea where have let down a large portion of he sounding-line he reach no bottom whereby he know the depth to be so many fathom and more but how much the more be he have no distinct notion at all : and could he always supply new line and find the plummet always sink without ever stop he would be something in the posture of the mind reach after a complete and positive idea of infinity in which case let this line be ten or ten thousand fathom long it equally discover what be beyond it and give only this confused and comparative idea that this be not all but one may yet go farther so much as the mind comprehend of any space it have a positive idea of : but in endeavor to make it infinite -- it be always enlarge always advance -- the idea be still imperfect and incomplete so much space as the mind take a view of in its contemplation of greatness be a clear picture and positive in the understanding : but infinite be still greater 1 then the idea of so much be positive and clear 2 the idea of greater be also clear but it be but a comparative idea the idea of so much greater as can not be comprehend 3 and this be plainly negative : not positive for he have no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension -lrb- which be that seek for in the idea of infinite -rrb- that have not a comprehensive idea of the dimension of it : and such nobody i think pretend to in what be infinite for to say a man have a positive clear idea of any quantity without know how great it be be as reasonable as to say he have the positive clear idea of the number of the sand on the sea-shore who know not how many there be but only that they be more than twenty for just such a perfect and positive idea have he of a infinite space or duration who say it be larger than the extent or duration of ten one hundred one thousand or any other number of mile or year whereof he have or can have a positive idea which be all the idea i think we have of infinite so that what lie beyond we positive idea towards infinity lie in obscurity and have the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea wherein i know i neither do nor can comprehend all i would it be too large for a finite and narrow capacity and that can not but be very far from a positive complete idea wherein the greatest part of what i would comprehend be leave out under the undeterminate intimation of be still greater for to say that have in any quantity measure so much or go so far you be not yet at the end be only to say that that quantity be greater so that the negation of a end in any quantity be in other word only to say that it be bigger and a total negation of a end be but carry this bigger still with you in all the progression you thought shall make in quantity and add this idea of still greater to all the idea you have or can be suppose to have of quantity now whether such a idea as that be positive i leave any one to consider 16 we have no positive idea of a infinite duration i ask those who say they have a positive idea of eternity whether they idea of duration include in it succession or not if it do not they ought to show the difference of they notion of duration when apply to a eternal being and to a finite since perhaps there may be other as well as i who will own to they they weakness of understanding in this point and acknowledge that the notion they have of duration force they to conceive that whatever have duration be of a longer continuance to-day than it be yesterday if to avoid succession in external existence they return to the punctum stan of the school i suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter or help we to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration there be nothing more inconceivable to I than duration without succession besides that punctum stan if it signify anything be not quantum finite or infinite can not belong to it but if we weak apprehension can not separate succession from any duration whatsoever we idea of eternity can be nothing but of infinite succession of moment of duration wherein anything do exist and whether any one have or can have a positive idea of a actual infinite number i leave he to consider till he infinite number be so great that he himself can add no more to it and as long as he can increase it i doubt he himself will think the idea he have of it a little too scanty for positive infinity 17 no complete idea of eternal be i think it unavoidable for every consider rational creature that will but examine he own or any other existence to have the notion of a eternal wise be who have no beginning : and such a idea of infinite duration i be sure i have but this negation of a beginning be but the negation of a positive thing scarce give I a positive idea of infinity which whenever i endeavor to extend my thought to i confess myself at a loss and i find i can not attain any clear comprehension of it 18 no positive idea of infinite space he that think he have a positive idea of infinite space will when he consider it find that he can no more have a positive idea of the greatest than he have of the least space for in this latter which seem the easier of the two and more within we comprehension we be capable only of a comparative idea of smallness which will always be less than any one whereof we have the positive idea all we positive idea of any quantity whether great or little have always bound though we comparative idea whereby we can always add to the one and take from the other have no bound for that which remain either great or little not be comprehend in that positive idea which we have lie in obscurity and we have no other idea of it but of the power of enlarge the one and diminish the other without cease a pestle and mortar will as soon bring any particle of matter to indivisibility as the acutest thought of a mathematician and a surveyor may as soon with he chain measure out infinite space as a philosopher by the quickest flight of mind reach it or by think comprehend it which be to have a positive idea of it he that think on a cube of a inch diameter have a clear and positive idea of it in he mind and so can frame one of 1\/2 1\/4 1\/8 and so on till he have the idea in he thought of something very little but yet reach not the idea of that incomprehensible littleness which division can produce what remain of smallness be as far from he thought as when he first begin and therefore he never come at all to have a clear and positive idea of that smallness which be consequent to infinite divisibility 19 what be positive what negative in we idea of infinite every one that look towards infinity do as i have say at first glance make some very large idea of that which he apply it to let it be space or duration and possibly he weary he thought by multiply in he mind that first large idea : but yet by that he come no nearer to the have a positive clear idea of what remain to make up a positive infinite than the country fellow have of the water which be yet to come and pass the channel of the river where he stand : ` rusticus expectat dum defluat amni at ille labitur et labetur in omne volubili aevum ' 20 some think they have a positive idea of eternity and not of infinite space there be some i have meet that put so much difference between infinite duration and infinite space that they persuade themselves that they have a positive idea of eternity but that they have not nor can have any idea of infinite space the reason of which mistake i suppose to be this -- that finding by a due contemplation of cause and effect that it be necessary to admit some eternal being and so to consider the real existence of that be as take up and commensurate to they idea of eternity but on the other side not find it necessary but on the contrary apparently absurd that body should be infinite they forwardly conclude that they can have no idea of infinite space because they can have no idea of infinite matter which consequence i conceive be very ill collect because the existence of matter be no way necessary to the existence of space no more than the existence of motion or the sun be necessary to duration though duration use to be measure by it and i doubt not but that a man may have the idea of ten thousand mile square without any body so big as well as the idea of ten thousand year without any body so old it seem as easy to I to have the idea of space empty of body as to think of the capacity of a bushel without corn or the hollow of a nut-shell without a kernel in it : it be no more necessary that there should be exist a solid body infinitely extend because we have a idea of the infinity of space than it be necessary that the world should be eternal because we have a idea of infinite duration and why should we think we idea of infinite space require the real existence of matter to support it when we find that we have as clear a idea of a infinite duration to come as we have of infinite duration past though i suppose nobody think it conceivable that anything do or have exist in that future duration nor be it possible to join we idea of future duration with present or past existence any more than it be possible to make the idea of yesterday to-day and to-morrow to be the same or bring age past and future together and make they contemporary but if these man be of the mind that they have clearer idea of infinite duration than of infinite space because it be past doubt that god have exist from all eternity but there be no real matter co-extend with infinite space yet those philosopher who be of opinion that infinite space be possess by god 's infinite omnipresence as well as infinite duration by he eternal existence must be allow to have as clear a idea of infinite space as of infinite duration though neither of they i think have any positive idea of infinity in either case for whatsoever positive idea a man have in he mind of any quantity he can repeat it and add it to the former as easy as he can add together the idea of two day or two pace which be positive idea of length he have in he mind and so on as long as he please : whereby if a man have a positive idea of infinite either duration or space he could add two infinite together nay make one infinite infinitely bigger than another -- absurdity too gross to be confute 21 suppose positive idea of infinity cause of mistake but yet if after all this there be man who persuade themselves that they have clear positive comprehensive idea of infinity it be fit they enjoy they privilege : and i should be very glad -lrb- with some other that i know who acknowledge they have none such -rrb- to be better inform by they communication for i have be hitherto apt to think that the great and inextricable difficulty which perpetually involve all discourse concern infinity -- whether of space duration or divisibility have be the certain mark of a defect in we idea of infinity and the disproportion the nature thereof have to the comprehension of we narrow capacity for whilst man talk and dispute of infinite space or duration as if they have as complete and positive idea of they as they have of the name they use for they or as they have of a yard or a hour or any other determinate quantity it be no wonder if the incomprehensible nature of the thing they discourse of or reason about lead they into perplexity and contradiction and they mind be overlay by a object too large and mighty to be survey and manage by they 22 all these be mode of idea get from sensation and reflection if i have dwell pretty long on the consideration of duration space and number and what arise from the contemplation of they -- infinity it be possibly no more than the matter require there be few simple idea whose mode give more exercise to the thought of man than those do i pretend not to treat of they in they full latitude it suffice to my design to show how the mind receive they such as they be from sensation and reflection and how even the idea we have of infinity how remote soever it may seem to be from any object of sense or operation of we mind have nevertheless as all we other idea its original there some mathematician perhaps of advanced speculation may have other way to introduce into they mind idea of infinity but this hinder not but that they themselves as well as all other man get the first idea which they have of infinity from sensation and reflection in the method we have here set down chapter xviii other simple mode 1 other simple mode of simple idea of sensation though i have in the foregoing chapter show how from simple idea take in by sensation the mind come to extend itself even to infinity which however it may of all other seem most remote from any sensible perception yet at last have nothing in it but what be make out of simple idea : receive into the mind by the sens and afterwards there put together by the faculty the mind have to repeat its own idea -- though i say these might be instance enough of simple mode of the simple idea of sensation and suffice to show how the mind come by they yet i shall for method 's sake though briefly give a account of some few more and then proceed to more complex idea 2 simple mode of motion to slide roll tumble walk creep run dance leap skip and abundance of other that might be name be word which be no sooner hear but every one who understand english have presently in he mind distinct idea which be all but the different modification of motion mode of motion answer those of extension swift and slow be two different idea of motion the measure whereof be make of the distance of time and space put together so they be complex idea comprehend time and space with motion 3 mode of sound the like variety have we in sound every articulate word be a different modification of sound by which we see that from the sense of hearing by such modification the mind may be furnish with distinct idea to almost a infinite number sound also besides the distinct cry of bird and beast be modify by diversity of note of different length put together which make that complex idea call a tune which a musician may have in he mind when he hear or make no sound at all by reflect on the idea of those sound so put together silently in he own fancy 4 mode of color those of color be also very various : some we take notice of as the different degree or as they be term shades of the same color but since we very seldom make assemblage of color either for use or delight but figure be take in also and have its part in it as in painting weave needlework & c -- those which be take notice of do most commonly belong to mixed mode as be make up of idea of diver kind viz figure and color such as beauty rainbow & c 5 mode of taste all compound taste and smell be also mode make up of the simple idea of those sens but they be such as generally we have no name for be less take notice of and can not be set down in write and therefore must be leave without enumeration to the thought and experience of my reader 6 some simple mode have no name in general it may be observe that those simple mode which be consider but as different degree of the same simple idea though they be in themselves many of they very distinct idea yet have ordinarily no distinct name nor be much take notice of as distinct idea where the difference be but very small between they whether man have neglect these mode and give no name to they as want measure nicely to distinguish they or because when they be so distinguish that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use i leave it to the thought of other it be sufficient to my purpose to show that all we simple idea come to we mind only by sensation and reflection and that when the mood have they it can variously repeat and compound they and so make new complex idea but though white red or sweet & c have not be modify or make into complex idea by several combination so as to be name and thereby rank into species yet some other of the simple idea viz those of unity duration and motion & c above instance in as also power and think have be thus modify to a great variety of complex idea with name belong to they 7 why some mode have and other have not name the reason whereof i suppose have be this -- that the great concernment of man be with man one amongst another the knowledge of man and they action and the signify of they to one another be most necessary and therefore they make idea of action very nicely modify and give those complex idea name that they might the more easily record and discourse of those thing they be daily conversant in without long ambage and circumlocution and that the thing they be continually to give and receive information about might be the easier and quicker understand that this be so and that man in frame different complex idea and give they name have be much govern by the end of speech in general -lrb- which be a very short and expedite way of convey they thought one to another -rrb- be evident in the name which in several art have be find out and apply to several complex idea of modify action belong to they several trade for dispatch sake in they direction or discourse about they which idea be not generally frame in the mind of man not conversant about these operation and thence the word that stand for they by the greatest part of man of the same language be not understand : v g coltshire drilling filtration cohobation be word stand for certain complex idea which be seldom in the mind of any but those few whose particular employment do at every turn suggest they to they thought those name of they be not generally understand but by smith and chymist who have frame the complex idea which these word stand for and have give name to they or receive they from other upon hearing of these name in communication readily conceive those idea in they minds-as by cohobation all the simple idea of distil and the pour the liquor distil from anything back upon the remain matter and distil it again thus we see that there be great variety of simple idea as of taste and smell which have no name and of mode many more which either not have be generally enough observe or else not be of any great use to be take notice of in the affair and converse of man they have not have name give to they and so pass not for species this we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large when we come to speak of word chapter xix of the mode of think 1 sensation remembrance contemplation & c mode of think when the mind turn its view inwards upon itself and contemplate its own action think be the first that occur in it the mind observe a great variety of modification and from thence receive distinct idea thus the perception or thought which actually accompany and be annex to any impression on the body make by a external object be distinct from all other modification of think furnish the mind with a distinct idea which we call sensation -- which be as it be the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by the sens the same idea when it again recur without the operation of the like object on the external sensory be remembrance : if it be seek after by the mind and with pain and endeavor find and bring again in view it be recollection : if it be hold there long under attentive consideration it be contemplation : when idea float in we mind without any reflection or regard of the understand it be that which the french call reverie we language have scarce a name for it : when the idea that offer themselves -lrb- for as i have observe in another place whilst we be awake there will always be a train of idea succeed one another in we mind -rrb- be take notice of and as it be register in the memory it be attention : when the mind with great earnestness and of choice fix its view on any idea consider it on all side and will not be call off by the ordinary solicitation of other idea it be that we call intention or study : sleep without dream be rest from all these : and dream itself be the have of idea -lrb- whilst the outward sens be stop so that they receive not outward object with they usual quickness -rrb- in the mind not suggest by any external object or know occasion nor under any choice or conduct of the understanding at all : and whether that which we call ecstasy be not dream with the eye open i leave to be examine 2 other mode of think these be some few instance of those various mode of think which the mind may observe in itself and so have as distinct idea of as it have of white and red a square or a circle i do not pretend to enumerate they all nor to treat at large of this set of idea which be get from reflection : that would be to make a volume it suffice to my present purpose to have show here by some few example of what sort these idea be and how the mind come by they especially since i shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of reasoning judge volition and knowledge which be some of the most considerable operation of the mind and mode of think 3 the various degree of attention in think but perhaps it may not be a unpardonable digression nor wholly impertinent to we present design if we reflect here upon the different state of the mind in think which those instance of attention reverie and dream & c before mention naturally enough suggest that there be idea some or other always present in the mind of a wake man every one 's experience convince he though the mind employ itself about they with several degree of attention sometimes the mind fix itself with so much earnestness on the contemplation of some object that it turn they idea on all side mark they relation and circumstance and view every part so nicely and with such intention that it shut out all other thought and take no notice of the ordinary impression make then on the sens which at another season would produce very sensible perception : at other time it barely observe the train of idea that succeed in the understanding without direct and pursue any of they : and at other time it let they pass almost quite unregarded as faint shadow that make no impression 4 hence it be probable that think be the action not the essence of the soul this difference of intention and remission of the mind in think with a great variety of degree between earnest study and very near mind nothing at all every one i think have experiment in himself trace it a little further and you find the mind in sleep retire as it be from the sens and out of the reach of those motion make on the organ of sense which at other time produce very vivid and sensible idea i need not for this instance in those who sleep out whole stormy night without hear the thunder or see the lightning or feel the shake of the house which be sensible enough to those who be wake but in this retirement of the mind from the sens it often retain a yet more loose and incoherent manner of think which we call dream and last of all sound sleep close the scene quite and put a end to all appearance this i think almost every one have experience of in himself and he own observation without difficulty lead he thus far that which i would further conclude from hence be that since the mind can sensibly put on at several time several degree of think and be sometimes even in a wake man so remiss as to have thought dim and obscure to that degree that they be very little remove from none at all and at last in the dark retirement of sound sleep lose the sight perfectly of all idea whatsoever : since i say this be evidently so in matter of fact and constant experience i ask whether it be not probable that think be the action and not the essence of the soul since the operation of agent will easily admit of intention and remission : but the essence of thing be not conceive capable of any such variation but this by the by chapter xx of mode of pleasure and pain 1 pleasure and pain simple idea amongst the simple idea which we receive both from sensation and reflection pain and pleasure be two very considerable one for as in the body there be sensation barely in itself or accompany with pain or pleasure so the thought or perception of the mind be simply so or else accompany also with pleasure or pain delight or trouble call it how you please these like other simple idea can not be describe nor they name define the way of know they be as of the simple idea of the sens only by experience for to define they by the presence of good or evil be no otherwise to make they know to we than by make we reflect on what we feel in ourselves upon the several and various operation of good and evil upon we mind as they be differently apply to or consider by we 2 good and evil what thing then be good or evil only in reference to pleasure or pain that we call good which be apt to cause or increase pleasure or diminish pain in we or else to procure or preserve we the possession of any other good or absence of any evil and on the contrary we name that evil which be apt to produce or increase any pain or diminish any pleasure in we : or else to procure we any evil or deprive we of any good by pleasure and pain i must be understand to mean of body or mind as they be commonly distinguish though in truth they be only different constitution of the mind sometimes occasion by disorder in the body sometimes by thought of the mind 3 we passion move by good and evil pleasure and pain and that which cause they -- good and evil be the hinge on which we passion turn and if we reflect on ourselves and observe how these under various consideration operate in we what modification or temper of mind what internal sensation -lrb- if i may so call they -rrb- they produce in we we may thence form to ourselves the idea of we passion 4 love thus any one reflect upon the thought he have of the delight which any present or absent thing be apt to produce in he have the idea we call love for when a man declare in autumn when he be eat they or in spring when there be none that he love grape it be no more but that the taste of grape delight he : let a alteration of health or constitution destroy the delight of they taste and he then can be say to love grape no longer 5 hatred on the contrary the thought of the pain which anything present or absent be apt to produce in we be what we call hatred be it my business here to inquire any further than into the bare idea of we passion as they depend on different modification of pleasure and pain i should remark that we love and hatred of inanimate insensible being be commonly found on that pleasure and pain which we receive from they use and application any way to we sens though with they destruction but hatred or love to being capable of happiness or misery be often the uneasiness of delight which we find in ourselves arise from they very be or happiness thus the be and welfare of a man 's child or friend produce constant delight in he he be say constantly to love they but it suffice to note that we idea of love and hatred be but the disposition of the mind in respect of pleasure and pain in general however cause in we 6 desire the uneasiness a man find in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carry the idea of delight with it be that we call desire which be greater or less as that uneasiness be more or less vehement where by the by it may perhaps be of some use to remark that the chief if not only spur to human industry and action be uneasiness for whatsoever good be propose if its absence carry no displeasure or pain with it if a man be easy and content without it there be no desire of it nor endeavor after it there be no more but a bare velleity the term use to signify the lowest degree of desire and that which be next to none at all when there be so little uneasiness in the absence of anything that it carry a man no further than some faint wish for it without any more effectual or vigorous use of the means to attain it desire also be stop or abate by the opinion of the impossibility or unattainableness of the good propose as far as the uneasiness be cure or allay by that consideration this might carry we thought further be it seasonable in this place 7 joy joy be a delight of the mind from the consideration of the present or assure approach possession of a good and we be then possess of any good when we have it so in we power that we can use it when we please thus a man almost starve have joy at the arrival of relief even before he have the pleasure of use it : and a father in whom the very well-being of he child cause delight be always as long as he child be in such a state in the possession of that good for he need but to reflect on it to have that pleasure 8 sorrow sorrow be uneasiness in the mind upon the thought of a good lose which might have be enjoy longer or the sense of a present evil 9 hope hope be that pleasure in the mind which every one find in himself upon the thought of a probable future enjoyment of a thing which be apt to delight he 10 fear fear be a uneasiness of the mind upon the thought of future evil likely to befal we 11 despair despair be the thought of the unattainableness of any good which work differently in man 's mind sometimes produce uneasiness or pain sometimes rest and indolency 12 anger anger be uneasiness or discomposure of the mind upon the receipt of any injury with a present purpose of revenge 13 envy envy be a uneasiness of the mind cause by the consideration of a good we desire obtain by one we think should not have have it before we 14 what passion all man have these two last envy and anger not be cause by pain and pleasure simply in themselves but have in they some mixed consideration of ourselves and other be not therefore to be find in all man because those other part of value they merit or intend revenge be want in they but all the rest terminate purely in pain and pleasure be i think to be find in all man for we love desire rejoice and hope only in respect of pleasure we hate fear and grieve only in respect of pain ultimately in fine all these passion be move by thing only as they appear to be the cause of pleasure and pain or to have pleasure or pain some way or other annex to they thus we extend we hatred usually to the subject -lrb- at least if a sensible or voluntary agent -rrb- which have produce pain in we because the fear it leave be a constant pain : but we do not so constantly love what have do we good because pleasure operate not so strongly on we as pain and because we be not so ready to have hope it will do so again but this by the by 15 pleasure and pain what by pleasure and pain delight and uneasiness i must all along be understand -lrb- as i have above intimate -rrb- to mean not only bodily pain and pleasure but whatsoever delight or uneasiness be feel by we whether arise from any grateful or unacceptable sensation or reflection 16 removal or lessen of either it be further to be consider that in reference to the passion the removal or lessen of a pain be consider and operate as a pleasure : and the loss or diminish of a pleasure as a pain 17 shame the passion too have most of they in most person operation on the body and cause various change in it which not be always sensible do not make a necessary part of the idea of each passion for shame which be a uneasiness of the mind upon the thought of have do something which be indecent or will lessen the value esteem which other have for we have not always blush accompany it 18 these instance to show how we idea of the passion be get from sensation and reflection i would not be mistake here as if i mean this as a discourse of the passion they be many more than those i have here name : and those i have take notice of would each of they require a much larger and more accurate discourse i have only mention these here as so many instance of mode of pleasure and pain result in we mind from various consideration of good and evil i might perhaps have instance in other mode of pleasure and pain more simple than these as the pain of hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eating and drinking to remove they : the pain of tooth set on edge the pleasure of music pain from captious uninstructive wrangling and the pleasure of rational conversation with a friend or of well-directed study in the search and discovery of truth but the passion be of much more concernment to we i rather make choice to instance in they and show how the idea we have of they be derive from sensation or reflection chapter xxi of power 1 this idea how get the mind be every day inform by the sens of the alteration of those simple idea it observe in thing without and take notice how one come to a end and cease to be and another begin to exist which be not before reflect also on what pass within itself and observe a constant change of its idea sometimes by the impression of outward object on the sens and sometimes by the determination of its own choice and conclude from what it have so constantly observe to have be that the like change will for the future be make in the same thing by like agent and by the like way -- consider in one thing the possibility of have any of its simple idea change and in another the possibility of make that change and so come by that idea which we call power thus we say fire have a power to melt gold i e to destroy the consistency of its insensible part and consequently its hardness and make it fluid and gold have a power to be melt that the sun have a power to blanch wax and wax a power to be blanch by the sun whereby the yellowness be destroy and whiteness make to exist in its room in which and the like case the power we consider be in reference to the change of perceivable idea for we can not observe any alteration to be make in or operation upon anything but by the observable change of its sensible idea nor conceive any alteration to be make but by conceive a change of some of its idea 2 power active and passive power thus consider be two-fold viz as able to make or able to receive any change the one may be call active and the other passive power whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power as its author god be truly above all passive power and whether the intermediate state of create spirit be not that alone which be capable of both active and passive power may be worth consideration i shall not now enter into that inquiry my present business be not to search into the original of power but how we come by the idea of it but since active power make so great a part of we complex idea of natural substance -lrb- as we shall see hereafter -rrb- and i mention they as such accord to common apprehension yet they be not perhaps so truly active power as we hasty thought be apt to represent they i judge it not amiss by this intimation to direct we mind to the consideration of god and spirit for the clearest idea of active power 3 power include relation i confess power include in it some kind of relation -lrb- a relation to action or change -rrb- as indeed which of we idea of what kind soever when attentively consider do not for we idea of extension duration and number do they not all contain in they a secret relation of the part figure and motion have something relative in they much more visibly and sensible quality as color and smell & c what be they but the power of different body in relation to we perception & c and if consider in the thing themselves do they not depend on the bulk figure texture and motion of the part all which include some kind of relation in they we idea therefore of power i think may well have a place amongst other simple idea and be consider as one of they be one of those that make a principal ingredient in we complex idea of substance as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe 4 the clearest idea of active power have from spirit of passive power all sensible thing abundantly furnish we with sensible idea whose sensible quality and being we find to be in continual flux and therefore with reason we look on they as liable still to the same change nor have we of active power -lrb- which be the more proper signification of the word power -rrb- fewer instance since whatever change be observe the mind must collect a power somewhere able to make that change as well as a possibility in the thing itself to receive it but yet if we will consider it attentively body by we sens do not afford we so clear and distinct a idea of active power as we have from reflection on the operation of we mind for all power relate to action and there be but two sort of action whereof we have a idea viz thinking and motion let we consider whence we have the clearest idea of the power which produce these action -lrb- 1 -rrb- of think body afford we no idea at all it be only from reflection that we have that -lrb- 2 -rrb- neither have we from body any idea of the beginning of motion a body at rest afford we no idea of any active power to move and when it be set in motion itself that motion be rather a passion than a action in it for when the ball obey the motion of a billiard-stick it be not any action of the ball but bare passion also when by impulse it set another ball in motion that lay in its way it only communicate the motion it have receive from another and lose in itself so much as the other receive : which give we but a very obscure idea of a active power of move in body whilst we observe it only to transfer but not produce any motion for it be but a very obscure idea of power which reach not the production of the action but the continuation of the passion for so be motion in a body impel by another the continuation of the alteration make in it from rest to motion be little more a action than the continuation of the alteration of its figure by the same blow be a action the idea of the beginning of motion we have only from reflection on what pass in ourselves where we find by experience that barely by willing it barely by a thought of the mind we can move the part of we body which be before at rest so that it seem to I we have from the observation of the operation of body by we sens but a very imperfect obscure idea of active power since they afford we not any idea in themselves of the power to begin any action either motion or thought but if from the impulse body be observe to make one upon another any one think he have a clear idea of power it serve as well to my purpose sensation be one of those way whereby the mind come by its idea : only i think it worth while to consider here by the way whether the mind doth not receive its idea of active power clearer from reflection on its own operation than it doth from any external sensation 5 will and understand two power in mind or spirit this at least i think evident -- that we find in ourselves a power to begin or forbear continue or end several action of we mind and motion of we body barely by a thought or preference of the mind order or as it be command the do or not do such or such a particular action this power which the mind have thus to order the consideration of any idea or the forbearing to consider it or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest and vice versa in any particular instance be that which we call the will the actual exercise of that power by direct any particular action or its forbearance be that which we call volition or willing the forbearance of that action consequent to such order or command of the mind be call voluntary and whatsoever action be perform without such a thought of the mind be call involuntary the power of perception be that which we call the understanding perception which we make the act of the understanding be of three sort : -- 1 the perception of idea in we mind 2 the perception of the : signification of sign 3 the perception of the connexion or repugnancy agreement or disagreement that there be between any of we idea all these be attribute to the understanding or perceptive power though it be the two latter only that use allow we to say we understand 6 faculty not real being these power of the mind viz of perceive and of prefer be usually call by another name and the ordinary way of speaking be that the understanding and will be two faculty of the mind a word proper enough if it be use as all word should be so as not to breed any confusion in man 's thought by be suppose -lrb- as i suspect it have be -rrb- to stand for some real being in the soul that perform those action of understanding and volition for when we say the will be the commanding and superior faculty of the soul that it be or be not free that it determine the inferior faculty that it follow the dictate of the understanding & c -- though these and the like expression by those that carefully attend to they own idea and conduct they thought more by the evidence of thing than the sound of word may be understand in a clear and distinct sense -- yet i suspect i say that this way of speaking of faculty have mislead many into a confused notion of so many distinct agent in we which have they several province and authority and do command obey and perform several action as so many distinct being which have be no small occasion of wrangle obscurity and uncertainty in question relate to they 7 whence the idea of liberty and necessity every one i think find in himself a power to begin or forbear continue or put a end to several action in himself from the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind over the action of the man which everyone find in himself arise the idea of liberty and necessity 8 liberty what all the action that we have any idea of reduce themselves as have be say to these two viz thinking and motion so far as a man have power to think or not to think to move or not to move accord to the preference or direction of he own mind so far be a man free wherever any performance or forbearance be not equally in a man 's power wherever do or not do will not equally follow upon the preference of he mind direct it there he be not free though perhaps the action may be voluntary so that the idea of liberty be the idea of a power in any agent to do or forbear any particular action accord to the determination or thought of the mind whereby either of they be prefer to the other : where either of they be not in the power of the agent to be produce by he accord to he volition there he be not at liberty that agent be under necessity so that liberty can not be where there be no thought no volition no will but there may be think there may be will there may be volition where there be no liberty a little consideration of a obvious instance or two may make this clear 9 suppose understanding and will a tennis-ball whether in motion by the stroke of a racket or lie still at rest be not by any one take to be a free agent if we inquire into the reason we shall find it be because we conceive not a tennis-ball to think and consequently not to have any volition or preference of motion to rest or vice versa and therefore have not liberty be not a free agent but all its both motion and rest come under we idea of necessary and be so call likewise a man fall into the water -lrb- a bridge break under he -rrb- have not herein liberty be not a free agent for though he have volition though he prefer he not fall to fall yet the forbearance of that motion not be in he power the stop or cessation of that motion follow not upon he volition and therefore therein he be not free so a man striking himself or he friend by a convulsive motion of he arm which it be not in he power by volition or the direction of he mind to stop or forbear nobody think he have in this liberty every one pity he as act by necessity and constraint 10 belong not to volition again : suppose a man be carry whilst fast asleep into a room where be a person he long to see and speak with and be there lock fast in beyond he power to get out : he awake and be glad to find himself in so desirable company which he stay willingly in i e prefer he stay to go away i ask be not this stay voluntary i think nobody will doubt it : and yet be lock fast in it be evident he be not at liberty not to stay he have not freedom to be go so that liberty be not a idea belong to volition or prefer but to the person have the power of do or forbear to do accord as the mind shall choose or direct we idea of liberty reach as far as that power and no farther for wherever restraint come to check that power or compulsion take away that indifferency of ability to act or to forbear act there liberty and we notion of it presently cease 11 voluntary oppose to involuntary we have instance enough and often more than enough in we own body a man 's heart beat and the blood circulate which it be not in he power by any thought or volition to stop and therefore in respect of these motion where rest depend not on he choice nor would follow the determination of he mind if it should prefer it he be not a free agent convulsive motion agitate he leg so that though he will it ever so much he can not by any power of he mind stop they motion -lrb- as in that odd disease call chorea sanctus vitus -rrb- but he be perpetually dance he be not at liberty in this action but under as much necessity of move as a stone that fall or a tennis-ball strike with a racket on the other side a palsy or the stock hinder he leg from obey the determination of he mind if it would thereby transfer he body to another place in all these there be want of freedom though the sit still even of a paralytic whilst he prefer it to a removal be truly voluntary voluntary then be not oppose to necessary but to involuntary for a man may prefer what he can do to what he can not do the state he be in to its absence or change though necessity have make it in itself unalterable 12 liberty what as it be in the motion of the body so it be in the thought of we mind : where any one be such that we have power to take it up or lay it by accord to the preference of the mind there we be at liberty a wake man be under the necessity of have some idea constantly in he mind be not at liberty to think or not to think no more than he be at liberty whether he body shall touch any other or no but whether he will remove he contemplation from one idea to another be many time in he choice and then he be in respect of he idea as much at liberty as he be in respect of body he rest on he can at pleasure remove himself from one to another but yet some idea to the mind like some motion to the body be such as in certain circumstance it can not avoid nor obtain they absence by the utmost effort it can use a man on the rack be not at liberty to lay by the idea of pain and divert himself with other contemplation : and sometimes a boisterous passion hurry we thought as a hurricane do we body without leave we the liberty of think on other thing which we would rather choose but as soon as the mind regain the power to stop or continue begin or forbear any of these motion of the body without or thought within accord as it think fit to prefer either to the other we then consider the man as a free agent again 13 wherever thought be wholly want or the power to act or forbear accord to the direction of think there necessity take place this in a agent capable of volition when the beginning or continuation of any action be contrary to that preference of he mind be call compulsion when the hinder or stop any action be contrary to he volition it be call restraint agent that have no thought no volition at all be in everything necessary agent 14 if this be so -lrb- as i imagine it be -rrb- i leave it to be consider whether it may not help to put a end to that long agitate and i think unreasonable because unintelligible question viz whether man 's will be free or no for if i mistake not it follow from what i have say that the question itself be altogether improper and it be as insignificant to ask whether man 's will be free as to ask whether he sleep be swift or he virtue square : liberty be as little applicable to the will as swiftness of motion be to sleep or squareness to virtue every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a question as either of these : because it be obvious that the modification of motion belong not to sleep nor the difference of figure to virtue and when any one well consider it i think he will as plainly perceive that liberty which be but a power belong only to agent and can not be a attribute or modification of the will which be also but a power 15 volition such be the difficulty of explain and give clear notion of internal action by sound that i must here warn my reader that order direct choose prefer & c which i have make use of will not distinctly enough express volition unless he will reflect on what he himself do when he will for example prefer which seem perhaps best to express the act of volition do it not precisely for though a man would prefer fly to walk yet who can say he ever will it volition it be plain be a act of the mind knowingly exert that dominion it take itself to have over any part of the man by employ it in or withhold it from any particular action and what be the will but the faculty to do this and be that faculty anything more in effect than a power the power of the mind to determine its thought to the produce continue or stop any action as far as it depend on we for can it be deny that whatever agent have a power to think on its own action and to prefer they do or omission either to other have that faculty call will will then be nothing but such a power liberty on the other side be the power a man have to do or forbear do any particular action accord as its do or forbearance have the actual preference in the mind which be the same thing as to say accord as he himself will it 16 power belong to agent it be plain then that the will be nothing but one power or ability and freedom another power or ability so that to ask whether the will have freedom be to ask whether one power have another power one ability another ability a question at first sight too grossly absurd to make a dispute or need a answer for who be it that see not that power belong only to agent and be attribute only of substance and not of power themselves so that this way of put the question -lrb- viz whether the will be free -rrb- be in effect to ask whether the will be a substance a agent or at least to suppose it since freedom can properly be attribute to nothing else if freedom can with any propriety of speech be apply to power it may be attribute to the power that be in a man to produce or forbear produce motion in part of he body by choice or preference which be that which denominate he free and be freedom itself but if any one should ask whether freedom be free he would be suspect not to understand well what he say and he would be think to deserve mida 's ear who know that rich be a denomination for the possession of riches should demand whether riches themselves be rich 17 how the will instead of the man be call free however the name faculty which man have give to this power call the will and whereby they have be lead into a way of talking of the will as act may by a appropriation that disguise its true sense serve a little to palliate the absurdity yet the will in truth signify nothing but a power or ability to prefer or choose : and when the will under the name of a faculty be consider as it be barely as a ability to do something the absurdity in say it be free or not free will easily discover itself for if it be reasonable to suppose and talk of faculty as distinct being that can act -lrb- as we do when we say the will order and the will be free -rrb- it be fit that we should make a speaking faculty and a walk faculty and a dancing faculty by which these action be produce which be but several mode of motion as well as we make the will and understand to be faculty by which the action of choose and perceive be produce which be but several mode of think and we may as properly say that it be the singing faculty sing and the dancing faculty dance as that the will choose or that the understanding conceive or as be usual that the will direct the understanding or the understanding obey or obey not the will : it be altogether as proper and intelligible to say that the power of speak direct the power of singing or the power of singing obey or disobey the power of speak 18 this way of talk cause confusion of think this way of talk nevertheless have prevail and as i guess produce great confusion for these be all different power in the mind or in the man to do several action he exert they as he think fit : but the power to do one action be not operate on by the power of do another action for the power of think operate not on the power of choose nor the power of choose on the power of think no more than the power of dancing operate on the power of singing or the power of singing on the power of dancing as any one who reflect on it will easily perceive and yet this be it which we say when we thus speak that the will operate on the understanding or the understanding on the will 19 power be relation not agent i grant that this or that actual thought may be the occasion of volition or exercise the power a man have to choose or the actual choice of the mind the cause of actual think on this or that thing : as the actual singing of such a tune may be the cause of dance such a dance and the actual dancing of such a dance the occasion of singing such a tune but in all these it be not one power that operate on another : but it be the mind that operate and exert these power it be the man that do the action it be the agent that have power or be able to do for power be relation not agent : and that which have the power or not the power to operate be that alone which be or be not free and not the power itself for freedom or not freedom can belong to nothing but what have or have not a power to act 20 liberty belong not to the will the attribute to faculty that which belong not to they have give occasion to this way of talking : but the introduce into discourse concern the mind with the name of faculty a notion of they operating have i suppose as little advanced we knowledge in that part of ourselves as the great use and mention of the like invention of faculty in the operation of the body have help we in the knowledge of physic not that i deny there be faculty both in the body and mind : they both of they have they power of operating else neither the one nor the other could operate for nothing can operate that be not able to operate and that be not able to operate that have no power to operate nor do i deny that those word and the like be to have they place in the common use of language that have make they current it look like too much affectation wholly to lay they by : and philosophy itself though it like not a gaudy dress yet when it appear in public must have so much complacency as to be clothe in the ordinary fashion and language of the country so far as it can consist with truth and perspicuity but the fault have be that faculty have be speak of and represent as so many distinct agent for it be ask what it be that digest the meat in we stomach it be a ready and very satisfactory answer to say that it be the digestive faculty what be it that make anything come out of the body the expulsive faculty what move the motive faculty and so in the mind the intellectual faculty or the understanding understand and the elective faculty or the will will or command this be in short to say that the ability to digest digested and the ability to move move and the ability to understand understand for faculty ability and power i think be but different name of the same thing : which way of speak when put into more intelligible word will i think amount to thus much -- that digestion be perform by something that be able to digest motion by something able to move and understand by something able to understand and in truth it would be very strange if it should be otherwise as strange as it would be for a man to be free without be able to be free 21 but to the agent or man to return then to the inquiry about liberty i think the question be not proper whether the will be free but whether a man be free thus i think first that so far as any one can by the direction or choice of he mind prefer the existence of any action to the non-existence of that action and vice versa make it to exist or not exist so far he be free for if i can by a thought direct the motion of my finger make it move when it be at rest or vice versa it be evident that in respect of that i be free : and if i can by a like thought of my mind prefer one to the other produce either word or silence i be at liberty to speak or hold my peace : and as far as this power reach of act or not act by the determination of he own thought prefer either so far be a man free for how can we think any one freer than to have the power to do what he will and so far as any one can by prefer any action to its not be or rest to any action produce that action or rest so far can he do what he will for such a prefer of action to its absence be the willing of it : and we can scarce tell how to imagine any be freer than to be able to do what he will so that in respect of action within the reach of such a power in he a man seem as free as it be possible for freedom to make he 22 in respect of willing a man be not free but the inquisitive mind of man willing to shift off from himself as far as he can all thought of guilt though it be by put himself into a worse state than that of fatal necessity be not content with this : freedom unless it reach further than this will not serve the turn : and it pass for a good plea that a man be not free at all if he be not as free to will as he be to act what he will concern a man 's liberty there yet therefore be raise this further question whether a man be free to will which i think be what be mean when it be dispute whether the will be free and as to that i imagine 23 how a man can not be free to will secondly that willing or volition be a action and freedom consist in a power of act or not act a man in respect of willing or the act of volition when any action in he power be once propose to he thought as presently to be do can not be free the reason whereof be very manifest for it be unavoidable that the action depend on he will should exist or not exist and its existence or not existence follow perfectly the determination and preference of he will he can not avoid willing the existence or non-existence of that action it be absolutely necessary that he will the one or the other ie prefer the one to the other : since one of they must necessarily follow and that which do follow follow by the choice and determination of he mind that be by he willing it : for if he do not will it it would not be so that in respect of the act of willing a man be not free : liberty consist in a power to act or not to act which in regard of volition a man have not 24 liberty be freedom to execute what be will this then be evident that a man be not at liberty to will or not to will anything in he power that he once consider of : liberty consist in a power to act or to forbear acting and in that only for a man that sit still be say yet to be at liberty because he can walk if he will it a man that walk be at liberty also not because he walk or move but because he can stand still if he will it but if a man sit still have not a power to remove himself he be not at liberty so likewise a man fall down a precipice though in motion be not at liberty because he can not stop that motion if he would this be so it be plain that a man that be walk to whom it be propose to give off walking be not at liberty whether he will determine himself to walk or give off walk or not : he must necessarily prefer one or the other of they walk or not walk and so it be in regard of all other action in we power they be once propose the mind have not a power to act or not to act wherein consist liberty the mind in that case have not a power to forbear willing it can not avoid some determination concern they let the consideration be as short the think as quick as it will it either leave the man in the state he be before think or change it continue the action or put a end to it whereby it be manifest that it order and direct one in preference to or with neglect of the other and thereby either the continuation or change become unavoidably voluntary 25 the will determine by something without it since then it be plain that in most case a man be not at liberty whether he will or no -lrb- for when a action in he power be propose to he thought he can not forbear volition he must determine one way or the other -rrb- the next thing demand be -- whether a man be at liberty to will which of the two he please motion or rest this question carry the absurdity of it so manifestly in itself that one might thereby sufficiently be convince that liberty concern not the will for to ask whether a man be at liberty to will either motion or rest speaking or silence which he please be to ask whether a man can will what he will or be please with what he be please with a question which i think need no answer : and they who can make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the act of another and another to determine that and so on in infinitum 26 the idea of liberty and volition must be define to avoid these and the like absurdity nothing can be of greater use than to establish in we mind determine idea of the thing under consideration if the idea of liberty and volition be well fix in we understanding and carry along with we in we mind as they ought through all the question that be raise about they i suppose a great part of the difficulty that perplex man 's thought and entangle they understanding would be much easier resolve and we should perceive where the confused signification of term or where the nature of the thing cause the obscurity 27 freedom first then it be carefully to be remember that freedom consist in the dependence of the existence or not existence of any action upon we volition of it and not in the dependence of any action or its contrary on we preference a man standing on a cliff be at liberty to leap twenty yard downwards into the sea not because he have a power to do the contrary action which be to leap twenty yard upward for that he can not do but he be therefore free because he have a power to leap or not to leap but if a greater force than he either hold he fast or tumble he down he be no longer free in that case because the do or forbearance of that particular action be no longer in he power he that be a close prisoner in a room twenty foot square be at the north side of he chamber be at liberty to walk twenty foot southward because he can walk or not walk it but be not at the same time at liberty to do the contrary ie to walk twenty foot northward in this then consist freedom viz in we be able to act or not to act accord as we shall choose or will 28 what volition and action mean secondly we must remember that volition or willing be a act of the mind direct its thought to the production of any action and thereby exert its power to produce it to avoid multiply of word i would crave leave here under the word action to comprehend the forbearance too of any action propose : sit still or hold one 's peace when walk or speak be propose though mere forbearance require as much the determination of the will and be as often weighty in they consequence as the contrary action may on that consideration well enough pass for action too : but this i say that i may not be mistake if -lrb- for brevity 's sake -rrb- i speak thus 29 what determine the will thirdly the will be nothing but a power in the mind to direct the operative faculty of a man to motion or rest as far as they depend on such direction to the question what be it determine the will the true and proper answer be the mind for that which determine the general power of direct to this or that particular direction be nothing but the agent itself exercise the power it have that particular way if this answer satisfy not it be plain the meaning of the question what determine the will be this -- what move the mind in every particular instance to determine its general power of direct to this or that particular motion or rest and to this i answer -- the motive for continue in the same state or action be only the present satisfaction in it the motive to change be always some uneasiness : nothing set we upon the change of state or upon any new action but some uneasiness this be the great motive that work on the mind to put it upon action which for shortness ' sake we will call determine of the will which i shall more at large explain 30 will and desire must not be confound but in the way to it it will be necessary to premise that though i have above endeavor to express the act of volition by choose prefer and the like term that signify desire as well as volition for want of other word to mark that act of the mind whose proper name be willing or volition yet it be a very simple act whosoever desire to understand what it be will better find it by reflect on he own mind and observe what it do when it will than by any variety of articulate sound whatsoever this caution of be careful not to be mislead by expression that do not enough keep up the difference between the will and several act of the mind that be quite distinct from it i think the more necessary because i find the will often confound with several of the affection especially desire and one put for the other and that by man who would not willingly be think not to have have very distinct notion of thing and not to have writ very clearly about they this i imagine have be no small occasion of obscurity and mistake in this matter and therefore be as much as may be to be avoid for he that shall turn he thought inwards upon what pass in he mind when he will shall see that the will or power of volition be conversant about nothing but we own action terminate there and reach no further and that volition be nothing but that particular determination of the mind whereby barely by a think the mind endeavor to give rise continuation or stop to any action which it take to be in its power this well consider plainly show that the will be perfectly distinguish from desire which in the very same action may have a quite contrary tendency from that which we will set we upon a man whom i can not deny may oblige I to use persuasion to another which at the same time i be speak i may wish may not prevail on he in this case it be plain the will and desire run counter i will the action that tend one way whilst my desire tend another and that the direct contrary way a man who by a violent fit of the gout in he limb find a doziness in he head or a want of appetite in he stomach remove desire to be ease too of the pain of he foot or hand -lrb- for wherever there be pain there be a desire to be rid of it -rrb- though yet whilst he apprehend that the removal of the pain may translate the noxious humor to a more vital part he will be never determine to any one action that may serve to remove this pain whence it be evident that desire and willing be two distinct act of the mind and consequently that the will which be but the power of volition be much more distinct from desire 31 uneasiness determine the will to return then to the inquiry what be it that determine the will in regard to we action and that upon second thought i be apt to imagine be not as be generally suppose the greater good in view but some -lrb- and for the most part the most pressing -rrb- uneasiness a man be at present under this be that which successively determine the will and set we upon those action we perform this uneasiness we may call as it be desire which be a uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good all pain of the body of what sort soever and disquiet of the mind be uneasiness : and with this be always join desire equal to the pain or uneasiness feel and be scarce distinguishable from it for desire be nothing but a uneasiness in the want of a absent good in reference to any pain feel ease be that absent good and till that ease be attain we may call it desire nobody feeling pain that he wish not to be ease of with a desire equal to that pain and inseparable from it besides this desire of ease from pain there be another of absent positive good and here also the desire and uneasiness be equal as much as we desire any absent good so much be we in pain for it but here all absent good do not accord to the greatness it have or be acknowledge to have cause pain equal to that greatness as all pain cause desire equal to itself : because the absence of good be not always a pain as the presence of pain be and therefore absent good may be look on and consider without desire but so much as there be anywhere of desire so much there be of uneasiness 32 desire be uneasiness that desire be a state of uneasiness every one who reflect on himself will quickly find who be there that have not feel in desire what the wise man say of hope -lrb- which be not much different from it -rrb- that it be ` defer make the heart sick ' and that still proportionable to the greatness of the desire which sometimes raise the uneasiness to that pitch that it make people cry out ` give I child ' give I the thing desire ` or i die ' life itself and all its enjoyment be a burden can not be bear under the lasting and unremoved pressure of such a uneasiness 33 the uneasiness of desire determine the will good and evil present and absent it be true work upon the mind but that which immediately determine the will from time to time to every voluntary action be the uneasiness of desire fix on some absent good : either negative as indolence to one in pain or positive as enjoyment of pleasure that it be this uneasiness that determine the will to the successive voluntary action whereof the greatest part of we life be make up and by which we be conduct through different course to different end i shall endeavor to show both from experience and the reason of the thing 34 this be the spring of action when a man be perfectly content with the state he be in -- which be when he be perfectly without any uneasiness -- what industry what action what will be there leave but to continue in it of this every man 's observation will satisfy he and thus we see we all-wise maker suitably to we constitution and frame and know what it be that determine the will have put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and other natural desire that return at they season to move and determine they will for the preservation of themselves and the continuation of they species for i think we may conclude that if the bare contemplation of these good end to which we be carry by these several uneasiness have be sufficient to determine the will and set we on work we should have have none of these natural pain and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all ` it be better to marry than to burn ' say st paul where we may see what it be that chiefly drive man into the enjoyment of a conjugal life a little burning feel push we more powerfully than greater pleasure in prospect draw or allure 35 the greatest positive good determine not the will but present uneasiness alone it seem so established and settle a maxim by the general consent of all mankind that good the greater good determine the will that i do not at all wonder that when i first publish my thought on this subject i take it for grant and i imagine that by a great many i shall be think more excusable for have then do so than that now i have venture to recede from so receive a opinion but yet upon a stricter inquiry i be force to conclude that good the greater good though apprehend and acknowledge to be so do not determine the will until we desire raise proportionably to it make we uneasy in the want of it convince a man never so much that plenty have its advantage over poverty make he see and own that the handsome convenience of life be better than nasty penury : yet as long as he be content with the latter and find no uneasiness in it he move not he will never be determine to any action that shall bring he out of it let a man be ever so well persuade of the advantage of virtue that it be as necessary to a man who have any great aim in this world or hope in the next as food to life : yet till he hunger or thirst after righteousness till he feel a uneasiness in the want of it he will will not be determine to any action in pursuit of this confess greater good but any other uneasiness he feel in himself shall take place and carry he will to other action on the other side let a drunkard see that he health decay he estate waste discredit and disease and the want of all thing even of he beloved drink attend he in the course he follow : yet the return of uneasiness to miss he companion the habitual thirst after he cup at the usual time drive he to the tavern though he have in he view the loss of health and plenty and perhaps of the joy of another life : the least of which be no inconsiderable good but such as he confess be far greater than the tickling of he palate with a glass of wine or the idle chat of a soak club it be not want of view the greater good : for he see and acknowledge it and in the interval of he drinking hour will take resolution to pursue the greater good but when the uneasiness to miss he accustomed delight return the greater acknowledge good lose its hold and the present uneasiness determine the will to the accustomed action which thereby get stronger footing to prevail against the next occasion though he at the same time make secret promise to himself that he will do so no more this be the last time he will act against the attainment of those greater goods and thus he be from time to time in the state of that unhappy complainer video meliora proboque deteriora sequor : which sentence allow for true and make good by constant experience may in this and possibly no other way be easily make intelligible 36 because the removal of uneasiness be the first step to happiness if we inquire into the reason of what experience make so evident in fact and examine why it be uneasiness alone operate on the will and determine it in its choice we shall find that we be capable but of one determination of the will to one action at once the present uneasiness that we be under do naturally determine the will in order to that happiness which we all aim at in all we action for as much as whilst we be under any uneasiness we can not apprehend ourselves happy or in the way to it pain and uneasiness being by every one conclude and feel to be inconsistent with happiness spoil the relish even of those good thing which we have : a little pain serve to mar all the pleasure we rejoice in and therefore that which of course determine the choice of we will to the next action will always be -- the remove of pain as long as we have any leave as the first and necessary step towards happiness 37 because uneasiness alone be present another reason why it be uneasiness alone determine the will be this : because that alone be present and it be against the nature of thing that what be absent should operate where it be not it may be say that absent good may by contemplation be bring home to the mind and make present the idea of it indeed may be in the mind and view as present there but nothing will be in the mind as a present good able to counterbalance the removal of any uneasiness which we be under till it raise we desire and the uneasiness of that have the prevalency in determine the will till then the idea in the mind of whatever be good be there only like other idea the object of bare unactive speculation but operate not on the will nor set we on work the reason whereof i shall show by and by how many be to be find that have have lively representation set before they mind of the unspeakable joy of heaven which they acknowledge both possible and probable too who yet would be content to take up with they happiness here and so the prevail uneasiness of they desire let loose after the enjoyment of this life take they turn in the determine they will and all that while they take not one step be not one jot move towards the good thing of another life consider as ever so great 38 because all who allow the joy of heaven possible purse they not be the will determine by the view of good as it appear in contemplation greater or less to the understanding which be the state of all absent good and that which in the receive opinion the will be suppose to move to and to be move by -- i do not see how it could ever get loose from the infinite eternal joy of heaven once propose and consider as possible for all absent good by which alone barely propose and come in view the will be think to be determine and so to set we on action be only possible but not infallibly certain it be unavoidable that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive action it direct and then we should keep constantly and steadily in we course towards heaven without ever stand still or direct we action to any other end : the eternal condition of a future state infinitely outweigh the expectation of riches or honor or any other worldly pleasure which we can propose to ourselves though we should grant these the more probable to be obtain : for nothing future be yet in possession and so the expectation even of these may deceive we if it be so that the greater good in view determine the will so great a good once propose could not but seize the will and hold it fast to the pursuit of this infinitely greatest good without ever let it go again : for the will have a power over and direct the thought as well as other action would if it be so hold the contemplation of the mind fix to that good 39 but any great uneasiness be never neglect this would be the state of the mind and regular tendency of the will in all its determination be it determine by that which be consider and in view the greater good but that it be not so be visible in experience the infinitely greatest confess good be often neglect to satisfy the successive uneasiness of we desire pursue trifle but though the greatest allow even everlasting unspeakable good which have sometimes move and affect the mind do not stedfastly hold the will yet we see any very great and prevailing uneasiness have once lay hold on the will let it not go by which we may be convince what it be that determine the will thus any vehement pain of the body the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love or the impatient desire of revenge keep the will steady and intent and the will thus determine never let the understanding lay by the object but all the thought of the mind and power of the body be uninterruptedly employ that way by the determination of the will influence by that top uneasiness as long as it last whereby it seem to I evident that the will or power of set we upon one action in preference to all other be determine in we by uneasiness : and whether this be not so i desire every one to observe in himself 40 desire accompany all uneasiness i have hitherto chiefly instance in the uneasiness of desire as that which determine the will : because that be the chief and most sensible and the will seldom order any action nor be there any voluntary action perform without some desire accompany it which i think be the reason why the will and desire be so often confound but yet we be not to look upon the uneasiness which make up or at least accompany most of the other passion as wholly exclude in the case aversion fear anger envy shame & c have each they uneasiness too and thereby influence the will these passion be scarce any of they in life and practice simple and alone and wholly unmixed with other though usually in discourse and contemplation that carry the name which operate strongest and appear most in the present state of the mind nay there be i think scarce any of the passion to be find without desire join with it i be sure wherever there be uneasiness there be desire for we constantly desire happiness and whatever we feel of uneasiness so much it be certain we want of happiness even in we own opinion let we state and condition otherwise be what it will besides the present moment not be we eternity whatever we enjoyment be we look beyond the present and desire go with we foresight and that still carry the will with it so that even in joy itself that which keep up the action whereon the enjoyment depend be the desire to continue it and fear to lose it : and whenever a greater uneasiness than that take place in the mind the will presently be by that determine to some new action and the present delight neglect 41 the most pressing uneasiness naturally determine the will but we be in this world beset with sundry uneasiness distract with different desire the next inquiry naturally will be -- which of they have the precedency in determine the will to the next action and to that the answer be -- that ordinarily which be the most pressing of those that be judge capable of be then remove for the will be the power of direct we operative faculty to some action for some end can not at any time be move towards what be judge at that time unattainable : that would be to suppose a intelligent be designedly to act for a end only to lose its labor for so it be to act for what be judge not attainable and therefore very great uneasiness move not the will when they be judge not capable of a cure : they in that case put we not upon endeavor but these set apart the most important and urgent uneasiness we at that time feel be that which ordinarily determine the will successively in that train of voluntary action which make up we life the greatest present uneasiness be the spur to action that be constantly most feel and for the most part determine the will in its choice of the next action for this we must carry along with we that the proper and only object of the will be some action of ours and nothing else for we produce nothing by we willing it but some action in we power it be there the will terminate and reach no further 42 all desire happiness if it be further ask -- what it be move desire i answer -- happiness and that alone happiness and misery be the name of two extreme the utmost bound whereof we know not it be what be in itself good and what be apt to produce any degree of pain be evil yet it often happen that we do not call it so when it come in competition with a greater of its sort because when they come in competition the degree also of pleasure and pain have justly a preference so that if we will rightly estimate what we call good and evil we shall find it lie much in comparison : for the cause of every less degree of pain as well as every greater degree of pleasure have the nature of good and vice versa 43 -lrb- \* miss -rrb- 44 what good be desire what not though this be that which be call good and evil and all good be the proper object of desire in general yet all good even see and confess to be so do not necessarily move every particular man 's desire but only that part or so much of it as be consider and take to make a necessary part of he happiness all other good however great in reality or appearance excite not a man 's desire who look not on it to make a part of that happiness wherewith he in he present thought can satisfy himself happiness under this view every one constantly pursue and desire what make any part of it : other thing acknowledge to be good he can look upon without desire pass by and be content without there be nobody i think so senseless as to deny that there be pleasure in knowledge : and for the pleasure of sense they have too many follower to let it be question whether man be take with they or no now let one man place he satisfaction in sensual pleasure another in the delight of knowledge : though each of they can not but confess there be great pleasure in what the other pursue yet neither of they make the other 's delight a part of he happiness they desire be not move but each be satisfy without what the other enjoy and so he will be not determine to the pursuit of it but yet as soon as the studious man 's hunger and thirst make he uneasy he whose will be never determine to any pursuit of good cheer poignant sauce delicious wine by the pleasant taste he have find in they be by the uneasiness of hunger and thirst presently determine to eat and drink though possibly with great indifferency what wholesome food come in he way and on the other side the epicure buckle to study when shame or the desire to recommend himself to he mistress shall make he uneasy in the want of any sort of knowledge thus how much soever man be in earnest and constant in pursuit of happiness yet they may have a clear view of good great and confess good without be concern for it or move by it if they think they can make up they happiness without it though as to pain that they be always concern for they can feel no uneasiness without be move and therefore be uneasy in the want of whatever be judge necessary to they happiness as soon as any good appear to make a part of they portion of happiness they begin to desire it 45 why the greatest good be not always desire ` this i think any one may observe in himself and other -- that the greater visible good do not always raise man 's desire in proportion to the greatness it appear and be acknowledge to have : though every little trouble move we and set we on work to get rid of it the reason whereof be evident from the nature of we happiness and misery itself all present pain whatever it be make a part of we present misery : but all absent good do not at any time make a necessary part of we present happiness nor the absence of it make a part of we misery if it do we should be constantly and infinitely miserable there be infinite degree of happiness which be not in we possession all uneasiness therefore be remove a moderate portion of good serve at present to content man and a few degree of pleasure in a succession of ordinary enjoyment make up a happiness wherein they can be satisfy if this be not so there could be no room for those indifferent and visibly trifling action to which we will be so often determine and wherein we voluntarily waste so much of we life which remissness could by no means consist with a constant determination of will or desire to the greatest apparent good that this be so i think few people need go far from home to be convinced and indeed in this life there be not many whose happiness reach so far as to afford they a constant train of moderate mean pleasure without any mixture of uneasiness and yet they could be content to stay here for ever : though they can not deny but that it be possible there may be a state of eternal durable joy after this life far surpass all the good that be to be find here nay they can not but see that it be more possible than the attainment and continuation of that pittance of honor riches or pleasure which they pursue and for which they neglect that eternal state but yet in full view of this difference satisfied of the possibility of a perfect secure and lasting happiness in a future state and under a clear conviction that it be not to be have here -- whilst they bind they happiness within some little enjoyment or aim of this life and exclude the joy of heaven from make any necessary part of it -- they desire be not move by this greater apparent good nor they will determine to any action or endeavor for its attainment 46 why not be desire it move not the will the ordinary necessity of we life fill a great part of they with the uneasiness of hunger thirst heat cold weariness with labor and sleepiness in they constant return & c to which if besides accidental harm we add the fantastical uneasiness -lrb- as itch after honor power or riches & c -rrb- which acquire habit by fashion example and education have settle in we and a thousand other irregular desire which custom have make natural to we we shall find that a very little part of we life be so vacant from these uneasiness as to leave we free to the attraction of remoter absent good we be seldom at ease and free enough from the solicitation of we natural or adopt desire but a constant succession of uneasiness out of that stock which natural want or acquire habit have heap up take the will in they turn and no sooner be one action dispatch which by such a determination of the will we be set upon but another uneasiness be ready to set we on work for the remove of the pain we feel and be at present press with be the get out of misery and consequently the first thing to be do in order to happiness -- absent good though think on confess and appear to be good not make any part of this unhappiness in its absence be justle out to make way for the removal of those uneasiness we feel till due and repeated contemplation have bring it nearer to we mind give some relish of it and raise in we some desire : which then begin to make a part of we present uneasiness stand upon fair term with the rest to be satisfied and so accord to its greatness and pressure come in its turn to determine the will 47 due consideration raise desire and thus by a due consideration and examine any good propose it be in we power to raise we desire in a due proportion to the value of that good whereby in its turn and place it may come to work upon the will and be pursue for good though appear and allow ever so great yet till it have raise desire in we mind and thereby make we uneasy in its want it reach not we will we be not within the sphere of its activity we will be under the determination only of those uneasiness which be present to we which -lrb- whilst we have any -rrb- be always solicit and ready at hand to give the will its next determination the balancing when there be any in the mind be only which desire shall be next satisfied which uneasiness first remove whereby it come to pass that as long as any uneasiness any desire remain in we mind there be no room for good barely as such to come at the will or at all to determine it because as have be say the first step in we endeavor after happiness be to get wholly out of the confines of misery and to feel no part of it the will can be at leisure for nothing else till every uneasiness we feel be perfectly remove : which in the multitude of want and desire we be beset with in this imperfect state we be not like to be ever free from in this world 48 the power to suspend the prosecution of any desire make way for consideration there be in we a great many uneasiness always solicit and ready to determine the will it be natural as i have say that the greatest and most press should determine the will to the next action and so it do for the most part but not always for the mind have in most case as be evident in experience a power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desire and so all one after another be at liberty to consider the object of they examine they on all side and weigh they with other in this lie the liberty man have and from the not use of it right come all that variety of mistake error and fault which we run into in the conduct of we life and we endeavor after happiness whilst we precipitate the determination of we will and engage too soon before due examination to prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire as every one daily may experiment in himself this seem to I the source of all liberty in this seem to consist that which be -lrb- as i think improperly -rrb- call free-will for during this suspension of any desire before the will be determine to action and the action -lrb- which follow that determination -rrb- do we have opportunity to examine view and judge of the good or evil of what we be go to do and when upon due examination we have judge we have do we duty all that we can or ought to do in pursuit of we happiness and it be not a fault but a perfection of we nature to desire will and act accord to the last result of a fair examination 49 to be determine by we own judgment be no restraint to liberty this be so far from be a restraint or diminution of freedom that it be the very improvement and benefit of it it be not a abridgment it be the end and use of we liberty and the further we be remove from such a determination the nearer we be to misery and slavery a perfect indifference in the mind not determinable by its last judgment of the good or evil that be think to attend its choice would be so far from be a advantage and excellency of any intellectual nature that it would be as great a imperfection as the want of indifferency to act or not to act till determine by the will would be a imperfection on the other side a man be at liberty to lift up he hand to he head or let it rest quiet : he be perfectly indifferent in either and it would be a imperfection in he if he want that power if he be deprive of that indifferency but it would be as great a imperfection if he have the same indifferency whether he would prefer the lift up he hand or its remain in rest when it would save he head or eye from a blow he see come : it be as much a perfection that desire or the power of prefer should be determine by good as that the power of act should be determine by the will and the certainer such determination be the greater be the perfection nay be we determine by anything but the last result of we own mind judge of the good or evil of any action we be not free 50 the freest agent be so determine if we look upon those superior being above we who enjoy perfect happiness we shall have reason to judge that they be more steadily determine in they choice of good than we and yet we have no reason to think they be less happy or less free than we be and if it be fit for such poor finite creature as we be to pronounce what infinite wisdom and goodness could do i think we might say that god himself can not choose what be not good the freedom of the almighty hinder not he be determine by what be best 51 a constant determination to a pursuit of happiness no abridgment of liberty but to give a right view of this mistaken part of liberty let I ask -- would any one be a changele because he be less determine by wise consideration than a wise man be it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool and draw shame and misery upon a man 's self if to break loose from the conduct of reason and to want that restraint of examination and judgment which keep we from choose or do the worse be liberty true liberty madman and fool be the only freeman : but yet i think nobody would choose to be mad for the sake of such liberty but he that be mad already the constant desire of happiness and the constraint it put upon we to act for it nobody i think account a abridgment of liberty or at least a abridgment of liberty to be complain of god almighty himself be under the necessity of be happy and the more any intelligent being be so the nearer be its approach to infinite perfection and happiness that in this state of ignorance we short-sight creature might not mistake true felicity we be endowed with a power to suspend any particular desire and keep it from determine the will and engage we in action this be stand still where we be not sufficiently assure of the way : examination be consult a guide the determination of the will upon inquiry be follow the direction of that guide : and he that have a power to act or not to act accord as such determination direct be a free agent : such determination abridge not that power wherein liberty consist he that have he chain knock off and the prison door set open to he be perfectly at liberty because he may either go or stay as he best like though he preference be determine to stay by the darkness of the night or illness of the weather or want of other lodging he cease not to be free though the desire of some convenience to be have there absolutely determine he preference and make he stay in he prison 52 the necessity of pursue true happiness the foundation of liberty as therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lie in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness so the care of ourselves that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness be the necessary foundation of we liberty the stronger tie we have to a unalterable pursuit of happiness in general which be we greatest good and which as such we desire always follow the more be we free from any necessary determination of we will to any particular action and from a necessary compliance with we desire so upon any particular and then appear preferable good till we have duly examine whether it have a tendency to or be inconsistent with we real happiness : and therefore till we be as much inform upon this inquiry as the weight of the matter and the nature of the case demand we be by the necessity of prefer and pursue true happiness as we greatest good oblige to suspend the satisfaction of we desire in particular case 53 power to suspend this be the hinge on which turn the liberty of intellectual being in they constant endeavor after and a steady prosecution of true felicity -- that they can suspend this prosecution in particular case till they have look before they and inform themselves whether that particular thing which be then propose or desire lie in the way to they main end and make a real part of that which be they greatest good for the inclination and tendency of they nature to happiness be a obligation and motive to they to take care not to mistake or miss it and so necessarily put they upon caution deliberation and wariness in the direction of they particular action which be the means to obtain it whatever necessity determine to the pursuit of real bliss the same necessity with the same force establish suspense deliberation and scrutiny of each successive desire whether the satisfaction of it do not interfere with we true happiness and mislead we from it this as seem to I be the great privilege of finite intellectual being and i desire it may be well consider whether the great inlet and exercise of all the liberty man have be capable of or can be useful to they and that whereon depend the turn of they action do not lie in this -- that they can suspend they desire and stop they from determine they will to any action till they have duly and fairly examine the good and evil of it as far forth as the weight of the thing require this we be able to do and when we have do it we have do we duty and all that be in we power and indeed all that need for since the will suppose knowledge to guide its choice all that we can do be to hold we will undetermined till we have examine the good and evil of what we desire what follow after that follow in a chain of consequence link one to another all depend on the last determination of the judgment which whether it shall be upon a hasty and precipitate view or upon a due and mature examination be in we power experience show we that in most case we be able to suspend the present satisfaction of any desire 54 government of we passion the right improvement of liberty but if any extreme disturbance -lrb- as sometimes it happen -rrb- possess we whole mind as when the pain of the rack a impetuous uneasiness as of love anger or any other violent passion run away with we allow we not the liberty of thought and we be not master enough of we own mind to consider thoroughly and examine fairly -- god who know we frailty pity we weakness and require of we no more than we be able to do and see what be and what be not in we power will judge as a kind and merciful father but the forbearance of a too hasty compliance with we desire the moderation and restraint of we passion so that we understanding may be free to examine and reason unbiassed give its judgment be that whereon a right direction of we conduct to true happiness depend it be in this we should employ we chief care and endeavor in this we should take pain to suit the relish of we mind to the true intrinsic good or ill that be in thing and not permit a allow or suppose possible great and weighty good to slip out of we thought without leave any relish any desire of itself there till by a due consideration of its true worth we have form appetite in we mind suitable to it and make ourselves uneasy in the want of it or in the fear of lose it and how much this be in every one 's power by make resolution to himself such as he may keep be easy for every one to try nor let any one say he can not govern he passion nor hinder they from break out and carry he into action for what he can do before a prince or a great man he can do alone or in the presence of god if he will 55 how man come to pursue different and often evil course from what have be say it be easy to give a account how it come to pass that though all man desire happiness yet they will carry they so contrarily and consequently some of they to what be evil and to this i say that the various and contrary choice that man make in the world do not argue that they do not all pursue good but that the same thing be not good to every man alike this variety of pursuit show that every one do not place he happiness in the same thing or choose the same way to it be all the concern of man terminate in this life why one follow study and knowledge and another hawk and hunting : why one choose luxury and debauchery and another sobriety and riches would not be because every one of these do not aim at he own happiness but because they happiness be place in different thing and therefore it be a right answer of the physician to he patient that have sore eye : -- if you have more pleasure in the taste of wine than in the use of you sight wine be good for you but if the pleasure of see be greater to you than that of drinking wine be naught 56 all man seek happiness but not of the same sort the mind have a different relish as well as the palate and you will as fruitlessly endeavor to delight all man with riches or glory -lrb- which yet some man place they happiness in -rrb- as you would to satisfy all man 's hunger with cheese or lobster which though very agreeable and delicious fare to some be to other extremely nauseous and offensive : and many person would with reason prefer the griping of a hungry belly to those dish which be a feast to other hence it be i think that the philosopher of old do in vain inquire whether summum bonum consist in riches or bodily delight or virtue or contemplation : and they might have as reasonably dispute whether the best relish be to be find in apple plum or nut and have divide themselves into sect upon it for as pleasant taste depend not on the thing themselves but on they agreeableness to this or that particular palate wherein there be great variety so the greatest happiness consist in the have those thing which produce the greatest pleasure and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance any pain now these to different man be very different thing if therefore man in this life only have hope if in this life only they can enjoy it be not strange nor unreasonable that they should seek they happiness by avoid all thing that disease they here and by pursue all that delight they wherein it will be no wonder to find variety and difference for if there be no prospect beyond the grave the inference be certainly right -- ` let we eat and drink ' let we enjoy what we delight in ` for to-morrow we shall die ' this i think may serve to show we the reason why though all man 's desire tend to happiness yet they be not move by the same object man may choose different thing and yet all choose right suppose they only like a company of poor insect whereof some be bee delighted with flower and they sweetness other beetle delighted with other kind of viand which have enjoy for a season they would cease to be and exist no more for ever 57 -lrb- not in early edition -rrb- 58 why man choose what make they miserable what have be say may also discover to we the reason why man in this world prefer different thing and pursue happiness by contrary course but yet since man be always constant and in earnest in matter of happiness and misery the question still remain how man come often to prefer the worse to the better and to choose that which by they own confession have make they miserable 59 the cause of this to account for the various and contrary way man take though all aim at be happy we must consider whence the various uneasiness that determine the will in the preference of each voluntary action have they rise : -- 1 from bodily pain some of they come from cause not in we power such as be often the pain of the body from want disease or outward injury as the rack etc which when present and violent operate for the most part forcibly on the will and turn the course of man 's life from virtue piety and religion and what before they judge to lead to happiness every one not endeavor or not be able by the contemplation of remote and future good to raise in himself desire of they strong enough to counterbalance the uneasiness he feel in those bodily torment and to keep he will steady in the choice of those action which lead to future happiness a neighbouring country have be of late a tragical theater from which we might fetch instance if there need any and the world do not in all country and age furnish example enough to confirm that receive observation : necessita cogit ad turpium and therefore there be great reason for we to pray ` lead we not into temptation ' 2 from wrong desire arise from wrong judgment other uneasiness arise from we desire of absent good which desire always bear proportion to and depend on the judgment we make and the relish we have of any absent good in both which we be apt to be variously mislead and that by we own fault 60 we judgment of present good or evil always right in the first place i shall consider the wrong judgment man make of future good and evil whereby they desire be mislead for as to present happiness and misery when that alone come into consideration and the consequence be quite remove a man never choose amiss : he know what best please he and that he actually prefer thing in they present enjoyment be what they seem : the apparent and real good be in this case always the same for the pain or pleasure be just so great and no greater than it be feel the present good or evil be really so much as it appear and therefore be every action of ours conclude within itself and draw no consequence after it we should undoubtedly never err in we choice of good : we should always infallibly prefer the best be the pain of honest industry and of starve with hunger and cold set together before we nobody would be in doubt which to choose : be the satisfaction of a lust and the joy of heaven offer at once to any one 's present possession he would not balance or err in the determination of he choice 61 we wrong judgment have regard to future good and evil only but since we voluntary action carry not all the happiness and misery that depend on they along with they in they present performance but be the precedent cause of good and evil which they draw after they and bring upon we when they themselves be past and cease to be we desire look beyond we present enjoyment and carry the mind out to absent good accord to the necessity which we think there be of it to the making or increase of we happiness it be we opinion of such a necessity that give it its attraction : without that we be not move by absent good for in this narrow scantling of capacity which we be accustom to and sensible of here wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once which when all uneasiness be away be whilst it last sufficient to make we think ourselves happy it be not all remote and even apparent good that affect we because the indolency and enjoyment we have suffice for we present happiness we desire not to venture the change since we judge that we be happy already be content and that be enough for who be content be happy but as soon as any new uneasiness come in this happiness be disturbed and we be set afresh on work in the pursuit of happiness 62 from a wrong judgment of what make a necessary part of they happiness they aptness therefore to conclude that they can be happy without it be one great occasion that man often be not raise to the desire of the greatest absent good for whilst such thought possess they the joy of a future state move they not they have little concern or uneasiness about they and the will free from the determination of such desire be leave to the pursuit of nearer satisfaction and to the removal of those uneasiness which it then feel in its want of any longing after they change but a man 's view of these thing let he see that virtue and religion be necessary to he happiness let he look into the future state of bliss or misery and see there god the righteous judge ready to ` render to every man accord to he deed to they who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life but unto every soul that doth evil indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish ' to he i say who have a prospect of the different state of perfect happiness or misery that attend all man after this life depend on they behavior here the measure of good and evil that govern he choice be mightily change for since nothing of pleasure and pain in this life can bear any proportion to the endless happiness or exquisite misery of a immortal soul hereafter action in he power will have they preference not accord to the transient pleasure or pain that accompany or follow they here but as they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter 63 a more particular account of wrong judgment but to account more particularly for the misery that man often bring on themselves notwithstanding that they do all in earnest pursue happiness we must consider how thing come to be represent to we desire under deceitful appearance : and that be by the judgment pronounce wrongly concern they to see how far this reach and what be the cause of wrong judgment we must remember that thing be judge good or bad in a double sense : -- first that which be properly good or bad be nothing but barely pleasure or pain secondly but because not only present pleasure and pain but that also which be apt by its efficacy or consequence to bring it upon we at a distance be a proper object of we desire and apt to move a creature that have foresight therefore thing also that draw after they pleasure and pain be consider as good and evil 64 no one choose misery willingly but only by wrong judgment the wrong judgment that mislead we and make the will often fasten on the worse side lie in misreport upon the various comparison of these the wrong judgment i be here speak of be not what one man may think of the determination of another but what every man himself must confess to be wrong for since i lay it for a certain ground that every intelligent be really seek happiness which consist in the enjoyment of pleasure without any considerable mixture of uneasiness it be impossible any one should willingly put into he own draught any bitter ingredient or leave out anything in he power that would tend to he satisfaction and the complete of he happiness but only by a wrong judgment i shall not here speak of that mistake which be the consequence of invincible error which scarce deserve the name of wrong judgment but of that wrong judgment which every man himself must confess to be so 65 man may err on compare present and future -lrb- i -rrb- therefore as to present pleasure and pain the mind as have be say never mistake that which be really good or evil that which be the greater pleasure or the greater pain be really just as it appear but though present pleasure and pain show they difference and degree so plainly as not to leave room to mistake yet when we compare present pleasure or pain with future -lrb- which be usually the case in most important determination of the will -rrb- we often make wrong judgment of they take we measure of they in different position of distance object near we view be apt to be think greater than those of a larger size that be more remote and so it be with pleasure and pain : the present be apt to carry it and those at a distance have the disadvantage in the comparison thus most man like spendthrift heir be apt to judge a little in hand better than a great deal to come and so for small matter in possession part with greater one in reversion but that this be a wrong judgment every one must allow let he pleasure consist in whatever it will : since that which be future will certainly come to be present and then have the same advantage of nearness will show itself in its full dimension and discover he wilful mistake who judge of it by unequal measure be the pleasure of drinking accompany the very moment a man take off he glass with that sick stomach and ache head which in some man be sure to follow not many hour after i think nobody whatever pleasure he have in he cup would on these condition ever let wine touch he lip which yet he daily swallow and the evil side come to be choose only by the fallacy of a little difference in time but if pleasure or pain can be so lessen only by a few hour ' removal how much more will it be so by a further distance to a man that will not by a right judgment do what time will i e bring it home upon himself and consider it as present and there take its true dimension this be the way we usually impose on ourselves in respect of bare pleasure and pain or the true degree of happiness or misery : the future lose its just proportion and what be present obtain the preference as the greater i mention not here the wrong judgment whereby the absent be not only lessen but reduce to perfect nothing when man enjoy what they can in present and make sure of that conclude amiss that no evil will thence follow for that lie not in compare the greatness of future good and evil which be that we be here speak of but in another sort of wrong judgment which be concern good or evil as it be consider to be the cause and procurement of pleasure or pain that will follow from it 66 cause of we judge amiss when we compare present pleasure and pain with future the cause of we judge amiss when we compare we present pleasure or pain with future seem to I to be the weak and narrow constitution of we mind we can not well enjoy two pleasure at once much less any pleasure almost whilst pain possess we the present pleasure if it be not very languid and almost none at all fill we narrow soul and so take up the whole mind that it scarce leave any thought of thing absent : or if among we pleasure there be some which be not strong enough to exclude the consideration of thing at a distance yet we have so great a abhorrence of pain that a little of it extinguish all we pleasure a little bitter mingle in we cup leave no relish of the sweet hence it come that at any rate we desire to be rid of the present evil which we be apt to think nothing absent can equal because under the present pain we find not ourselves capable of any the least degree of happiness man 's daily complaint be a loud proof of this : the pain that any one actually feel be still of all other the worst and it be with anguish they cry out -- ` any rather than this : nothing can be so intolerable as what i now suffer ' and therefore we whole endeavor and thought be intent to get rid of the present evil before all thing as the first necessary condition to we happiness let what will follow nothing as we passionately think can exceed or almost equal the uneasiness that sit so heavy upon we and because the abstinence from a present pleasure that offer itself be a pain nay oftentimes a very great one the desire be inflamed by a near and tempting object it be no wonder that that operate after the same manner pain do and lessen in we thought what be future and so force we as it be blindfold into its embrace 67 absent good unable to counterbalance present uneasiness add to this that absent good or which be the same thing future pleasure -- especially if of a sort we be unacquainted with -- seldom be able to counterbalance any uneasiness either of pain or desire which be present for its greatness be no more than what shall be really taste when enjoy man be apt enough to lessen that to make it give place to any present desire and conclude with themselves that when it come to trial it may possibly not answer the report or opinion that generally pass of it : they have often find that not only what other have magnify but even what they themselves have enjoy with great pleasure and delight at one time have prove insipid or nauseous at another and therefore they see nothing in it for which they should forego a present enjoyment but that this be a false way of judge when apply to the happiness of another life they must confess unless they will say god can not make those happy he design to be so for that be intend for a state of happiness it must certainly be agreeable to every one 's wish and desire : could we suppose they relish as different there as they be here yet the manna in heaven will suit every one 's palate thus much of the wrong judgment we make of present and future pleasure and pain when they be compare together and so the absent consider as future 68 wrong judgment in consider consequence of action -lrb- ii -rrb- as to thing good or bad in they consequence and by the aptness that be in they to procure we good or evil in the future we judge amiss several way 1 when we judge that so much evil do not really depend on they as in truth there do 2 when we judge that though the consequence be of that moment yet it be not of that certainty but that it may otherwise fall out or else by some means be avoid as by industry address change repentance & c that these be wrong way of judge be easy to show in every particular if i would examine they at large singly : but i shall only mention this in general viz that it be a very wrong and irrational way of proceed to venture a greater good for a less upon uncertain guess and before a due examination be make proportionable to the weightiness of the matter and the concernment it be to we not to mistake this i think every one must confess especially if he consider the usual cause of this wrong judgment whereof these follow be some : -- 69 cause of this -lrb- i -rrb- ignorance : he that judge without inform himself to the utmost that he be capable can not acquit himself of judge amiss -lrb- ii -rrb- inadvertency : when a man overlook even that which he do know this be a affected and present ignorance which mislead we judgment as much as the other judge be as it be balance a account and determine on which side the odds lie if therefore either side be huddle up in haste and several of the sum that should have go into the reckoning be overlook and leave out this precipitancy cause as wrong a judgment as if it be a perfect ignorance that which most commonly cause this be the prevalency of some present pleasure or pain heighten by we feeble passionate nature most strongly work on by what be present to check this precipitancy we understanding and reason be give we if we will make a right use of they to search and see and then judge thereupon how much sloth and negligence heat and passion the prevalency of fashion or acquire indisposition do severally contribute on occasion to these wrong judgment i shall not here further inquire i shall only add one other false judgment which i think necessary to mention because perhaps it be little take notice of though of great influence 70 wrong judgment of what be necessary to we happiness all man desire happiness that be past doubt : but as have be already observe when they be rid of pain they be apt to take up with any pleasure at hand or that custom have endear to they to rest satisfied in that and so be happy till some new desire by make they uneasy disturb that happiness and show they that they be not so they look no further nor be the will determine to any action in pursuit of any other known or apparent good for since we find that we can not enjoy all sort of good but one exclude another we do not fix we desire on every apparent greater good unless it be judge to be necessary to we happiness : if we think we can be happy without it it move we not this be another occasion to man of judge wrong when they take not that to be necessary to they happiness which really be so this mistake mislead we both in the choice of the good we aim at and very often in the means to it when it be a remote good but which way ever it be either by place it where really it be not or by neglect the means as not necessary to it -- when a man miss he great end happiness he will acknowledge he judge not right that which contribute to this mistake be the real or suppose unpleasantness of the action which be the way to this end it seem so preposterous a thing to man to make themselves unhappy in order to happiness that they do not easily bring themselves to it 71 we can change the agreeableness or disagreeableness in thing the last inquiry therefore concern this matter be -- whether it be in a man 's power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accompany any sort of action and as to that it be plain in many case he can man may and should correct they palate and give relish to what either have or they suppose have none the relish of the mind be as various as that of the body and like that too may be alter and it be a mistake to think that man can not change the displeasingness or indifferency that be in action into pleasure and desire if they will do but what be in they power a due consideration will do it in some case and practice application and custom in most bread or tobacco may be neglect where they be show to be useful to health because of a indifferency or disrelish to they reason and consideration at first recommend and begin they trial and use find or custom make they pleasant that this be so in virtue too be very certain action be please or displease either in themselves or consider as a means to a greater and more desirable end the eating of a well-seasoned dish suit to a man 's palate may move the mind by the delight itself that accompany the eating without reference to any other end to which the consideration of the pleasure there be in health and strength -lrb- to which that meat be subservient -rrb- may add a new gusto able to make we swallow a ill-relished potion in the latter of these any action be render more or less please only by the contemplation of the end and the be more or less persuade of its tendency to it or necessary connexion with it : but the pleasure of the action itself be best acquire or increase by use and practice trial often reconcile we to that which at a distance we look on with aversion and by repetition wear we into a liking of what possibly in the first essay displeased we habit have powerful charm and put so strong attraction of easiness and pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to that we can not forbear to do or at least be easy in the omission of action which habitual practice have suit and thereby recommend to we though this be very visible and every one 's experience show he he can do so yet it be a part in the conduct of man towards they happiness neglect to a degree that it will be possibly entertain as a paradox if it be say that man can make thing or action more or less please to themselves and thereby remedy that to which one may justly impute a great deal of they wander fashion and the common opinion have settle wrong notion and education and custom ill habit the just value of thing be misplace and the palate of man corrupt pain should be take to rectify these and contrary habit change we pleasure and give a relish to that which be necessary or conducive to we happiness this every one must confess he can do and when happiness be lose and misery overtake he he will confess he do amiss in neglect it and condemn himself for it and i ask every one whether he have not often do so 72 preference of vice to virtue a manifest wrong judgment i shall not now enlarge any further on the wrong judgment and neglect of what be in they power whereby man mislead themselves this would make a volume and be not my business but whatever false notion or shameful neglect of what be in they power may put man out of they way to happiness and distract they as we see into so different course of life this yet be certain that morality establish upon its true foundation can not but determine the choice in any one that will but consider : and he that will not be so far a rational creature as to reflect seriously upon infinite happiness and misery must need condemn himself as not make that use of he understanding he should the reward and punishment of another life which the almighty have establish as the enforcement of he law be of weight enough to determine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can show where the eternal state be consider but in its bare possibility which nobody can make any doubt of he that will allow exquisite and endless happiness to be but the possible consequence of a good life here and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one must own himself to judge very much amiss if he do not conclude -- that a virtuous life with the certain expectation of everlasting bliss which may come be to be prefer to a vicious one with the fear of that dreadful state of misery which it be very possible may overtake the guilty or at best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation this be evidently so though the virtuous life here have nothing but pain and the vicious continual pleasure : which yet be for the most part quite otherwise and wicked man have not much the odds to brag of even in they present possession nay all thing rightly consider have i think even the worse part here but when infinite happiness be put into one scale against infinite misery in the other if the worst that come to the pious man if he mistake be the best that the wicked can attain to if he be in the right who can without madness run the venture who in he wit would choose to come within a possibility of infinite misery which if he miss there be yet nothing to be get by that hazard whereas on the other side the sober man venture nothing against infinite happiness to be get if he expectation come not to pass if the good man be in the right he be eternally happy if he mistake he be not miserable he feel nothing on the other side if the wicked man be in the right he be not happy if he mistake he be infinitely miserable must it not be a most manifest wrong judgment that do not presently see to which side in this case the preference be to be give i have forbear to mention anything of the certainty or probability of a future state design here to show the wrong judgment that any one must allow he make upon he own principle lay how he please who prefer the short pleasure of a vicious life upon any consideration whilst he know and can not but be certain that a future life be at least possible 73 recapitulation -- liberty of indifferency to conclude this inquiry into human liberty which as it stand before i myself from the beginning fear and a very judicious friend of mine since the publication suspect to have some mistake in it though he could not particularly show it I i be put upon a stricter review of this chapter wherein lighting upon a very easy and scarce observable slip i have make in put one seemingly indifferent word for another that discovery open to I this present view which here in this second edition i submit to the learn world and which in short be this : liberty be a power to act or not to act accord as the mind direct a power to direct the operative faculty to motion or rest in particular instance be that which we call the will that which in the train of we voluntary action determine the will to any change of operation be some present uneasiness which be or at least be always accompany with that of desire desire be always move by evil to fly it : because a total freedom from pain always make a necessary part of we happiness : but every good nay every greater good do not constantly move desire because it may not make or may not be take to make any necessary part of we happiness for all that we desire be only to be happy but though this general desire of happiness operate constantly and invariably yet the satisfaction of any particular desire can be suspend from determine the will to any subservient action till we have maturely examine whether the particular apparent good which we then desire make a part of we real happiness or be consistent or inconsistent with it the result of we judgment upon that examination be what ultimately determine the man who could not be free if he will be determine by anything but he own desire guide by he own judgment 74 active and passive power in motion and in think true notion concern the nature and extent of liberty be of so great importance that i hope i shall be pardon this digression which my attempt to explain it have lead I into the idea of will volition liberty and necessity in this chapter of power come naturally in my way in a former edition of this treatise i give a account of my thought concern they accord to the light i then have and now as a lover of truth and not a worshipper of my own doctrine i own some change of my opinion which i think i have discover ground for in what i first writ i with a unbiassed indifferency follow truth whither i think she lead I but neither be so vain as to fancy infallibility nor so disingenuous as to dissemble my mistake for fear of blemish my reputation i have with the same sincere design for truth only not be ashamed to publish what a severer inquiry have suggest it be not impossible but that some may think my former notion right and some -lrb- as i have already find -rrb- these latter and some neither i shall not at all wonder at this variety in man 's opinion : impartial deduction of reason in controvert point be so rare and exact one in abstract notion not so very easy especially if of any length and therefore i should think myself not a little beholden to any one who would upon these or any other grounds fairly clear this subject of liberty from any difficulty that may yet remain 75 summary of we original idea and thus i have in a short draught give a view of we original idea from whence all the rest be derive and of which they be make up which if i would consider as a philosopher and examine on what cause they depend and of what they be make i believe they all might be reduce to these very few primary and original one viz extension solidity mobility or the power of be move which by we sens we receive from body : perceptivity or the power of perception or think motivity or the power of move : which by reflection we receive from we mind i crave leave to make use of these two new word to avoid the danger of be mistake in the use of those which be equivocal to which if we add existence duration number which belong both to the one and the other we have perhaps all the original idea on which the rest depend for by these i imagine might be explain the nature of color sound taste smell and all other idea we have if we have but faculty acute enough to perceive the severally modify extension and motion of these minute body which produce those several sensation in we but my present purpose be only to inquire into the knowledge the mind have of thing by those idea and appearance which god have fit it to receive from they and how the mind come by that knowledge rather than into they cause or manner of production i shall not contrary to the design of this essay see myself to inquire philosophically into the peculiar constitution of body and the configuration of part whereby they have the power to produce in we the idea of they sensible quality i shall not enter any further into that disquisition it sufficing to my purpose to observe that gold or saffron have power to produce in we the idea of yellow and snow or milk the idea of white which we can only have by we sight without examine the texture of the part of those body or the particular figure or motion of the particle which rebind from they to cause in we that particular sensation though when we go beyond the bare idea in we mind and would inquire into they cause we can not conceive anything else to be in any sensible object whereby it produce different idea in we but the different bulk figure number texture and motion of its insensible part chapter xxii of mixed mode 1 mixed mode what have treat of simple mode in the foregoing chapter and give several instance of some of the most considerable of they to show what they be and how we come by they we be now in the next place to consider those we call mixed mode such be the complex idea we mark by the name obligation drunkenness a lie & c which consist of several combination of simple idea of different kind i have call mixed mode to distinguish they from the more simple mode which consist only of simple idea of the same kind these mixed mode be also such combination of simple idea as be not look upon to be characteristical mark of any real being that have a steady existence but scatter and independent idea put together by the mind be thereby distinguish from the complex idea of substance 2 make by the mind that the mind in respect of its simple idea be wholly passive and receive they all from the existence and operation of thing such as sensation or reflection offer they without be able to make any one idea experience show we but if we attentively consider these idea i call mixed mode we be now speak of we shall find they origin quite different the mind often exercise a active power in make these several combination for it be once furnish with simple idea it can put they together in several composition and so make variety of complex idea without examine whether they exist so together in nature and hence i think it be that these idea be call notion : as they have they original and constant existence more in the thought of man than in the reality of thing and to form such idea it suffice that the mind put the part of they together and that they be consistent in the understanding without consider whether they have any real being : though i do not deny but several of they might be take from observation and the existence of several simple idea so combine as they be put together in the understanding for the man who first frame the idea of hypocrisy might have either take it at first from the observation of one who make show of good quality which he have not or else have frame that idea in he mind without have any such pattern to fashion it by for it be evident that in the beginning of language and society of man several of those complex idea which be consequent to the constitution establish amongst they must need have be in the mind of man before they exist anywhere else and that many name that stand for such complex idea be in use and so those idea frame before the combination they stand for ever exist 3 sometimes get by the explication of they name indeed now that language be make and abound with word stand for such combination a usual way of get these complex idea be by the explication of those term that stand for they for consist of a company of simple idea combine they may by word stand for those simple idea be represent to the mind of one who understand those word though that complex combination of simple idea be never offer to he mind by the real existence of thing thus a man may come to have the idea of sacrilege or murder by enumerate to he the simple idea which these word stand for without ever see either of they committed 4 the name tie the part of mixed mode into one idea every mixed mode consist of many distinct simple idea it seem reasonable to inquire whence it have its unity and how such a precise multitude come to make but one idea since that combination do not always exist together in nature to which i answer it be plain it have its unity from a act of the mind combine those several simple idea together and consider they as one complex one consist of those part and the mark of this union or that which be look on generally to complete it be one name give to that combination for it be by they name that man commonly regulate they account of they distinct species of mixed mode seldom allow or consider any number of simple idea to make one complex one but such collection as there be name for thus though the killing of a old man be as fit in nature to be unite into one complex idea as the kill a man 's father yet there be no name standing precisely for the one as there be the name of parricide to mark the other it be not take for a particular complex idea nor a distinct species of action from that of kill a young man or any other man 5 the cause of make mixed mode if we should inquire a little further to see what it be that occasion man to make several combination of simple idea into distinct and as it be settle mode and neglect other which in the nature of thing themselves have as much a aptness to be combine and make distinct idea we shall find the reason of it to be the end of language which be to mark or communicate man 's thought to one another with all the dispatch that may be they usually make such collection of idea into complex mode and affix name to they as they have frequent use of in they way of living and conversation leave other which they have but seldom a occasion to mention loose and without name that tie they together : they rather choose to enumerate -lrb- when they have need -rrb- such idea as make they up by the particular name that stand for they than to trouble they memory by multiply of complex idea with name to they which they seldom or never have any occasion to make use of 6 why word in one language have none answering in another this show we how it come to pass that there be in every language many particular word which can not be render by any one single word of another for the several fashion custom and manners of one nation make several combination of idea familiar and necessary in one which another people have have never a occasion to make or perhaps so much as take notice of name come of course to be annex to they to avoid long periphrase in thing of daily conversation and so they become so many distinct complex idea in they mind thus ostrakismo amongst the greek and proscriptio amongst the roman be word which other language have no name that exactly answer because they stand for complex idea which be not in the mind of the man of other nation where there be no such custom there be no notion of any such action no use of such combination of idea as be unite and as it be tie together by those term : and therefore in other country there be no name for they 7 and language change hence also we may see the reason why language constantly change take up new and lay by old term because change of custom and opinion bring with it new combination of idea which it be necessary frequently to think on and talk about new name to avoid long description be annex to they and so they become new species of complex mode what a number of different idea be by this mean wrap up in one short sound and how much of we time and breath be thereby save any one will see who will but take the pain to enumerate all the idea that either reprieve or appeal stand for and instead of either of those name use a periphrasis to make any one understand they meaning 8 mixed mode though i shall have occasion to consider this more at-large when i come to treat of word and they use yet i could not avoid to take thus much notice here of the name of mixed mode which be fleeting and transient combination of simple idea which have but a short existence anywhere but in the mind of man and there too have no longer any existence than whilst they be think on have not so much anywhere the appearance of a constant and lasting existence as in they name : which be therefore in this sort of idea very apt to be take for the idea themselves for if we should inquire where the idea of a triumph or apotheosis exist it be evident they could neither of they exist altogether anywhere in the thing themselves be action that require time to they performance and so could never all exist together and as to the mind of man where the idea of these action be suppose to be lodge they have there too a very uncertain existence : and therefore we be apt to annex they to the name that excite they in we 9 how we get the idea of mixed mode there be therefore three way whereby we get these complex idea of mixed mode : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- by experience and observation of thing themselves : thus by see two man mixed wrestle or fence we get the idea of wrestling or fencing -lrb- 2 -rrb- by invention or voluntary put together of several simple idea in we own mind : so he that first invent printing or etching have a idea of it in he mind before it ever exist -lrb- 3 -rrb- which be the most usual way by explain the name of action we never see or motion we can not see and by enumerate and thereby as it be set before we imagination all those idea which go to the make they up and be the constituent part of they for have by sensation and reflection store we mind with simple idea and by use get the name that stand for they we can by those means represent to another any complex idea we would have he conceive so that it have in it no simple idea but what he know and have with we the same name for for all we complex idea be ultimately resolvable into simple idea of which they be compound and originally make up though perhaps they immediate ingredient as i may so say be also complex idea thus the mixed mode which the word lie stand for be make of these simple idea : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- articulate sound -lrb- 2 -rrb- certain idea in the mind of the speaker -lrb- 3 -rrb- those word the sign of those idea -lrb- 4 -rrb- those sign put together by affirmation or negation otherwise than the idea they stand for be in the mind of the speaker i think i need not go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie : what i have say be enough to show that it be make up of simple idea and it could not be but a offensive tediousness to my reader to trouble he with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple idea that go to this complex one which from what have be say he can not but be able to make out to himself the same may be do in all we complex idea whatsoever which however compound and decompound may at last be resolve into simple idea which be all the material of knowledge or thought we have or can have nor shall we have reason to fear that the mind be hereby stint to too scanty a number of idea if we consider what a inexhaustible stock of simple mode number and figure alone afford we how far then mixed mode which admit of the various combination of different simple idea and they infinite mode be from be few and scanty we may easily imagine so that before we have do we shall see that nobody need be afraid he shall not have scope and compass enough for he thought to range in though they be as i pretend confine only to simple idea receive from sensation or reflection and they several combination 10 motion thinking and power have be most modify it be worth we observe which of all we simple idea have be most modify and have most mixed idea make out of they with name give to they and those have be these three : -- think and motion -lrb- which be the two idea which comprehend in they all action -rrb- and power from whence these action be conceive to flow these simple idea i say of think motion and power have be those which have be most modify and out of whose modification have be make most complex mode with name to they for action be the great business of mankind and the whole matter about which all law be conversant it be no wonder that the several mode of think and motion should be take notice of the idea of they observe and lay up in the memory and have name assign to they without which law could be but ill make or vice and disorder repress nor could any communication be well have amongst man without such complex idea with name to they : and therefore man have settle name and suppose settle idea in they mind of mode of action distinguish by they cause mean object end instrument time place and other circumstance and also of they power fit for those action : vg boldness be the power to speak or do what we intend before other without fear or disorder and the greek call the confidence of speaking by a peculiar name -lrb- word in greek -rrb- : which power or ability in man of do anything when it have be acquire by frequent do the same thing be that idea we name habit when it be forward and ready upon every occasion to break into action we call it disposition thus testiness be a disposition or aptness to be angry to conclude : let we examine any mode of action vg consideration and assent which be action of the mind run and speak which be action of the body revenge and murder which be action of both together and we shall find they but so many collection of simple idea which together make up the complex one signify by those name 11 several word seem to signify action signify but the effect power be the source from whence all action proceed the substance wherein these power be when they \* -lrb- lose line -rrb- exert this power into act be call cause and the substance which thereupon be produce or the simple idea which be introduce into any subject by the exert of that power be call effect the efficacy whereby the new substance or idea be produce be call in the subject exert that power action but in the subject wherein any simple idea be change or produce it be call passion : which efficacy however various and the effect almost infinite yet we can i think conceive it in intellectual agent to be nothing else but mode of think and willing in corporeal agent nothing else but modification of motion i say i think we can not conceive it to be any other but these two for whatever sort of action besides these produce any effect i confess myself to have no notion nor idea of and so it be quite remote from my thought apprehension and knowledge and as much in the dark to I as five other sens or as the idea of color to a blind man and therefore many word which seem to express some action signify nothing of the action or modus operandus at all but barely the effect with some circumstance of the subject work on or cause operating : vg creation annihilation contain in they no idea of the action or manner whereby they be produce but barely of the cause and the thing do and when a countryman say the cold freeze water though the word freezing seem to import some action yet truly it signify nothing but the effect viz that water that be before fluid be become hard and consistent without contain any idea of the action whereby it be do 12 mixed mode make also of other idea than those of power and action i think i shall not need to remark here that though power and action make the greatest part of mixed mode mark by name and familiar in the mind and mouth of man yet other simple idea and they several combination be not exclude : much less i think will it be necessary for I to enumerate all the mixed mode which have be settle with name to they that would be to make a dictionary of the greatest part of the word make use of in divinity ethic law and politics and several other science all that be requisite to my present design be to show what sort of idea those be which i call mixed mode how the mind come by they and that they be composition make up of simple idea get from sensation and reflection which i suppose i have do chapter xxiii of we complex idea of substance the mind be as i have declare furnished with a great number of the simple idea convey in by the sens as they be find in exterior thing or by reflection on its own operation take notice also that a certain number of these simple idea go constantly together which be presume to belong to one thing and word be suit to common apprehension and make use of for quick dispatch be call so unite in one subject by one name which by inadvertency we be apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea which indeed be a complication of many idea together : because as i have say not imagine how these simple idea can subsist by themselves we accustom ourselves to suppose some substratum wherein they do subsist and from which they do result which therefore we call substance 2 we obscure idea of substance in general so that if any one will examine himself concern he notion of pure substance in general he will find he have no other idea of it at all but only a supposition of he know not what support of such quality which be capable of produce simple idea in we which quality be commonly call accident if any one should be ask what be the subject wherein color or weight inhere he would have nothing to say but the solid extended part and if he be demand what be it that solidity and extension adhere in he would not be in a much better case than the indian before mention who say that the world be support by a great elephant be ask what the elephant rest on to which he answer be -- a great tortoise : but be again press to know what give support to the broad-backed tortoise reply -- something he know not what and thus here as in all other case where we use word without have clear and distinct idea we talk like child : who be question what such a thing be which they know not readily give this satisfactory answer that it be something : which in truth signify no more when so use either by child or man but that they know not what and that the thing they pretend to know and talk of be what they have no distinct idea of at all and so be perfectly ignorant of it and in the dark the idea then we have to which we give the general name substance be nothing but the suppose but unknown support of those quality we find exist which we imagine can not subsist sine re substante without something to support they we call that support substantium which accord to the true import of the word be in plain english standing under or uphold 3 of the sort of substance a obscure and relative idea of substance in general be thus make we come to have the idea of particular sort of substance by collect such combination of simple idea as be by experience and observation of man 's sens take notice of to exist together and be therefore suppose to flow from the particular internal constitution or unknown essence of that substance thus we come to have the idea of a man horse gold water & c of which substance whether any one have any other clear idea further than of certain simple idea co-existent together i appeal to every one 's own experience it be the ordinary quality observable in iron or a diamond put together that make the true complex idea of those substance which a smith or a jeweller commonly know better than a philosopher who whatever substantial form he may talk of have no other idea of those substance than what be frame by a collection of those simple idea which be to be find in they : only we must take notice that we complex idea of substance besides all those simple idea they be make up of have always the confused idea of something to which they belong and in which they subsist : and therefore when we speak of any sort of substance we say it be a thing have such or such quality as body be a thing that be extend figure and capable of motion spirit a thing capable of think and so hardness friability and power to draw iron we say be quality to be find in a loadstone these and the like fashion of speak intimate that the substance be suppose always something besides the extension figure solidity motion thinking or other observable idea though we know not what it be 4 no clear or distinct idea of substance in general hence when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substance as horse stone & c though the idea we have of either of they be but the complication or collection of those several simple idea of sensible quality which we use to find unite in the thing call horse or stone yet because we can not conceive how they should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose they exist in and support by some common subject which support we denote by the name substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support 5 as clear a idea of spiritual substance as of corporeal substance the same thing happen concern the operation of the mind viz think reasoning fear & c which we conclude not to subsist of themselves nor apprehend how they can belong to body or be produce by it we be apt to think these the action of some other substance which we call spirit whereby yet it be evident that have no other idea or notion of matter but something wherein those many sensible quality which affect we sens do subsist by suppose a substance wherein think know doubt and a power of move & c do subsist we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body the one be suppose to be -lrb- without know what it be -rrb- the substratum to those simple idea we have from without and the other suppose -lrb- with a like ignorance of what it be -rrb- to be the substratum to those operation we experiment in ourselves within it be plain then that the idea of corporeal substance in matter be as remote from we conception and apprehension as that of spiritual substance or spirit : and therefore from we not have any notion of the substance of spirit we can no more conclude its non-existence than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body it be as rational to affirm there be no body because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter as to say there be no spirit because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of a spirit 6 we idea of particular sort of substance whatever therefore be the secret abstract nature of substance in general all the idea we have of particular distinct sort of substance be nothing but several combination of simple idea co-exist in such though unknown cause of they union as make the whole subsist of itself it be by such combination of simple idea and nothing else that we represent particular sort of substance to ourselves such be the idea we have of they several species in we mind and such only do we by they specific name signify to other vg man horse sun water iron : upon hearing which word every one who understand the language frame in he mind a combination of those several simple idea which he have usually observe or fancy to exist together under that denomination all which he suppose to rest in and be as it be adherent to that unknown common subject which inhere not in anything else though in the meantime it be manifest and every one upon inquiry into he own thought will find that he have no other idea of any substance vg let it be gold horse iron man vitriol bread but what he have barely of those sensible quality which he suppose to inhere with a supposition of such a substratum as give as it be a support to those quality or simple idea which he have observe to exist unite together thus the idea of the sun -- what be it but a aggregate of those several simple idea bright hot roundish have a constant regular motion at a certain distance from we and perhaps some other : as he who think and discourse of the sun have be more or less accurate in observe those sensible quality idea or property which be in that thing which he call the sun 7 they active and passive power a great part of we complex idea of substance for he have the perfectest idea of any of the particular sort of substance who have gather and put together most of those simple idea which do exist in it among which be to be reckon its active power and passive capacity which though not simple idea yet in this respect for brevity 's sake may conveniently enough be reckon amongst they thus the power of draw iron be one of the idea of the complex one of that substance we call a loadstone and a power to be so draw be a part of the complex one we call iron : which power pass for inherent quality in those subject because every substance be as apt by the power we observe in it to change some sensible quality in other subject as it be to produce in we those simple idea which we receive immediately from it do by those new sensible quality introduce into other subject discover to we those power which do thereby mediately affect we sens as regularly as its sensible quality do it immediately : v g we immediately by we sens perceive in fire its heat and color which be if rightly consider nothing but power in it to produce those idea in we : we also by we sens perceive the color and brittleness of charcoal whereby we come by the knowledge of another power in fire which it have to change the color and consistency of wood by the former fire immediately by the latter it mediately discover to we these several power which therefore we look upon to be a part of the quality of fire and so make they a part of the complex idea of it for all those power that we take cognizance of terminate only in the alteration of some sensible quality in those subject on which they operate and so make they exhibit to we new sensible idea therefore it be that i have reckon these power amongst the simple idea which make the complex one of the sort of substance though these power consider in themselves be truly complex idea and in this looser sense i crave leave to be understand when i name any of these potentiality among the simple idea which we recollect in we mind when we think of particular substance for the power that be severally in they be necessary to be consider if we will have true distinct notion of the several sort of substance 8 and why nor be we to wonder that power make a great part of we complex idea of substance since they secondary quality be those which in most of they serve principally to distinguish substance one from another and commonly make a considerable part of the complex idea of the several sort of they for we sens fail we in the discovery of the bulk texture and figure of the minute part of body on which they real constitution and difference depend we be fain to make use of they secondary quality as the characteristical note and mark whereby to frame idea of they in we mind and distinguish they one from another : all which secondary quality as have be show be nothing but bare power for the color and taste of opium be as well as its soporific or anodyne virtue mere power depend on its primary quality whereby it be fit to produce different operation on different part of we body 9 three sort of idea make we complex one of corporeal substance the idea that make we complex one of corporeal substance be of these three sort first the idea of the primary quality of thing which be discover by we sens and be in they even when we perceive they not such be the bulk figure number situation and motion of the part of body which be really in they whether we take notice of they or not secondly the sensible secondary quality which depend on these be nothing but the power those substance have to produce several idea in we by we sens which idea be not in the thing themselves otherwise than as anything be in its cause thirdly the aptness we consider in any substance to give or receive such alteration of primary quality as that the substance so altered should produce in we different idea from what it do before these be call active and passive power : all which power as far as we have any notice or notion of they terminate only in sensible simple idea for whatever alteration a loadstone have the power to make in the minute particle of iron we should have no notion of any power it have at all to operate on iron do not its sensible motion discover it : and i doubt not but there be a thousand change that body we daily handle have a power to cause in one another which we never suspect because they never appear in sensible effect 10 power thus make a great part of we complex idea of particular substance power therefore justly make a great part of we complex idea of substance he that will examine he complex idea of gold will find several of its idea that make it up to be only power as the power of be melt but of not spend itself in the fire of be dissolve in aqua regium be idea as necessary to make up we complex idea of gold as its color and weight : which if duly consider be also nothing but different power for to speak truly yellowness be not actually in gold but be a power in gold to produce that idea in we by we eye when place in a due light : and the heat which we can not leave out of we idea of the sun be no more really in the sun than the white color it introduce into wax these be both equally power in the sun operating by the motion and figure of its sensible part so on a man as to make he have the idea of heat and so on wax as to make it capable to produce in a man the idea of white 11 the now secondary quality of body would disappear if we could discover the primary one of they minute part have we sens acute enough to discern the minute particle of body and the real constitution on which they sensible quality depend i doubt not but they would produce quite different idea in we : and that which be now the yellow color of gold would then disappear and instead of it we should see a admirable texture of part of a certain size and figure this microscope plainly discover to we for what to we naked eye produce a certain color be by thus augment the acuteness of we sens discover to be quite a different thing and the thus alter as it be the proportion of the bulk of the minute part of a color object to we usual sight produce different idea from what it do before thus sand or pounded glass which be opaque and white to the naked eye be pellucid in a microscope and a hair see in this way lose its former color and be in a great measure pellucid with a mixture of some bright sparkling color such as appear from the refraction of diamond and other pellucid body blood to the naked eye appear all red but by a good microscope wherein its lesser part appear show only some few globule of red swimming in a pellucid liquor and how these red globule would appear if glass could be find that could yet magnify they a thousand or ten thousand time more be uncertain 12 we faculty for discovery of the quality and power of substance suit to we state the infinite wise contriver of we and all thing about we have fitted we sens faculty and organ to the convenience of life and the business we have to do here we be able by we sens to know and distinguish thing : and to examine they so far as to apply they to we use and several way to accommodate the exigence of this life we have insight enough into they admirable contrivance and wonderful effect to admire and magnify the wisdom power and goodness of they author such a knowledge as this which be suit to we present condition we want not faculty to attain but it appear not that god intend we should have a perfect clear and adequate knowledge of they : that perhaps be not in the comprehension of any finite be we be furnish with faculty -lrb- dull and weak as they be -rrb- to discover enough in the creature to lead we to the knowledge of the creator and the knowledge of we duty and we be fit well enough with ability to provide for the convenience of living : these be we business in this world but be we sens alter and make much quicker and acuter the appearance and outward scheme of thing would have quite another face to we and i be apt to think would be inconsistent with we be or at least wellbeing in the part of the universe which we inhabit he that consider how little we constitution be able to bear a remove into part of this air not much higher than that we commonly breathe in will have reason to be satisfy that in this globe of earth allot for we mansion the all-wise architect have suit we organ and the body that be to affect they one to another if we sense of hearing be but a thousand time quicker than it be how would a perpetual noise distract we and we should in the quietest retirement be less able to sleep or meditate than in the middle of a sea-fight nay if that most instructive of we sens see be in any man a thousand or a hundred thousand time more acute than it be by the best microscope thing several million of time less than the smallest object of he sight now would then be visible to he naked eye and so he would come nearer to the discovery of the texture and motion of the minute part of corporeal thing and in many of they probably get idea of they internal constitution : but then he would be in a quite different world from other people : nothing would appear the same to he and other : the visible idea of everything would be different so that i doubt whether he and the rest of man could discourse concern the object of sight or have any communication about color they appearance be so wholly different and perhaps such a quickness and tenderness of sight could not endure bright sunshine or so much as open daylight nor take in but a very small part of any object at once and that too only at a very near distance and if by the help of such microscopical eye -lrb- if i may so call they -rrb- a man could penetrate further than ordinary into the secret composition and radical texture of body he would not make any great advantage by the change if such a acute sight would not serve to conduct he to the market and exchange if he could not see thing he be to avoid at a convenient distance nor distinguish thing he have to do with by those sensible quality other do he that be sharp-sighted enough to see the configuration of the minute particle of the spring of a clock and observe upon what peculiar structure and impulse its elastic motion depend would no doubt discover something very admirable : but if eye so frame could not view at once the hand and the character of the hour-plate and thereby at a distance see what o'clock it be they owner could not be much benefit by that acuteness which whilst it discover the secret contrivance of the part of the machine make he lose its use 13 conjecture about the corporeal organ of some spirit and here give I leave to propose a extravagant conjecture of mine viz that since we have some reason -lrb- if there be any credit to be give to the report of thing that we philosophy can not account for -rrb- to imagine that spirit can assume to themselves body of different bulk figure and conformation of part -- whether one great advantage some of they have over we may not lie in this that they can so frame and shape to themselves organ of sensation or perception as to suit they to they present design and the circumstance of the object they would consider for how much would that man exceed all other in knowledge who have but the faculty so to alter the structure of he eye that one sense as to make it capable of all the several degree of vision which the assistance of glass -lrb- casually at first light on -rrb- have teach we to conceive what wonder would he discover who could so fit he eye to all sort of object as to see when he please the figure and motion of the minute particle in the blood and other juice of animal as distinctly as he do at other time the shape and motion of the animal themselves but to we in we present state unalterable organ so contrived as to discover the figure and motion of the minute part of body whereon depend those sensible quality we now observe in they would perhaps be of no advantage god have no doubt make they so as be best for we in we present condition he have fitted we for the neighborhood of the body that surround we and we have to do with and though we can not by the faculty we have attain to a perfect knowledge of thing yet they will serve we well enough for those end above-mentioned which be we great concernment i beg my reader 's pardon for lay before he so wild a fancy concern the way of perception of being above we but how extravagant soever it be i doubt whether we can imagine anything about the knowledge of angel but after this manner some way or other in proportion to what we find and observe in ourselves and though we can not but allow that the infinite power and wisdom of god may frame creature with a thousand other faculty and way of perceive thing without they than what we have yet we thought can go no further than we own : so impossible it be for we to enlarge we very guess beyond the idea receive from we own sensation and reflection the supposition at least that angel do sometimes assume body need not startle we since some of the most ancient and most learn father of the church seem to believe that they have body : and this be certain that they state and way of existence be unknown to we 14 we specific idea of substance but to return to the matter in hand -- the idea we have of substance and the way we come by they i say we specific idea of substance be nothing else but a collection of certain number of simple idea consider as unite in one thing these idea of substance though they be commonly simple apprehension and the name of they simple term yet in effect be complex and compounded thus the idea which a englishman signify by the name swan be white color long neck red beak black leg and whole foot and all these of a certain size with a power of swimming in the water and make a certain kind of noise and perhaps to a man who have long observe this kind of bird some other property : which all terminate in sensible simple idea all unite in one common subject 15 we idea of spiritual substance as clear as of bodily substance besides the complex idea we have of material sensible substance of which i have last speak -- by the simple idea we have take from those operation of we own mind which we experiment daily in ourselves as think understanding willing know and power of begin motion & c co-existing in some substance we be able to frame the complex idea of a immaterial spirit and thus by put together the idea of think perceive liberty and power of move themselves and other thing we have as clear a perception and notion of immaterial substance as we have of material for put together the idea of think and willing or the power of move or quiet corporeal motion join to substance of which we have no distinct idea we have the idea of a immaterial spirit and by put together the idea of coherent solid part and a power of be move join with substance of which likewise we have no positive idea we have the idea of matter the one be as clear and distinct a idea as the other : the idea of thinking and move a body be as clear and distinct idea as the idea of extension solidity and be move for we idea of substance be equally obscure or none at all in both : it be but a suppose i know not what to support those idea we call accident it be for want of reflection that we be apt to think that we sens show we nothing but material thing every act of sensation when duly consider give we a equal view of both part of nature the corporeal and spiritual for whilst i know by see or hear & c that there be some corporeal be without I the object of that sensation i do more certainly know that there be some spiritual be within I that see and hear this i must be convince can not be the action of bare insensible matter nor ever could be without a immaterial thinking be 16 no idea of abstract substance either in body or spirit by the complex idea of extended figure color and all other sensible quality which be all that we know of it we be as far from the idea of the substance of body as if we know nothing at all : nor after all the acquaintance and familiarity which we imagine we have with matter and the many quality man assure themselves they perceive and know in body will it perhaps upon examination be find that they have any more or clearer primary idea belong to body than they have belong to immaterial spirit 17 cohesion of solid part and impulse the primary idea peculiar to body the primary idea we have peculiar to body as contradistinguish to spirit be the cohesion of solid and consequently separable part and a power of communicate motion by impulse these i think be the original idea proper and peculiar to body for figure be but the consequence of finite extension 18 thinking and motivity the idea we have belong and peculiar to spirit be think and will or a power of put body into motion by thought and which be consequent to it liberty for as body can not but communicate its motion by impulse to another body which it meet with at rest so the mind can put body into motion or forbear to do so as it please the idea of existence duration and mobility be common to they both 19 spirit capable of motion there be no reason why it should be think strange that i make mobility belong to spirit for have no other idea of motion but change of distance with other being that be consider as at rest and finding that spirit as well as body can not operate but where they be and that spirit do operate at several time in several place i can not but attribute change of place to all finite spirit : -lrb- for of the infinite spirit i speak not here -rrb- for my soul be a real be as well as my body be certainly as capable of change distance with any other body or be as body itself and so be capable of motion and if a mathematician can consider a certain distance or a change of that distance between two point one may certainly conceive a distance and a change of distance between two spirit and so conceive they motion they approach or removal one from another 20 proof of this every one find in himself that he soul can think will and operate on he body in the place where that be but can not operate on a body or in a place a hundred mile distant from it nobody can imagine that he soul can think or move a body at oxford whilst he be at london and can not but know that be unite to he body it constantly change place all the whole journey between oxford and london as the coach or horse do that carry he and i think may be say to be truly all that while in motion or if that will not be allow to afford we a clear idea enough of its motion its be separate from the body in death i think will for to consider it as go out of the body or leave it and yet to have no idea of its motion seem to I impossible 21 god immoveable because infinite if it be say by any one that it can not change place because it have none for the spirit be not in loco but ubus i suppose that way of talk will not now be of much weight to many in a age that be not much disposed to admire or suffer themselves to be deceive by such unintelligible way of speak but if any one think there be any sense in that distinction and that it be applicable to we present purpose i desire he to put it into intelligible english and then from thence draw a reason to show that immaterial spirit be not capable of motion indeed motion can not be attribute to god not because he be a immaterial but because he be a infinite spirit 22 we complex idea of a immaterial spirit and we complex idea of body compare let we compare then we complex idea of a immaterial spirit with we complex idea of body and see whether there be any more obscurity in one than in the other and in which most we idea of body as i think be a extended solid substance capable of communicate motion by impulse : and we idea of soul as a immaterial spirit be of a substance that think and have a power of exciting motion in body by willing or think these i think be we complex idea of soul and body as contradistinguished and now let we examine which have most obscurity in it and difficulty to be apprehend i know that people whose thought be immerse in matter and have so subject they mind to they sens that they seldom reflect on anything beyond they be apt to say they can not comprehend a think thing which perhaps be true : but i affirm when they consider it well they can no more comprehend a extended thing 23 cohesion of solid part in body as hard to be conceive as think in a soul if any one say he know not what it be think in he he mean he know not what the substance be of that think thing : no more say i know he what the substance be of that solid thing further if he say he know not how he think i answer neither know he how he be extend how the solid part of body be unite or cohere together to make extension for though the pressure of the particle of air may account for the cohesion of several part of matter that be grosser than the particle of air and have pore less than the corpuscle of air yet the weight or pressure of the air will not explain nor can be a cause of the coherence of the particle of air themselves and if the pressure of the aether or any subtiler matter than the air may unite and hold fast together the part of a particle of air as well as other body yet it can not make bond for itself and hold together the part that make up every the least corpuscle of that materia subtilis so that that hypothesis how ingeniously soever explain by show that the part of sensible body be hold together by the pressure of other external insensible body reach not the part of the aether itself and by how much the more evident it prove that the part of other body be hold together by the external pressure of the aether and can have no other conceivable cause of they cohesion and union by so much the more it leave we in the dark concern the cohesion of the part of the corpuscle of the aether itself : which we can neither conceive without part they be body and divisible nor yet how they part cohere they want that cause of cohesion which be give of the cohesion of the part of all other body 24 not explain by a ambient fluid but in truth the pressure of any ambient fluid how great soever can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid part of matter for though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies one from another in a line perpendicular to they as in the experiment of two polished marble yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion in a line parallel to those surface because the ambient fluid have a full liberty to succeed in each point of space desert by a lateral motion resist such a motion of body so join no more than it would resist the motion of that body be it on all side environ by that fluid and touch no other body and therefore if there be no other cause of cohesion all part of body must be easily separable by such a lateral slide motion for if the pressure of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion wherever that cause operate not there can be no cohesion and since it can not operate against a lateral separation -lrb- as have be show -rrb- therefore in every imaginary plane intersect any mass of matter there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surface which will always notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid easily slide one from another so that perhaps how clear a idea soever we think we have of the extension of body which be nothing but the cohesion of solid part he that shall well consider it in he mind may have reason to conclude that it be as easy for he to have a clear idea how the soul think as how body be extend for since body be no further nor otherwise extend than by the union and cohesion of its solid part we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body without understand wherein consist the union and cohesion of its part which seem to I as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking and how it be perform we can as little understand how the part cohere in extension as how we spirit perceive or move 25 i allow it be usual for most people to wonder how any one should find a difficulty in what they think they every day observe do we not see -lrb- will they be ready to say -rrb- the part of body stick firmly together be there anything more common and what doubt can there be make of it and the like i say concern thinking and voluntary motion do we not every moment experiment it in ourselves and therefore can it be doubt the matter of fact be clear i confess but when we would a little nearer look into it both in the one and the other and can as little understand how the part of body cohere as how we ourselves perceive or move i would have any one intelligibly explain to I how the part of gold or brass -lrb- that but now in fusion be as loose from one another as the particle of water or the sand of a hour-glass -rrb- come in a few moment to be so united and adhere so strongly one to another that the utmost force of man 's arm can not separate they a consider man will i suppose be here at a loss to satisfy he own or another man 's understanding 26 the cause of coherence of atom in extended substance incomprehensible the little body that compose that fluid we call water be so extremely small that i have never hear of any one who by a microscope -lrb- and yet i have hear of some that have magnify to ten thousand nay to much above a hundred thousand time -rrb- pretend to perceive they distinct bulk figure or motion and the particle of water be also so perfectly loose one from another that the least force sensibly separate they nay if we consider they perpetual motion we must allow they to have no cohesion one with another and yet let but a sharp cold come and they unite they consolidate these little atom cohere and be not without great force separable he that could find the bond that tie these heap of loose little body together so firmly he that could make know the cement that make they stick so fast one to another would discover a great and yet unknown secret : and yet when that be do would he be far enough from make the extension of body -lrb- which be the cohesion of its solid part -rrb- intelligible till he could show wherein consist the union or consolidation of the part of those bond or of that cement or of the least particle of matter that exist whereby it appear that this primary and suppose obvious quality of body will be find when examine to be as incomprehensible as anything belong to we mind and a solid extended substance as hard to be conceive as a think immaterial one whatever difficulty some would raise against it 27 the suppose pressure -lrb- \* drop word -rrb- explain cohesion be unintelligible for to extend we thought a little further the pressure which be bring to explain the cohesion of body -lrb- \* drop line -rrb- consider as no doubt it be finite let any one send he contemplation to the extremity of the universe and there see what conceivable hoop what bond he can imagine to hold this mass of matter in so close a pressure together from whence steel have its firmness and the part of a diamond they hardness and indissolubility if matter be finite it must have its extreme and there must be something to hinder it from scatter asunder if to avoid this difficulty any one will throw himself into the supposition and abyss of infinite matter let he consider what light he thereby bring to the cohesion of body and whether he be ever the nearer make it intelligible by resolve it into a supposition the most absurd and most incomprehensible of all other : so far be we extension of body -lrb- which be nothing but the cohesion of solid part -rrb- from be clearer or more distinct when we would inquire into the nature cause or manner of it than the idea of think 28 communication of motion by impulse or by think equally unintelligible another idea we have of body be the power of communication of motion by impulse and of we soul the power of exciting motion by think these idea the one of body the other of we mind every day 's experience clearly furnish we with : but if here again we inquire how this be do we be equally in the dark for in the communication of motion by impulse wherein as much motion be lose to one body as be get to the other which be the ordinariest case we can have no other conception but of the passing of motion out of one body into another which i think be as obscure and inconceivable as how we mind move or stop we body by thought which we every moment find they do the increase of motion by impulse which be observe or believe sometimes to happen be yet harder to be understand we have by daily experience clear evidence of motion produce both by impulse and by thought but the manner how hardly come within we comprehension : we be equally at a loss in both so that however we consider motion and its communication either from body or spirit the idea which belong to spirit be at least as clear as that which belong to body and if we consider the active power of move or as i may call it motivity it be much clearer in spirit than body since two body place by one another at rest will never afford we the idea of a power in the one to move the other but by a borrow motion : whereas the mind every day afford we idea of a active power of move of body and therefore it be worth we consideration whether active power be not the proper attribute of spirit and passive power of matter hence may be conjecture that create spirit be not totally separate from matter because they be both active and passive pure spirit viz god be only active pure matter be only passive those being that be both active and passive we may judge to partake of both but be that as it will i think we have as many and as clear idea belong to spirit as we have belong to body the substance of each be equally unknown to we and the idea of think in spirit as clear as of extension in body and the communication of motion by thought which we attribute to spirit be as evident as that by impulse which we ascribe to body constant experience make we sensible of both these though we narrow understanding can comprehend neither for when the mind would look beyond those original idea we have from sensation or reflection and penetrate into they cause and manner of production we find still it discover nothing but its own short-sightedness 29 summary to conclude sensation convince we that there be solid extended substance and reflection that there be think one : experience assure we of the existence of such being and that the one have a power to move body by impulse the other by think this we can not doubt of experience i say every moment furnish we with the clear idea both of the one and the other but beyond these idea as receive from they proper source we faculty will not reach if we would inquire further into they nature cause and manner we perceive not the nature of extension clearer than we do of think if we would explain they any further one be as easy as the other and there be no more difficulty to conceive how a substance we know not should by thought set body into motion than how a substance we know not should by impulse set body into motion so that we be no more able to discover wherein the idea belong to body consist than those belong to spirit from whence it seem probable to I that the simple idea we receive from sensation and reflection be the boundary of we thought beyond which the mind whatever effort it would make be not able to advance one jot nor can it make any discovery when it would pry into the nature and hidden cause of those idea 30 we idea of spirit and we idea of body compare so that in short the idea we have of spirit compare with the idea we have of body stand thus : the substance of spirit be unknown to we and so be the substance of body equally unknown to we two primary quality or property of body viz solid coherent part and impulse we have distinct clear idea of : so likewise we know and have distinct clear idea of two primary quality or property of spirit viz thinking and a power of action ie a power of begin or stop several thought or motion we have also the idea of several quality inherent in body and have the clear distinct idea of they which quality be but the various modification of the extension of cohere solid part and they motion we have likewise the idea of the several mode of think viz believe doubt intend fear hope all which be but the several mode of think we have also the idea of willing and move the body consequent to it and with the body itself too for as have be show spirit be capable of motion 31 the notion of spirit involve no more difficulty in it than that of body lastly if this notion of immaterial spirit may have perhaps some difficulty in it not easily to be explain we have therefore no more reason to deny or doubt the existence of such spirit than we have to deny or doubt the existence of body because the notion of body be cumber with some difficulty very hard and perhaps impossible to be explain or understand by we for i would fain have instance anything in we notion of spirit more perplexed or nearer a contradiction than the very notion of body include in it the divisibility in infinitum of any finite extension involve we whether we grant or deny it in consequence impossible to be explicate or make in we apprehension consistent consequence that carry greater difficulty and more apparent absurdity than anything can follow from the notion of a immaterial know substance 32 we know nothing of thing beyond we simple idea of they which we be not at all to wonder at since we have but some few superficial idea of thing discover to we only by the sens from without or by the mind reflect on what it experiment in itself within have no knowledge beyond that much less of the internal constitution and true nature of thing be destitute of faculty to attain it and therefore experiment and discover in ourselves knowledge and the power of voluntary motion as certainly as we experiment or discover in thing without we the cohesion and separation of solid part which be the extension and motion of body we have as much reason to be satisfy with we notion of immaterial spirit as with we notion of body and the existence of the one as well as the other for it be no more a contradiction that think should exist separate and independent from solidity than it be a contradiction that solidity should exist separate and independent from think they be both but simple idea independent one from another and have as clear and distinct idea in we of think as of solidity i know not why we may not as well allow a think thing without solidity ie immaterial to exist as a solid thing without think ie matter to exist especially since it be not harder to concieve how thinking should exist without matter than how matter should think for whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple idea we have from sensation and reflection and dive further into the nature of thing we fall presently into darkness and obscurity perplexedness and difficulty and can discover nothing further but we own blindness and ignorance but whichever of these complex idea be clearest that of body or immaterial spirit this be evident that the simple idea that make they up be no other than what we have receive from sensation or reflection : and so be it of all we other idea of substance even of god himself 33 we complex idea of god for if we examine the idea we have of the incomprehensible supreme be we shall find that we come by it the same way and that the complex idea we have both of god and separate spirit be make of the simple idea we receive from reflection vg have from what we experiment in ourselves get the idea of existence and duration of knowledge and power of pleasure and happiness and of several other quality and power which it be better to have than to be without when we would frame a idea the most suitable we can to the supreme be we enlarge every one of these with we idea of infinity and so put they together make we complex idea of god for that the mind have such a power of enlarge some of its idea receive from sensation and reflection have be already show 34 we complex idea of god as infinite if i find that i know some few thing and some of they or all perhaps imperfectly i can frame a idea of know twice as many which i can double again as often as i can add to number and thus enlarge my idea of knowledge by extend its comprehension to all thing exist or possible the same also i can do of know they more perfectly ie all they quality power cause consequence and relation & c till all be perfectly know that be in they or can any way relate to they : and thus frame the idea of infinite or boundless knowledge the same may also be do of power till we come to that we call infinite and also of the duration of existance without begin or end and so frame the idea of a eternal be the degree or extent wherein we ascribe existence power wisdom and all other perfection -lrb- which we can have any idea of -rrb- to that sovereign be which we call g-d be all boundless and infinite we frame the best idea of he we mind be capable of : all which be do i say by enlarge those simple idea we have take from the operation of we own mind by reflection or by we sens from exterior thing to that vastness to which infinity can extend they 35 god in he own essence incognisable for it be infinity which join to we idea of existence power knowledge & c make that complex idea whereby we represent to ourselves the best we can the supreme be for though in he own essence -lrb- which certainly we do not know know not know the real essence of a pebble or a fly or of we own self -rrb- god be simple and uncompounded yet i think i may say we have no other idea of he but a complex one of existence knowledge power happiness & c infinite and eternal : which be all distinct idea and some of they be relative be again compound of other : all which be as have be show originally get from sensation and reflection go to make up the idea or notion we have of god 36 no idea in we complex idea of spirit but those get from sensation or reflection this further be to be observe that there be no idea we attribute to god bating infinity which be not also a part of we complex idea of other spirit because be capable of no other simple idea belong to anything but body but those which by reflection we receive from the operation of we own mind we can attribute to spirit no other but what we receive from thence : and all the difference we can put between they in we contemplation of spirit be only in the several extent and degree of they knowledge power duration happiness & c for that in we idea as well of spirit as of other thing we be restrain to those we receive from sensation and reflection be evident from hence -- that in we idea of spirit how much soever advance in perfection beyond those of body even to that of infinite we can not yet have any idea of the manner wherein they discover they thought one to another : though we must necessarily conclude that separate spirit which be being that have perfecter knowledge and greater happiness than we must need have also a perfecter way of communicate they thought than we have who be fain to make use of corporeal sign and particular sound which be therefore of most general use as be the best and quickest we be capable of but of immediate communication have no experiment in ourselves and consequently no notion of it at all we have no idea how spirit which use not word can with quickness or much less how spirit that have no body can be master of they own thought and communicate or conceal they at pleasure though we can not but necessarily suppose they have such a power 37 recapitulation and thus we have see what kind of idea we have of substance of all kind wherein they consist and how we come by they from whence i think it be very evident first that all we idea of the several sort of substance be nothing but collection of simple idea : with a supposition of something to which they belong and in which they subsist though of this suppose something we have no clear distinct idea at all secondly that all the simple idea that thus unite in one common substratum make up we complex idea of several sort of substance be no other but such as we have receive from sensation or reflection so that even in those which we think we be most intimately acquaint with and that come nearest the comprehension of we most enlarged conception we can not go beyond those simple idea and even in those which seem most remote from all we have to do with and do infinitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reflection or discover by sensation in other thing we can attain to nothing but those simple idea which we originally receive from sensation or reflection as be evident in the complex idea we have of angel and particularly of god himself thirdly that most of the simple idea that make up we complex idea of substance when truly consider be only power however we be apt to take they for positive quality vg the greatest part of the idea that make we complex idea of gold be yellowness great weight ductility fusibility and solubility in aqua regium & c all unite together in a unknown substratum : all which idea be nothing else but so many relation to other substance and be not really in the gold consider barely in itself though they depend on those real and primary quality of its internal constitution whereby it have a fitness differently to operate and be operate on by several other substance chapter xxiv of collective idea of substance 1 a collective idea be one idea besides these complex idea of several single substance as of man horse gold violet apple & c the mind have also complex collective idea of substance which i so call because such idea be make up of many particular substance consider together as unite into one idea and which so join be look on as one v g the idea of such a collection of man as make a army though consist of a great number of distinct substance be as much one idea as the idea of a man : and the great collective idea of all body whatsoever signify by the name world be as much one idea as the idea of any the least particle of matter in it it sufficing to the unity of any idea that it be consider as one representation or picture though make up of ever so many particulars 2 make by the power of compose in the mind these collective idea of substance the mind make by its power of composition and unite severally either simple or complex idea into one as it do by the same faculty make the complex idea of particular substance consist of a aggregate of diver simple idea unite in one substance and as the mind by put together the repeat idea of unity make the collective mode or complex idea of any number as a score or a gross & c -- so by put together several particular substance it make collective idea of substance as a troop a army a swarm a city a fleet each of which every one find that he represent to he own mind by one idea in one view and so under that notion consider those several thing as perfectly one as one ship or one atom nor be it harder to conceive how a army of ten thousand man should make one idea than how a man should make one idea it be as easy to the mind to unite into one the idea of a great number of man and consider it as one as it be to unite into one particular all the distinct idea that make up the composition of a man and consider they all together as one 3 artificial thing that be make up of distinct substance be we collective idea amongst such kind of collective idea be to be count most part of artificial thing at least such of they as be make up of distinct substance : and in truth if we consider all these collective idea aright as army constellation universe as they be unite into so many single idea they be but the artificial draught of the mind bring thing very remote and independent on one another into one view the better to contemplate and discourse on they unite into one conception and signify by one name for there be no thing so remote nor so contrary which the mind can not by this art of composition bring into one idea as be visible in that signify by the name universe chapter xxv of relation 1 relation what besides the idea whether simple or complex that the mind have of thing as they be in themselves there be other it get from they comparison one with another the understanding in the consideration of anything be not confine to that precise object : it can carry any idea as it be beyond itself or at least look beyond it to see how it stand in conformity to any other when the mind so consider one thing that it do as it be bring it to and set it by another and carry its view from one to the other -- this be as the word import relation and respect and the denomination give to positive thing intimate that respect and serve as mark to lead the thought beyond the subject itself denominate to something distinct from it be what we call relative and the thing so bring together related thus when the mind consider caius as such a positive be it take nothing into that idea but what really exist in caius vg when i consider he as a man i have nothing in my mind but the complex idea of the species man so likewise when i say caius be a white man i have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who have that white color but when i give caius the name husband i intimate some other person and when i give he the name whiter i intimate some other thing : in both case my thought be lead to something beyond caius and there be two thing bring into consideration and since any idea whether simple or complex may be the occasion why the mind thus bring two thing together and as it be take a view of they at once though still consider as distinct : therefore any of we idea may be the foundation of relation as in the above-mentioned instance the contract and ceremony of marriage with sempronium be the occasion of the denomination and relation of husband and the color white the occasion why he be say to be whiter than free-stone 2 idea of relation without correlative term not easily apprehend these and the like relation express by relative term that have other answer they with a reciprocal intimation as father and son bigger and less cause and effect be very obvious to every one and everybody at first sight perceive the relation for father and son husband and wife and such other correlative term seem so nearly to belong one to another and through custom do so readily chime and answer one another in people 's memory that upon the naming of either of they the thought be presently carry beyond the thing so name and nobody overlook or doubt of a relation where it be so plainly intimate but where language have fail to give correlative name there the relation be not always so easily take notice of concubine be no doubt a relative name as well as wife : but in language where this and the like word have not a correlative term there people be not so apt to take they to be so as want that evident mark of relation which be between correlative which seem to explain one another and not to be able to exist but together hence it be that many of those name which duly consider do include evident relation have be call external denomination but all name that be more than empty sound must signify some idea which be either in the thing to which the name be apply and then it be positive and be look on as unite to and exist in the thing to which the denomination be give or else it arise from the respect the mind find in it to something distinct from it with which it consider it and then it include a relation 3 some seemingly absolute term contain relation another sort of relative term there be which be not look on to be either relative or so much as external denomination : which yet under the form and appearance of signify something absolute in the subject do conceal a tacit though less observable relation such be the seemingly positive term of old great imperfect & c whereof i shall have occasion to speak more at large in the follow chapter 4 relation different from the thing relate this further may be observe that the idea of relation may be the same in man who have far different idea of the thing that be related or that be thus compare : v g those who have far different idea of a man may yet agree in the notion of a father which be a notion superinduce to the substance or man and refer only to a act of that think call man whereby he contribute to the generation of one of he own kind let man be what it will 5 change of relation may be without any change in the thing relate the nature therefore of relation consist in the refer or compare two thing one to another from which comparison one of both come to be denominate and if either of those thing be remove or cease to be the relation cease and the denomination consequent to it though the other receive in itself no alteration at all vg caius whom i consider to-day as a father cease to be so to-morrow only by the death of he son without any alteration make in himself nay barely by the mind 's change the object to which it compare anything the same thing be capable of have contrary denomination at the same time : vg caius compare to several person may truly be say to be older and younger stronger and weaker & c 6 relation only betwixt two thing whatsoever doth or can exist or be consider as one thing be positive : and so not only simple idea and substance but mode also be positive being : though the part of which they consist be very often relative one to another : but the whole together consider as one thing and produce in we the complex idea of one thing which idea be in we mind as one picture though a aggregate of diver part and under one name it be a positive or absolute thing or idea thus a triangle though the part thereof compare one to another be relative yet the idea of the whole be a positive absolute idea the same may be say of a family a tune & c for there can be no relation but betwixt two thing consider as two thing there must always be in relation two idea or thing either in themselves really separate or consider as distinct and then a ground or occasion for they comparison 7 all thing capable of relation concern relation in general these thing may be consider : first that there be no one thing whether simple idea substance mode or relation or name of either of they which be not capable of almost a infinite number of consideration in reference to other thing : and therefore this make no small part of man 's thought and word : vg one single man may at once be concern in and sustain all these follow relation and many more viz father brother son grandfather grandson father-in-law son-in-law husband friend enemy subject general judge patron client professor european englishman islander servant master possessor captain superior inferior bigger less older younger contemporary like unlike & c to a almost infinite number : he be capable of as many relation as there can be occasion of compare he to other thing in any manner of agreement disagreement or respect whatsoever for as i say relation be a way of compare or consider two thing -lrb- \* drop line -rrb- from that comparison and sometimes give even the relation itself a name 8 we idea of relation often clearer than of the subject related secondly this further may be consider concern relation that though it be not contain in the real existence of thing but something extraneous and superinduce yet the idea which relative word stand for be often clearer and more distinct than of those substance to which they do belong the notion we have of a father or brother be a great deal clearer and more distinct than that we have of a man or if you will paternity be a thing whereof it be easier to have a clear idea than of humanity and i can much easier conceive what a friend be than what god because the knowledge of one action or one simple idea be oftentimes sufficient to give I the notion of a relation but to the know of any substantial be a accurate collection of sundry idea be necessary a man if he compare two thing together can hardly be suppose not to know what it be wherein he compare they : so that when he compare any thing together he can not but have a very clear idea of that relation the idea then of relation be capable at least of be more perfect and distinct in we mind than those of substance because it be commonly hard to know all the simple idea which be really in any substance but for the most part easy enough to know the simple idea that make up any relation i think on or have a name for : vg compare two man in reference to one common parent it be very easy to frame the idea of brother without have yet the perfect idea of a man for significant relative word as well as other stand only for idea and those be all either simple or make up of simple one it suffice for the know the precise idea the relative term stand for to have a clear conception of that which be the foundation of the relation which may be do without have a perfect and clear idea of the thing it be attribute to thus have the notion that one lay the egg out of which the other be hatch i have a clear idea of the relation of dam and chick between the two cassiowary in st jame 's park though perhaps i have but a very obscure and imperfect idea of those bird themselves 9 relation all terminate in simple idea thirdly though there be a great number of consideration wherein thing may be compare one with another and so a multitude of relation yet they all terminate in and be concern about those simple idea either of sensation or reflection which i think to be the whole material of all we knowledge to clear this i shall show it in the most considerable relation that we have any notion of and in some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reflection : which yet will appear to have they idea from thence and leave it past doubt that the notion we have of they be but certain simple idea and so originally derive from sense or reflection 10 term lead the mind beyond the subject denominate be relative fourthly that relation be the consider of one thing with another which be extrinsical to it it be evident that all word that necessarily lead the mind to any other idea than be suppose really to exist in that thing to which the word be apply be relative word : vga man black merry thoughtful thirsty angry extend these and the like be all absolute because they neither signify nor intimate anything but what do or be suppose really to exist in the man thus denominate but father brother king husband blacker merrier & c be word which together with the thing they denominate imply also something else separate and exterior to the existence of that thing 11 all relative make up of simple idea have lay down these premise concern relation in general i shall now proceed to show in some instance how all the idea we have of relation be make up as the other be only of simple idea and that they all how refined or remote from sense soever they seem terminate at last in simple idea i shall begin with the most comprehensive relation wherein all thing that do or can exist be concerned and that be the relation of cause and effect : the idea whereof how derive from the two fountain of all we knowledge sensation and reflection i shall in the next place consider chapter xxvi of cause and effect and other relation 1 whence the idea of cause and effect get in the notice that we sens take of the constant vicissitude of thing we can not but observe that several particular both quality and substance begin to exist and that they receive this they existence from the due application and operation of some other be from this observation we get we idea of cause and effect that which produce any simple or complex idea we denote by the general name cause and that which be produce effect thus find that in that substance which we call wax fluidity which be a simple idea that be not in it before be constantly produce by the application of a certain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat in relation to fluidity in wax the cause of it and fluidity the effect so also find that the substance wood which be a certain collection of simple idea so call by the application of fire be turn into another substance call ash i e another complex idea consist of a collection of simple idea quite different from that complex idea which we call wood we consider fire in relation to ash as cause and the ash as effect so that whatever be consider by we to conduce or operate to the produce any particular simple idea or collection of simple idea whether substance or mode which do not before exist have thereby in we mind the relation of a cause and so be denominate by we 2 creation generation make alteration have thus from what we sens be able to discover in the operation of body on one another get the notion of cause and effect viz that a cause be that which make any other thing either simple idea substance or mode begin to be and a effect be that which have its beginning from some other thing the mind find no great difficulty to distinguish the several original of thing into two sort : -- first when the thing be wholly make new so that no part thereof do ever exist before as when a new particle of matter doth begin to exist in rerum natura which have before no be and this we call creation secondly when a thing be make up of particle which do all of they before exist but that very thing so constitute of pre-existing particle which consider all together make up such a collection of simple idea have not any existence before as this man this egg rise or cherry & c and this when refer to a substance produce in the ordinary course of nature by internal principle but set on work by and receive from some external agent or cause and work by insensible way which we perceive not we call generation when the cause be extrinsical and the effect produce by a sensible separation or juxta-position of discernible part we call it make and such be all artificial thing when any simple idea be produce which be not in that subject before we call it alteration thus a man be generate a picture make and either of they alter when any new sensible quality or simple idea be produce in either of they which be not there before : and the thing thus make to exist which be not there before be effect and those thing which operate to the existence cause in which and all other case we may observe that the notion of cause and effect have its rise from idea receive by sensation or reflection and that this relation how comprehensive soever terminate at last in they for to have the idea of cause and effect it suffice to consider any simple idea or substance as begin to exist by the operation of some other without know the manner of that operation 3 relation of time time and place be also the foundation of very large relation and all finite being at least be concern in they but have already show in another place how we get those idea it may suffice here to intimate that most of the denomination of thing receive from time be only relation thus when any one say that queen elizabeth live sixty-nine and reign forty-five year these word import only the relation of that duration to some other and mean no more but this that the duration of she existence be equal to sixty-nine and the duration of she government to forty-five annual revolution of the sun and so be all word answer how long again william the conqueror invade england about the year 1066 which mean this that take the duration from we savior 's time till now for one entire great length of time it show at what distance this invasion be from the two extreme and so do all word of time answer to the question when which show only the distance of any point of time from the period of a longer duration from which we measure and to which we thereby consider it as related 4 some idea of time suppose positive and find to be relative there be yet besides those other word of time that ordinarily be think to stand for positive idea which yet will when consider be find to be relative such as be young old & c which include and intimate the relation anything have to a certain length of duration whereof we have the idea in we mind thus have settle in we thought the idea of the ordinary duration of a man to be seventy year when we say a man be young we mean that he age be yet but a small part of that which usually man attain to and when we denominate he old we mean that he duration be run out almost to the end of that which man do not usually exceed and so it be but compare the particular age or duration of this or that man to the idea of that duration which we have in we mind as ordinarily belong to that sort of animal : which be plain in the application of these name to other thing for a man be call young at twenty year and very young at seven year old : but yet a horse we call old at twenty and a dog at seven year because in each of these we compare they age to different idea of duration which be settle in we mind as belong to these several sort of animal in the ordinary course of nature but the sun and star though they have outlast several generation of man we call not old because we do not know what period god have set to that sort of being this term belong properly to those thing which we can observe in the ordinary course of thing by a natural decay to come to a end in a certain period of time and so have in we mind as it be a standard to which we can compare the several part of they duration and by the relation they bear thereunto call they young or old which we can not therefore do to a ruby or a diamond thing whose usual period we know not 5 relation of place and extension the relation also that thing have to one another in they place and distance be very obvious to observe as above below a mile distant from charing-cross in england and in london but as in duration so in extension and bulk there be some idea that be relative which we signify by name that be think positive as great and little be truly relation for here also have by observation settle in we mind the idea of the bigness of several species of thing from those we have be most accustomed to we make they as it be the standard whereby to denominate the bulk of other thus we call a great apple such a one as be bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have be use to and a little horse such a one as come not up to the size of that idea which we have in we mind to belong ordinarily to horse and that will be a great horse to a welchman which be but a little one to a fleming they two have from the different breed of they country take several-sized idea to which they compare and in relation to which they denominate they great and they little 6 absolute term often stand for relation so likewise weak and strong be but relative denomination of power compare to some idea we have at that time of greater or less power thus when we say a weak man we mean one that have not so much strength or power to move as usually man have or usually those of he size have which be a compare he strength to the idea we have of the usual strength of man or man of such a size the like when we say the creature be all weak thing weak there be but a relative term signify the disproportion there be in the power of god and the creature and so abundance of word in ordinary speech stand only for relation -lrb- and perhaps the greatest part -rrb- which at first sight seem to have no such signification : vg the ship have necessary store necessary and store be both relative word one have a relation to the accomplish the voyage intend and the other to future use all which relation how they be confine to and terminate in idea derive from sensation or reflection be too obvious to need any explication chapter xxvii of identity and diversity 1 wherein identity consist another occasion the mind often take of compare be the very be of thing when consider anything as exist at any determine time and place we compare it with itself exist at another time and thereon form the idea of identity and diversity when we see anything to be in any place in any instant of time we be sure -lrb- be it what it will -rrb- that it be that very thing and not another which at that same time exist in another place how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respects : and in this consist identity when the idea it be attribute to vary not at all from what they be that moment wherein we consider they former existence and to which we compare the present for we never find nor conceive it possible that two thing of the same kind should exist in the same place at the same time we rightly conclude that whatever exist anywhere at any time exclude all of the same kind and be there itself alone when therefore we demand whether anything be the same or no it refer always to something that exist such a time in such a place which it be certain at that instant be the same with itself and no other from whence it follow that one thing can not have two beginning of existence nor two thing one begin it be impossible for two thing of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant in the very same place or one and the same thing in different place that therefore that have one beginning be the same thing and that which have a different beginning in time and place from that be not the same but diverse that which have make the difficulty about this relation have be the little care and attention use in have precise notion of the thing to which it be attribute 2 identity of substance we have the idea but of three sort of substance : 1 god 2 finite intelligence 3 body first god be without begin eternal unalterable and everywhere and therefore concern he identity there can be no doubt secondly finite spirit have have each its determinate time and place of begin to exist the relation to that time and place will always determine to each of they its identity as long as it exist thirdly the same will hold of every particle of matter to which no addition or subtraction of matter be make it be the same for though these three sort of substance as we term they do not exclude one another out of the same place yet we can not conceive but that they must necessarily each of they exclude any of the same kind out of the same place : or else the notion and name of identity and diversity would be in vain and there could be no such distinction of substance or anything else one from another for example : could two body be in the same place at the same time then those two parcel of matter must be one and the same take they great or little nay all body must be one and the same for by the same reason that two particle of matter may be in one place all body may be in one place : which when it can be suppose take away the distinction of identity and diversity of one and more and render it ridiculous but it be a contradiction that two or more should be one identity and diversity be relation and way of compare well found and of use to the understanding 3 identity of mode and relation all other thing be but mode or relation ultimately terminate in substance the identity and diversity of each particular existence of they too will be by the same way determine : only as to thing whose existence be in succession such as be the action of finite being v g motion and think both which consist in a continued train of succession concern they diversity there can be no question : because each perish the moment it begin they can not exist in different time or in different place as permanent being can at different time exist in distant place and therefore no motion or think consider as at different time can be the same each part thereof have a different beginning of existence 4 principium individuationi from what have be say it be easy to discover what be so much inquire after the principium individuationi and that it be plain be existence itself which determine a being of any sort to a particular time and place incommunicable to two being of the same kind this though it seem easier to conceive in simple substance or mode yet when reflect on be not more difficult in compound one if care be take to what it be apply : vg let we suppose a atom ie a continued body under one immutable superficies exist in a determine time and place it be evident that consider in any instant of its existence it be in that instant the same with itself for be at that instant what it be and nothing else it be the same and so must continue as long as its existence be continue for so long it will be the same and no other in like manner if two or more atom be join together into the same mass every one of those atom will be the same by the foregoing rule : and whilst they exist unite together the mass consist of the same atom must be the same mass or the same body let the part be ever so differently jumble but if one of these atom be take away or one new one add it be no longer the same mass or the same body in the state of live creature they identity depend not on a mass of the same particle but on something else for in they the variation of great parcel of matter alter not the identity : a oak grow from a plant to a great tree and then lop be still the same oak and a colt grow up to a horse sometimes fat sometimes lean be all the while the same horse : though in both these case there may be a manifest change of the part so that truly they be not either of they the same mass of matter though they be truly one of they the same oak and the other the same horse the reason whereof be that in these two case -- a mass of matter and a living body -- identity be not apply to the same thing 5 identity of vegetable we must therefore consider wherein a oak differ from a mass of matter and that seem to I to be in this that the one be only the cohesion of particle of matter any how unite the other such a disposition of they as constitute the part of a oak and such a organization of those part as be fit to receive and distribute nourishment so as to continue and frame the wood bark and leave & c of a oak in which consist the vegetable life that be then one plant which have such a organization of part in one coherent body partaking of one common life it continue to be the same plant as long as it partake of the same life though that life be communicate to new particle of matter vitally unite to the living plant in a like continued organization conformable to that sort of plant for this organization be at any one instant in any one collection of matter be in that particular concrete distinguish from all other and be that individual life which exist constantly from that moment both forwards and backwards in the same continuity of insensibly succeed part unite to the living body of the plant it have that identity which make the same plant and all the part of it part of the same plant during all the time that they exist unite in that continue organization which be fit to convey that common life to all the part so united 6 identity of animal the case be not so much different in brute but that any one may hence see what make a animal and continue it the same something we have like this in machine and may serve to illustrate it for example what be a watch it be plain it be nothing but a fit organization or construction of part to a certain end which when a sufficient force be add to it it be capable to attain if we would suppose this machine one continue body all whose organize part be repair increase or diminish by a constant addition or separation of insensible part with one common life we should have something very much like the body of a animal with this difference that in a animal the fitness of the organization and the motion wherein life consist begin together the motion come from within but in machine the force come sensibly from without be often away when the organ be in order and well fit to receive it 7 the identity of man this also show wherein the identity of the same man consist viz in nothing but a participation of the same continued life by constantly fleeting particle of matter in succession vitally unite to the same organize body he that shall place the identity of man in anything else but like that of other animal in one fitly organize body take in any one instant and from thence continue under one organization of life in several successively fleeting particle of matter unite to it will find it hard to make a embryo one of year mad and sober the same man by any supposition that will not make it possible for seth ismael socrate pilate st austin and caesar borgium to be the same man for if the identity of soul alone make the same man and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same individual spirit may not be unite to different body it will be possible that those man live in distant age and of different temper may have be the same man : which way of speak must be from a very strange use of the word man apply to a idea out of which body and shape be exclude and that way of speak would agree yet worse with the notion of those philosopher who allow of transmigration and be of opinion that the soul of man may for they miscarriage be detrude into the body of beast as fit habitation with organ suit to the satisfaction of they brutal inclination but yet i think nobody could he be sure that the soul of heliogabalus be in one of he hog would yet say that hog be a man or heliogabalus 8 idea of identity suit to the idea it be apply to it be not therefore unity of substance that comprehend all sort of identity or will determine it in every case but to conceive and judge of it aright we must consider what idea the word it be apply to stand for : it be one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the same person if person man and substance be three name stand for three different idea -- for such as be the idea belong to that name such must be the identity which if it have be a little more carefully attend to would possibly have prevent a great deal of that confusion which often occur about this matter with no small seeming difficulty especially concern personal identity which therefore we shall in the next place a little consider 9 same man a animal be a living organize body and consequently the same animal as we have observe be the same continued life communicate to different particle of matter as they happen successively to be unite to that organize living body and whatever be talk of other definition ingenious observation put it past doubt that the idea in we mind of which the sound man in we mouth be the sign be nothing else but of a animal of such a certain form since i think i may be confident that whoever should see a creature of he own shape or make though it have no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot would call he still a man or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot discourse reason and philosophize would call or think it nothing but a cat or a parrot and say the one be a dull irrational man and the other a very intelligent rational parrot 10 same man for i presume it be not the idea of a thinking or rational being alone that make the idea of a man in most people 's sense : but of a body so and so shaped join to it and if that be the idea of a man the same successive body not shift all at once must as well as the same immaterial spirit go to the making of the same man 11 personal identity this be premise to find wherein personal identity consist we must consider what person stand for -- which i think be a think intelligent be that have reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself the same thinking thing in different time and place which it do only by that consciousness which be inseparable from think and as it seem to I essential to it : it be impossible for any one to perceive without perceive that he do perceive when we see hear smell taste feel meditate or will anything we know that we do so thus it be always as to we present sensation and perception : and by this every one be to himself that which he call self : -- it not be consider in this case whether the same self be continue in the same or diver substance for since consciousness always accompany thinking and it be that which make every one to be what he call self and thereby distinguish himself from all other think thing in this alone consist personal identity ie the sameness of a rational being : and as far as this consciousness can be extend backwards to any past action or think so far reach the identity of that person it be the same self now it be then and it be by the same self with this present one that now reflect on it that that action be do 12 consciousness make personal identity but it be further inquire whether it be the same identical substance this few would think they have reason to doubt of if these perception with they consciousness always remain present in the mind whereby the same thinking thing would be always consciously present and as would be think evidently the same to itself but that which seem to make the difficulty be this that this consciousness be interrupted always by forgetfulness there be no moment of we life wherein we have the whole train of all we past action before we eye in one view but even the best memory lose the sight of one part whilst they be view another and we sometimes and that the greatest part of we life not reflect on we past self be intent on we present thought and in sound sleep have no thought at all or at least none with that consciousness which remark we wake thought -- i say in all these case we consciousness be interrupted and we lose the sight of we past self doubt be raise whether we be the same thinking thing ie the same substance or no which however reasonable or unreasonable concern not personal identity at all the question be what make the same person and not whether it be the same identical substance which always think in the same person which in this case matter not at all : different substance by the same consciousness -lrb- where they do partake in it -rrb- be unite into one person as well as different body by the same life be unite into one animal whose identity be preserve in that change of substance by the unity of one continue life for it be the same consciousness that make a man be himself to himself personal identity depend on that only whether it be annex solely to one individual substance or can be continue in a succession of several substance for as far as any intelligent being can repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness it have of it at first and with the same consciousness it have of any present action so far it be the same personal self for it be by the consciousness it have of its present thought and action that it be self to itself now and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to action past or to come and would be by distance of time or change of substance no more two person than a man be two man by wear other clothes to-day than he do yesterday with a long or a short sleep between : the same consciousness unite those distant action into the same person whatever substance contribute to they production 13 personal identity in change of substance that this be so we have some kind of evidence in we very body all whose particle whilst vitally unite to this same thinking conscious self so that we feel when they be touch and be affect by and conscious of good or harm that happen to they be a part of ourselves ie of we think conscious self thus the limb of he body be to every one a part of himself he sympathize and be concern for they cut off a hand and thereby separate it from that consciousness he have of its heat cold and other affection and it be then no longer a part of that which be himself any more than the remotest part of matter thus we see the substance whereof personal self consist at one time may be vary at another without the change of personal identity there be no question about the same person though the limb which but now be a part of it be cut off 14 personality in change of substance but the question be whether if the same substance which think be change it can be the same person or remain the same it can be different person and to this i answer : first this can be no question at all to those who place think in a purely material animal constitution void of a immaterial substance for whether they supposition be true or no it be plain they conceive personal identity preserve in something else than identity of substance as animal identity be preserve in identity of life and not of substance and therefore those who place thinking in a immaterial substance only before they can come to deal with these man must show why personal identity can not be preserve in the change of immaterial substance or variety of particular immaterial substance as well as animal identity be preserve in the change of material substance or variety of particular body : unless they will say it be one immaterial spirit that make the same life in brute as it be one immaterial spirit that make the same person in man which the cartesian at least will not admit for fear of make brute think thing too 15 whether in change of think substance there can be one person but next as to the first part of the question whether if the same thinking substance -lrb- suppose immaterial substance only to think -rrb- be change it can be the same person i answer that can not be resolve but by those who know there can what kind of substance they be that do think and whether the consciousness of past action can be transfer from one think substance to another i grant be the same consciousness the same individual action it could not : but it be a present representation of a past action why it may not be possible that that may be represent to the mind to have be which really never be will remain to be show and therefore how far the consciousness of past action be annex to any individual agent so that another can not possibly have it will be hard for we to determine till we know what kind of action it be that can not be do without a reflex act of perception accompany it and how perform by think substance who can not think without be conscious of it but that which we call the same consciousness not be the same individual act why one intellectual substance may not have represent to it as do by itself what it never do and be perhaps do by some other agent -- why i say such a representation may not possibly be without reality of matter of fact as well as several representation in dream be which yet whilst dream we take for true -- will be difficult to conclude from the nature of thing and that it never be so will by we till we have clearer view of the nature of think substance be best resolve into the goodness of god who as far as the happiness or misery of any of he sensible creature be concern in it will not by a fatal error of theirs transfer from one to another that consciousness which draw reward or punishment with it how far this may be a argument against those who would place think in a system of fleeting animal spirit i leave to be consider but yet to return to the question before we it must be allow that if the same consciousness -lrb- which as have be show be quite a different thing from the same numerical figure or motion in body -rrb- can be transfer from one think substance to another it will be possible that two think substance may make but one person for the same consciousness be preserve whether in the same or different substance the personal identity be preserved 16 whether the same immaterial substance remain there can be two person as to the second part of the question whether the same immaterial substance remain there may be two distinct person which question seem to I to be build on this -- whether the same immaterial be be conscious of the action of its past duration may be wholly strip of all the consciousness of its past existence and lose it beyond the power of ever retrieve it again : and so as it be begin a new account from a new period have a consciousness that can not reach beyond this new state all those who hold pre-existence be evidently of this mind since they allow the soul to have no remain consciousness of what it do in that pre-existent state either wholly separate from body or inform any other body and if they should not it be plain experience would be against they so that personal identity reach no further than consciousness reach a pre-existent spirit not have continue so many age in a state of silence must need make different person suppose a christian platonist or a pythagorean should upon god 's have end all he work of creation the seventh day think he soul have exist ever since and should imagine it have revolve in several human body as i once meet with one who be persuade he have be the soul of socrate -lrb- how reasonably i will not dispute this i know that in the post he fill which be no inconsiderable one he pass for a very rational man and the press have show that he want not part or learning -rrb- -- would any one say that he be not conscious of any of socrate 's action or thought could be the same person with socrate let any one reflect upon himself and conclude that he have in himself a immaterial spirit which be that which think in he and in the constant change of he body keep he the same : and be that which he call himself : let he also suppose it to be the same soul that be in nestor or thersite at the siege of troy -lrb- for soul be as far as we know anything of they in they nature indifferent to any parcel of matter the supposition have no apparent absurdity in it -rrb- which it may have be as well as it be now the soul of any other man : but he now have no consciousness of any of the action either of nestor or thersite do or can he conceive himself the same person with either of they can he be concern in either of they action attribute they to himself or think they he own more than the action of any other man that ever exist so that this consciousness not reach to any of the action of either of those man he be no more one self with either of they than of the soul of immaterial spirit that now inform he have be create and begin to exist when it begin to inform he present body though it be never so true that the same spirit that inform nestor 's or thersite ' body be numerically the same that now inform he for this would no more make he the same person with nestor than if some of the particle of smaller that be once a part of nestor be now a part of this man the same immaterial substance without the same consciousness no more make the same person by be unite to any body than the same particle of matter without consciousness unite to any body make the same person but let he once find himself conscious of any of the action of nestor he then find himself the same person with nestor 17 the body as well as the soul go to the making of a man and thus may we be able without any difficulty to conceive the same person at the resurrection though in a body not exactly in make or part the same which he have here -- the same consciousness go along with the soul that inhabit it but yet the soul alone in the change of body would scarce to any one but to he that make the soul the man be enough to make the same man for should the soul of a prince carry with it the consciousness of the prince 's past life enter and inform the body of a cobbler as soon as desert by he own soul every one see he would be the same person with the prince accountable only for the prince 's action : but who would say it be the same man the body too go to the make the man and would i guess to everybody determine the man in this case wherein the soul with all its princely thought about it would not make another man : but he would be the same cobbler to every one besides himself i know that in the ordinary way of speak the same person and the same man stand for one and the same thing and indeed every one will always have a liberty to speak as he please and to apply what articulate sound to what idea he think fit and change they as often as he please but yet when we will inquire what make the same spirit man or person we must fix the idea of spirit man or person in we mind and have resolve with ourselves what we mean by they it will not be hard to determine in either of they or the like when it be the same and when not 18 consciousness alone unite action into the same person but though the same immaterial substance or soul do not alone wherever it be and in whatsoever state make the same man yet it be plain consciousness as far as ever it can be extend -- should it be to age past -- unite existence and action very remote in time into the same person as well as it do the existence and action of the immediately precede moment : so that whatever have the consciousness of present and past action be the same person to whom they both belong have i the same consciousness that i see the ark and noah 's flood as that i see a overflow of the thame last winter or as that i write now i could no more doubt that i who write this now that see the thame overflow last winter and that view the flood at the general deluge be the same self -- place that self in what substance you please -- than that i who write this be the same myself now whilst i write -lrb- whether i consist of all the same substance material or immaterial or no -rrb- that i be yesterday for as to this point of be the same self it matter not whether this present self be make up of the same or other substance -- i be as much concerned and as justly accountable for any action that be do a thousand year since appropriate to I now by this self-consciousness as i be for what i do the last moment 19 self depend on consciousness not on substance self be that conscious thinking thing -- whatever substance make up of -lrb- whether spiritual or material simple or compound it matter not -rrb- -- which be sensible or conscious of pleasure and pain capable of happiness or misery and so be concern for itself as far as that consciousness extend thus every one find that whilst comprehend under that consciousness the little finger be as much a part of himself as what be most so upon separation of this little finger should this consciousness go along with the little finger and leave the rest of the body it be evident the little finger would be the person the same person and self then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body as in this case it be the consciousness that go along with the substance when one part be separate from another which make the same person and constitute this inseparable self : so it be in reference to substance remote in time that with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join itself make the same person and be one self with it and with nothing else and so attribute to itself and own all the action of that thing as its own as far as that consciousness reach and no further as every one who reflect will perceive 20 person not substance the object of reward and punishment in this personal identity be found all the right and justice of reward and punishment happiness and misery be that for which every one be concern for himself and not matter what become of any substance not join to or affect with that consciousness for as it be evident in the instance i give but now if the consciousness go along with the little finger when it be cut off that would be the same self which be concern for the whole body yesterday as make part of itself whose action then it can not but admit as its own now though if the same body should still live and immediately from the separation of the little finger have its own peculiar consciousness whereof the little finger know nothing it would not at all be concern for it as a part of itself or could own any of its action or have any of they imputed to he 21 which show wherein personal identity consist this may show we wherein personal identity consist : not in the identity of substance but as i have say in the identity of consciousness wherein if socrate and the present mayor of queenborough agree they be the same person : if the same socrate wake and sleep do not partake of the same consciousness socrate wake and sleep be not the same person and to punish socrate wake for what sleep socrate think and wake socrate be never conscious of would be no more of right than to punish one twin for what he brother-twin do whereof he know nothing because they outside be so like that they could not be distinguish for such twin have be see 22 absolute oblivion separate what be thus forget from the person but not from the man but yet possibly it will still be object -- suppose i wholly lose the memory of some part of my life beyond a possibility of retrieve they so that perhaps i shall never be conscious of they again yet be i not the same person that do those action have those thought that i once be conscious of though i have now forget they to which i answer that we must here take notice what the word _ i _ be apply to which in this case be the man only and the same man be presume to be the same person i be easily here suppose to stand also for the same person but if it be possible for the same man to have distinct incommunicable consciousness at different time it be past doubt the same man would at different time make different person which we see be the sense of mankind in the solemnest declaration of they opinion human law not punish the mad man for the sober man 's action nor the sober man for what the mad man do -- thereby make they two person : which be somewhat explain by we way of speak in english when we say such a one be ` not himself ' or be ` beside himself ' in which phrase it be insinuate as if those who now or at least first use they think that self be change the selfsame person be no longer in that man 23 difference between identity of man and of person but yet it be hard to conceive that socrate the same individual man should be two person to help we a little in this we must consider what be mean by socrate or the same individual man first it must be either the same individual immaterial thinking substance in short the same numerical soul and nothing else secondly or the same animal without any regard to a immaterial soul thirdly or the same immaterial spirit unite to the same animal now take which of these supposition you please it be impossible to make personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness or reach any further than that do for by the first of they it must be allow possible that a man bear of different woman and in distant time may be the same man a way of speaking which whoever admit must allow it possible for the same man to be two distinct person as any two that have live in different age without the knowledge of one another 's thought by the second and third socrate in this life and after it can not be the same man any way but by the same consciousness and so make human identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place personal identity there will be difficulty to allow the same man to be the same person but then they who place human identity in consciousness only and not in something else must consider how they will make the infant socrate the same man with socrate after the resurrection but whatsoever to some man make a man and consequently the same individual man wherein perhaps few be agree personal identity can by we be place in nothing but consciousness -lrb- which be that alone which make what we call self -rrb- without involve we in great absurdity 24 but be not a man drunk and sober the same person why else be he punish for the fact he commit when drunk though he be never afterwards conscious of it just as much the same person as a man that walk and do other thing in he sleep be the same person and be answerable for any mischief he shall do in it human law punish both with a justice suitable to they way of knowledge -- because in these case they can not distinguish certainly what be real what counterfeit : and so the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep be not admit as a plea but in the great day wherein the secret of all heart shall be lay open it may be reasonable to think no one shall be make to answer for what he know nothing of but shall receive he doom he conscience accuse or excuse he 25 consciousness alone unite remote existence into one person nothing but consciousness can unite remote existence into the same person : the identity of substance will not do it for whatever substance there be however frame without consciousness there be no person : and a carcass may be a person as well as any sort of substance be so without consciousness could we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousness act the same body the one constantly by day the other by night and on the other side the same consciousness act by interval two distinct body : i ask in the first case whether the day and the night -- man would not be two as distinct person as socrate and plato and whether in the second case there would not be one person in two distinct body as much as one man be the same in two distinct clothing nor be it at all material to say that this same and this distinct consciousness in the case above mention be owe to the same and distinct immaterial substance bring it with they to those body which whether true or no alter not the case : since it be evident the personal identity would equally be determine by the consciousness whether that consciousness be annex to some individual immaterial substance or no for grant that the think substance in man must be necessarily suppose immaterial it be evident that immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness and be restore to it again : as appear in the forgetfulness man often have of they past action and the mind many time recover the memory of a past consciousness which it have lose for twenty year together make these interval of memory and forgetfulness to take they turn regularly by day and night and you have two person with the same immaterial spirit as much as in the former instance two person with the same body so that self be not determine by identity or diversity of substance which it can not be sure of but only by identity of consciousness 26 not the substance with which the consciousness may be unite indeed it may conceive the substance whereof it be now make up to have exist formerly unite in the same conscious being : but consciousness remove that substance be no more itself or make no more a part of it than any other substance as be evident in the instance we have already give of a limb cut off of whose heat or cold or other affection have no longer any consciousness it be no more of a man 's self than any other matter of the universe in like manner it will be in reference to any immaterial substance which be void of that consciousness whereby i be myself to myself : so that i can not upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby i be now myself it be in that part of its existence no more myself than any other immaterial be for whatsoever any substance have think or do which i can not recollect and by my consciousness make my own thought and action it will no more belong to I whether a part of I think or do it than if it have be think or do by any other immaterial be anywhere exist 27 consciousness unite substance material or spiritual with the same personality i agree the more probable opinion be that this consciousness be annex to and the affection of one individual immaterial substance but let man accord to they diverse hypothesis resolve of that as they please this every intelligent be sensible of happiness or misery must grant -- that there be something that be himself that he be concern for and would have happy that this self have exist in a continued duration more than one instant and therefore it be possible may exist as it have do month and year to come without any certain bound to be set to its duration and may be the same self by the same consciousness continue on for the future and thus by this consciousness he find himself to be the same self which do such and such a action some year since by which he come to be happy or miserable now in all which account of self the same numerical substance be not consider a make the same self but the same continued consciousness in which several substance may have be unite and again separate from it which whilst they continue in a vital union with that wherein this consciousness then reside make a part of that same self thus any part of we body vitally unite to that which be conscious in we make a part of ourselves : but upon separation from the vital union by which that consciousness be communicate that which a moment since be part of ourselves be now no more so than a part of another man 's self be a part of I : and it be not impossible but in a little time may become a real part of another person and so we have the same numerical substance become a part of two different person and the same person preserve under the change of various substance could we suppose any spirit wholly strip of all its memory of consciousness of past action as we find we mind always be of a great part of ours and sometimes of they all the union or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no variation of personal identity any more than that of any particle of matter do any substance vitally unite to the present thinking be be a part of that very same self which now be anything unite to it by a consciousness of former action make also a part of the same self which be the same both then and now 28 person a forensic term person as i take it be the name for this self wherever a man find what he call himself there i think another may say be the same person it be a forensic term appropriate action and they merit and so belong only to intelligent agent capable of a law and happiness and misery this personality extend itself beyond present existence to what be past only by consciousness -- whereby it become concerned and accountable own and impute to itself past action just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it do the present all which be found in a concern for happiness the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness that which be conscious of pleasure and pain desire that that self that be conscious should be happy and therefore whatever past action it can not reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness it can be no more concerned in than if they have never be do : and to receive pleasure or pain ie reward or punishment on the account of any such action be all one as to be make happy or miserable in its first be without any demerit at all for suppose a man punish now for what he have do in another life whereof he could be make to have no consciousness at all what difference be there between that punishment and be create miserable and therefore conformable to this the apostle tell we that at the great day when every one shall ` receive accord to he doings the secret of all heart shall be lay open ' the sentence shall be justify by the consciousness all person shall have that they themselves in what body soever they appear or what substance soever that consciousness adhere to be the same that commit those action and deserve that punishment for they 29 supposition that look strange be pardonable in we ignorance i be apt enough to think i have in treat of this subject make some supposition that will look strange to some reader and possibly they be so in themselves but yet i think they be such as be pardonable in this ignorance we be in of the nature of that think thing that be in we and which we look on as ourselves do we know what it be or how it be tie to a certain system of fleeting animal spirit or whether it could or could not perform its operation of think and memory out of a body organize as ours be and whether it have please god that no one such spirit shall ever be unite to any but one such body upon the right constitution of whose organ its memory should depend we might see the absurdity of some of those supposition i have make but take as we ordinarily now do -lrb- in the dark concern these matter -rrb- the soul of a man for a immaterial substance independent from matter and indifferent alike to it all there can from the nature of thing be no absurdity at all to suppose that the same soul may at different time be unite to different body and with they make up for that time one man : as well as we suppose a part of a sheep 's body yesterday should be a part of a man 's body to-morrow and in that union make a vital part of meliboeus himself as well as it do of he ram 30 the difficulty from ill use of name to conclude : whatever substance begin to exist it must during its existence necessarily be the same : whatever composition of substance begin to exist during the union of those substance the concrete must be the same : whatsoever mode begin to exist during its existence it be the same : and so if the composition be of distinct substance and different mode the same rule hold whereby it will appear that the difficulty or obscurity that have be about this matter rather rise from the name ill-used than from any obscurity in thing themselves for whatever make the specific idea to which the name be apply if that idea be steadily keep to the distinction of anything into the same and diver will easily be conceive and there can arise no doubt about it 31 continuance of that which we have make to be we complex idea of man make the same man for suppose a rational spirit be the idea of a man it be easy to know what be the same man viz the same spirit -- whether separate or in a body -- will be the same man suppose a rational spirit vitally unite to a body of a certain conformation of part to make a man whilst that rational spirit with that vital conformation of part though continue in a fleeting successive body remain it will be the same man but if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of part in a certain shape as long as that vital union and shape remain in a concrete no otherwise the same but by a continued succession of fleeting particle it will be the same man for whatever be the composition whereof the complex idea be make whenever existence make it one particular thing under any denomination the same existence continue preserve it the same individual under the same denomination chapter xxviii of other relation 1 idea of proportional relation besides the before-mentioned occasion of time place and causality of compare or refer thing one to another there be as i have say infinite other some whereof i shall mention first the first i shall name be some one simple idea which be capable of part or degree afford a occasion of compare the subject wherein it be to one another in respect of that simple idea vg whiter sweeter equal more & c these relation depend on the equality and excess of the same simple idea in several subject may be call if one will proportional and that these be only conversant about those simple idea receive from sensation or reflection be so evident that nothing need be say to evince it 2 natural relation secondly another occasion of compare thing together or consider one thing so as to include in that consideration some other thing be the circumstance of they origin or beginning which be not afterwards to be alter make the relation depend thereon as lasting as the subject to which they belong vg father and son brother cousin-german & c which have they relation by one community of blood wherein they partake in several degree : countryman ie those who be bear in the same country or tract of ground and these i call natural relation : wherein we may observe that mankind have fit they notion and word to the use of common life and not to the truth and extent of thing for it be certain that in reality the relation be the same betwixt the begetter and the begotten in the several race of other animal as well as man but yet it be seldom say this bull be the grandfather of such a calf or that two pigeon be cousin-german it be very convenient that by distinct name these relation should be observe and mark out in mankind there be occasion both in law and other communication one with another to mention and take notice of man under these relation : from whence also arise the obligation of several duty amongst man : whereas in brute man have very little or no cause to mind these relation they have not think fit to give they distinct and peculiar name this by the way may give we some light into the different state and growth of language which be suit only to the convenience of communication be proportion to the notion man have and the commerce of thought familiar amongst they and not to the reality or extent of thing nor to the various respects might be find among they nor the different abstract consideration might be frame about they where they have no philosophical notion there they have no term to express they : and it be no wonder man should have frame no name for those thing they find no occasion to discourse of from whence it be easy to imagine why as in some country they may have not so much as the name for a horse and in other where they be more careful of the pedigree of they horse than of they own that there they may have not only name for particular horse but also of they several relation of kindred one to another 3 idea of institute of voluntary relation thirdly sometimes the foundation of consider thing with reference to one another be some act whereby any one come by a moral right power or obligation to do something thus a general be one that have power to command a army and a army under a general be a collection of armed man oblige to obey one man a citizen or a burgher be one who have a right to certain privilege in this or that place all this sort depend upon man 's will or agreement in society i call institute or voluntary and may be distinguish from the natural in that they be most if not all of they some way or other alterable and separable from the person to whom they have sometimes belong though neither of the substance so related be destroy now though these be all reciprocal as well as the rest and contain in they a reference of two thing one to the other yet because one of the two thing often want a relative name import that reference man usually take no notice of it and the relation be commonly overlook : v g a patron and client be easily allow to be relation but a constable or dictator be not so readily at first hearing consider as such because there be no peculiar name for those who be under the command of a dictator or constable express a relation to either of they though it be certain that either of they have a certain power over some other and so be so far related to they as well as a patron be to he client or general to he army 4 idea of moral relation fourthly there be another sort of relation which be the conformity or disagreement man 's voluntary action have to a rule to which they be refer and by which they be judge of which i think may be call moral relation as be that which denominate we moral action and deserve well to be examine there be no part of knowledge wherein we should be more careful to get determine idea and avoid as much as may be obscurity and confusion human action when with they various end object manners and circumstance they be frame into distinct complex idea be as have be show so many mixed mode a great part whereof have name annex to they thus suppose gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return kindness receive polygamy to be the have more wife than one at once : when we frame these notion thus in we mind we have there so many determine idea of mixed mode but this be not all that concern we action : it be not enough to have determine idea of they and to know what name belong to such and such combination of idea we have a further and greater concernment and that be to know whether such action so make up be morally good or bad 5 moral good and evil good and evil as have be show -lrb- b ii chap xx section 2 and chap xxi section 43 -rrb- be nothing but pleasure or pain or that which occasion or procure pleasure or pain to we moral good and evil then be only the conformity or disagreement of we voluntary action to some law whereby good or evil be draw on we from the will and power of the law-maker which good and evil pleasure or pain attend we observance or breach of the law by the decree of the law-maker be that we call reward and punishment 6 moral rule of these moral rule or law to which man generally refer and by which they judge of the rectitude or gravity of they action there seem to I to be three sort with they three different enforcement or reward and punishment for since it would be utterly in vain to suppose a rule set to the free action of man without annex to it some enforcement of good and evil to determine he will we must wherever we suppose a law suppose also some reward or punishment annex to that law it would be in vain for one intelligent be to set a rule to the action of another if he have it not in he power to reward the compliance with and punish deviation from he rule by some good and evil that be not the natural product and consequence of the action itself for that be a natural convenience or inconvenience would operate of itself without a law this if i mistake not be the true nature of all law properly so call 7 law the law that man generally refer they action to to judge of they rectitude or obliquity seem to I to be these three : -- 1 the divine law 2 the civil law 3 the law of opinion or reputation if i may so call it by the relation they bear to the first of these man judge whether they action be sin or duty by the second whether they be criminal or innocent and by the third whether they be virtue or vice 8 divine law the measure of sin and duty first the divine law whereby that law which god have set to the action of man -- whether promulgate to they by the light of nature or the voice of revelation that god have give a rule whereby man should govern themselves i think there be nobody so brutish as to deny he have a right to do it we be he creature : he have goodness and wisdom to direct we action to that which be best : and he have power to enforce it by reward and punishment of infinite weight and duration in another life for nobody can take we out of he hand this be the only true touchstone of moral rectitude and by compare they to this law it be that man judge of the most considerable moral good or evil of they action that be whether as duty or sin they be like to procure they happiness or misery from the hand of the almighty 9 civil law the measure of crime and innocence secondly the civil law -- the rule set by the commonwealth to the action of those who belong to it -- be another rule to which man refer they action to judge whether they be criminal or no this law nobody overlook : the reward and punishment that enforce it be ready at hand and suitable to the power that make it : which be the force of the commonwealth engage to protect the life liberty and possession of those who live accord to its law and have power to take away life liberty or goods from he who disobey which be the punishment of offence commit against he law 10 philosophical law the measure of virtue and vice thirdly the law of opinion or reputation virtue and vice be name pretend and suppose everywhere to stand for action in they own nature right and wrong : and as far as they really be so apply they so far be coincident with the divine law above mention but yet whatever be pretended this be visible that these name virtue and vice in the particular instance of they application through the several nation and society of man in the world be constantly attribute only to such action as in each country and society be in reputation or discredit nor be it to be think strange that man everywhere should give the name of virtue to those action which amongst they be judge praiseworthy and call that vice which they account blamable : since otherwise they would condemn themselves if they should think anything right to which they allow not commendation anything wrong which they let pass without blame thus the measure of what be everywhere call and esteem virtue and vice be this approbation or dislike praise or blame which by a secret and tacit consent establish itself in the several society tribe and club of man in the world : whereby several action come to find credit or disgrace amongst they accord to the judgment maxim or fashion of that place for though man unite into politic society have resign up to the public the dispose of all they force so that they can not employ it against any fellow-citizen any further than the law of the country direct : yet they retain still the power of think well or ill approve or disapprove of the action of those whom they live amongst and converse with : and by this approbation and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they will call virtue and vice 11 the measure that man commonly apply to determine what they call virtue and vice that this be the common measure of virtue and vice will appear to any one who consider that though that pass for vice in one country which be count a virtue or at least not vice in another yet everywhere virtue and praise vice and blame go together virtue be everywhere that which be think praiseworthy and nothing else but that which have the allowance of public esteem be call virtue virtue and praise be so unite that they be call often by the same name sunt sua premia laudus say virgil and so cicero nihil habet natura praestantius quam honestatem quam laudem quam dignitatem quam decus which he tell you be all name for the same thing this be the language of the heathen philosopher who well understand wherein they notion of virtue and vice consist and though perhaps by the different temper education fashion maxim or interest of different sort of man it fall out that what be think praiseworthy in one place escape not censure in another and so in different society virtue and vice be change yet as to the main they for the most part keep the same everywhere for since nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation that wherein every one find he advantage and to blame and discountenance the contrary it be no wonder that esteem and discredit virtue and vice should in a great measure everywhere correspond with the unchangeable rule of right and wrong which the law of god have establish there be nothing that so directly and visible secure and advance the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to the law he have set they and nothing that breed such mischief and confusion as the neglect of they and therefore man without renounce all sense and reason and they own interest which they be so constantly true to could not generally mistake in place they commendation and blame on that side that really deserve it not nay even those man whose practice be otherwise fail not to give they approbation right few be deprave to that degree as not to condemn at least in other the fault they themselves be guilty of whereby even in the corruption of manners the true boundary of the law of nature which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice be pretty well prefer so that even the exhortation of inspired teacher have not fear to appeal to common repute : ` whatsoever be lovely whatsoever be of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise ' & c -lrb- phil iv 8 -rrb- 12 its inforcement be commendation and discredit if any one shall imagine that i have forget my own notion of a law when i make the law whereby man judge of virtue and vice to be nothing else but the consent of private man who have not authority enough to make a law : especially want that which be so necessary and essential to a law a power to enforce it : i think i may say that he who imagine commendation and disgrace not to be strong motive to man to accommodate themselves to the opinion and rule of those with whom they converse seem little skilled in the nature or history of mankind : the greatest part whereof we shall find to govern themselves chiefly if not solely by this law of fashion and so they do that which keep they in reputation with they company little regard the law of god or the magistrate the penalty that attend the breach of god 's law some nay perhaps most man seldom seriously reflect on : and amongst those that do many whilst they break the law entertain thought of future reconciliation and make they peace for such breach and as to the punishment due from the law of the commonwealth they frequently flatter themselves with the hope of impunity but no man escape the punishment of they censure and dislike who offend against the fashion and opinion of the company he keep and would recommend himself to nor be there one of ten thousand who be stiff and insensible enough to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of he own club he must be of a strange and unusual constitution who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with he own particular society solitude many man have seek and be reconcile to : but nobody that have the least thought or sense of a man about he can live in society under the constant dislike and ill opinion of he familiar and those he converse with this be a burden too heavy for human sufferance : and he must be make up of irreconcileable contradiction who can take pleasure in company and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from he companion 13 these three law the rule of moral good and evil these three then first the law of god secondly the law of politic society thirdly the law of fashion or private censure be those to which man variously compare they action : and it be by they conformity to one of these law that they take they measure when they would judge of they moral rectitude and denominate they action good or bad 14 morality be the relation of voluntary action to these rule whether the rule to which as to a touchstone we bring we voluntary action to examine they by and try they goodness and accordingly to name they which be as it be the mark of the value we set upon they : whether i say we take that rule from the fashion of the country or the will of a law-maker the mind be easily able to observe the relation any action have to it and to judge whether the action agree or disagree with the rule and so have a notion of moral goodness or evil which be either conformity or not conformity of any action to that rule : and therefore be often call moral rectitude this rule be nothing but a collection of several simple idea the conformity thereto be but so order the action that the simple idea belong to it may correspond to those which the law require and thus we see how moral being and notion be found on and terminate in these simple idea we have receive from sensation or reflection for example : let we consider the complex idea we signify by the word murder : and when we have take it asunder and examine all the particulars we shall find they to amount to a collection of simple idea derive from reflection or sensation viz first from reflection on the operation of we own mind we have the idea of willing consider purpose beforehand malice or wish ill to another and also of life or perception and self-motion secondly from sensation we have the collection of those simple sensible idea which be to be find in a man and of some action whereby we put a end to perception and motion in the man all which simple idea be comprehend in the word murder this collection of simple idea be find by I to agree or disagree with the esteem of the country i have be breed in and to be hold by most man there worthy praise or blame i call the action virtuous or vicious : if i have the will of a supreme invisible lawgiver for my rule then as i suppose the action command or forbid by god i call it good or evil sin or duty : and if i compare it to the civil law the rule make by the legislative power of the country i call it lawful or unlawful a crime or no crime so that whencesoever we take the rule of moral action or by what standard soever we frame in we mind the idea of virtue or vice they consist only and be make up of collection of simple idea which we originally receive from sense or reflection : and they rectitude or obliquity consist in the agreement or disagreement with those pattern prescribe by some law 15 moral action may be regard wither absolutely or as idea of relation to conceive rightly of moral action we must take notice of they under this two-fold consideration first as they be in themselves each make up of such a collection of simple idea thus drunkenness or lie signify such or such a collection of simple idea which i call mixed mode : and in this sense they be as much positive absolute idea as the drinking of a horse or speaking of a parrot secondly we action be consider as good bad or indifferent and in this respect they be relative it be they conformity to or disagreement with some rule that make they to be regular or irregular good or bad and so as far as they be compare with a rule and thereupon denominate they come under relation thus the challenging and fight with a man as it be a certain positive mode or particular sort of action by particular idea distinguish from all other be call duelling : which when consider in relation to the law of god will deserve the name of sin to the law of fashion in some country valor and virtue and to the municipal law of some government a capital crime in this case when the positive mode have one name and another name as it stand in relation to the law the distinction may as easily be observe as it be in substance where one name vg man be use to signify the thing another vg father to signify the relation 16 the denomination of action often mislead we but because very frequently the positive idea of the action and its moral relation be comprehend together under one name and the same word make use of to express both the mode or action and its moral rectitude or obliquity : therefore the relation itself be less take notice of and there be often no distinction make between the positive idea of the action and the reference it have to a rule by which confusion of these two distinct consideration under one term those who yield too easily to the impression of sound and be forward to take name for thing be often mislead in they judgment of action thus the take from another what be he without he knowledge or allowance be properly call stealing : but that name be commonly understand to signify also the moral gravity of the action and to denote its contrariety to the law man be apt to condemn whatever they hear call steal as a ill action disagree with the rule of right and yet the private take away he sword from a madman to prevent he do mischief though it be properly denominate steal as the name of such a mixed mode yet when compare to the law of god and consider in its relation to that supreme rule it be no sin or transgression though the name steal ordinarily carry such a intimation with it 17 relation innumerable and only the most considerable here mention and thus much for the relation of human action to a law which therefore i call moral relation it would make a volume to go over all sort of relation : it be not therefore to be expect that i should here mention they all it suffice to we present purpose to show by these what the idea be we have of this comprehensive consideration call relation which be so various and the occasion of it so many -lrb- as many as there can be of compare thing one to another -rrb- that it be not very easy to reduce it to rule or under just head those i have mention i think be some of the most considerable and such as may serve to let we see from whence we get we idea of relation and wherein they be found but before i quit this argument from what have be say give I leave to observe : 18 all relation terminate in simple idea first that it be evident that all relation terminate in and be ultimately found on those simple idea we have get from sensation or reflection : so that all we have in we thought ourselves -lrb- if we think of anything or have any meaning -rrb- or would signify to other when we use word stand for relation be nothing but some simple idea or collection of simple idea compare one with another this be so manifest in that sort call proportional that nothing can be more for when a man say ` honey be sweeter than wax ' it be plain that he thought in this relation terminate in this simple idea sweetness which be equally true of all the rest : though where they be compound or decompound the simple idea they be make up of be perhaps seldom take notice of : vg when the word father be mention : first there be mean that particular species or collective idea signify by the word man secondly those sensible simple idea signify by the word generation and thirdly the effect of it and all the simple idea signify by the word child so the word friend be take for a man who love and be ready to do good to another have all these follow idea to the making of it up : first all the simple idea comprehend in the word man or intelligent be secondly the idea of love thirdly the idea of readiness or disposition fourthly the idea of action which be any kind of thought or motion fifthly the idea of good which signify anything that may advance he happiness and terminate at last if examine in particular simple idea of which the word good in general signify any one but if remove from all simple idea quite it signify nothing at all and thus also all moral word terminate at last though perhaps more remotely in a collection of simple idea : the immediate signification of relative word be very often other suppose known relation which if trace one to another still end in simple idea 19 we have ordinarily as clear a notion of the relation as of the simple idea in thing on which it be found secondly that in relation we have for the most part if not always as clear a notion of the relation as we have of those simple idea wherein it be found : agreement or disagreement whereon relation depend be thing whereof we have commonly as clear idea as of any other whatsoever it be but the distinguishing simple idea or they degree one from another without which we could have no distinct knowledge at all for if i have a clear idea of sweetness light or extension i have too of equal or more or less of each of these : if i know what it be for one man to be bear of a woman viz sempronium i know what it be for another man to be bear of the same woman sempronium and so have as clear a notion of brother as of birth and perhaps clearer for it i believe that sempronium dig titus out of the parsley-bed -lrb- as they use to tell child -rrb- and thereby become he mother and that afterwards in the same manner she dig caius out of the parsley-bed i have as clear a notion of the relation of brother between they as it i have all the skill of a midwife : the notion that the same woman contribute as mother equally to they birth -lrb- though i be ignorant or mistaken in the manner of it -rrb- be that on which i ground the relation and that they agree in the circumstance of birth let it be what it will the compare they then in they descent from the same person without know the particular circumstance of that descent be enough to find my notion of they have or not have the relation of brother but though the idea of particular relation be capable of be as clear and distinct in the mind of those who will duly consider they as those of mixed mode and more determinate than those of substance : yet the name belong to relation be often of as doubtful and uncertain signification as those of substance or mixed mode and much more than those of simple idea because relative word be the mark of this comparison which be make only by man 's thought and be a idea only in man 's mind man frequently apply they to different comparison of thing accord to they own imagination which do not always correspond with those of other use the same name 20 the notion of relation be the same whether the rule any action be compare to be true or false thirdly that in these i call moral relation i have a true notion of relation by compare the action with the rule whether the rule be true or false for if i measure anything by a yard i know whether the thing i measure be longer or shorter than that suppose yard though perhaps the yard i measure by be not exactly the standard : which indeed be another inquiry for though the rule be erroneous and i mistake in it yet the agreement or disagreement observable in that which i compare with make I perceive the relation though measure by a wrong rule i shall thereby be bring to judge amiss of its moral rectitude because i have try it by that which be not the true rule : yet i be not mistake in the relation which that action bear to that rule i compare it to which be agreement or disagreement chapter xxix of clear and obscure distinct and confused idea 1 idea come clear and distinct other obscure and confused have show the original of we idea and take a view of they several sort consider the difference between the simple and the complex and observe how the complex one be divide into those of mode substance and relation -- all which i think be necessary to be do by any one who would acquaint himself thoroughly with the progress of the mind in its apprehension and knowledge of thing -- it will perhaps be think i have dwell long enough upon the examination of idea i must nevertheless crave leave to offer some few other consideration concern they the first be that some be clear and other obscure some distinct and other confuse 2 clear and obscure explain by sight the perception of the mind be most aptly explain by word relate to the sight we shall best understand what be mean by clear and obscure in we idea by reflect on what we call clear and obscure in the object of sight light be that which discover to we visible object we give the name of obscure to that which be not place in a light sufficient to discover minutely to we the figure and color which be observable in it and which in a better light would be discernible in like manner we simple idea be clear when they be such as the object themselves from whence they be take do or might in a well-ordered sensation or perception present they whilst the memory retain they thus and can produce they to the mind whenever it have occasion to consider they they be clear idea so far as they either want anything of the original exactness or have lose any of they first freshness and be as it be fade or tarnish by time so far be they obscure complex idea as they be make up of simple one so they be clear when the idea that go to they composition be clear and the number and order of those simple idea that be the ingredient of any complex one be determinate and certain 3 cause of obscurity the cause of obscurity in simple idea seem to be either dull organ or very slight and transient impression make by the object or else a weakness in the memory not able to retain they as receive for to return again to visible object to help we to apprehend this matter if the organ or faculty of perception like wax over-hardened with cold will not receive the impression of the seal from the usual impulse wont to imprint it or like wax of a temper too soft will not hold it well when well imprinted or else suppose the wax of a temper fit but the seal not apply with a sufficient force to make a clear impression : in any of these case the print leave by the seal will be obscure this i suppose need no application to make it plainer 4 distinct and confused what as a clear idea be that whereof the mind have such a full and evident perception as it do receive from a outward object operating duly on a well-disposed organ so a distinct idea be that wherein the mind perceive a difference from all other and a confused idea be such a one as be not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it ought to be different 5 objection if no idea be confuse but such as be not sufficiently distinguishable from another from which it should be different it will be hard may any one say to find anywhere a confused idea for let any idea be as it will it can be no other but such as the mind perceive it to be and that very perception sufficiently distinguish it from all other idea which can not be other ie different without be perceive to be so no idea therefore can be undistinguishable from another from which it ought to be different unless you would have it different from itself : for from all other it be evidently different 6 confusion of idea be in reference to they name to remove this difficulty and to help we to conceive aright what it be that make the confusion idea be at any time chargeable with we must consider that thing rank under distinct name be suppose different enough to be distinguish that so each sort by its peculiar name may be marked and discourse of apart upon any occasion : and there be nothing more evident than that the greatest part of different name be suppose to stand for different thing now every idea a man have be visibly what it be and distinct from all other idea but itself that which make it confused be when it be such that it may as well be call by another name as that which it be express by the difference which keep the thing -lrb- to be rank under those two different name -rrb- distinct and make some of they belong rather to the one and some of they to the other of those name be leave out and so the distinction which be intend to be keep up by those different name be quite lose 7 default which make this confusion the default which usually occasion this confusion i think be chiefly these follow : first complex idea make up of too few simple one first when any complex idea -lrb- for it be complex idea that be most liable to confusion -rrb- be make up of too small a number of simple idea and such only as be common to other thing whereby the difference that make it deserve a different name be leave out thus he that have a idea make up of barely the simple one of a beast with spot have but a confused idea of a leopard it not be thereby sufficiently distinguish from a lynx and several other sort of beast that be spot so that such a idea though it have the peculiar name leopard be not distinguishable from those design by the name lynx or panther and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard how much the custom of define of word by general term contribute to make the idea we would express by they confused and undetermined i leave other to consider this be evident that confused idea be such as render the use of word uncertain and take away the benefit of distinct name when the idea for which we use different term have not a difference answerable to they distinct name and so can not be distinguish by they there it be that they be truly confused 8 secondly or they simple one jumble disorderly together secondly another fault which make we idea confuse be when though the particulars that make up any idea be in number enough yet they be so jumble together that it be not easily discernible whether it more belong to the name that be give it than to any other there be nothing properer to make we conceive this confusion than a sort of picture usually show as surprising piece of art wherein the color as they be lay by the pencil on the table itself mark out very odd and unusual figure and have no discernible order in they position this draught thus make up of part wherein no symmetry nor order appear be in itself no more a confused thing than the picture of a cloudy sky wherein though there be as little order of color or figure to be find yet nobody think it a confused picture what be it then that make it be think confused since the want of symmetry do not as it be plain it do not : for another draught make barely in imitation of this could not be call confused i answer that which make it be think confused be the apply it to some name to which it do no more discernibly belong than to some other : vg when it be say to be the picture of a man or caesar then any one with reason count it confused because it be not discernible in that state to belong more to the name man or caesar than to the name baboon or pompey : which be suppose to stand for different idea from those signify by man or caesar but when a cylindrical mirror place right have reduce those irregular line on the table into they due order and proportion then the confusion cease and the eye presently see that it be a man or caesar ie that it belong to those name and that it be sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon or pompey ie from the idea signify by those name just thus it be with we idea which be as it be the picture of thing no one of these mental draught however the part be put together can be call confused -lrb- for they be plainly discernible as they be -rrb- till it be rank under some ordinary name to which it can not be discern to belong any more than it do to some other name of a allow different signification 9 thirdly or they simple one mutable and undetermined thirdly a third defect that frequently give the name of confuse to we idea be when any one of they be uncertain and undetermined thus we may observe man who not forbear to use the ordinary word of they language till they have learn they precise signification change the idea they make this or that term stand for almost as often as they use it he that do this out of uncertainty of what he should leave out or put into he idea of church or idolatry every time he think of either and hold not steady to any one precise combination of idea that make it up be say to have a confused idea of idolatry or the church : though this be still for the same reason as the former viz because a mutable idea -lrb- if we will allow it to be one idea -rrb- can not belong to one name rather than another and so lose the distinction that distinct name be design for 10 confusion without reference to name hardly conceivable by what have be say we may observe how much name as suppose steady sign of thing and by they difference to stand for and keep thing distinct that in themselves be different be the occasion of denominate idea distinct or confuse by a secret and unobserved reference the mind make of its idea to such name this perhaps will be fuller understand after what i say of word in the third book have be read and consider but without take notice of such a reference of idea to distinct name as the sign of distinct thing it will be hard to say what a confused idea be and therefore when a man design by any name a sort of thing or any one particular thing distinct from all other the complex idea he annex to that name be the more distinct the more particular the idea be and the greater and more determinate the number and order of they be whereof it be make up for the more it have of these the more it have still of the perceivable difference whereby it be keep separate and distinct from all idea belong to other name even those that approach nearest to it and thereby all confusion with they be avoid 11 confusion concern always two idea confusion make it a difficulty to separate two thing that should be separate concern always two idea and those most which most approach one another whenever therefore we suspect any idea to be confuse we must examine what other it be in danger to be confound with or which it can not easily be separate from and that will always be find a idea belong to another name and so should be a different thing from which yet it be not sufficiently distinct : be either the same with it or make a part of it or at least as properly call by that name as the other it be rank under and so keep not that difference from that other idea which the different name import 12 cause of confused idea this i think be the confusion proper to idea which still carry with it a secret reference to name at least if there be any other confusion of idea this be that which most of all disorder man 's thought and discourse : idea as rank under name be those that for the most part man reason of within themselves and always those which they commune about with other and therefore where there be suppose two different idea mark by two different name which be not as distinguishable as the sound that stand for they there never fail to be confusion and where any idea be distinct as the idea of those two sound they be mark by there can be between they no confusion the way to prevent it be to collect and unite into one complex idea as precisely as be possible all those ingredient whereby it be difference from other and to they so unite in a determinate number and order apply steadily the same name but this neither accommodate man 's ease or vanity nor serve any design but that of naked truth which be not always the thing aim at such exactness be rather to be wish than hope for and since the loose application of name to undetermined variable and almost no idea serve both to cover we own ignorance as well as to perplex and confound other which go for learn and superiority in knowledge it be no wonder that most man should use it themselves whilst they complain of it in other though i think no small part of the confusion to be find in the notion of man might by care and ingenuity be avoid yet i be far from conclude it everywhere wilful some idea be so complex and make up of so many part that the memory do not easily retain the very same precise combination of simple idea under one name : much less be we able constantly to divine for what precise complex idea such a name stand in another man 's use of it from the first of these follow confusion in a man 's own reasoning and opinion within himself from the latter frequent confusion in discourse and argue with other but have more at large treat of word they defect and abuse in the follow book i shall here say no more of it 13 complex idea may be distinct in one part and confuse in another we complex idea be make up of collection and so variety of simple one may accordingly be very clear and distinct in one part and very obscure and confuse in another in a man who speak of a chiliaedron or a body of a thousand side the idea of the figure may be very confused though that of the number be very distinct so that he be able to discourse and demonstrate concern that part of he complex idea which depend upon the number of thousand he be apt to think he have a distinct idea of a chiliaedron though it be plain he have no precise idea of its figure so as to distinguish it by that from one that have but 999 side : the not observe whereof cause no small error in man 's thought and confusion in they discourse 14 this if not heed cause confusion in we arguing he that think he have a distinct idea of the figure of a chiliaedron let he for trial sake take another parcel of the same uniform matter viz gold or wax of a equal bulk and make it into a figure of 999 side he will i doubt not be able to distinguish these two idea one from another by the number of side and reason and argue distinctly about they whilst he keep he thought and reasoning to that part only of these idea which be contain in they number as that the side of the one could be divide into two equal number and of the other not & c but when he go about to distinguish they by they figure he will there be presently at a loss and not be able i think to frame in he mind two idea one of they distinct from the other by the bare figure of these two piece of gold as he could if the same parcel of gold be make one into a cube the other a figure of five side in which incomplete idea we be very apt to impose on ourselves and wrangle with other especially where they have particular and familiar name for be satisfy in that part of the idea which we have clear and the name which be familiar to we be apply to the whole contain that part also which be imperfect and obscure we be apt to use it for that confused part and draw deduction from it in the obscure part of its signification as confidently as we do from the other 15 instance in eternity have frequently in we mouth the name eternity we be apt to think we have a positive comprehensive idea of it which be as much as to say that there be no part of that duration which be not clearly contain in we idea it be true that he that think so may have a clear idea of duration he may also have a clear idea of a very great length of duration he may also have a clear idea of the comparison of that great one with still a greater : but it not be possible for he to include in he idea of any duration let it be as great as it will the whole extent together of a duration where he suppose no end that part of he idea which be still beyond the bound of that large duration he represent to he own thought be very obscure and undetermined and hence it be that in dispute and reasoning concern eternity or any other infinite we be very apt to blunder and involve ourselves in manifest absurdity 16 infinite divisibility of matter in matter we have no clear idea of the smallness of part much beyond the smallest that occur to any of we sens : and therefore when we talk of the divisibility of matter in infinitum though we have clear idea of division and divisibility and have also clear idea of part make out of a whole by division yet we have but very obscure and confused idea of corpuscle or minute body so to be divide when by former division they be reduce to a smallness much exceed the perception of any of we sens and so all that we have clear and distinct idea of be of what division in general or abstractedly be and the relation of totum and par : but of the bulk of the body to be thus infinitely divide after certain progression i think we have no clear nor distinct idea at all for i ask any one whether take the smallest atom of dust he ever see he have any distinct idea -lrb- bate still the number which concern not extension -rrb- betwixt the 100000th and the 1000000th part of it or if he think he can refine he idea to that degree without lose sight of they let he add ten cypher to each of those number such a degree of smallness be not unreasonable to be suppose since a division carry on so far bring it no nearer the end of infinite division than the first division into two half do i must confess for my part i have no clear distinct idea of the different bulk or extension of those body have but a very obscure one of either of they so that i think when we talk of division of body in infinitum we idea of they distinct bulk which be the subject and foundation of division come after a little progression to be confound and almost lose in obscurity for that idea which be to represent only bigness must be very obscure and confused which we can not distinguish from one ten time as big but only by number : so that we have clear distinct idea we may say of ten and one but no distinct idea of two such extension it be plain from hence that when we talk of infinite divisibility of body or extension we distinct and clear idea be only of number : but the clear distinct idea of extension after some progress of division be quite lose and of such minute part we have no distinct idea at all but it return as all we idea of infinite do at last to that of number always to be add but thereby never amount to any distinct idea of actual infinite part we have it be true a clear idea of division as often as we think of it but thereby we have no more a clear idea of infinite part in matter than we have a clear idea of a infinite number by be able still to add new number to any assigned number we have : endless divisibility give we no more a clear and distinct idea of actually infinite part than endless addibility -lrb- if i may so speak -rrb- give we a clear and distinct idea of a actually infinite number : they both be only in a power still of increase the number be it already as great as it will so that of what remain to be add -lrb- wherein consist the infinity -rrb- we have but a obscure imperfect and confused idea from or about which we can argue or reason with no certainty or clearness no more than we can in arithmetic about a number of which we have no such distinct idea as we have of 4 or 100 but only this relative obscure one that compare to any other it be still bigger : and we have no more a clear positive idea of it when we -lrb- drop line \* -rrb- than if we should say it be bigger than 40 or 4 : 400000000 have no nearer a proportion to the end of addition or number than 4 for he that add only 4 to 4 and so proceed shall as soon come to the end of all addition as he that add 400000000 to 400000000 and so likewise in eternity he that have a idea of but four year have as much a positive complete idea of eternity as he that have one of 400000000 of year : for what remain of eternity beyond either of these two number of year be as clear to the one as the other ie neither of they have any clear positive idea of it at all for he that add only 4 year to 4 and so on shall as soon reach eternity as he that add 400000000 of year and so on or if he please double the increase as often as he will : the remain abyss be still as far beyond the end of all these progression as it be from the length of a day or a hour for nothing finite bear any proportion to infinite and therefore we idea which be all finite can not bear any thus it be also in we idea of extension when we increase it by addition as well as when we diminish it by division and would enlarge we thought to infinite space after a few doubling of those idea of extension which be the largest we be accustom to have we lose the clear distinct idea of that space : it become a confusedly great one with a surplus of still greater about which when we would argue or reason we shall always find ourselves at a loss confuse idea in we arguing and deduction from that part of they which be confuse always lead we into confusion chapter xxx of real and fantastical idea 1 idea consider in reference to they archetype besides what we have already mention concern idea other consideration belong to they in reference to thing from whence they be take or which they may be suppose to represent and thus i think they may come under a threefold distinction and be : -- first either real or fantastical secondly adequate or inadequate thirdly true or false first by real idea i mean such as have a foundation in nature such as have a conformity with the real be and existence of thing or with they archetype fantastical or chimerical i call such as have no foundation in nature nor have any conformity with that reality of be to which they be tacitly refer as to they archetype if we examine the several sort of idea before mention we shall find that 2 simple idea be all real appearance of thing first we simple idea be all real all agree to the reality of thing : not that they be all of they the image or representation of what do exist the contrary whereof in all but the primary quality of body have be already show but though whiteness and coldness be no more in snow than pain be yet those idea of whiteness and coldness pain & c be in we the effect of power in thing without we ordain by we maker to produce in we such sensation they be real idea in we whereby we distinguish the quality that be really in thing themselves for these several appearance be design to be the mark whereby we be to know and distinguish thing which we have to do with we idea do as well serve we to that purpose and be as real distinguishing character whether they be only constant effect or else exact resemblance of something in the thing themselves : the reality lie in that steady correspondence they have with the distinct constitution of real being but whether they answer to those constitution as to cause or pattern it matter not it suffice that they be constantly produce by they and thus we simple idea be all real and true because they answer and agree to those power of thing which produce they on we mind that be all that be requisite to make they real and not fiction at pleasure for in simple idea -lrb- as have be show -rrb- the mind be wholly confine to the operation of thing upon it and can make to itself no simple idea more than what it be receive 3 complex idea be voluntary combination though the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple idea yet i think we may say it be not so in respect of its complex idea for those be combination of simple idea put together and unite under one general name it be plain that the mind of man use some kind of liberty in form those complex idea : how else come it to pass that one man 's idea of gold or justice be different from another 's but because he have put in or leave out of he some simple idea which the other have not the question then be which of these be real and which barely imaginary combination what collection agree to the reality of thing and what not and to this i say that 4 mixed mode and relation make of consistent idea be real secondly mixed mode and relation have no other reality but what they have in the mind of man there be nothing more require to this kind of idea to make they real but that they be so frame that there be a possibility of exist conformable to they these idea themselves be archetype can not differ from they archetype and so can not be chimerical unless any one will jumble together in they inconsistent idea indeed as any of they have the name of a known language assign to they by which he that have they in he mind would signify they to other so bare possibility of exist be not enough they must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name that be give they that they may not be think fantastical : as if a man would give the name of justice to that idea which common use call liberality but this fantasticalness relate more to propriety of speech than reality of idea for a man to be undisturbed in danger sedately to consider what be fittest to be do and to execute it steadily be a mixed mode or a complex idea of a action which may exist but to be undisturbed in danger without use one 's reason or industry be what be also possible to be and so be as real a idea as the other though the first of these have the name courage give to it may in respect of that name be a right or wrong idea but the other whilst it have not a common receive name of any known language assign to it be not capable of any deformity be make with no reference to anything but itself 5 complex idea of substance be real when they agree with the existence of thing thirdly we complex idea of substance be make all of they in reference to thing exist without we and intend to be representation of substance as they really be be no further real than as they be such combination of simple idea as be really unite and co-exist in thing without we on the contrary those be fantastical which be make up of such collection of simple idea as be really never unite never be find together in any substance : v g a rational creature consist of a horse 's head join to a body of human shape or such as the centaur be describe : or a body yellow very malleable fusible and fixed but lighter than common water : or a uniform unorganized body consist as to sense all of similar part with perception and voluntary motion join to it whether such substance as these can possibly exist or no it be probable we do not know : but be that as it will these idea of substance be make conformable to no pattern exist that we know and consist of such collection of idea as no substance ever show we unite together they ought to pass with we for barely imaginary : but much more be those complex idea so which contain in they any inconsistency or contradiction of they part chapter xxxi of adequate and inadequate idea 1 adequate idea be such as perfectly represent they archetype of we real idea some be adequate and some be inadequate those i call adequate which perfectly represent those archetype which the mind suppose they take from : which it intend they to stand for and to which it refer they inadequate idea be such which be but a partial or incomplete representation of those archetype to which they be refer upon which account it be plain 2 adequate idea be such as perfectly represent they archetype simple idea all adequate first that all we simple idea be adequate because be nothing but the effect of certain power in thing fit and ordain by god to produce such sensation in we they can not but be correspondent and adequate to those power : and we be sure they agree to the reality of thing for if sugar produce in we the idea which we call whiteness and sweetness we be sure there be a power in sugar to produce those idea in we mind or else they could not have be produce by it and so each sensation answer the power that operate on any of we sens the idea so produce be a real idea -lrb- and not a fiction of the mind which have no power to produce any simple idea -rrb- and can not but be adequate since it ought only to answer that power : and so all simple idea be adequate it be true the thing produce in we these simple idea be but few of they denominate by we as if they be only the cause of they but as if those idea be real being in they for though fire be call painful to the touch whereby be signify the power of produce in we the idea of pain yet it be denominate also light and hot as if light and heat be really something in the fire more than a power to excite these idea in we and therefore be call quality in or of the fire but these be nothing in truth but power to excite such idea in we i must in that sense be understand when i speak of secondary quality as be in thing or of they idea as be the object that excite they in we such way of speak though accommodate to the vulgar notion without which one can not be well understand yet truly signify nothing but those power which be in thing to excite certain sensation or idea in we since be there no fit organ to receive the impression fire make on the sight and touch nor a mind join to those organ to receive the idea of light and heat by those impression from the fire or sun there would yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be pain if there be no sensible creature to feel it though the sun should continue just as it be now and mount aetna flame higher than ever it do solidity and extension and the termination of it figure with motion and rest whereof we have the idea would be really in the world as they be whether there be any sensible be to perceive they or no : and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real modification of matter and such as be the exciting cause of all we various sensation from body but this be a inquiry not belong to this place i shall enter no further into it but proceed to show what complex idea be adequate and what not 3 mode be all adequate secondly we complex idea of mode be voluntary collection of simple idea which the mind put together without reference to any real archetype or stand pattern exist anywhere be and can not but be adequate idea because they not be intend for copy of thing really exist but for archetype make by the mind to rank and denominate thing by can not want anything they have each of they that combination of idea and thereby that perfection which the mind intend they should : so that the mind acquiesce in they and can find nothing want thus by have the idea of a figure with three side meet at three angle i have a complete idea wherein i require nothing else to make it perfect that the mind be satisfy with the perfection of this its idea be plain in that it do not conceive that any understanding have or can have a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signify by the word triangle suppose it to exist than itself have in that complex idea of three side and three angle in which be contain all that be or can be essential to it or necessary to complete it wherever or however it exist but in we idea of substance it be otherwise for there desire to copy thing as they really do exist and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all they property depend we perceive we idea attain not that perfection we intend : we find they still want something we should be glad be in they and so be all inadequate but mixed mode and relation be archetype without pattern and so have nothing to represent but themselves can not but be adequate everything be so to itself he that at first put together the idea of danger perceive absence of disorder from fear sedate consideration of what be justly to be do and execute that without disturbance or be deter by the danger of it have certainly in he mind that complex idea make up of that combination : and intend it to be nothing else but what be nor to have in it any other simple idea but what it have it could not also but be a adequate idea : and lay this up in he memory with the name courage annex to it to signify to other and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it have thereby a standard to measure and denominate action by as they agree to it this idea thus make and lay up for a pattern must necessarily be adequate be refer to nothing else but itself nor make by any other original but the good liking and will of he that first make this combination 4 mode in reference to settle name may be inadequate indeed another come after and in conversation learning from he the word courage may make a idea to which he give the name courage different from what the first author apply it to and have in he mind when he use it and in this case if he design that he idea in think should be conformable to the other 's idea as the name he use in speaking be conformable in sound to he from whom he learn it he idea may be very wrong and inadequate : because in this case make the other man 's idea the pattern of he idea in think as the other man 's word or sound be the pattern of he in speak he idea be so far defective and inadequate as it be distant from the archetype and pattern he refer it to and intend to express and signify by the name he use for it which name he would have to be a sign of the other man 's idea -lrb- to which in its proper use it be primarily annex -rrb- and of he own as agree to it : to which if he own do not exactly correspond it be faulty and inadequate 5 because then mean in propriety of speech to correspond to the idea in some other mind therefore these complex idea of mode which they be refer by the mind and intend to correspond to the idea in the mind of some other intelligent be express by the name we apply to they they may be very deficient wrong and inadequate because they agree not to that which the mind design to be they archetype and pattern : in which respect only any idea of mode can be wrong imperfect or inadequate and on this account we idea of mixed mode be the most liable to be faulty of any other but this refer more to proper speaking than know right 6 idea of substance as refer to real essence not adequate thirdly what idea we have of substance i have above show now those idea have in the mind a double reference : 1 sometimes they be refer to a suppose real essence of each species of thing 2 sometimes they be only design to be picture and representation in the mind of thing that do exist by idea of those quality that be discoverable in they in both which way these copy of those original and archetype be imperfect and inadequate first it be usual for man to make the name of substance stand for thing as suppose to have certain real essence whereby they be of this or that species : and name stand for nothing but the idea that be in man 's mind they must constantly refer they idea to such real essence as to they archetype that man -lrb- especially such as have be breed up in the learning teach in this part of the world -rrb- do suppose certain specific essence of substance which each individual in its several kind be make conformable to and partake of be so far from need proof that it will be think strange if any one should do otherwise and thus they ordinarily apply the specific name they rank particular substance under to thing as distinguish by such specific real essence who be there almost who would not take it amiss if it should be doubt whether he call himself a man with any other meaning than as have the real essence of a man and yet if you demand what those real essence be it be plain man be ignorant and know they not from whence it follow that the idea they have in they mind be refer to real essence as to archetype which be unknown must be so far from be adequate that they can not be suppose to be any representation of they at all the complex idea we have of substance be as it have be show certain collection of simple idea that have be observe or suppose constantly to exist together but such a complex idea can not be the real essence of any substance for then the property we discover in that body would depend on that complex idea and be deducible from it and they necessary connexion with it be know as all property of a triangle depend on and as far as they be discoverable be deducible from the complex idea of three line include a space but it be plain that in we complex idea of substance be not contain such idea on which all the other quality that be to be find in they do depend the common idea man have of iron be a body of a certain color weight and hardness and a property that they look on as belong to it be malleableness but yet this property have no necessary connexion with that complex idea or any part of it : and there be no more reason to think that malleableness depend on that color weight and hardness than that color or that weight depend on its malleableness and yet though we know nothing of these real essence there be nothing more ordinary than that man should attribute the sort of thing to such essence the particular parcel of matter which make the ring i have on my finger be forwardly by most man suppose to have a real essence whereby it be gold and from whence those quality flow which i find in it viz its peculiar color weight hardness fusibility fixedness and change of color upon a slight touch of mercury & c this essence from which all these property flow when i inquire into it and search after it i plainly perceive i can not discover : the furthest i can go be only to presume that it be nothing but body its real essence or internal constitution on which these quality depend can be nothing but the figure size and connexion of its solid part of neither of which have any distinct perception at all can i have any idea of its essence : which be the cause that it have that particular shine yellowness a greater weight than anything i know of the same bulk and a fitness to have its color change by the touch of quicksilver if any one will say that the real essence and internal constitution on which these property depend be not the figure size and arrangement or connexion of its solid part but something else call its particular form i be further from have any idea of its real essence than i be before for i have a idea of figure size and situation of solid part in general though i have none of the particular figure size or put together of part whereby the quality above mention be produce which quality i find in that particular parcel of matter that be on my finger and not in another parcel of matter with which i cut the pen i write with but when i be tell that something besides the figure size and posture of the solid part of that body in its essence something call substantial form of that i confess i have no idea at all but only of the sound form which be far enough from a idea of its real essence or constitution the like ignorance as i have of the real essence of this particular substance i have also of the real essence of all other natural one : of which essence i confess i have no distinct idea at all and i be apt to suppose other when they examine they own knowledge will find in themselves in this one point the same sort of ignorance 7 because man know not the real essence of substance now then when man apply to this particular parcel of matter on my finger a general name already in use and denominate it gold do they not ordinarily or be they not understand to give it that name as belong to a particular species of body have a real internal essence by have of which essence this particular substance come to be of that species and to be call by that name if it be so as it be plain it be the name by which thing be mark as have that essence must be refer primarily to that essence and consequently the idea to which that name be give must be refer also to that essence and be intend to represent it which essence since they who so use the name know not they idea of substance must be all inadequate in that respect as not contain in they that real essence which the mind intend they should 8 idea of substance when regard as collection of they quality be all inadequate secondly those who neglect that useless supposition of unknown real essence whereby they be distinguish endeavor to copy the substance that exist in the world by put together the idea of those sensible quality which be find co-exist in they though they come much nearer a likeness of they than those who imagine they know not what real specific essence : yet they arrive not at perfectly adequate idea of those substance they would thus copy into they mind : nor do those copy exactly and fully contain all that be to be find in they archetype because those quality and power of substance whereof we make they complex idea be so many and various that no man 's complex idea contain they all that we complex idea of substance do not contain in they all the simple idea that be unite in the thing themselves be evident in that man do rarely put into they complex idea of any substance all the simple idea they do know to exist in it because endeavor to make the signification of they name as clear and as little cumbersome as they can they make they specific idea of the sort of substance for the most part of a few of those simple idea which be to be find in they : but these have no original precedency or right to be put in and make the specific idea more than other that be leave out it be plain that both these way we idea of substance be deficient and inadequate the simple idea whereof we make we complex one of substance be all of they -lrb- bate only the figure and bulk of some sort -rrb- power which be relation to other substance we can never be sure that we know all the power that be in any one body till we have try what change it be fit to give to or receive from other substance in they several way of application : which be impossible to be try upon any one body much less upon all it be impossible we should have adequate idea of any substance make up of a collection of all its property 9 they power usually make up we complex idea of substance whosoever first light on a parcel of that sort of substance we denote by the word gold could not rationally take the bulk and figure he observe in that lump to depend on its real essence or internal constitution therefore those never go into he idea of that species of body but its peculiar color perhaps and weight be the first he abstract from it to make the complex idea of that species which both be but power the one to affect we eye after such a manner and to produce in we that idea we call yellow and the other to force upward any other body of equal bulk they be put into a pair of equal scale one against another another perhaps add to these the idea of fusibility and fixedness two other passive power in relation to the operation of fire upon it another its ductility and solubility in aqua regium two other power relate to the operation of other body in change its outward figure or separation of it into insensible part these or part of these put together usually make the complex idea in man 's mind of that sort of body we call gold 10 substance have innumerable power not contain in we complex idea of they but no one who have consider the property of body in general or this sort in particular can doubt that this call gold have infinite other property not contain in that complex idea some who have examine this species more accurately could i believe enumerate ten time as many property in gold all of they as inseparable from its internal constitution as its color or weight : and it be probable if any one know all the property that be by diver man know of this metal there would be a hundred time as many idea go to the complex idea of gold as any one man yet have in he and yet perhaps that not be the thousandth part of what be to be discover in it the change that that one body be apt to receive and make in other body upon a due application exceed far not only what we know but what we be apt to imagine which will not appear so much a paradox to any one who will but consider how far man be yet from know all the property of that one no very compound figure a triangle though it be no small number that be already by mathematician discover of it 11 idea of substance be get only by collect they quality be all inadequate so that all we complex idea of substance be imperfect and inadequate which would be so also in mathematical figure if we be to have we complex idea of they only by collect they property in reference to other figure how uncertain and imperfect would we idea be of a ellipsis if we have no other idea of it but some few of its property whereas have in we plain idea the whole essence of that figure we from thence discover those property and demonstratively see how they flow and be inseparable from it 12 simple idea -lrb- word in greek -rrb- and adequate thus the mind have three sort of abstract idea or nominal essence : first simple idea which be -lrb- word in greek -rrb- or copy but yet certainly adequate because be intend to express nothing but the power in thing to produce in the mind such a sensation that sensation when it be produce can not but be the effect of that power so the paper i write on have the power in the light -lrb- i speak accord to the common notion of light -rrb- to produce in man the sensation which i call white it can not but be the effect of such a power in something without the mind since the mind have not the power to produce any such idea in itself : and be mean for nothing else but the effect of such a power that simple idea be -lrb- \* word miss -rrb- the sensation of white in my mind be the effect of that power which be in the paper to produce it be perfectly adequate to that power or else that power would produce a different idea 13 idea of substance be echthypa and inadequate secondly the complex idea of substance be ectypes copy too but not perfect one not adequate : which be very evident to the mind in that it plainly perceive that whatever collection of simple idea it make of any substance that exist it can not be sure that it exactly answer all that be in that substance since not have try all the operation of all other substance upon it and find all the alteration it would receive from or cause in other substance it can not have a exact adequate collection of all its active and passive capacity and so not have a adequate complex idea of the power of any substance exist and its relation which be that sort of complex idea of substance we have and after all if we would have and actually have in we complex idea a exact collection of all the secondary quality or power of any substance we should not yet thereby have a idea of the essence of that thing for since the power or quality that be observable by we be not the real essence of that substance but depend on it and flow from it any collection whatsoever of these quality can not be the real essence of that thing whereby it be plain that we idea of substance be not adequate be not what the mind intend they to be besides a man have no idea of substance in general nor know what substance be in itself 14 idea of mode and relation be archetype and can not be adequate thirdly complex idea of mode and relation be original and archetype be not copy nor make after the pattern of any real existence to which the mind intend they to be conformable and exactly to answer these be such collection of simple idea that the mind itself put together and such collection that each of they contain in it precisely all that the mind intend that it should they be archetype and essence of mode that may exist and so be design only for and bele only to such mode as when they do exist have a exact conformity with those complex idea the idea therefore of mode and relation can not but be adequate chapter xxxii of true and false idea 1 truth and falsehood properly belong to proposition not to idea though truth and falsehood belong in propriety of speech only to proposition : yet idea be oftentimes term true or false -lrb- as what word be there that be not use with great latitude and with some deviation from they strict and proper signification -rrb- though i think that when idea themselves be term true or false there be still some secret or tacit proposition which be the foundation of that denomination : as we shall see if we examine the particular occasion wherein they come to be call true or false in all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation which be the reason of that denomination for we idea be nothing but bare appearance or perception in we mind can not properly and simply in themselves be say to be true or false no more than a single name of anything can be say to be true or false 2 idea and word may be say to be true inasmuch as they really be idea and word indeed both idea and word may be say to be true in a metaphysical sense of the word truth as all other thing that any way exist be say to be true ie really to be such as they exist though in thing call true even in that sense there be perhaps a secret reference to we idea look upon as the standard of that truth which amount to a mental proposition though it be usually not take notice of 3 no idea as a appearance in the mind either true or false but it be not in that metaphysical sense of truth which we inquire here when we examine whether we idea be capable of be true or false but in the more ordinary acceptation of those word : and so i say that the idea in we mind be only so many perception or appearance there none of they be false the idea of a centaur have no more falsehood in it when it appear in we mind than the name centaur have falsehood in it when it be pronounce by we mouth or write on paper for truth or falsehood lie always in some affirmation or negation mental or verbal we idea be not capable any of they of be false till the mind pass some judgment on they that be affirm or deny something of they 4 idea refer to anything extraneous to they may be true or false whenever the mind refer any of its idea to anything extraneous to they they be then capable to be call true or false because the mind in such a reference make a tacit supposition of they conformity to that thing which supposition as it happen to be true or false so the idea themselves come to be denominate the most usual case wherein this happen be these follow : 5 other man 's idea real existence and suppose real essence be what man usually refer they idea to first when the mind suppose any idea it have conformable to that in other man 's mind call by the same common name vg when the mind intend or judge its idea of justice temperance religion to be the same with what other man give those name to secondly when the mind suppose any idea it have in itself to be conformable to some real existence thus the two idea of a man and a centaur suppose to be the idea of real substance be the one true and the other false the one have a conformity to what have really exist the other not thirdly when the mind refer any of its idea to that real constitution and essence of anything whereon all its property depend : and thus the greatest part if not all we idea of substance be false 6 the cause of such reference these supposition the mind be very apt tacitly to make concern its own idea but yet if we will examine it we shall find it be chiefly if not only concern its abstract complex idea for the natural tendency of the mind be towards knowledge and finding that if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular thing its progress would be very slow and its work endless therefore to shorten its way to knowledge and make each perception more comprehensive the first thing it do as the foundation of the easier enlarge its knowledge either by contemplation of the thing themselves that it would know or conference with other about they be to bind they into bundle and rank they so into sort that what knowledge it get of any of they it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort and so advance by larger step in that which be its great business knowledge this as i have elsewhere show be the reason why we collect thing under comprehensive idea with name annex to they into genus and species ie into kind and sort 7 name of thing suppose to carry in they knowledge of they essence if therefore we will warily attend to the motion of the mind and observe what course it usually take in its way to knowledge we shall i think find that the mind have get a idea which it think it may have use of either in contemplation or discourse the first thing it do be to abstract it and then get a name to it an so lay it up in its storehouse the memory as contain the essence of a sort of thing of which that name be always to be the mark hence it be that we may often observe that when any one see a new thing of a kind that he know not he presently ask what it be mean by that inquiry nothing but the name as if the name carry with it the knowledge of the species or the essence of it whereof it be indeed use as the mark and be generally suppose annex to it 8 how man suppose that they idea must correspond to thing and to the customary meaning of name but this abstract idea be something in the mind between the thing that exist and the name that be give to it it be in we idea that both the rightness of we knowledge and the propriety and intelligibleness of we speaking consist and hence it be that man be so forward to suppose that the abstract idea they have in they mind be such as agree to the thing exist without they to which they be refer and be the same also to which the name they give they do by the use and propriety of that language belong for without this double conformity of they idea they find they should both think amiss of thing in themselves and talk of they unintelligibly to other 9 simple idea may be false in reference to other of the same name but be least liable to be so first then i say that when the truth of we idea be judge of by the conformity they have to the idea which other man have and commonly signify by the same name they may be any of they false but yet simple idea be least of all liable to be so mistaken because a man by he sens and every day 's observation may easily satisfy himself what the simple idea be which they several name that be in common use stand for they be but few in number and such as if he doubt or mistake in he may easily rectify by the object they be to be find in therefore it be seldom that any one mistake in he name of simple idea or apply the name red to the idea green or the name sweet to the idea bitter : much less be man apt to confound the name of idea belong to different sens and call a color by the name of a taste & c whereby it be evident that the simple idea they call by any name be commonly the same that other have and mean when they use the same name 10 idea of mixed mode most liable to be false in this sense complex idea be much more liable to be false in this respect and the complex idea of mixed mode much more than those of substance because in substance -lrb- especially those which the common and unborrowed name of any language be apply to -rrb- some remarkable sensible quality serve ordinarily to distinguish one sort from another easily preserve those who take any care in the use of they word from apply they to sort of substance to which they do not at all belong but in mixed mode we be much more uncertain it be not so easy to determine of several action whether they be to be call justice or cruelty liberality or prodigality and so in refer we idea to those of other man call by the same name ours may be false and the idea in we mind which we express by the word justice may perhaps be that which ought to have another name 11 or at least to be think false but whether or no we idea of mixed mode be more liable than any sort to be different from those of other man which be mark by the same name this at least be certain that this sort of falsehood be much more familiarly attribute to we idea of mixed mode than to any other when a man be think to have a false idea of justice or gratitude or glory it be for no other reason but that he agree not with the idea which each of those name be the sign of in other man 12 and why the reason whereof seem to I to be this : that the abstract idea of mixed mode be man 's voluntary combination of such a precise collection of simple idea and so the essence of each species be make by man alone whereof we have no other sensible standard exist anywhere but the name itself or the definition of that name we have nothing else to refer these we idea of mixed mode to as a standard to which we would conform they but the idea of those who be think to use those name in they most proper signification and so as we idea conform or differ from they they pass for true or false and thus much concern the truth and falsehood of we idea in reference to they name 13 as refer to real existence none of we idea can be false but those of substance secondly as to the truth and falsehood of we idea in reference to the real existence of thing when that be make the standard of they truth none of they can be term false but only we complex idea of substance 14 first simple idea in this sense not false and why first we simple idea be barely such perception as god have fit we to receive and give power to external object to produce in we by establish law and way suitable to he wisdom and goodness though incomprehensible to we they truth consist in nothing else but in such appearance as be produce in we and must be suitable to those power he have place in external object or else they could not be produce in we : and thus answer those power they be what they should be true idea nor do they become liable to any imputation of falsehood if the mind -lrb- as in most man i believe it do -rrb- judge these idea to be in the thing themselves for god in he wisdom have set they as mark of distinction in thing whereby we may be able to discern one thing from another and so choose any of they for we use as we have occasion it alter not the nature of we simple idea whether we think that the idea of blue be in the violet itself or in we mind only and only the power of produce it by the texture of its part reflect the particle of light after a certain manner to be in the violet itself for that texture in the object by a regular and constant operation produce the same idea of blue in we it serve we to distinguish by we eye that from any other thing whether that distinguish mark as it be really in the violet be only a peculiar texture of part or else that very color the idea whereof -lrb- which be in we -rrb- be the exact resemblance and it be equally from that appearance to be denominate blue whether it be that real color or only a peculiar texture in it that cause in we that idea : since the name blue note properly nothing but that mark of distinction that be in a violet discernible only by we eye whatever it consist in that be beyond we capacity distinctly to know and perhaps would be of less use to we if we have faculty to discern 15 though one man 's idea of blue should be different from another 's neither would it carry any imputation of falsehood to we simple idea if by the different structure of we organ it be so order that the same object should produce in several man 's mind different idea at the same time vg if the idea that a violet produce in one man 's mind by he eye be the same that a marigold produce in another man 's and vice versa for since this could never be know because one man 's mind could not pass into another man 's body to perceive what appearance be produce by those organ neither the idea hereby nor the name would be at all confound or any falsehood be in either for all thing that have the texture of a violet produce constantly the idea that he call blue and those which have the texture of a marigold produce constantly the idea which he as constantly call yellow whatever those appearance be in he mind he would be able as regularly to distinguish thing for he use by those appearance and understand and signify those distinction mark by the name blue and yellow as if the appearance or idea in he mind receive from those two flower be exactly the same with the idea in other man 's mind i be nevertheless very apt to think that the sensible idea produce by any object in different man 's mind be most commonly very near and undiscernibly alike for which opinion i think there might be many reason offer : but that be besides my present business i shall not trouble my reader with they but only mind he that the contrary supposition if it could be prove be of little use either for the improvement of we knowledge or conveniency of life and so we need not trouble ourselves to examine it 16 simple idea can none of they be false in respect of real existence from what have be say concern we simple idea i think it evident that we simple idea can none of they be false in respect of thing exist without we for the truth of these appearance or perception in we mind consist as have be say only in they be answerable to the power in external object to produce by we sens such appearance in we and each of they be in the mind such as it be suitable to the power that produce it and which alone it represent it can not upon that account or as refer to such a pattern be false blue and yellow bitter or sweet can never be false idea : these perception in the mind be just such as they be there answer the power appoint by god to produce they and so be truly what they be and be intend to be indeed the name may be misapply but that in this respect make no falsehood in the idea as if a man ignorant in the english tongue should call purple scarlet 17 secondly mode not false can not be false in reference to essence of thing secondly neither can we complex idea of mode in reference to the essence of anything really exist be false because whatever complex idea i have of any mode it have no reference to any pattern exist and make by nature it be not suppose to contain in it any other idea than what it have nor to represent anything but such a complication of idea as it do thus when i have the idea of such a action of a man who forbear to afford himself such meat drink and clothing and other convenience of life as he riches and estate will be sufficient to supply and he station require i have no false idea but such a one as represent a action either as i find or imagine it and so be capable of neither truth nor falsehood but when i give the name frugality or virtue to this action then it may be call a false idea if thereby it be suppose to agree with that idea to which in propriety of speech the name of frugality doth belong or to be conformable to that law which be the standard of virtue and vice 18 thirdly idea of substance may be false in reference to exist thing thirdly we complex idea of substance be all refer to pattern in thing themselves may be false that they be all false when look upon as the representation of the unknown essence of thing be so evident that there need nothing to be say of it i shall therefore pass over that chimerical supposition and consider they as collection of simple idea in the mind take from combination of simple idea exist together constantly in thing of which pattern they be the suppose copy and in this reference of they to the existence of thing they be false idea : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- when they put together simple idea which in the real existence of thing have no union as when to the shape and size that exist together in a horse be join in the same complex idea the power of bark like a dog : which three idea however put together into one in the mind be never unite in nature and this therefore may be call a false idea of a horse -lrb- 2 -rrb- idea of substance be in this respect also false when from any collection of simple idea that do always exist together there be separate by a direct negation any other simple idea which be constantly join with they thus if to extension solidity fusibility the peculiar weightiness and yellow color of gold any one join in he thought the negation of a greater degree of fixedness than be in lead or copper he may be say to have a false complex idea as well as when he join to those other simple one the idea of perfect absolute fixedness for either way the complex idea of gold be make up of such simple one as have no union in nature may be term false but if he leave out of this he complex idea that of fixedness quite without either actually join to or separate it from the rest in he mind it be i think to be look on as a inadequate and imperfect idea rather than a false one since though it contain not all the simple idea that be unite in nature yet it put none together but what do really exist together 19 truth or falsehood always suppose affirmation or negation though in compliance with the ordinary way of speak i have show in what sense and upon what ground we idea may be sometimes call true or false yet if we will look a little nearer into the matter in all case where any idea be call true or false it be from some judgment that the mind make or be suppose to make that be true or false for truth or falsehood be never without some affirmation or negation express or tacit it be not to be find but where sign be join or separate accord to the agreement or disagreement of the thing they stand for the sign we chiefly use be either idea or word wherewith we make either mental or verbal proposition truth lie in so join or separate these representative as the thing they stand for do in themselves agree or disagree and falsehood in the contrary as shall be more fully show hereafter 20 idea in themselves neither true nor false any idea then which we have in we mind whether conformable or not to the existence of thing or to any idea in the mind of other man can not properly for this alone be call false for these representation if they have nothing in they but what be really exist in thing without can not be think false be exact representation of something : nor yet if they have anything in they differ from the reality of thing can they properly be say to be false representation or idea of thing they do not represent but the mistake and falsehood be : 21 but be false -- 1 when judge agreeable to another man 's idea without be so first when the mind have any idea it judge and conclude it the same that be in other man 's mind signify by the same name or that it be conformable to the ordinary receive signification or definition of that word when indeed it be not : which be the most usual mistake in mixed mode though other idea also be liable to it 22 secondly when judge to agree to real existence when they do not -lrb- 2 -rrb- when it have a complex idea make up of such a collection of simple one as nature never put together it judge it to agree to a species of creature really exist as when it join the weight of tin to the color fusibility and fixedness of gold 23 thirdly when judge adequate without be so -lrb- 3 -rrb- when in its complex idea it have unite a certain number of simple idea that do really exist together in some sort of creature but have also leave out other as much inseparable it judge this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of thing which really it be not vg have join the idea of substance yellow malleable most heavy and fusible it take that complex idea to be the complete idea of gold when yet its peculiar fixedness and solubility in aqua regium be as inseparable from those other idea or quality of that body as they be one from another 24 fourthly when judge to represent the real essence -lrb- 4 -rrb- the mistake be yet greater when i judge that this complex idea contain in it the real essence of any body exist when at least it contain but some few of those property which flow from its real essence and constitution i say only some few of those property for those property consist mostly in the active and passive power it have in reference to other thing all that be vulgarly know of any one body of which the complex idea of that kind of thing be usually make be but a very few in comparison of what a man that have several way try and examine it know of that one sort of thing and all that the most expert man know be but a few in comparison of what be really in that body and depend on its internal or essential constitution the essence of a triangle lie in a very little compass consist in a very few idea : three line include a space make up that essence : but the property that flow from this essence be more than can be easily know or enumerate so i imagine it be in substance they real essence lie in a little compass though the property flow from that internal constitution be endless 25 idea when call false to conclude a man have no notion of anything without he but by the idea he have of it in he mind -lrb- which idea he have a power to call by what name he please -rrb- he may indeed make a idea neither answer the reason of thing nor agree to the idea commonly signify by other people 's word but can not make a wrong or false idea of a thing which be no otherwise know to he but by the idea he have of it : vg when i frame a idea of the leg arm and body of a man and join to this a horse 's head and neck i do not make a false idea of anything because it represent nothing without I but when i call it a man or tartar and imagine it to represent some real be without I or to be the same idea that other call by the same name in either of these case i may err and upon this account it be that it come to be term a false idea though indeed the falsehood lie not in the idea but in that tacit mental proposition wherein a conformity and resemblance be attribute to it which it have not but yet if have frame such a idea in my mind without think either that existence or the name man or tartar belong to it i will call it man or tartar i may be justly think fantastical in the naming but not erroneous in my judgment nor the idea any way false 26 more properly to be call right or wrong upon the whole matter i think that we idea as they be consider by the mind -- either in reference to the proper signification of they name or in reference to the reality of thing -- may very fitly be call right or wrong idea accord as they agree or disagree to those pattern to which they be refer but if any one have rather call they true or false it be fit he use a liberty which every one have to call thing by those name he think best though in propriety of speech truth or falsehood will i think scarce agree to they but as they some way or other virtually contain in they some mental proposition the idea that be in a man 's mind simply consider can not be wrong unless complex one wherein inconsistent part be jumble together all other idea be in themselves right and the knowledge about they right and true knowledge but when we come to refer they to anything as to they pattern and archetype then they be capable of be wrong as far as they disagree with such archetype chapter xxxiii of the association of idea 1 something unreasonable in most man there be scarce any one that do not observe something that seem odd to he and be in itself really extravagant in the opinion reasoning and action of other man the least flaw of this kind if at all different from he own every one be quick-sighted enough to espy in another and will by the authority of reason forwardly condemn though he be guilty of much greater unreasonableness in he own tenet and conduct which he never perceive and will very hardly if at all be convince of 2 not wholly from self-love this proceed not wholly from self-love though that have often a great hand in it man of fair mind and not give up to the overweening of self-flattery be frequently guilty of it and in many case one with amazement hear the arguing and be astonish at the obstinacy of a worthy man who yield not to the evidence of reason though lay before he as clear as daylight 3 not from education this sort of unreasonableness be usually imputed to education and prejudice and for the most part truly enough though that reach not the bottom of the disease nor show distinctly enough whence it rise or wherein it lie education be often rightly assign for the cause and prejudice be a good general name for the thing itself : but yet i think he ought to look a little further who would trace this sort of madness to the root it spring from and so explain it as to show whence this flaw have its original in very sober and rational mind and wherein it consist 4 a degree of madness find in most man i shall be pardon for call it by so harsh a name as madness when it be consider that opposition to reason deserve that name and be really madness and there be scarce a man so free from it but that if he should always on all occasion argue or do as in some case he constantly do would not be think fitter for bedlam than civil conversation i do not here mean when he be under the power of a unruly passion but in the steady calm course of he life that which will yet more apologize for this harsh name and ungrateful imputation on the greatest part of mankind be that inquire a little by the bye into the nature of madness -lrb- b ii ch xi section 13 -rrb- i find it to spring from the very same root and to depend on the very same cause we be here speak of this consideration of the thing itself at a time when i think not i the least on the subject which i be now treat of suggest it to I and if this be a weakness to which all man be so liable if this be a taint which so universally infect mankind the greater care should be take to lay it open under its due name thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure 5 from a wrong connexion of idea some of we idea have a natural correspondence and connexion one with another : it be the office and excellency of we reason to trace these and hold they together in that union and correspondence which be found in they peculiar being besides this there be another connexion of idea wholly owe to chance or custom idea that in themselves be not all of kin come to be so unite in some man 's mind that it be very hard to separate they they always keep in company and the one no sooner at any time come into the understanding but its associate appear with it and if they be more than two which be thus unite the whole gang always inseparable show themselves together 6 this connexion make by custom this strong combination of idea not ally by nature the mind make in itself either voluntarily or by chance and hence it come in different man to be very different accord to they different inclination education interest & c custom settle habit of think in the understanding as well as of determine in the will and of motion in the body : all which seem to be but train of motion in the animal spirit which once set a go continue in the same step they have be use to which by often tread be wear into a smooth path and the motion in it become easy and as it be natural as far as we can comprehend think thus idea seem to be produce in we mind or if they be not this may serve to explain they follow one another in a habitual train when once they be put into they track as well as it do to explain such motion of the body a musician use to any tune will find that let it but once begin in he head the idea of the several note of it will follow one another orderly in he understanding without any care or attention as regularly as he finger move orderly over the key of the organ to play out the tune he have begin though he unattentive thought be elsewhere a wander whether the natural cause of these idea as well as of that regular dancing of he finger be the motion of he animal spirit i will not determine how probable soever by this instance it appear to be so : but this may help we a little to conceive of intellectual habit and of the tie together of idea 7 some antipathy a effect of it that there be such association of they make by custom in the mind of most man i think nobody will question who have well consider himself or other and to this perhaps might be justly attribute most of the sympathy and antipathy observable in man which work as strongly and produce as regular effect as if they be natural and be therefore call so though they at first have no other original but the accidental connexion of two idea which either the strength of the first impression or future indulgence so unite that they always afterwards keep company together in that man 's mind as if they be but one idea i say most of the antipathy i do not say all for some of they be truly natural depend upon we original constitution and be bear with we but a great part of those which be count natural would have be know to be from unheeded though perhaps early impression or wanton fancy at first which would have be acknowledge the original of they if they have be warily observe a grow person surfeit with honey no sooner hear the name of it but he fancy immediately carry sickness and qualm to he stomach and he can not bear the very idea of it other idea of dislike and sickness and vomit presently accompany it and he be disturbed but he know from whence to date this weakness and can tell how he get this indisposition have this happen to he by a over-dose of honey when a child all the same effect would have follow but the cause would have be mistaken and the antipathy count natural 8 influence of association to be watch educate young child i mention this not out of any great necessity there be in this present argument to distinguish nicely between natural and acquire antipathy but i take notice of it for another purpose viz that those who have child or the charge of they education would think it worth they while diligently to watch and carefully to prevent the undue connexion of idea in the mind of young people this be the time most susceptible of last impression and though those relate to the health of the body be by discreet people mind and fence against yet i be apt to doubt that those which relate more peculiarly to the mind and terminate in the understanding or passion have be much less heed than the thing deserve : nay those relate purely to the understanding have as i suspect be by most man wholly overlook 9 wrong connexion of idea a great cause of error this wrong connexion in we mind of idea in themselves loose and independent of one another have such a influence and be of so great force to set we awry in we action as well moral as natural passion reasoning and notion themselves that perhaps there be not any one thing that deserve more to be look after 10 as instance the idea of goblin and sprite have really no more to do with darkness than light : yet let but a foolish maid inculcate these often on the mind of a child and raise they there together possibly he shall never be able to separate they again so long as he live but darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful idea and they shall be so join that he can no more bear the one than the other 11 another instance a man receive a sensible injury from another think on the man and that action over and over and by ruminate on they strongly or much in he mind so cement those two idea together that he make they almost one never think on the man but the pain and displeasure he suffer come into he mind with it so that he scarce distinguish they but have as much a aversion for the one as the other thus hatred be often beget from slight and innocent occasion and quarrel propagate and continue in the world 12 a third instance a man have suffer pain or sickness in any place he see he friend die in such a room : though these have in nature nothing to do one with another yet when the idea of the place occur to he mind it bring -lrb- the impression be once make -rrb- that of the pain and displeasure with it : he confound they in he mind and can as little bear the one as the other 13 why time cure some disorder in the mind which reason can not cure when this combination be settle and while it last it be not in the power of reason to help we and relieve we from the effect of it idea in we mind when they be there will operate accord to they nature and circumstance and here we see the cause why time cure certain affection which reason though in the right and allow to be so have not power over nor be able against they to prevail with those who be apt to hearken to it in other case the death of a child that be the daily delight of its mother 's eye and joy of she soul rend from she heart the whole comfort of she life and give she all the torment imaginable : use the consolation of reason in this case and you be as good preach ease to one on the rack and hope to allay by rational discourse the pain of he joint tear asunder till time have by disuse separate the sense of that enjoyment and its loss from the idea of the child return to she memory all representation though ever so reasonable be in vain and therefore some in whom the union between these idea be never dissolve spend they life in mourning and carry a incurable sorrow to they grave 14 another instance of the effect of the association of idea a friend of mine know one perfectly cure of madness by a very harsh and offensive operation the gentleman who be thus recover with great sense of gratitude and acknowledgment own the cure all he life after as the greatest obligation he could have receive but whatever gratitude and reason suggest to he he could never bear the sight of the operator : that image bring back with it the idea of that agony which he suffer from he hand which be too mighty and intolerable for he to endure 15 more instance many child impute the pain they endure at school to they book they be correct for so join those idea together that a book become they aversion and they be never reconcile to the study and use of they all they life after and thus read become a torment to they which otherwise possibly they might have make the great pleasure of they life there be room convenient enough that some man can not study in and fashion of vessel which though ever so clean and commodious they can not drink out of and that by reason of some accidental idea which be annex to they and make they offensive and who be there that have not observe some man to flag at the appearance or in the company of some certain person not otherwise superior to he but because have once on some occasion get the ascendant the idea of authority and distance go along with that of the person and he that have be thus subject be not able to separate they 16 a curious instance instance of this kind be so plentiful everywhere that if i add one more it be only for the pleasant oddness of it it be of a young gentleman who have learn to dance and that to great perfection there happen to stand a old trunk in the room where he learn the idea of this remarkable piece of household stuff have so mixed itself with the turn and step of all he dance that though in that chamber he could dance excellently well yet it be only whilst that trunk be there nor could he perform well in any other place unless that or some such other trunk have its due position in the room if this story shall be suspect to be dress up with some comical circumstance a little beyond precise nature i answer for myself that i have it some year since from a very sober and worthy man upon he own knowledge as i report it and i dare say there be very few inquisitive person who read this who have not meet with account if not example of this nature that may parallel or at least justify this 17 influence of association on intellectual habit intellectual habit and defect this way contract be not less frequent and powerful though less observe let the idea of be and matter be strongly join either by education or much thought whilst these be still combine in the mind what notion what reasoning will there be about separate spirit let custom from the very childhood have join figure and shape to the idea of god and what absurdity will that mind be liable to about the deity let the idea of infallibility be inseparably join to any person and these two constantly together possess the mind and then one body in two place at once shall unexamined be swallow for a certain truth by a implicit faith whenever that imagine infallible person dictate and demand assent without inquiry 18 observable in the opposition between different sect of philosophy and of religion some such wrong and unnatural combination of idea will be find to establish the irreconcilable opposition between different sect of philosophy and religion for we can not imagine every one of they follower to impose wilfully on himself and knowingly refuse truth offer by plain reason interest though it do a great deal in the case yet can not be think to work whole society of man to so universal a perverseness as that every one of they to a man should knowingly maintain falsehood : some at least must be allow to do what all pretend to ie to pursue truth sincerely and therefore there must be something that blind they understanding and make they not see the falsehood of what they embrace for real truth that which thus captivate they reason and lead man of sincerity blindfold from common sense will when examine be find to be what we be speak of : some independent idea of no alliance to one another be by education custom and the constant din of they party so couple in they mind that they always appear there together and they can no more separate they in they thought than if they be but one idea and they operate as if they be so this give sense to jargon demonstration to absurdity and consistency to nonsense and be the foundation of the greatest i have almost say of all the error in the world or if it do not reach so far it be at least the most dangerous one since so far as it obtain it hinder man from see and examine when two thing in themselves disjoin appear to the sight constantly unite if the eye see these thing rivet which be loose where will you begin to rectify the mistake that follow in two idea that they have be accustom so to join in they mind as to substitute one for the other and as i be apt to think often without perceive it themselves this whilst they be under the deceit of it make they incapable of conviction and they applaud themselves as zealous champion for truth when indeed they be contend for error and the confusion of two different idea which a customary connexion of they in they mind have to they make in effect but one fill they head with false view and they reasoning with false consequence 19 conclusion have thus give a account of the original sort and extent of we idea with several other consideration about these -lrb- i know not whether i may say -rrb- instrument or material of we knowledge the method i at first propose to myself would now require that i should immediately proceed to show what use the understanding make of they and what knowledge we have by they this be that which in the first general view i have of this subject be all that i think i should have to do : but upon a nearer approach i find that there be so close a connexion between idea and word and we abstract idea and general word have so constant a relation one to another that it be impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of we knowledge which all consist in proposition without consider first the nature use and signification of language which therefore must be the business of the next book end of volume i end of the project gutenberg ebook of a essay
