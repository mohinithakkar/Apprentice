in three volume which be a continuation of the previous eight the present edition be not a reproduction of those eleven volume of 1882-9 it be true that to much of the editorial material include in

these book have be revise correct and readjust in this one -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` erratum ' in the previous volume be correct : several thousand new note have be add many of the old one be entirely recast : the change of text introduce by wordsworth into the successive edition of he poem have all be revise new reading -- derive from many m source -- have be add : while the chronological order of the poem have in several instance be change in the light of fresh evidence the distinctive feature of my edition of 1882-6 be state in the preface to its first volume so far as these feature remain in the present edition they may be repeat as follow : first the poem be arrange in chronological order of composition not of publication in all the collective edition issue by wordsworth during he lifetime the arrangement of he poem in artificial group base on they lead characteristic -- a plan first adopt in 1815 -- be adhered to although he not unfrequently transfer a poem from one group to another here they be print with one or two exception to be afterwards explain in the order in which they be write second the change of text make by wordsworth in the successive edition of he poem be give in footnote with the date of the change third suggest change write by the poet on a copy of the stereotyped edition of 1836-7 -- long keep at rydal mount and buy after mr wordsworth 's death at the sale of a portion of the library at the mount -- be give in footnote fourth the note dictate by wordsworth to miss isabellum fenwick -- a dear friend of the rydal mount household and a woman of remarkable character and faculty -- which tell the story of he poem and the circumstance under which each be write be print in full fifth topographical note -- explanatory of allusion make by wordsworth to locality in the lake district of england to place in scotland somersetshire yorkshire the isle of man and other on the continent of europe -- be give either at the close of the poem in which the allusion occur or as footnote to the passage they illustrate sixth several complete poem and other fragment of verse not include in any edition of he work publish during wordsworth 's lifetime or since be print as a appendix to volume viii seventh a new bibliography of the poem and prose work and of the several edition issue in england and america from 1793 to 1850 be add eighth a new life of the poet be give these feature of the edition of 1882-6 be preserve in that of 1896 and the follow be add : first the volume be publish not in library 8vo size but -- as the work of every poet should be issue -- in one more convenient to handle and to carry eight volume be devote to the poetical work and among they be include those fragment by he sister dorothy and other which wordsworth publish in he lifetime among he own poem they be print in the chronological order of composition so far as that be know second in the case of each poem any note write by wordsworth himself as explanatory of it come first and have the initial w w with the date of its first insertion place after it next follow the fenwick note within square bracket thus -lrb- -rrb- and sign i f and afterwards any editorial note require when however wordsworth 's own note be place at the end of the poem or at the foot of the page he plan be adopt and the date append i should have be glad have it be possible -- the editor of the twentieth century may note this -- to print wordsworth 's own note the fenwick note and the editor 's in different type and in type of a decrease size but the idea occur to I too late i e after the first volume have be pass for press third all the prose work of wordsworth be give in full and follow the poem in two volume the prose work be collect by dr grosart and publish in 1876 extract from they have since be edit by myself and other : but they will now be issue like the poem in chronological order under they own title and with such note as seem desirable fourth all the journal write by dorothy wordsworth at alfoxden dive cottage and elsewhere as well as she record of tour with she brother in scotland on the continent etc be publish -- some of they in full other only in part a explanation of why any journal be curtail will be find in the editorial note precede it much new material will be find in these journal fifth the letter of william and dorothy wordsworth -- with a few from mary and dora wordsworth -- be arrange chronologically and publish by themselves hitherto these letter have be scatter in many quarter -- in the late bishop of lincoln 's ` memoirs ' of he uncle in ` the diary reminiscence and correspondence of henry crabb robinson ' in the ` memorial of coleorton ' and my own ` life ' of the poet in the ` prose work ' in the ` transaction of the wordsworth society ' in the ` letter of charle lamb ' in the ` memorial of thomas de quincey ' and other volume but many more both of wordsworth 's and he sister 's have never before see the light more than a hundred and fifty letter from dorothy wordsworth to mr clarkson the wife of the great slave-liberator be send to I some time ago by mr arthur tennyson a relative of mr clarkson and i have recently see and be allow to copy wordsworth 's letter to he early friend franci wrangham through the kindness of they late owner mr mackay of the grange trowbridge many other letter of great interest have recently reach I sixth in addition to a new bibliography and a chronological table of the poem and the prose work a bibliography of wordsworth criticism be append it include most of the article on the poet and notice of he work which have appear in great britain america and the continent of europe under this head i have specially to thank mr henry a st john of ithaca ny a devoted transatlantic wordsworthian who have perhaps do more than any one -- since henry reed -- to promote the study of she favorite poet in america mr st john 's wordsworth collection be unique and she knowledge and enthusiasm be as great as she industry have be professor e legoui of the university of lyon -- who write a interesting book on wordsworth 's friend ` le général michel beaupuy ' -lrb- 1891 -rrb- -- have send I material from france which will be find in its proper place frau professor gothein of bonn who have translate many of wordsworth 's poem into german and write he life ` william wordsworth : sein leben seine werke seine zeitgenossen ' -lrb- 1893 -rrb- have similarly help I in reference to german criticism seventh as the poet 's letter and he sister 's journal will appear in earlier volume the new ` life of wordsworth ' will be much shorter than that which be publish in 1889 in three volume 8vo it will not exceed a single volume eighth in the edition of 1882-6 each volume contain a etching of a locality associate with wordsworth the drawing be make by john m ` whirter ra in water-colour and they be afterwards etch by mr c o murray one portrait by haydon be prefix to the first volume of the ` life ' in each volume of this edition -- poem prose work journal letter and life -- there will be a new portrait either of the poet or he wife or sister or daughter

r haydon all the etching will be prepare by h manesse the portrait with many other will be describe in detail in a subsequent volume in all editorial note the title give by wordsworth to he poem be invariably print in italics not with inverted comma before and after as wordsworth himself so often print they : and when he give no title to a poem its first line will be invariably place within inverted comma this plan of use italics and not roman letter apply also to the title of any book refer to by wordsworth or by he sister in she journal whether they put the title in italics or within comma it be always italicise in this edition a subsidiary matter such as this become important when one find that many editor of part of the work of wordsworth or of selection from they have invent title of they own and have send they volume to press without the slightest indication to they reader that the title be not wordsworth 's mix up they own notion of what best describe the contents of the poem or the letter with those of the writer some have suppress wordsworth 's and put they own title in its place other have contented themselves -lrb- more modestly -rrb- with invent a title when wordsworth give none i do not object to these title in themselves several such as those by archbishop trench be suggestive and valuable what i object to be that any editor -- no matter who -- should mingle he own title with those of the poet and give no indication to the reader as to which be which dr grosart have be so devote a student of wordsworth and we owe he so much that one regret to find in the prose work of wordsworth -lrb- 1876 -rrb- the follow title give to he letter to the bishop of llandaff ` apology for the french revolution ' it be interesting to know that dr grosart think this a useful description of the letter : but a clear indication should have be give that it be not wordsworth 's it be true that in the general preface to he volume dr grosart take upon himself the responsibility for this title but it should not have be print as the title in chief or as the headline to the text similarly with the title of the second and third of the three ` essay on epitaph ' as student of wordsworth know he issue a volume in 1838 contain all he sonnet then write and at the close of that edition he add the six sonnet annex be compose as this volume be go through the press but too late for insertion in the class of miscellaneous one to which they belong in 1884 archbishop trench edit the sonnet with a admirable introductory essay on the history of the english sonnet but while wordsworth give no title to the 3rd and the 4th of the six compose as the volume be go through the press -- either in he edition of 1838 ` or in any subsequent issue ' of he poem -- he editor do so he give what be really excellent title but he do not tell we that they be he own he call they respectively ` the thrush at twilight ' and ` the thrush at dawn ' possibly wordsworth would have approve of both of those title : but that they be not he should have be indicate i do not think it wise from a editorial point of view even to print in a chronological table -- as professor dowden have do in he admirable aldine edition -- title which be not wordsworth 's without some indication to that effect but in the case of selection from wordsworth -- such as those of mr hawe turner and mr a j symington -- every one must feel that the editor should have inform he reader ` when ' the title be wordsworth 's and ` when ' it be he own coinage in the case of a much greater man -- and one of wordsworth 's most illustrious successor in the great hierarchy of english poesy matthew arnold -- it may be ask why should he have put ` margaret or the ruin cottage ' as the title of a poem write in 1795-7 when wordsworth never once publish it under that name it be a extract from the first book of ` the excursion ' -- write it be true in these early year -- but only issue as part of the latter poem first publish in 1814 the question of the number the character and the length of the note which a wise editor should append to the work of a great poet -lrb- or to any classic -rrb- be perhaps still ` sub judice ' my own opinion be that in all editorial work the note should be illustrative rather than critical and that they should only bring out those point which the ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand if the poem be not annotated for this reason topographical historical and antiquarian note be almost essential the note which wordsworth himself write to he poem be of unequal length and merit it be perhaps necessary for he to write -- at all event it be easy to understand and to sympathise with he writing -- the long note on the revered parson of the duddon valley the rev robert walker who will be remember for many generation as the wonderful walker the poet 's editor have also be occasionally lead to add digressive note to clear up point which have be leave by himself either dubious or obscure i must plead guilty to the charge of do so : eg the identification of the muccawiss -lrb- see ` the excursion ' book iii l 953 -rrb- with the whip-poor-will involve a great deal of laborious correspondence year ago it be a question of real difficulty and although the result reach could now be put into two or three line i have think it desirable that the opinion of those who write about it and help toward the solution should be record what i print be only a small part of the correspondence that take place on the other hand it would be quite out of place in a note to the famous passage in the 4th book of ` the excursion ' beginning i have see a curious child apply to he ear to enter on a discussion as to the extent of wordsworth 's debt -- if any -- to the author of ` gebir ' it be quite sufficient to print the relative passage from landor 's poem at the foot of the page all the note write by wordsworth himself in he numerous edition will be find in this one with the date of they first appearance add slight textual change however or casual ` addendum ' be not indicate unless they be sufficiently important change in the text of note have not the same importance to posterity as change in the text of poem in the preface to the prose work reference will be make to wordsworth 's alteration of he text at present i refer only to he own note to he poem when they be write as footnote to the page they remain footnote still when they be place by he as preface to he poem they retain that place in this edition but when they be appendix note -- as eg in the early edition of lyrical ballad -- they be now make footnote to the poem they illustrate in such a case however as the elaborate note to ` the excursion ' contain a reprint of the ` essay upon epitaph ' -- originally contribute to the friend -- it be transfer to the prose work to which it belong by priority of date and as it would be inexpedient to print it twice over it be omit from the note to ` the excursion ' as to the place which note to a poet 's work should occupy there be no doubt that numerous and lengthy one -- however valuable or even necessary by way of illustration -- disfigure the print page and some prefer that they should be throw all together at the end of each volume or at the close of a series such as -- in wordsworth 's case -- the river duddon ecclesiastical sonnet ` the prelude ' ` the white doe of rylstone ' etc i do not think however that many care to turn repeatedly to the close of a series of poem or the end of a volume to find a explanatory note help only by a index number and when perhaps even that do not meet he eye at the foot of the page i do not find that even ardent wordsworth student like to search for note in appendix and perhaps the more ardent they be the less desirable be it for they thus to hunt the waterfall i have the greatest admiration for the work which professor dowden have do in he edition of wordsworth but the ` plan ' which he have follow in he aldine edition of give not only the fenwick note but all the change of text introduce by wordsworth into he successive edition in additional editorial note at the end of each volume -- to understand which the reader must turn the page repeatedly from text to note and note to text forwards and backwards at time distractingly -- be for practical purpose almost unworkable the reader who examine note ` critically ' be ever one among a thousand even if they be print at the foot of the page and meet the eye readily if they be consign to the realm of ` addendum ' they will be read by very few and study by fewer to those who object to note be thrust into view -lrb- as it must be admit that they be in this edition -rrb- -- because it disturb the pleasure of the reader who care for the poetry of wordsworth and for the poetry alone -- i may ask how many person have read the fenwick note give together in a series and mix up heterogeneously with wordsworth 's own note to he poem in comparison with those who have read and enjoy they in the edition of 1857 and 1863 professor dowden justify he plan of relegate the fenwick and other note to the end of each volume of he edition on the ground that student of the poet ` must ' take the trouble of hunting to and fro for such thing i greatly doubt if many who have read and profit -- for they could not but profit -- by a perusal of professor dowden 's work ` have ' take that trouble or that future reader of the aldine edition will take it to refer somewhat more in detail to the feature of this edition first as to the ` chronological order ' of the poem the chief advantage of a chronological arrangement of the work of any author -- and especially of a poet who himself adopt a different plan -- be that it show we as nothing else can do the growth of he own mind the progressive development of he genius and imaginative power by such a redistribution of what he write we can trace the rise the culmination and also -- it may be -- the decline and fall of he genius wordsworth 's own arrangement -- first adopt in the edition of 1815 -- be design by he with the view of bring together in separate class those poem which refer to the same -lrb- or similar -rrb- subject or which be suppose to be the product of the same -lrb- or a similar -rrb- faculty irrespective of the date of composition thus one group be entitle poem of the fancy another poem of the imagination a third poem proceed from sentiment and reflection a fourth epitaph and elegiac piece again poem on the naming of place memorial of tour ecclesiastical sonnet miscellaneous sonnet etc the principle which guide he in this be obvious enough it be in some respects a most natural arrangement and in now adopt a chronological order the group which he construct with so much care be break up probably every author would attach more importance to a classification of he work which bring they together under appropriate heading irrespective of date than to a method of arrangement which exhibit the growth of he own mind and it may be take for grant that posterity would not think highly of any author who attach special value to this latter element none the less posterity may wish to trace the gradual development of genius in the imaginative writer of the past by the help of such a subsequent rearrangement of they work there be difficulty however in the way of such a rearrangement some of which in wordsworth 's case can not be entirely surmount in the case of itinerary sonnet refer to the same subject the dismemberment of a series -- carefully arrange by they author -- seem to be specially unnatural but wordsworth himself sanction the principle if there be a fitness in collect all he sonnet in one volume in the year 1838 out of deference to the wish of he friend in order that these poem might be bring under the eye at once -- thus remove they from they original place in he collect work -- it seem equally fitting now to rearrange they chronologically as far as it be possible to do so it will be see that it be not always possible then there be the case of two poem follow each other in wordsworth 's own arrangement by natural affinity such as the ` epistle to sir george beaumont ' write in 1811 which in almost all exist edition be follow by the poem write in 1841 and entitle ` upon peruse the foregoing epistle thirty year after its composition ' or the dedication to ` the white doe of rylstone ' write in April 1815 while the poem itself be write in 1807 to separate these poem seem unnatural and as it would be inadmissible to print the second of the two twice over -- once as a sequel to the first poem and again in its chronological place -- adherence to the latter plan have its obvious disadvantage in the case of these poem mr aubrey de vere be very desirous that i should arrange all the poem dedicate to national independence and liberty together in series as wordsworth leave they on the principle that though the order of publication should as a rule be the order of composition in poetry all rule require as well as admit of exception as i have the greatest respect for the judgment of such a authority as mr de vere i may explain that i only venture to differ from he because there be seventy-four poem -- include the sonnet and ode -- in this series and because they cover a period range from 1802 to 1815 i be glad however that many of these sonnet can be print together especially the earlier one of 1802 after carefully weigh every consideration it have seem to I desirable to adopt the chronological arrangement in this particular edition in which a attempt be make to trace the growth of wordsworth 's genius as it be unfold in he successive work he own arrangement of he poem will always possess a special interest and value and it be not likely ever to be entirely supersede in subsequent issue of he work the editor and publisher of the future may possibly prefer it to the plan now adopt and it will commend itself to many reader from the mere fact that ` it be wordsworth 's own ' but in a edition such as the present -- which be mean to supply material for the study of the poet to those who may not possess or have access to the earlier and rarer edition -- no method of arrangement can be so good as the chronological one its importance will be obvious after several volume be publish when the point refer to above -- viz the evolution of the poet 's genius -- will be show by the very sequence of the subject choose and they method of treatment from year to year the date of the composition of wordsworth 's poem can not always be ascertain with accuracy : and to get at the chronological order it be not sufficient to take up he earlier volume and thereafter to note the addition make in subsequent one we now know -lrb- approximately -rrb- when each poem be first publish although in some instance they appear in newspaper and magazine and in many case publication be long after the date of composition for example ` guilt and sorrow or incident upon salisbury plain ' -- write in the year 1791-94 -- be not publish ` in extenso ' till 1842 the tragedy of ` the borderer ' compose in 1795-96 be also first publish in 1842 ` the prelude ' -- commence in the beginning of the year 1799 and complete in the summer of 1805 -- be publish posthumously in 1850 : and some unpublished poem -- both of early and late year -- be first issue in 1886 a poem be frequently keep back from some doubt as to its worth or from a wish to alter and amend it of the five or six hundred sonnet that he write wordsworth say most of they be frequently re-touched and not a few laboriously some poem be almost entirely recast and occasionally fugitive verse be withhold from publication for a time because it be hope that they would subsequently form part of a larger whole in the case of many of the poem we be leave to conjecture the date of composition although we be seldom without some clue to it the fenwick note be a great assistance in determine the chronology these note -- which will be afterwards more fully refer to -- be dictate by wordsworth to miss fenwick in the year 1843 but at that time he memory could not be absolutely trust as to date and in some instance we know it to have be at fault for example he say of ` the old cumberland beggar ' that it be write at racedown and alfoxden in my twenty-third year now he go to racedown in the autumn of 1795 when he be twenty-five year old and to alfoxden in the autumn of 1797 when twenty-seven again the poem ` rural architecture ' be put down in the fenwick note as write at townend in 1801 but it have be publish in 1800 in the second edition of lyrical ballad similarly wordsworth give the date 1801 or 1802 for ` the reverie of poor susan ' which have also appear in lyrical ballad 1800 wordsworth 's memory be not always to be trust even when he be speak of a group of he own poem for example in the edition of 1807 there be a short series describe thus poem compose during a tour chiefly on foot they be number 1 2 3 4 5 now one would naturally suppose that all the poem in this set of five be compose during the same pedestrian tour and that they all refer to the same time but the series contain ` alice fall ' -lrb- 1802 -rrb- ` beggar ' -lrb- 1802 -rrb- ` to a sky-lark ' -lrb- 1805 -rrb- and ` resolution and independence ' -lrb- 1802 -rrb- much more valuable than the fenwick note -- for a certain portion of wordsworth 's life -- be he sister dorothy 's journal the mistake in the former can frequently be correct from the minutely keep diary of those early year when the brother and sister live together at grasmere the whole of that journal so far as it be desirable to print it for posterity will be give in a subsequent volume long before the publication of the fenwick note wordsworth himself supply some datum for a chronological arrangement of he work in the table of contents prefix to the first collect edition of 1815 in two volume -- and also to the second collect edition of 1820 in four volume -- there be two parallel column : one give the date of composition and the other that of publication there be numerous blank in the former column which be the only important one as the year of publication could be ascertain from the edition themselves sometimes the date be give vaguely as in the case of the sonnet dedicate to liberty where the note run from the year 1807 to 1813 at other time the entry of the year of publication be inaccurate for example the ` inscription for the spot where the hermitage stand on st herbert 's island derwentwater ' be put down as belong to the year 1807 but this poem do not occur in the volume of 1807 but in the second volume of lyrical ballad -lrb- 1800 -rrb- it will thus be see that it be only by compare wordsworth 's own list of the year to which he poem belong with the contents of the several edition of he work with the fenwick note and with he sister 's journal that we can approximately reconstruct the true chronology to these source of information must be add the internal evidence of the poem themselves incidental reference in letter to friend and stray hint gather from various quarter many new source of information as to the date of the composition of the poem become know to I during the publication of my previous edition and after its issue the most important be the journal of dorothy wordsworth these discovery show that my chronological table of 1882 -- although then relatively up to date -- be incomplete the table construct by mr tutin and by professor dowden be both more accurate than it be it be impossible to attain to finality in such a matter and several fact afterwards discover and mention in the later volume of my previous edition have be use against the conclusion come to in the earlier one i have thus supply the feather for a few subsequent critical arrow the shot have not be unkindly one and i be glad of the result viz that we knowledge of the date -- both as to the composition and first publication of the poem -- be now much more exact than before when a conjectural one be give in this edition the fact be always mention this chronological method of arrangement however have its limit it be not possible always to adopt it : nor be it invariably ` necessary ' even in order to obtain a true view of the growth of wordsworth 's mind in this -- as in so many other thing -- wisdom lie in the avoidance of extreme the extreme of rigid fidelity to the order of time on the one hand and the extreme of a irrational departure from it on the other while a effort have be make to discover the exact order of the composition of the poem -- and this be show not only in the chronological table but at the beginning of each separate poem -- it have be consider expedient to depart from that order in print some of the poem in certain case a poem be begin and lay aside and again resume at interval and it be difficult to know to what year the larger part of it should be assign when we know the date at which a poem be commence and that it be finish long afterwards but have no clue as to the year it be assign to the year in which it be begin for example the ` address to kilchurn castle ' be begin in 1803 but only the first three line be write then wordsworth tell we that the rest be add many year after but when we know not and the poem be not publish till 1827 in such a case it be place in this edition as if it belong chronologically to 1803 and retain its place in the series of poem which memorialise the tour in scotland of that year on a similar principle ` the highland girl ' be place in the same series although dorothy wordsworth tell we in she journal of the tour that it be compose not long after we return from scotland and ` glen almain ' -- although write afterwards at rydal -- retain its publish place in the memorial group again the ` departure from the vale of grasmere August 1803 ' be prefix to the same series although it be not write till 1811 and first publish in 1827 to give symmetry to such a series it be necessary to depart from the exact chronological order -- the departure be duly indicate on the same principle i have follow the ` address to the scholar of the village school of -- ' by its natural sequel -- ` by the side of the grave some year after ' the date of the composition of which be unknown : and the ` epistle to sir george beaumont ' -lrb- 1811 -rrb- be follow by the later line to which wordsworth give the most prosaic title -- he be often infelicitous in he title -- ` upon peruse the foregoing epistle thirty year after its composition ' a like remark apply to the poem ` beggar ' which be follow by its own ` sequel ' although the order of date be disturb while all the epitaph translate from chiabrera be print together it be manifestly appropriate that the poem belong to a series -- such as the ecclesiastical sonnet or those refer to the duddon -- should be bring together as wordsworth finally arrange they even although we may be aware that some of they be write subsequently and place in the middle of the series the sonnet refer to aspect of christianity in america -- insert in the 1845 and 1849-50 edition of the collect work -- be find in no previous edition or version of the ecclesiastical sonnet these along with some other on the office of the english liturgy be suggest to wordsworth by a american prelate bishop doane and by professor henry reed -lrb- 2 -rrb- but we do not know in what year they be write the ecclesiastical sonnet -- first call ecclesiastical sketch -- be write in the year 1820-22 the above addition to they appear twenty-five year afterwards but they ought manifestly to retain they place as arrange by wordsworth in the edition of 1845 the case be much the same with regard to the duddon sonnet they be first publish in 1820 : but no xiv beginning : o mountain stream the shepherd and he cot be write in the year 1806 and appear in the edition of 1807 this sonnet will be print in the series to which it belong and not in its chronological place i think it would be equally unjust to remove it from the group -- in which it help to form a unity -- and to print it twice over -lrb- 3 -rrb- on the other hand the series of poem compose during a tour in scotland and on the english border in the autumn of 1831 -- and first publish in the year 1835 in the volume entitle yarrow revisit and other poem -- contain two which wordsworth himself tell we be compose earlier and there be no reason why these poem should not be restore to they chronological place the series of itinerary sonnet publish along with they in the yarrow volume of 1835 be the record of another scottish tour take in the year 1833 and wordsworth say of they that they be compose ` or suggest ' during a tour in the summer of 1833 we can not now discover which of they be write during the tour and which at rydal mount after he return but it be obvious that they should be print in the order in which they be leave by he in 1835 it may be note that almost all the evening voluntary belong to these year -- 1832 to 1835 -- when the author be from sixty-two to sixty-five year of age wordsworth 's habit of revision may perhaps explain the mistake into which he occasionally fall as to the date of he poem and the difficulty of reconcile what he say as to the year of composition with the date assign by he sister in she journal when he say write in 1801 or 1802 he may be refer to the last revision which he give to he work certain it be however that he sometimes give a date for the composition which be subsequent to the publication of the poem in question in the case of those poem to which no date be attach i have try to find a clue by which to fix a approximate one obviously it would not do to place all the undated poem in a class by themselves such a arrangement would be thoroughly artificial and while we be in many instance leave to conjecture we can always say that such and such a poem be compose not later than a particular year when the precise date be undiscoverable i have think it best to place the poem in or immediately before the year in which it be first publish poem which be several year in process of composition have be lay aside and take up repeatedly ` eg the prelude ' which be compose between the year 1799 and 1805 -- be place in the year in which they be finish disputable question as to the date of any poem be deal with in the editorial note prefix or append to it there be one poem which i have intentionally place out of its chronological place viz the ` ode intimation of immortality from recollection of early childhood ' it be write at interval from 1803 to 1806 and be first publish in the edition of 1807 where it stand at the end of the second volume in every subsequent edition of the collect work -- 1815 to 1850 -- it close the group of poem ` the excursion ' only follow it in a volume of its own this be a arrangement make by wordsworth of set purpose and steadily adhere to -- the ` ode ' form as it be the high altar of he poetic cathedral as he wish it to retain that place in subsequent edition of he work it retain it in this one mr arnold 's arrangement of the poem in he volume of selection -lrb- 4 -rrb- be extremely interesting and valuable but as to the method of group adopt i be not sure that it be better than wordsworth 's own as a descriptive title poem of sentiment and reflection be quite as good as poem akin to the antique and poem of the fancy quite as appropriate as poem of ballad form wordsworth 's arrangement of he poem in group be psychologically very interesting but it be open to many objection unfortunately wordsworth be not himself consistent -- in the various edition issue by himself -- either in the class into which he relegate each poem or the order in which he place it there there be tantalise topsy-turvyism in this so that a editor who adopt it be almost compel to select wordsworth 's latest group which be not always he best sir william rowan hamilton write to mr aubrey de vere in 1835 that dora wordsworth tell he that she father be sometimes at a loss whether to refer she to the ` poem of the imagination ' or the ` poem of the fancy ' for some particular passage aubrey de vere himself consider wordsworth 's arrangement as a parade of system and write of it i can not help think that in it he mistake classification for method -lrb- 5 -rrb- i confess that it be often difficult to see why some of the poem be assign by they author to the realm of the fancy the imagination and sentiment and reflection respectively in a note to ` the horn of egremont castle ' -lrb- edition 1815 -rrb- wordsworth speak of it as refer to the imagination rather than as be produce by it and say that he would not have place it amongst he poem of the imagination but to avoid a needless multiplication of class and in the edition of 1827 and 1832 he actually include the great ` ode ' on immortality among he epitaph and elegiac poem as late as 27th September 1845 he write to professor henry reed follow you example -lrb- i e the example set in reed 's american edition of the poem -rrb- i have greatly extend the class entitle ` poem of the imagination ' think as you must have do that if imagination be predominant in the class it be not indispensable that it should pervade every poem which it contain limit the class as i have do before seem to imply and to the uncandid or observe do so that the faculty which be the ` primum mobile ' in poetry have little to do in the estimation of the author with piece not arrange under that head i therefore feel much oblige to you for suggest by you practice the plan which i have adopt could anything show more explicitly than this that wordsworth be not perfectly satisfy with he own artificial group professor reed in he american edition of 1837 however act on wordsworth 's express intention of distribute the contents of yarrow revisit and other poem amongst the class he tell we that he intersperse the contents of this volume among the poem already arrange by wordsworth -lrb- 6 -rrb- it may also be mention that not only member of he own household but many of wordsworth 's friend -- notably charle lamb -- express a preference for a different arrangement of he poem from that which he have adopt second the various reading or variation of text make by wordsworth during he lifetime or write by he on copy of he poem or discover in m letter from himself or he sister or he wife be give in footnote in this edition few english poet change they text more frequently or with more fastidiousness than wordsworth do he do not always alter it for the better every alteration however which have be discover by I whether for the better or for the worse be here print in full we have thus a record of the fluctuation of he own mind as to the form in which he wish he poem to appear and this record cast considerable light on the development of he genius -lrb- 7 -rrb- a knowledge of these change of text can only be obtain in one or other of two way either the reader must have access to all the thirty-two edition of poem the publication of which wordsworth personally supervise or he must have all the change in the successive edition exhibit in the form of footnote and append to the particular text that be select and print in the body of the work it be extremely difficult -- in some case quite impossible -- to obtain the early edition the great public library of the country do not possess they all -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be therefore necessary to fall back upon the latter plan which seem the only one by which a knowledge of the change of the text can be make accessible either to the general reader or to the special student of english poetry the text which -- after much consideration -- i have resolve to place throughout in the body of the work be wordsworth 's own final ` textus receptus ' ie the text of 1849-50 reproduce in the posthumous edition of 1857 -lrb- 9 -rrb- and since opinion will doubtless differ as to the wisdom of this selection it may be desirable to state at some length the reason which have lead I to adopt it there be only three possible course open to a editor who wish to give -- along with the text select -- all the various reading chronologically arrange as footnote either 1st the earliest text may be take or 2nd the latest may be choose or 3rd the text may be select from different edition so as to present each poem in its best state -lrb- accord to the judgment of the editor -rrb- in whatever edition it be find a composite text make up from two or more edition would be inadmissible now most person who have study the subject know that wordsworth 's best text be to be find in one poem in its earliest edition in another in its latest and in a third in some intermediate edition i can not agree either with the statement that he always alter for the worse or that he always alter for the better he critical judgment be not nearly so unerring in this respect as coleridge 's be or as tennyson 's have be it may be difficult therefore to assign a altogether satisfactory reason for adopt either the earliest or the latest text and at first sight the remain alternative plan may seem the wisest of the three there be indeed difficulty in the way of the adoption of any one of the method suggest and as i adopt the latest text -- not because it be always intrinsically the best but on other grounds to be immediately state -- it may clear the way if reference be make in the first instance to the other and to the reason for abandon they as to a selection of the text from various edition this would doubtless be the best plan be it a practicable one and perhaps it may be attainable some day but wordsworth be as yet too near we for such a editorial treatment of he work to be successful the fundamental objection to it be that scarcely two mind -- even among the most competent of contemporary judge -- will agree as to what the best text be a edition arrange on this principle could not possibly be acceptable to more than a few person of course no arrangement of any kind can escape adverse criticism : it would be most unfortunate if it do but this particular edition would fail in its main purpose if question of individual taste be make primary and not secondary and a arrangement which give scope for the arbitrary selection of particular text -- accord to the wisdom or the want of wisdom of the editor -- would deservedly meet with severe criticism in many quarter besides such a method of arrangement would not indicate the growth of the poet 's mind and the development of he genius if a editor wish to indicate he own opinion of the best text for each poem -- under the idea that he judgment might be of some use to other people -- it would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal note than by print he select text in the main body of the work he could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the reading indicate he own preference and leave it to other to select what they prefer besides the compiler of such a edition would often find himself in doubt as to what the best text really be the merit of the different reading be sometimes almost equal or very nearly balanced and be he to endeavor to get out of the difficulty by obtain the judgment of literary man or even of contemporary poet he would find that they opinion would in most case be dissimilar if they do not openly conflict those who can not come to a final decision as to they own text would not be likely to agree as to the merit of particular reading in the poem of they predecessor unanimity of opinion on this point be indeed quite unattainable nevertheless it would be easy for a editor to show the unfortunate result of keep rigorously either to the latest or to the earliest text of wordsworth if on the one hand the latest be take it could be show that many of the change introduce into it be for the worse and some of they very decidedly so for example in the poem ` to a skylark ' -- compose in 1825 -- the second verse retain in the edition of 1827 1832 1836 and 1843 be unaccountably drop out in the edition of 1845 and 1849 the following be the complete poem of 1825 as publish in 1827 ethereal minstrel pilgrim of the sky dost thou despise the earth where care abound or while the wing aspire be heart and eye both with thy nest upon the dewy ground thy nest which thou canst drop into at will those quiver wing compose that music still to the last point of vision and beyond mount daring warbler that love-prompt strain -lrb- ` twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond -rrb- thrill not the less the bosom of the plain : yet might ` st thou seem proud privilege to sing all independent of the leafy spring leave to the nightingale she shady wood a privacy of glorious light be thine whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood of harmony with rapture more divine type of the wise who soar but never roam true to the kindred point of heaven and home there be no doubt that the first and third stanza be the finest and some may respect the judgment that cut down the poem by the removal of its second verse : but other will say if it be right that such a verse should be remove why be many other of questionable merit allow to remain why be such a poem as ` the glowworm ' of the edition of 1807 never republish while ` the waterfall and the eglantine ' and ` to the spade of a friend ' be retain to give one other illustration where a score be possible in the sonnet belong to the year 1807 beginning : beloved vale i say when i shall con we find in the latest text the line -- first adopt in 1827 : i stand of simple shame the blush thrall so narrow seem the brook the field so small while the early edition of 1807 contain the far happier line : to see the tree which i have think so tall mere dwarf the brook so narrow field so small on the other hand if the earliest text be invariably retain some of the best poem will be spoil -lrb- or the improvement lose -rrb- since wordsworth do usually alter for the better for example few person will doubt that the form in which the second stanza of the poem ` to the cuckoo ' -lrb- write in 1802 -rrb- appear in 1845 be a improvement on all its predecessor i give the reading of 1807 1815 1820 1827 and 1845 while i be lie on the grass i hear thy restless shout : from hill to hill it seem to pass about and all about 1807 while i be lie on the grass thy loud note smite my ear -- from hill to hill it seem to pass at once far off and near 1815 while i be lie on the grass thy loud note smite my ear it seem to fill the whole air 's space at once far off and near 1820 while i be lie on the grass thy twofold shout i hear that seem to fill the whole air 's space as loud far off as near 1827 while i be lie on the grass thy twofold shout i hear from hill to hill it seem to pass at once far off and near 1845 similarly in each of the three poem ` to the daisy ' compose in 1802 and in the ` afterthought to the duddon ' the alteration introduce into the latest edition be all improvement upon the early version it might be urge that these consideration would warrant the interference of a editor and justify he in select the text which he think the best upon the whole but this must be leave to posterity when editor can escape the bias of contemporary thought and feeling when they judgment be refine by distance and mellow by the new literary standard of the intervene year -- when in fact wordsworth be as far away from he critic as shakespeare now be -- it may be possible to adjust a final text but the task be beyond the power of the present generation it may farther be urge that if this reasoning be valid -- and if for the present one text must be retain uniformly throughout -- the natural plan be to take the earliest and not the latest and this have some recommendation it seem more simple more natural and certainly the easiest we have a natural sequence if we begin with the earliest and go on to the latest reading then all the reader of wordsworth who care to possess or to consult the present edition will doubtless possess one or other of the complete copy of he work which contain he final text while probably not one in twenty have ever see the first edition of any of he poem with the exception of ` the prelude ' it be true that if the reader turn to a footnote to compare the version of different year while he be read for the sake of the poetry he will be so distract that the effect of the poem as a whole will be entirely lose because the critical spirit which judge of the text work apart from the spirit of sympathetic appreciation in which all poetry should be read but it be not necessary to turn to the footnote and to mark what may be call the literary growth of a poem while it be be read for its own sake : and these note be print in smaller type so as not to obtrude themselves on the eye of the reader against the adoption of the earlier text there be this fatal objection that if it be to be do at all it must be do throughout and in the earliest poem wordsworth write -- viz ` a evening walk ' and ` descriptive sketch ' -- the subsequent alteration almost amount to a canceling of the earlier version he change be all or almost all unmistakably for the better indeed there be little in these work -- in the form in which they first appear -- to lead to the belief that a original poet have arise in england it be true that coleridge saw in they the sign of the dawn of a new era and write thus of ` descriptive sketch ' before he know its author seldom if ever be the emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the literary horizon more evidently announce nevertheless the earliest text of these ` sketch ' be in many place so artificial prosaic and dull that its reproduction -lrb- except as a appendix or in the form of footnote -rrb- would be a injustice to wordsworth -lrb- 10 -rrb- on the other hand the passage subsequently cancel be so numerous and so long that if place in footnote the latter would in some instance be more extensive than the text the quarto of 1793 will therefore be reprint in full as a appendix to the first volume of this edition the ` school exercise write at hawkshead ' in the poet 's fourteenth year will be find in vol viii pass over these juvenile effort there be poem -- such as ` guilt and sorrow ' ` peter bell ' and many other -- in which the earlier text be a inferior one which be either correct or abandon by wordsworth in he maturer year it would be a conspicuous blunder to print -- in the place of honor -- the crude original which be afterwards repudiate by its author it may be remember in connection with wordsworth 's text that he himself say i be for the most part uncertain about my success in alter poem but in this case -lrb- he be speak of a insertion -rrb- i be sure i have produce a great improvement -lrb- ` memoirs of wordsworth ' vol i p 174 -rrb- -lrb- 11 -rrb- again in write to mr dyce in 1830 you know what importance i attach to follow strictly the last copy of the text of a author it be also worthy of note that the study of they chronology cast some light on the change which the poem undergo the second edition of lyrical ballad appear in 1800 in that edition the text of 1798 be scarcely alter : but in the year in which it be publish wordsworth be engross with he settlement at grasmere and in the springtime of creative work he probably never think of revise he earlier piece in the year 1800 he compose at least twenty-five new poem the third edition of lyrical ballad appear in 1802 and during that year he write forty-three new poem many of they amongst the most perfect of he lyric he critical instinct have become much more delicate since 1800 : and it be not surprising to find -- as we do find -- that between the text of the lyrical ballad of 1800 and that of 1802 there be many important variation this be see for example in the way in which he deal with ` the female vagrant ' which be alter throughout its early redundance be prune away and in many instance the final text sanction in 1845 have be adopt in 1803 without go into further detail it be sufficient to remark that in the year 1803 wordsworth 's critical faculty the faculty of censorship have develop almost step for step with the creative originality of he genius in that prolific year when week by week almost day by day fresh poem be throw off with marvellous facility -- as we see from he sister 's journal -- he have become a severe if not a fastidious critic of he own earlier work a further explanation of the absence of critical revision in the edition of 1800 may be find in the fact that during that year wordsworth be engage in write the preface to he poem which deal in so remarkable a manner with the nature of poetry in general and with he own theory of it in particular a further reference to the ` evening walk ' will illustrate wordsworth 's way of deal with he earlier text in he later edition this poem show from the first a minute observation of nature -- not only in she external form and color but also in she suggestiveness -- though not in she symbolism and we also find the same transition from nature to man the same interest in rural life and the same linger over its incident that we see in he maturer poem nevertheless there be much that be conventional in the first edition of ` a evening walk ' publish in 1793 i need only mention as a sample the use of the phrase silent tide to describe the water of a lake when this poem be revise in the year 1815 -- with a view to its insertion in the first edition of the collect work -- wordsworth merely omit large portion of it and some of its best passage be strike out he scarcely amend the text at all in 1820 however he prune and improve it throughout so that between this poem as recast in 1820 -lrb- and reproduce almost ` verbatim ' in the next two edition of 1827 and 1832 -rrb- and he happiest description of nature in he most inspired mood there be no great difference but in 1836 he alter it still further in detail and in that state practically leave it apparently not care to revise it further in the edition of 1845 however there be several change so far as i can judge there be one alteration for the worse and one only the reading in the edition of 1793 in these lone vale if aught of faith may claim thin silver hair and ancient hamlet fame when up the hill as now retreat the light strange apparition mock the village sight be better than that finally adopt in these secluded vale if village fame confirm by hoary hair belief may claim when up the hill as now retire the light strange apparition mock the shepherd 's sight it will be see however from the change make in the text of this poem how wordsworth 's observation of nature develop how thoroughly dissatisfy he soon become with everything conventional and discard every image not draw directly or at first hand from nature the text adopt in the present edition be for the reason state that which be finally sanction by wordsworth himself in the last edition of he poem -lrb- 1849-50 -rrb- the earlier reading occur in previous edition be give in footnote and it may be desirable to explain the way in which these be arrange it will be see that whenever the text have be change a date be give in the footnote ` before ' the other reading be add this date which accompany the reference number of the footnote indicate the year in which the reading finally retain be first adopt by wordsworth the earlier reading then follow in chronological order with the year to which they belong -lrb- 12 -rrb- and it be in every case to be assume that the last of the change indicate be continue in all subsequent edition of the work no direct information be give as to how long a particular reading be retain or through how many edition it run it be to be assume however that it be retain in all intermediate edition till the next change of text be state it would encumber the note with too many figure if in every instance in which a change be make the corresponding state of the text in all the other edition be indicate but if no new reading follow the text quote it be to be take for grant that the reading in question be continue in every subsequent edition until the date which accompany the reference figure two illustration will make this clear the first be a case in which the text be only altered once the second a instance in which it be alter six time in the ` evening walk ' the follow line occur -- the dog loud bark ` mid the glitter rock hunt where he master point the intercept flock and the footnote be as follow : 1836 that bark busy ` mid the glitter rock hunt where he point the intercept flock 1793 in the light of what have be say above and by reference to the bibliography it will be see from these two date that the original text of 1793 -- give in the footnote -- be continue in the edition of 1820 1827 and 1832 -lrb- it be omit from the extract of 1815 -rrb- that it be change in the year 1836 and that this reading be retain in the edition of 1843 1845 and 1849 again in ` simon lee ' the line occur : but what to they avail the land which he can till no longer and the follow be the footnote : 1845 but what avail the land to they which they can till no longer 1798 but what saith he avail the land which i can till no longer 1827 but what avail it now the land which he can till no longer 1832 ` tis he but what avail the land which he can till no longer 1837 the time alas be come when he can till the land no longer 1840 the time be also come when he can till the land no longer c from this it will be see that the text adopt in the first edition of lyrical ballad in 1798 be retain in the edition of 1800 1802 1805 1815 and 1820 that it be alter in each of the edition of 1827 1832 1837 1840 as also in the m reading in lord coleridge 's copy of the work and in the edition of 1845 and that the version of 1845 be retain in the edition of 1849-50 it should be add that when a verse or stanza or line -- occur in one or other of the earlier edition -- be omit from that of 1849 the footnote simply contain the extract along with the date of the year or year in which it occur and that in such case the date do not follow the reference number of the footnote but be place for obvious reason at the end of the extract the same thing be true of ` descriptive sketch ' in the year 1827 there be scarcely any alteration make on the text of the poem as print in 1820 still fewer be add in 1832 but for the edition of 1836 the whole be virtually rewrite and in that state it be finally leave although a few significant change be make in 1845 slight change of spelling which occur in the successive edition be not mention when however the change be one of transposition although the text remain unaltered -- as be largely the case in ` simon lee ' for example -- it be always indicate it will be further observe that at the beginning of every poem two date be give the first on the left-hand side be the date of composition the second on the right-hand side be the date of the first publication in what class the poem first appear and the change -lrb- if any -rrb- which subsequently occur in its title be mention in the note append third in the present edition several suggest change of text which be write by wordsworth on the margin of a copy of he edition of 1836-7 which he keep beside he at rydal mount be publish these m note seem to have be write by himself or dictate to other at interval between the year 1836 and 1850 and they be thus a record of pass thought or mood of he own mind during these year some of these be afterwards introduce into the edition of 1842 1846 and 1849 other be not make use of the latter have now a value of they own as indicate certain new phase of thought and feeling in wordsworth 's later year i owe my knowledge of they and the permission to use they to the kindness of the late chief justice of england lord coleridge the follow be a extract from a letter from he : fox ghyll ambleside ' 4th October 1881 ' i have be long intend to write you as to the manuscript note and alteration in wordsworth 's poem which you have have the opportunity of see and so far as you think fit of use for you edition they come into my possession in this way i see they advertise in a catalogue which be send I and at my request the book be very courteously forward to I for my inspection it appear to I of sufficient interest and value to induce I to buy it and i accordingly become the purchaser it be a copy of the edition in six volume the publication of which begin in the year 1836 and of the volume contain the collect sonnet which be afterwards print uniformly with that edition it appear to have be the copy which wordsworth himself use for correct alter and add to the poem contain in it as you have see in some of the poem the alteration be very large amounting sometimes to a complete rewrite of considerable passage many of these alteration have be print in subsequent edition some have not two or three small poem as far as i know have not be hitherto publish much of the writing be wordsworth 's own but perhaps the larger portion be the hand-writing of other one or more not familiar to I as wordsworth 's be how the volume come to be sell i do not know such as they be and whatever be they interest or value you be as far as i be concerned heartily welcome to they and i shall be glad indeed if they add in the least degree to make you edition more worthy of the great man for whom my admiration grow every day i live and my deep gratitude to whom will cease only with my life and my reason this precious copy of the edition of 1836-7 be now the property of lady coleridge i re-examine it in 1894 and add several reading which i have omit to note twelve year ago when lord coleridge first show it to I i should add that since the issue of the volume of 1882-6 many other m copy of individual poem have come under my notice and that every important variation of text in they be incorporate in this edition as it be impossible to discover the precise year in which the suggest alteration of text be write by wordsworth on the margin of the edition of 1836 they will be indicate wherever they occur by the initial letter c comparatively few change occur in the poem of early year a copy of the 1814 -lrb- quarto -rrb- edition of ` the excursion ' now in the possession of a grandson of the poet the rev john wordsworth gosforth rectory cumberland -- which be the copy wordsworth keep at rydal mount for annotation and correction much in the same way as he keep the edition of 1836-7 -- have also be kindly send to I by its present owner for examination and use in this edition and in it i have find some additional reading fourth in the present edition all the note and memorandum explanatory of the poem which wordsworth dictate to miss fenwick be give in full miss fenwick live much at rydal mount during the later year of the poet 's life and it be to they friendship and to she induce wordsworth to dictate these note that we owe most of the information we possess as to the occasion and circumstance under which he poem be compose these note be first make use of -- although only in a fragmentary manner -- by the late bishop of lincoln in the ` memoirs ' of he uncle they be afterwards incorporate in full in the edition of 1857 issue by mr moxon under the direction of mr carter and in the centenary edition they be subsequently print in ` the prose work of wordsworth ' edit by dr grosart and in my edition of 1882-6 i be uncertain whether it be the original m write by miss fenwick or the copy of it afterwards take for miss quillinan to which dr grosart have access the text of these note as print in the edition of 1857 be certainly -lrb- in very many case -rrb- widely different from what be give in ` the prose work ' of 1876 i have make many correction -- from the m which i have examine with care -- of error which exist in all previously print copy of these note include my own what appear in this volume be print from a m which miss quillinan give I to examine and copy and which she assure I be the original one the proper place for these fenwick note be doubtless that which be assign to they by the editor of 1857 viz before the poem which they respectively illustrate fifth topographical note explanatory of the allusion make by wordsworth to the locality in the english lake district and elsewhere be add throughout the volume this have already be attempt to some extent by several writer but a good deal more remain to be do and i may repeat what i write on this subject in 1878 many of wordsworth 's allusion to place be obscure and the exact locality difficult to identify it be doubtful if he care whether they could be afterwards trace out or not and in reference to one particular rock refer to in the poem on the naming of place when ask by a friend to localize it he decline reply to the question yes that -- or any other that will suit there be no doubt that in many instance he allusion to place be intentionally vague and in some of he most realistic passage he avowedly weave together a description of locality remote from each other it be true that poem of place be not mean to be photograph and be they simply to reproduce the feature of a particular district and be a exact transcript of reality they would be literary photograph and not poem poetry can not in the nature of thing be a mere register of phenomenon appeal to the eye or the ear no imaginative writer however in the whole range of english literature be so peculiarly identify with locality as wordsworth be and there be not one on the roll of poet the appreciation of whose writings be more aid by a intimate knowledge of the district in which he live the wish to be able to identify he allusion to those place which he so specially interpret be natural to every one who have ever feel the spell of he genius and it be indispensable to all who would know the special charm of a region which he describe as a national property and of which he beyond all other man may be say to have effect the literary conveyance to posterity but it have be ask -- and will doubtless be ask again -- what be the use of a minute identification of all these place be not the general fact that wordsworth describe this district of mountain vale and mere sufficient without any further attempt at localisation the question be more important and have wider bearing than appear upon the surface it must be admit on the one hand that the discovery of the precise point in every local allusion be not necessary to a understanding or appreciation of the poem but it must be remember on the other hand that wordsworth be never contented with simply copy what he see in nature of the ` evening walk ' -- write in he eighteenth year -- he say that the plan of the poem have not be confine to a particular walk or a individual place a proof -lrb- of which i be unconscious at the time -rrb- of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chain of fact and real circumstance the country be idealised rather than describe in any one of its local aspect -lrb- 13 -rrb- again he say of the ` line write while sailing in a boat at evening ' : it be during a solitary walk on the bank of the cam that i be first strike with this appearance and apply it to my own feeling in the manner here express change the scene to the thame near windsor -lrb- 14 -rrb- and of ` guilt and sorrow ' he say to obviate some distraction in the mind of those who be well acquaint with salisbury plain it may be proper to say that of the feature describe as belong to it one or two be take from other desolate part of england -lrb- 15 -rrb- in ` the excursion ' he pass from langdale to grasmere over to patterdale back to grasmere and again to hawe water without warning and even in the case of the duddon sonnet he introduce a description take direct from rydal mr aubrey de vere tell of a conversation he have with wordsworth in which he vehemently condemn the ultra-realistic poet who go to nature with pencil and note-book and jot down whatever strike he most add nature do not permit a inventory to be make of she charm he should have leave he pencil and note-book at home fix he eye as he walk with a reverent attention on all that surround he and take all into a heart that could understand and enjoy afterwards he would have discover that while much of what he have admire be preserve to he much be also most wisely obliterate _ that which remain the picture survive in he mind would have present the ideal and essential truth of the scene and do so in large part by discard much which though in itself striking be not characteristic _ in every scene many of the most brilliant detail be but accidental the two last sentence of this extract give admirable expression to one feature of wordsworth 's interpretation of nature in the deepest poetry as in the loftiest music -- in wordsworth 's lyric as in beethoven 's sonata -- it be by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they exhaustively express that they truth and power be know in what he leave unsaid write schiller i discover the master of style it depend no doubt upon the vision of the inward eye and the reproductive power of the idealising mind whether the result be a travesty of nature or the embodiment of a truth higher than nature yield on the other hand it be equally certain that the identification of locality cast a sudden light in many instance upon obscure passage in a poem and be by far the best commentary that can be give it be much to be able to compare the actual scene with the ideal creation suggest by it as the latter be both wordsworth 's reading of the text of nature and he interpretation of it in he seventy-third year he say look back on he ` evening walk ' that there be not a image in the poem which he have not observe and that he recollect the time and place where most of they be note in the fenwick note we constantly find he say the fact occur strictly as record the fact be as mention in the poem and the fact very often involve the accessory of place any one who have try to trace out the allusion in the poem on the naming of place or to discover the site of michael 's sheepfold to identify ghimmer crag or thurston-mere -- not to speak of the individual rock and recess near blea tarn at the head of little langdale so minutely describe in ` the excursion ' -- will admit that local commentary be a important aid to the understanding of wordsworth if to read the ` yew tree ' in borrowdale itself in mute repose to lie and listen to the mountain flood murmur from glaramara 's inmost cave to read ` the brother ' in ennerdale or the daffodil by the shore of ullswater give a new significance to these poem of the imagination a discovery of the obscurer allusion to place or scene will deepen we appreciation of those passage in which he idealism be most pronounced every one know kirkstone pass aira force dungeon ghyll the wish gate and helm crag : many person know the glowworm rock and use to know the rock of name but where be emma 's dell or the meeting point of two highway so characteristically describe in the twelfth book of ` the prelude ' and who will fix the site of the pool in rydal upper park immortalise in the poem ` to m h ' or identify joanna 's rock many of the place in the english lake district be undergo change and every year the local allusion will be more difficult to trace perhaps the most interesting memorial of the poet which exist viz the rock of name on the shore of thirlmere be now sink under the water of a manchester reservoir other memorial be perish by the wear and tear of time the decay of old building the alteration of road the cut down of tree and the modernize or improve of the district generally all this be inevitable but it be well that many of the natural object over and around which the light of wordsworth 's genius linger be out of the reach of improvement and be indestructible even by machinery if it be object that several of the place which we try to identify -- and which some would prefer to leave for ever undisturbed in the realm of imagination -- be purposely leave obscure it may be reply that death and time have probably now remove all reason for reticence especially in the case of those poem refer to domestic life and friendly tie while a author be alive or while those be alive to whom he have make reference in the course of he allusion to place it may even be right that work design for posterity should not be deal with after the fashion of the modern interviewer but greatness have its penalty and a fierce light beat around the throne of genius as well as round that of empire moreover all experience show that posterity take a great and a grow interest in exact topographical illustration of the work of great author the labor recently bestow upon the place connect with shakespeare scott and burn sufficiently attest this the locality in westmoreland which be most permanently associate with wordsworth be these : grasmere where he live during the year of he poetic prime and where he be bury lower easdale where he pass so many day with he sister by the side of the brook and on the terrace at lancrigg and where ` the prelude ' be dictate rydal mount where he spend the latter half of he life and where he find one of the most perfect retreat in england great langdale and blea tarn at the head of little langdale immortalise in ` the excursion ' the upper end of ullswater and kirkstone pass and all the mountain track and path round grasmere and rydal especially the old upper road between they under nab scar he favorite walk during he later year where he compose hundred of verse there be scarcely a rock or mountain summit a stream or tarn or even a well a grove or forest-side in all that neighborhood which be not imperishably identify with this poet who at once interpret they as they have never be interpret before and add the gleam the light that never be on sea or land the consecration and the poet 's dream it may be worthy of note that wordsworth himself sanction the principle of trace out local allusion both by dictate the fenwick note and by republish he essay on the topography of the lake along with the duddon sonnet in 1820 -- and also by itself in 1822 -- from a belief that it would tend materially to illustrate he poem in this edition the topographical note usually follow the poem to which they refer but in the case of the longer poem such as ` the prelude ' ` the excursion ' and other it seem more convenient to print they at the foot of the page than to oblige the reader to turn to the end of the volume from the accident of my have try long ago -- at principal shairp 's request -- to do what he tell I he wish to do but have fail to carry out i have be suppose quite erroneously to be a ` authority ' on the subject of the english lake district as interpret in the poem of wordsworth the latter it be true be the title of one of the book which i have write about wordsworth : but although i visit the lake in 1860 -- as a pilgrim resolute -- and have re-visit the district nearly every year for more than a quarter of a century i may say that i have only a partial knowledge of it other such as canon rawnsley mr harry goodwin and mr rix for example know many part of it much better than i do but as i have often have to compare my own judgment with that of such expert as the late dr cradock principal of brasenose college oxford and other i may add that when i differ from they it have be only after a re-examination of they evidence at the locality themselves sixth several poem and fragment of poem hitherto unpublished -- or publish in stray quarter and in desultory fashion -- will find a place in this edition but i reserve these fragment and place they all together in a appendix to the last volume of the poetical work if it be desirable to print these poem in such a edition as this it be equally desirable to separate they from those which wordsworth himself sanction in he final edition of 1849-50 every great author in the literature of the world -- whether he live to old age -lrb- when he judgment may possibly be less critical -rrb- or die young -lrb- when it may be relatively more accurate -rrb- -- should himself determine what portion of he work ought and what ought not to survive at the same time -- while i do not presume to judge in the case of writer whom i know less fully than i happen to know wordsworth and he contemporary -- it seem clear that the very greatest man have occasionally err as to what part of they writings might with most advantage survive and that they have even more frequently err as to what m letter etc -- cast light on they contemporary -- should or should not be preserve i be convince for example that if the wordsworth household have not destroy all the letter which coleridge send to they in the first decade of this century the world would now possess much important knowledge which be for ever lose it may have be wise for reason now unknown to burn those letter write by coleridge : but the student of the literature of the period would gladly have they now pass from the question of the preservation of letter it be evident that wordsworth be very careful in distinguish between the verse which he send to newspaper and magazine and those poem which he include in he publish volume he anxiety on this point may be infer from the way in which he more than once emphasise the fact of republication eg in ` peter bell ' -lrb- 1819 -rrb- he put the follow prefatory note to four sonnet which have previously appear in ` blackwood 's magazine ' and which afterwards -lrb- 1828 -rrb- appear in the ` poetical album ' of alaric watt the following sonnet have lately appear in periodical publication be here reprint some of the poem -lrb- or fragment of poem -rrb- include in the ` addendum ' to volume viii of this edition i would willingly have leave out -lrb- especially the sonnet address to miss marium william -rrb- but since they have appear elsewhere i feel justified in now reprint even that trivial youthful effusion sign axiologus i rejoice however that there be no likelihood that the somersetshire tragedy will ever see the light when i tell wordsworth 's successor in the laureateship that i have burn a copy of that poem send to I by one to whom it have be confide he delight be great it be the chronicle of a revolting crime with nothing in the verse to warrant its publication the only curious thing about it be that wordsworth write it with this exception there be no reason why the fragment which he do not himself republish and other which he publish but afterwards suppress should not now be print the suppression of some of these by the poet himself be as unaccountable as be he omission of certain stanza in the earlier poem from they later version even the cambridge ` installation ode ' which be so feeble will be reprint -lrb- 16 -rrb- ` the glowworm ' which only appear in the edition of 1807 will be republish in full ` andrew jone ' -- also suppress after appear in lyrical ballad of 1800 1802 and 1805 -- will be replace in like manner the youthful ` school exercise ' write at hawkshead the translation from the ` georgic ' of virgil the poem address ` to the queen ' in 1846 will appear in they chronological place in vol viii there be also a translation of some french stanza by franci wrangham on ` the birth of love ' - a poem entitle ` the eagle and the dive ' which be privately print in a volume consist chiefly of french fragment and call ` la petite chouannerie ou historie d'un college breton sous l'empire ' -- a sonnet on the rebuilding of a church at cardiff -- a election squib write during the lowther and brougham contest for the representation of the county of cumberland in 1818 -- some stanza write in the visitor ' book at the ferry windermere and other fragment then since wordsworth publish some verse by he sister dorothy in he own volume other unpublished fragment by miss wordsworth may find a place in this edition i do not attach much importance however to the recovery of these unpublished poem the truth be as sir henry taylor -- himself a poet and critic of no mean order -- remark -lrb- 17 -rrb- in these day when a great man 's path to posterity be likely to be more and more crowded there be a tendency to create a obstruction in the desire to give a impulse to gather about a man 's work all the detail that can be find out about it be in my opinion to put a drag upon it and as of the work so of the life the industrious labor of some editor in disinter the trivial work of great man be not a commendable industry all great writer have occasionally write trifle -- this be true even of shakespeare -- and if they wish they to perish why should we seek to resuscitate they besides this labor -- whether due to the industry of admire friend or to the ambition of the literary resurrectionist -- be futile because the verdict of time be sure and posterity be certain to consign the recover triviality to kindly oblivion the question which should invariably present itself to the editor of the fragment of a great writer be _ can these bone live _ if they can not they have better never see the light indeed the only good reason for reprint the fragment which have be lose -lrb- because the author himself attach no value to they -rrb- be that in a complete collection of the work of a great man some of they may have a biographic or psychological value but have we any right to reproduce from a antiquarian motive what -- in a literary sense -- be either trivial or feeble or sterile we must however distinguish between what be suitable for a edition mean either to popularize a author or to interpret he and a edition intend to bring together all that be worthy of preservation for posterity there be great truth in what mr arnold have lately say of byron : i question whether by read everything which he give we we be so likely to acquire a admiring sense even of he variety and abundance as by read what he give we at he happier moment receive he absolutely without omission and compromise follow he whole outpouring stanza by stanza and line by line from the very commencement to the very end and he be capable of be tiresome -lrb- 18 -rrb- this be quite true nevertheless english literature demand a complete edition of all the work of byron : and it may be safely predict that for weightier reason and with greater urgency it will continue to call for the collect work of wordsworth it should also be note that the fact of wordsworth 's have dictate to miss fenwick -lrb- so late as 1843 -rrb- a stanza from ` the convict ' in he note to ` the lament of mary queen of scot ' -lrb- 1817 -rrb- justify the inclusion of the whole of that -lrb- suppress -rrb- poem in such a edition as this the fact that wordsworth do not republish all he poem in he final edition of 1849-50 be not conclusive evidence that he think they unworthy of preservation and reproduction it must be remember that ` the prelude ' itself be a posthumous publication and also that the fragmentary canto of ` the recluse ' entitle home at grasmere -- as well as the other canto publish in 1886 and entitle -lrb- most prosaically -rrb- compose when a probability exist of we be oblige to quit rydal mount as a residence -- be not publish by the poet himself i be of opinion that he omission of the stanza begin : among all lovely thing my love have be and of the sonnet on he ` voyage down the rhine ' be due to sheer forgetfulness of they existence few poet remember all they past fugitive production at the same time there be other fragment -- write when he be experiment with he theme and when the inspiration of genius have forsake he -- which it be unfortunate that he do not himself destroy among the poem which wordsworth suppress in he final edition be the latin translation of ` the somnambulist ' by he son this will be republish more especially as it be include by wordsworth himself in the second edition of he yarrow revisit it may be well to mention the ` repetition ' which be inevitable in this edition -lrb- 1 -rrb- as already explain those fragment of ` the recluse ' -- which be issue in all the earlier volume and afterwards incorporate in ` the prelude ' -- be print as they originally appear -lrb- 2 -rrb- short note be extract from dorothy wordsworth 's ` recollection of a tour make in scotland ' -lrb- 1803 -rrb- which illustrate the poem compose during that tour while the whole text of that tour will be print in full in subsequent volume -lrb- 3 -rrb- other fragment include the line begin wisdom and spirit of the universe will be print both by themselves in they chronological place and in the longer poem of which they form a part accord to the original plan of they author a detail perhaps not too trivial to mention be that in this edition -- at the suggestion of several friend -- i have follow the example of professor dowden in he aldine edition and number the line of almost all the poem -- even the sonnet when i have not do so the reason will be obvious viz either the structure or the brevity of the poem -lrb- 19 -rrb- in give the date of each poem i have use the word compose rather than write very much because wordsworth himself -- and he sister in she journal -- almost invariably use the word compose although he criticise the term as apply to the creation of a poem as if it be a manufactured article in he chronological table mr dowden adopt the word compose but in he edition of the poem he have make use of the term write -lrb- 20 -rrb- no notice -lrb- or almost none -rrb- of misprint in wordsworth 's own text be take in the note to this edition sometimes a error occur and be carry on through more than one edition and correct in the next : eg in ` the childless father ' the edition of 1827 1832 and 1836 have the line : fresh spring of green boxwood not six month before in the ` erratum ' of the edition of 1836 this be correct to fresh sprig there be other ` erratum ' which remain in the edition of 1849-50 eg in ` rob roy 's grave ' vool for veol and mistake in quotation from other poet such as invention for instruction in wither 's poem on the daisy these be correct without mention i should perhaps add that while i have include amongst the illustrative note extract from henry crabb robinson 's ` diary ' etc many of they be now publish for the first time these voluminous mss of robinson 's have be re-examine with care and the reader who compare the three volume of the ` diary ' etc -- edit by dr sadler -- with the extract now print from the original m will see where sentence omit by the original editor have be include as this edition proceed my debt to many -- who have be so kind as to put they wordsworth mss and memorandum at my disposal -- will be apparent it be difficult to acknowledge duly my obligation to collector of autograph letter -- mr morrison the late mr locker lampson the late mr mackay of the grange trowbridge and a score of other -- but i may say in general that the kindness of those who possess wordsworth mss in allow I to examine they have be a very genuine evidence of they interest in the poet and he work my special thanks be due to mr gordon wordsworth who have in the kindest manner and for many year place everything at my disposal which could further my labor on he grandfather 's work finally i wish to express the great debt i owe to the late mr j dyke campbell for many suggestion and for he unwearied interest in this work -- which i think be second only to he interest in coleridge -- and also to mr w b kinghorn for he valuable assistance in the revision of proof sheet if there be any desideratum in reference to wordsworth -- in addition to a new life a critical essay and such a bibliography of criticism as will be adequate for posterity -- a ` concordance ' to he work be one of they a correspondent once offer to prepare this for I if i find a publisher : and another have undertake to compile a volume of ` parallel passage ' from the earlier poet of england and of the world a concordance might very well form part of a volume of ` wordsworthiana ' and be a real service to future student of the poet william knight -lrb- footnote 1 : in addition to my own detection of error in the text and note to the edition 1882-9 i acknowledge special obligation to the late vice-chancellor of the victorium university principal greenwood who go over every volume with laborious care and send I the result to the late mr j dyke campbell to mr j r tutin to the rev thoma hutchinson of kimbolton and to many other i be similarly indebted -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see ` memoirs of william wordsworth ' ii pp 113 114 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : it be however different with the fragment which be publish in all the edition issue in the poet 's lifetime and afterwards in ` the prelude ' such as the line on the immortal boy of windermere these be print in they chronological place and also in the posthumous poem -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : ` poem of wordsworth select and arrange by matthew arnold ' london : macmillan and co -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : see the ` life of sir w

actual alteration introduce deliberately as improvement by the hand of the poet himself -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : the collection in the british museum and those in all the university library of the country be incomplete -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : the publication of this edition be superintend by mr carter who act as wordsworth 's secretary for thirty-seven year and be appoint one of he literary executor -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : let the indiscriminate admirer of first edition turn to this quarto and perhaps even he may wonder why it have be rescue from oblivion i be only aware of the existence of five copy of the edition of 1793 and although it have a certain autobiographic value i do not think that many who read it once will return to it again except as a literary curiosity here -- and not in lyrical ballad or ` the excursion ' -- be the quarry where jeffrey or gifford might have find abundant material for criticism -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : it be unfortunate that the ` memoirs ' do not tell we to what poem the remark apply or to whom the letter contain it be address -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : it be important to note that the print text in several of the edition be occasionally cancel in the list of ` erratum ' at the beginning or the end of the volume : also that many copy of the early edition -lrb- notably those of 1800 -rrb- be bind up without the full `

variety of natural appearance which have be unnoticed by the poet of any age or country so far as i be acquaint with they and i make a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency i could not have be at that time above fourteen year of age the description of the swan that follow be take from the daily opportunity i have of observe they habit not as confine to the gentleman 's park but in a

horseman seem to come from the lowest part of southen-fell and become visible just at a place call knott they then move in regular troops along the side of the fell till they come opposite blakehill when they go over the mountain then they describe a kind of curvilinear path upon the side of the fell and both these first and last appearance be bound by the top of the mountain frequently the last or last but one in a troop would leave he place and gallop to the front and then take the same pace with the rest -- a regular swift walk thus change happen to every troop -lrb- for many troops appear

poison at the heart lacy what mean you wallace -lrb- whose eye have be fix suspiciously upon oswald -rrb- ay what be it you mean marmaduke hark ` ee my friend -- -lrb- appear gay -rrb- be there a man who be weak and helpless and most forlorn should bribe a mother press by penury to yield he up she daughter a little infant and instruct the babe prattle upon he knee to call he father -- lacy why if

bid the highest in the market of foul pollution -- lacy the whole visible world contain not such a monster marmaduke for this purpose should he resolve to taint she soul by means which bathe the limb in sweat to think of they should he by tale which would draw tear from iron work on she nature and so turn compassion and gratitude to minister of vice and make the spotless spirit of filial love prime mover in a plot to damn he victim both soul and body -- wallace ` tis too horrible oswald what say you to it lacy hew he down and fling he to the raven marmaduke but he aspect it be so meek he

more than perhaps become I or duty sanction lacy we will have ample justice who be we friend do we not live on ground where soul be self-defended free to grow like mountain oak rock by the stormy wind

the camp yes to the camp oh wisdom a most wise resolve and then that half a word should blow it to the wind this last device must end my work -- methink it be a pleasant pastime to construct a scale and table of belief -- as thus -- two column one for passion one for proof each rise as the other fall : and first passion a unit and _ against _ we -- proof -- nay we must travel in another path or we be stick fast for ever -- passion then shall be a unit _ for _ we proof -- no passion we 'll not insult thy majesty by time person and place -- the where the when the how and all particulars that dull brain require to constitute the spiritless shape of fact they bow to call the idol demonstration a whipping to the moralist who preach that misery be a sacred thing : for I i know no cheaper engine to degrade a man nor any half so sure this stripling 's mind be shake till the dregs float on the surface and in the storm and anguish of the heart he talk of a transition in he soul and dream that he be happy we dissect the senseless body and why not the mind -- these be strange sight -- the mind of man upturn be in all nature a strange spectacle in some a hideous one -- hem shall i stop no -- thought and feeling will sink deep but then they have no substance pass but a few minute and something shall be do which memory may touch whene'er she vassal be at work -lrb- enter marmaduke from behind -rrb- oswald -lrb- turn to meet he -rrb- but listen for my peace -- marmaduke why i _ believe _ you oswald but hear the proof -- marmaduke ay prove that when two pea lie snugly in a pod the pod must then be larger than the pea -- prove this -- ` twere matter worthy the hearing fool be i to dream it ever could be otherwise oswald last night when i return with water from the brook i overhear the villain -- every word like red-hot iron burn into my heart say one it be agree on the blind man shall feign a sudden illness and the girl who on she journey must proceed alone under pretence of violence be seize she be continue the detest slave she be right willing -- strange if she be not -- they say lord clifford be a savage man but faith to see he in he silken tunic fitting he low voice to the minstrel 's harp there be witchery i not i never know a maid that could withstand it true continue he when we arrange the affair she weep a little -lrb- not the less welcome to my lord for that -rrb- and say ` my father he will have it so ' marmaduke i be you hearer oswald this i catch and more that may not be retell to any ear the obstinate bolt of a small iron door detain they near the gateway of the castle by a dim lantern 's light i see that wreath of flower be in they hand as if design for festive decoration and they say with brutal laughter and most foul allusion that they should share the banquet with they lord and he new favorite marmaduke misery -- oswald i know how you would be disturb by this dire news and therefore choose this solitary moor here to impart the tale of which last night i strove to ease my mind when we two comrade commission by the band burst in upon we marmaduke last night when move to lift the avenge steel i do believe all thing be shadow -- yea living or dead all thing be bodiless or but the mutual mockery of body till that same star summon I back again now i could laugh till my rib ache fool to let a creed build in the heart of thing dissolve before a twinkling atom -- oswald i could fetch lesson out of wiser school than you have enter be it worth the pain young as i be i might go forth a teacher and you should see how deeply i could reason of love in all its shape beginning end of moral quality in they diverse aspect of action and they law and tendency oswald you take it as it merit -- marmaduke one a king general or cham sultan or emperor strew twenty acre of good meadow-ground with carcase in lineament and shape and substance nothing differ from he own but that they can not stand up of themselves another sit i ' th ' sun and by the hour float kingcup in the brook -- a hero one we call and scorn the other as time 's spendthrift but have they not a world of common ground to occupy -- both fool or wise alike each in he way oswald troth i begin to think so marmaduke now for the corner-stone of my philosophy : i would not give a denier for the man who on such provocation as this earth yield could not chuck he babe beneath the chin and send it with a fillip to its grave oswald nay you leave I behind marmaduke that such a one so pious in demeanor in he look so saintly and so pure -- hark ` ee my friend i 'll plant myself before lord clifford 's castle a surly mastiff kennel at the gate and he shall howl and i will laugh a medley most tunable oswald in faith a pleasant scheme but take you sword along with you for that might in such neighborhood find seemly use -- but first how wash we hand of this old man marmaduke oh yes that mole that viper in the path plague on my memory he i have forget oswald you know we leave he sit -- see he yonder marmaduke ha ha -- oswald as ` twill be but a moment 's work i will stroll on you follow when ` tis do -lrb- exeunt -rrb- scene change to another part of the moor at a short distance -- herbert be discover seat on a stone herbert a sound of laughter too -- ` tis well -- i fear the stranger have some pitiable sorrow press upon he solitary heart hush -- ` tis the feeble and earth-loving wind that creep along the bell of the crisp heather alas ` tis cold -- i shiver in the sunshine -- what can this mean there be a psalm that speak of god 's parental mercy -- with idonea i use to sing it -- listen -- what foot be there -lrb- enter marmaduke -rrb- marmaduke -lrb- aside -- look at herbert -rrb- and i have love this man and _ she _ have love he and i love she and she love the lord clifford and there it end -- if this be not enough to make mankind merry for evermore then plain it be as day that eye be make for a wise purpose -- verily to weep with -lrb- look round -rrb- a pretty prospect this a masterpiece of nature finish with most curious skill -lrb- to herbert -rrb- good baron have you ever practice tillage pray tell I what this land be worth by the acre herbert how glad i be to hear you voice i know not wherein i have offend you -- last night i find in you the kindest of protector this morning when i speak of weariness you from my shoulder take my scrip and throw it about you own but for these two hour past once only have you speak when the lark whir from among the fern beneath we foot and i no coward in my better day be almost terrify marmaduke that be excellent -- so you bethink you of the many way in which a man may come to he end whose crime have rouse all nature up against he -- pshaw -- herbert for mercy 's sake be nobody in sight no traveller peasant herdsman marmaduke not a soul : here be a tree raggèd and bent and bare that turn its goat 's - beard flake of pea-green moss from the stern breathing of the rough sea-wind this have we but no other company : commend I to the place if a man should die and leave he body here it be all one as he be twenty fathom underground herbert where be we common friend marmaduke a ghost methink -- the spirit of a murder man for instance -- might have fine room to ramble about here a grand domain to squeak and gibber in herbert lose man if thou have any close-pent guilt press upon thy heart and this the hour of visitation -- marmaduke a bold word from _ you _ herbert restore he heaven marmaduke the desperate wretch -- a flower fairest of all flower be she once but now they have snap she from the stem -- poh let she lie besoil with mire and let the houseless snail feed on she leaf you know she well -- ay there old man you be a very lynx you know the worm be in she -- herbert mercy sir what mean you marmaduke you have a daughter herbert oh that she be here -- she have a eye that sink into all heart and if i have in aught offend you soon would she gentle voice make peace between we marmaduke -lrb- aside -rrb- i do believe he weep -- i could weep too -- there be a vein of she voice that run through he : even such a man my fancy body forth from the first moment that i love the maid and for he sake i love she more : these tear -- i do not think that aught be leave in I of what i have be -- yes i thank thee heaven one happy thought have pass across my mind -- it may not be -- i be cut off from man no more shall i be man -- no more shall i have human feeling -- -lrb- to herbert -rrb- -- now for a little more about you daughter herbert troops of armed man meet in the road would bless we little child rush along in the full tide of play stand silent as we pass they i have hear the boisterous carman in the miry road check he loud whip and hail we with mild voice and speak with milder voice to he poor beast marmaduke and whither be you go herbert learn young man -- to fear the virtuous and reverence misery whether too much for patience or like mine softened till it become a gift of mercy marmaduke now this be as it should be herbert i be weak -- my daughter do not know how weak i be and as thou see ` st under the arch of heaven here do i stand alone to helplessness by the good god we common father doom -- but i have once a spirit and a arm -- marmaduke now for a word about you barony : i fancy when you leave the holy land and come to -- what be you title -- eh you claim be undisputed herbert like a mendicant whom no one come to meet i stand alone -- i murmured -- but remember he who feed the pelican and ostrich of the desert from my own threshold i look up to heaven and do not want glimmering of quiet hope so from the court i pass and down the brook lead by its murmur to the ancient oak i come and when i feel its cooling shade i sate I down and can not but believe -- while in my lap i hold my little babe and clasp she to my heart my heart that ache more with delight than grief -- i hear a voice such as by cherith on elijah call it say i will be with thee a little boy a shepherd-lad ere yet my trance be go hail we as if he have be send from heaven and say with tear that he would be we guide : i have a better guide -- that innocent babe -- she who have save I to this hour from harm from cold from hunger penury and death to whom i owe the best of all the good i have or wish for upon earth -- and more and higher far than lie within earth 's bound : therefore i bless she : when i think of man i bless she with sad spirit -- when of god i bless she in the fulness of my joy marmaduke the name of daughter in he mouth he pray with nerve so steady that the very fly sit unmolested on he staff -- innocent -- if he be innocent -- then he would tremble and be disturb as i be -lrb- turn aside -rrb- i have read in story what man now alive have witness how when the people 's mind be rack with doubt appeal be make to the great judge : the accuse with naked foot walk over burn ploughshare here be a man by nature 's hand prepare for a like trial but more merciful why else have i be lead to this bleak waste bare be it without house or track and destitute of obvious shelter as a shipless sea here will i leave he -- here -- all-seeing god such as _ he _ be and sore perplexed as i be i will commit he to this final _ ordeal _ -- he hear a voice -- a shepherd-lad come to he and be he guide if once why not again and in this desert if never -- then the whole of what he say and look and do and be make up one damning falsehood leave he here to cold and hunger -- pain be of the heart and what be a few throe of bodily suffering if they can waken one pang of remorse -lrb- go up to herbert -rrb- old man my wrath be as a flame burn out it can not be rekindle thou art here lead by my hand to save thee from perdition : thou wilt have time to breathe and think -- herbert oh mercy marmaduke i know the need that all man have of mercy and therefore leave thee to a righteous judgment herbert my child my blessèd child marmaduke no more of that thou wilt have many guide if thou art innocent yea from the utmost corner of the earth that woman will come o'er this waste to save thee -lrb- he pause and look at herbert 's staff -rrb- ha what be here and carve by she own hand -lrb- read upon the staff -rrb- i be eye to the blind saith the lord he that put he trust in I shall not fail yes be it so -- repent and be forgive -- god and that staff be now thy only guide -lrb- he leave herbert on the moor -rrb- scene -- a eminence a beacon on the summit lacy wallace lennox etc etc several of the band -lrb- confusedly -rrb- but patience one of the band curse on that traitor oswald -- we captain make a prey to foul device -- lennox -lrb- to wallace -rrb- he tool the wander beggar make last night a plain confession such as leave no doubt know what otherwise we know too well that she reveal the truth stand by I now for rather would i have a nest of viper between my breast-plate and my skin than make oswald my special enemy if you deny I you support lacy we have be fool -- but for the motive wallace nature such as he spin motive out of they own bowels lacy i learn would this when i be a confessor i know he well there need no other motive than that most strange incontinence in crime which haunt this oswald power be life to he and breath and be where he can not govern he will destroy lacy to have be trap like mole -- yes you be right we need not hunt for motive : there be no crime from which this man would shrink he reck not human law and i have notice that often when the name of god be utter a sudden blankness overspread he face lennox yet reasoner as he be he pride have build some uncouth superstition of its own wallace i have see trace of it lennox once he head a band of pirate in the norway sea and when the king of denmark summon he to the oath of fealty i well remember 'twa a strange answer that he make he say i hold of spirit and the

such mind as find amid they fellow-men no heart that love they none that they can love will turn perforce and seek for sympathy in dim relation to imagine being one of the band what if he mean to offer up we captain a expiation and a sacrifice to those infernal fiend wallace now if the event should be as lennox have foretell then swear my friend he heart shall have as many wound as there be dagger here lacy what need of swearing one of the band let we away another away a third hark how the horn of those scotch rover echo through the vale lacy stay you behind and when the sun be down

marmaduke a later meeting oswald would have be better time oswald alone i see you have do you duty i have hope which now i feel that you will justify marmaduke i have fear from which i have free myself -- but ` tis my wish to be alone and therefore we must part oswald nay then -- i be mistaken there be a weakness about you still you talk of solitude -- i be you friend marmaduke what need of this assurance at any time and why give now oswald because you be now in truth my master you have teach I what there be not another live man have strength to teach -- and therefore gratitude be bold and would relieve itself by praise marmaduke wherefore press this on I oswald because i feel that you have show and by a signal instance how they who would be just must seek the rule by diving for it into they own bosom to-day you have throw off a tyranny that live but in the torpid acquiescence of we emasculated soul the tyranny of the world 's master with the musty rule by which they uphold they craft from age to age : you have obey the only law that sense submit to recognize the immediate law from the clear light of circumstance flash upon a independent intellect henceforth new prospects open on you path you faculty should grow with the demand i still will be you friend will cleave to you through good and evil obloquy and scorn oft as they dare to follow on you step marmaduke i would

so -- he be forsake oswald there be a power in sound : the cry he utter might have stop the boat that bear we through the water -- marmaduke you return upon that dismal hearing -- do you not oswald some scoff at he with hellish mockery and laugh so loud it seem that the smooth sea do from some distant region echo we marmaduke we all be of one blood we vein be fill at the same poisonous fountain

until the mystery of all this world be solve well may we envy the worm that underneath a stone whose weight would crush the lion 's paw with mortal anguish doth lodge and feed and coil and sleep in safety fall not the wrath of heaven upon those traitor oswald give not to they a think from palestine we march to syria : oft i leave the camp when all that multitude of heart be still and follow on through wood of gloomy cedar into deep chasm trouble by roar stream or from the top of lebanon survey the moonlight desert and the moonlight sea : in these my lonely wanderings i perceive what mighty

year 1793 have leave the isle of wight and crost salisbury plain as mention in the preface to ` guilt and sorrow ' i proceed by bristol up the wye and so on to n wale to the vale of clwydd where i spend my summer under the roof of the father of my friend robert jone in reference to this poem i will here mention one of the most remarkable fact in my own poetic history and that of mr coleridge in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself start from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stone near it and as we unite fund be very small we agree to defray the expense of the tour by write a poem to be send to the ` new monthly magazine ' set up by philip the bookseller and edit by dr aikin accordingly we set off and proceed along the quantock hill towards watchet and in the course of this walk be plan the poem of ` the ancient mariner ' found on a dream as mr coleridge say of he friend mr cruikshank much the greatest part of the story be mr coleridge 's invention but certain part i myself suggest : for example some crime be to be commit which should bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call he the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and he own wanderings i have be read in shelvocke 's ` voyage ' a day or two before that while double cape horn they frequently see albatross in that latitude the largest sort of sea-fowl some extend they wing twelve or thirteen foot ` suppose ' say i ` you represent he as have kill one of these bird on enter the south sea and that the tutelary spirit of these region take upon they to avenge the crime ' the incident be think fit for the purpose and adopt accordingly i also suggest the navigation of the ship by the dead man but do not recollect that i have anything more to do with the scheme of the poem the gloss with which it be subsequently accompany be not think of by either of we at the time at least not a hint of it be give to I and i have no doubt it be a gratuitous after-thought we begin the composition together on that to I memorable evening : i furnished two or three line at the beginning of the poem in particular -- and listen would like a three year ' child the mariner have he will these trifling contribution all but one -lrb- which mr c have with unnecessary scrupulosity record -rrb- slipt out of he mind as well they might as we endeavor to proceed conjointly -lrb- i speak of the same evening -rrb- we respective manners prove so widely different that it would have be quite presumptuous in I to do anything but separate from a undertaking upon which i could only have be a clog we return after a few day from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of they droll enough recollection we return by dulverton to alfoxden ` the ancient mariner ' grow and grow till it become too important for we first object which be limit to we expectation of five pound and we begin to talk of a volume which be to consist as mr coleridge have tell the world of poem chiefly on natural subject take from common life but look at as much as might be through a imaginative medium accordingly i write ` the idiot boy ' ` she eye be wild ' etc ` we be seven ' ` the thorn ' and some other to return to ` we be seven ' the piece that call forth this note i compose it while walk in the grove at alfoxden my friend will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walk to and fro i compose the last stanza first have begin with the last line when it be all but finish i come in and recite it to mr coleridge and my sister and say a prefatory stanza must be add and i should sit down to we little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task be finish i mention in substance what i wish to be express and coleridge immediately throw off the stanza thus a little child dear brother jem i object to the rhyme ` dear brother jem ' as be ludicrous but we all enjoy the joke of hitch in we friend jame tobin 's name who be familiarly call jem he be the brother of the dramatist and this remind I of a anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice the say jem get a sight of the

he take in my good name as a writer and beg to know what be the unfortunate piece he allude to he say ` it be call ` we be seven '' ` nay ' say i ` that shall take its chance however ' and he leave I

which i have be prevent from write by never have feel myself in a mood when it be probable that i should write it well -- the character which i have here introduce speaking be sufficiently common the reader will perhaps have a general notion of it if he have ever know a man a captain of a small trading vessel for example who be past the middle age of life have retire upon a annuity or small independent income to some village or country town of which he be not a native or in which he have not be accustom to live such man have little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence and from the same cause and other predispose cause by which it be probable that such man may have be affect they be prone to superstition on which account it appear to I proper to select a character like this to exhibit some of the general law by which superstition act upon the mind superstitious man be almost always man of slow faculty and deep feeling they mind be not loose but adhesive they have a reasonable share of imagination by which word i mean the faculty which produce impressive effect out of simple element but they be utterly destitute of fancy the power by which pleasure and surprise be excite by sudden variety of situation and by accumulate imagery it be my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such man cleave to the same idea and to follow the turn of passion always different yet not palpably different by which they conversation be sway i have two object to attain first to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character that should describe it secondly while i adhere to the style in which such person describe to take care that word which in they mind be impregnate with passion should likewise convey passion to reader who be not accustom to sympathize with man feel in that manner or use such language it seem to I that this might be do by call in the assistance of lyrical and rapid metre it be necessary that the poem to be natural should in reality move slowly yet i hope that by the aid of the metre to those who should at all enter into the spirit of the poem it would appear to move quickly the reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as i be sensible that a introductory poem be necessary to give this poem its full effect upon this occasion i will request permission to add a few word closely connect with ` the thorn ' and many other poem in these volume there be a numerous class of reader who imagine that the same word can not be repeat without tautology this be a great error : virtual tautology be much oftener produce by use different word when the meaning be exactly the same word a poet 's word more particularly ought to be weigh in the balance of feeling and not measure by the space which they occupy upon paper for the reader can not be too often remind that poetry be passion : it be the history or science of feeling : now every man must know that a attempt be rarely make to communicate impassioned feeling without something of a accompany consciousness of the inadequateness of we own power or the deficiency of language during such effort there will be a craving in the mind and as long as it be unsatisfied the speaker will cling to the same word or word of the same character there be also various other reason why repetition and apparent tautology be frequently beauty of the highest kind among the chief of these reason be the interest which the mind attach to word not only as symbol of the passion but as ` thing ' active and efficient which be of themselves part of the passion and further from a spirit of fondness exultation and gratitude the mind luxuriate in the repetition of word which appear successfully to communicate its feeling the truth of these remark might be show by innumerable passage from the bible and from the impassioned poetry of every nation awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song : arise barak and lead captivity captive thou

little idle saunter thing with other name a endless string 160 but now that time be go and past and betty 's droop at the heart that happy time all past and go how can it be he be so late the doctor he have make he wait 165 susan they 'll both be here anon and susan 's grow worse and worse and betty be in a sad _ quandary _ and then there be nobody to say if she must go or she must stay 170 --

still at susan 's side and susan now begin to fear -lrb- 16 -rrb- of sad mischance not a few that johnny may perhaps be drown or lose perhaps and never find 180 which they must both for ever rue she preface half a hint of this with god forbid it should be true at the first word that susan say cry betty rise from the bed 185 susan i would gladly stay with you i must be go i must away : consider johnny 's but half-wise susan we must take care of he if he be hurt in life or limb -- 190 oh god forbid poor susan cry what can i do say betty go what can i do to ease you pain good susan tell I and i 'll stay i fear you be in a dreadful way 195 but i shall soon be back again nay betty -lrb- 17 -rrb- go good betty go there be nothing that can ease my pain then off she hie but with a prayer that god poor susan 's life would spare 200 till she come back again so through the moonlight lane she go and far into the moonlight dale and how she run and how she walk and all that to herself she talk 205 would surely be a tedious tale in high and low above below in great and small in round and square in tree and tower be johnny see in bush and brake in black and green 210 'twa johnny johnny every where and while she cross the bridge there come a think with which she heart be sore -- -lrb- 18 -rrb- johnny perhaps he horse forsake to hunt the moon within the brook -lrb- 19 -rrb- 215 and never will be hear of more now be she high -lrb- 20 -rrb- upon the down alone amid a prospect wide there be neither johnny nor he horse among the fern or in the gorse 220 there be neither doctor nor he guide oh saint what be become of he perhaps he be climb into a oak where he will stay till he be dead or sadly he have be mislead 225 and join the wander gipsy-folk or he that wicked pony 's carry to the dark cave the goblin 's hall or in the castle he be pursue among the ghost he own undoing 230 or play with the waterfall at poor old susan then she rail while to the town she post away if susan have not be so ill alas i should have have he still 235 my johnny till my die day poor betty in this sad distemper the doctor 's self could -lrb- 21 -rrb- hardly spare : unworthy thing she talk and wild even he of cattle the most mild 240 the pony have he share but now she be fairly in the town -lrb- 22 -rrb- and to the doctor 's door she hie ` tis silence all on every side the town so long the town so wide 245 be silent as the sky and now she be at the doctor 's door she lift the knocker rap rap rap the doctor at the casement show he glimmering eye that peep and doze 250 and one hand rub he old night-cap oh doctor doctor where 's my johnny i be here what be ' t you want with I oh sir you know i be betty foy and i have lose my poor dear boy 255 you know he -- he you often see he be not so wise as some folk be : the devil take he wisdom say the doctor look somewhat grim what woman should i know of he 260 and grumble he go back to bed o woe be I o woe be I here will i die here will i die i think to find my lose one here -lrb- 23 -rrb- but he be neither far nor near 265 oh what a wretched mother i she stop she stand she look about which way to turn she can not tell poor betty it would ease she pain if she have heart to knock again 270 -- the clock strike three -- a dismal knell then up along the town she hie no wonder if she sens fail this piteous news so much it shock she she quite forget to send the doctor 275 to comfort poor old susan gale and now she be high upon the down and she can see a mile of road : o cruel i be almost threescore such night as this be ne'er before 280 there be not a single soul abroad she listen but she can not hear the foot of horse the voice of man the stream with softest sound be flow the grass you almost hear it grow 285 you hear it now if e'er you can the owlet through the long blue night be shout to each other still : fond lover yet not quite hob nob they lengthen out the tremulous sob 290 that echo far from hill to hill poor betty now have lose all hope she thought be bent on deadly sin a green-grown pond she just have past and from the brink she hurry fast 295 lest she should drown herself therein and now she sit she down and weep such tear she never shed before oh dear dear pony my sweet joy oh carry back my idiot boy 300 and we will ne'er o'erload thee more a thought be come into she head : the pony he be mild and good and we have always use he well perhaps he be go along the dell 305 and carry johnny to the wood then up she spring as if on wing she think no more of deadly sin if betty fifty pond should see the last of all she thought would be 310 to drown herself therein o reader now that i might tell what johnny and he horse be do what they have be do all this time oh could i put it into rhyme 315 a most delightful tale pursue perhaps and no unlikely thought he with he pony now doth roam the cliff and peak so high that be to lay he hand upon a star 320 and in he pocket bring it home perhaps he be turn himself about he face unto he horse 's tail and still and mute in wonder lose all silent as a horseman-ghost 325 he travel slowly down the vale -lrb- 24 -rrb- and now perhaps be hunting -lrb- 25 -rrb-
