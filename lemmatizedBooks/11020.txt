locality you must be wide in you view else you do somebody a injustice queen yes brown and that be why i like be up in the hill where the view _ be _ wide jb i put it this way ma'am you come to a locality and you find you can not get serve as you be accustom to be serve well you do not go there again and you tell other not to go and so the place get a bad name i have a brother who keep a inn down at aberlochy on the coach route and he tell I that more than half he customer come from outside the locality queen of course naturally jb well now ma'am it 'll be for the bad locality to have half the custom that come to it turn away because of local option and believe I ma'am that be what it will come to people live in it will not see till the shoe pinch they and by that time my brother and other like he will have be ruin in they business queen local option be not go to come yet brown jb -lrb- _ firmly _ -rrb- no ma'am not while i vote conservative it will not but i be look ahead i

favorite minister cross the entrance and he stand hat in hand before she flawlessly array in a gay frock suit suggestive of the period when male attire be still not only a fashion but a art despite however the study correctness of he costume face and deportment give sign of haggard fatigue and when he bow it be the droop of a weary man slow in the recovery just at the fitting moment for full

ah the same thing doctor there be no get away from that in one 's old age when one have live as well as i have doctor that be why i dieted you statesman oh i have nothing on my conscience as to that my housekeeper be a dragon she fidelity be of the kind that will even risk dismissal doctor a invaluable person under the circumstance statesman yes a nuisance but indispensable no doctor this dream do not come from the stomach it seem rather to emanate from that outer darkness which surround man 's destiny so real so horribly real doctor better then not to brood on it statesman ah could i explain it then i might get rid of it in the ancient religion of my race dream find they interpretation but have they any doctor medical science be begin to say yes that in sleep the subconscious mind have its reaction statesman well i wonder how my subconscious mind get hold of primrose doctor primrose do they form a feature in you dream statesman a feature no the whole place be alive with they as the victim of inebriety see snake i see primrose they be everywhere : they fawn on I in wreath and festoon swarm over I like parasite fly at I like fly till it seem that the whole world have conspire to suffocate I under a sulphurous canopy of those detestable little atom can you imagine the horror of it doctor to a sane -- a hitherto sane mind like mine doctor oh in a dream any figment may excite aversion statesman this be not like a dream it be rather the threat of some new disease some brain malady about to descend on I : possibly delirium tremen i have not be of abstemious habit doctor suppose -- doctor impossible dismiss altogether that supposition from you mind statesman well doctor i hope -- i hope you may be right for i assure you that the horror i then conceive for those pale botanical specimen in they pestiferous and increscent abundance exceed what word can describe i have feel spiritually devastate ever since as though some vast calamity be about to fall not only on my own intellect but on that of my country well you shall hear -lrb- _ he draw he tremble band wearily over he face and sit think awhile _ -rrb- with all the harsh abruptness of a soul launch into eternity by the jerk of the hangman 's rope so i find myself precipitate into the midst of this dream i be stand on a pillory set up in parliament square face the abbey i could see the hand of st margaret 's clock point to half-past eleven and away to the leave the roof of westminster hall undergo restoration detail doctor which give a curious reality to a scene otherwise fantastic unbelievable there i stand in a pillory raise up from earth and a great crowd have gather to look at I i can only describe it as a primrose crowd the disease infect all but not so badly as it do I the yellow contagion spread everywhere from all the street around the botanical deluge continue to flow in upon I i feel a pressure at my back a man have place a ladder against it he mount and hang a large wreath of primrose about my neck the snigger crowd applaud the indignity have place a smaller wreath upon my head he descend a mockery of a may queen there i stand doctor -lrb- _ lay a soothing hand on he _ -rrb- a dream my dear lord only a dream statesman doctor imagine my feeling my sense of ridicule be keen but keener my sense of the injustice -- not to be allow to know _ why _ the whole world be thus make mock of I for this be in the nature of a public celebration its malignity be organise and national a new fifth of November have be spring upon the calendar around I i see the emblematic watchword of the great party i have once lead to triumph : imperium et libertas peace with honor england shall reign where'er the sun and other motto of a like kind and on they also the floral disease have spread itself the air grow thick and heavy with its sick-room odour doctor i could have vomit doctor yes yes a touch of biliousness i do not doubt statesman with a sudden flash of insight -- this i say to myself be my day of judgment here i stand judge by my fellow-countryman for the failure and shortcoming of my political career the good intention with which my path be strew be now turn to my reproach but why do they take this particular form why -- why primrose doctor the primrose way possibly statesman ah that occur to I but have it indeed be a primrose way that i have trodden so long and so painfully i think not i can not so accuse myself but suppose the day of judgment which fate reserve for we be fundamentally this : the appraisement of one 's life and character -- not by the all-seeing eye of heaven -lrb- before which i would bow -rrb- but by the vindictively unjust verdict of the people one have try to serve -- the judgment not of god but of public opinion that be a judgment of which all who strive for power must admit the relevancy doctor you distress yourself unnecessarily dear lord you reputation be safe from detraction now statesman with urgency i set my mind to meet the charge if i could understand the meaning of that yellow visitation then i should no longer have to fear that i be go mad -lrb- _ at this point the door be discreetly open and the housekeeper mild benign but inflexible _ enter _ carry a cup and toast-rack upon a tray _ -rrb- housekeeper i beg pardon my lord but i think you lordship ought to have you beef-tea now statesman yes yes mr manson come in doctor you be right mr manson he ought housekeeper -lrb- _ place the tray on a small stand _ -rrb- where will you have it my lord statesman in my inside mr manson -- presently -- he he doctor now let I take you pulseye yes pretty good you know -lrb- _ mr manson stand respectfully at attention with interrogation in she eye _ -rrb- statesman yes you may bring I my cap now -lrb- _ then to the doctor _ -rrb- i generally sleep after this -lrb- _ mr manson bring a large tasselled fez of brilliant color and adjust it to he head while he drink she then go to the door take a hot-water bottle from the band of a unseen servant and effect the necessary change all this be do so unobtrusively that the statesman resume he theme without regard she when she have do she go _ -rrb- ah where be i doctor if you could understand you say statesman ah yes understand again a strange faculty of divination come upon I i stand upon the international plane amid a congress of power and let my eye travel once more over the alliance of europe i look doctor and truly i see then surprising shift and change in the political and diplomatic fabric which i have help to frame time and kingdom have pass i see at home and abroad the rise of new party into power strange coalition defection alliance old balance destroy new balance set up in they place i see frontier annul treaty violate world-problem tumble like clown stand on they head and cry here we be again power -- after all have solve nothing my eye travel over that problem of the near east which for some generation at least we think to have settle to vienna petersburg constantinople -- and away farther east to teheran and -- that other place whose name i have forget and as i look a recording angel come and cry to I in a voice strangely familiar the voice of one of my most detested colleague -- trust i mean -- you have put you money on the wrong horse and i have doctor if what i see then be true -- i have yes if ever man blunder and fool he countryman into a false and fatal position -- i be that man it be not a question of right or wrong in politics that do not really matter you decide on a course and you invent moral reason for it afterwards no what i have do be much worse than any mere wrongdoing all my political foresight and achievement be a gamble that have go wrong and for that my day of judgment have come and i stand in the pillory a peepshow for mockery but why for they instrument of torture do they choose primrose oh i can invent a reason it be mose primrose cheat of he horse with a gross of green spectacles case in shagreen but that be not the reason for then come new insight and a fresh humiliation as i look more intently i see that i be _ not _ be mock i be be worship adulated flattered i have become a god -- for party purpose perhaps -- and this be my day give in my honor for national celebration and i see by the insight give I that they be praise I _ for have put they money on the wrong horse _ year by year the celebration have go on until they have so get into the habit that they could not leave off all my achievement all my policy all my statecraft be in the dust but the worship of I have become a national habit -- so foolish and meaningless that nothing nothing but some vast calamity -- some great social upheaval be ever go to stop it doctor my dear lord it be i who must stop it now you must not go on statesman i have do doctor there i have give you the essential of my dream material depress enough for the mind of a old man enfeebled by indisposition at the end of a long day 's work but i tell you doctor that nothing therein which stand explainable fill I with such repulsion and aversion as that one thing which i can not explain -- why why primrose doctor a remarkable dream my lord render more vivid -- or as you say real -- by you present disturbed state of health as to that part of it which you find so inexplicable i can at least point toward where the explanation lie it reduce itself to this : primrose have become associate for you -- in a way which you have forget -- with something you wish to avoid and so they become the image or symbol of you aversion and as such find a place in you dream -lrb- _ so say the doctor rise and move toward the window where he attention suddenly become rivet _ -rrb- statesman perhaps doctor perhaps as you say there be some such explanation but i do not feel like that doctor why here be primrose this may be the clue where do they come from statesman ah those indeed i have forget they at least no i could not have do that doctor there be a written card with they i see statesman she gracious majesty do I the great honor hearing that i be ill to send and inquire of course since my removal from office the

mr chamberlain morley that be a view which i confess have not occur to I chamberlain mr g no one could have keep mr chamberlain from lead the liberal party except mr gladstone and now he never will morley that certainly be a triumph of a kind you think that influence he chamberlain be a friend of mine once -- be still in a way -lrb- _ he pause then add ruefully _ -rrb- politics be a cruel game -lrb- _ he sigh and sit depressed but mention of she husband 's great antagonist have make the old lady brisk again _ -rrb- mr g do you know mr morley that if mr gladstone have not make I pray for that man every night of my life i should positively have hate he morley -lrb- _ with a touch of mischief _ -rrb- you do that -- still tell I -- -lrb- i be curious -rrb- -- do you pray for he as plain joe chamberlain or do you put in the mister mr g i never mention he name at all i leave that to providence -- to be understand morley well it _ have _ be understand and answer -- abundantly chamberlain 's star be in the ascendant again it be strange he and mr gladstone never really get on together mr g i do not think he ever really try -- much morley do not he oh you do not mean mr gladstone mr g and then you see the queen never like he that have count for a good deal morley it have -- curiously mr g now why should it mr morley she ought not to have such power -- any more than i morley how can it be keep from either of you during the last decade this country have be live on two rival catchword which in the field of politics have mean much -- the widow at windsor and the grand old man and these two maker of history be mentally and temperamentally incompatible that have be the tragedy this be _ she _ day dear lady but it will not always be so mrs g mr morley who be go to be -- who will take mr gladstone 's place morley difficult to say : the queen may make she own choice spencer perhaps though i rather doubt it probably harcourt mr g shall you serve under he morley i have not decide mr g you will not morley possibly not we be at the end of a dispensation whether i belong to the new one i do not yet know mr g the queen will be please at any rate morley delighted mr g will she offer he a peerage do you think morley oh of course mr g yes and she know he will not accept it so that give she the advantage of seem -- magnanimous morley dear lady you say rather terrible thing -- sometimes you pray for the queen too i suppose or do not you mr g oh yes but that be different i do not feel with she that it be personal she be always against he it be she bring up she could not help be morley so be chamberlain so be harcourt so be everybody he be the loneliest man in a great position that i have ever know mr g till he meet you mr morley morley i be only speaking of politics sixty year ago he meet _ you _ mr g nearly sixty-three morley three to the good all the better mr g -lrb- _ have finish off the comforter _ -rrb- there that be finish now morley a

this the end have he -- have he after all be a failure morley my dear lady he have be a epoch mr g be not epoch failure sometimes morley even so they count we have to reckon with they no he be no failure though it may seem like it just now do not pay too much attention to what the papers will say he do not though he read they look at he now -- do that look like failure -lrb- _ he point to the exuberantly energetic figure intensely absorb in its game _ -rrb- mr g he be put it on to-night a little for _ I _ mr morley he know i be watch he tell I how he seem when he first speak to you be he feel it -- much morley oh deeply of course he believe that on a direct appeal we could win the election mr g and you morley i do not but all the same i hold it the right thing to do great cause must face and number they defeat that be how they come to victory mr g and now that will be in other hand not he suppose he should not live to see it oh mr morley mr morley how be i go to bear it morley dear lady i do not usually praise the great altitude may i speak in he praise just for once to-night as a rather faithless man myself -- not believe or expect too much of human nature -- i see he now look back more than anything else as a man of faith mr g ah yes to he religion have always mean everything morley faith in himself i mean mr g of course he have to have that too morley and i believe in he still more now than ever they can remove he they can not remove ireland he may have make mistake and misjudge character he may not have solve the immediate problem either wisely or well but this he have do to we honor and to he own : he have give we the cause of liberty as a sacred trust if we break faith with that we ourselves shall be break -- and we shall deserve it mr g you think that -- possible morley i would rather not think anything just now the game be over i must be go good night dear friend and if you sleep only as well as you deserve i could wish you no better repose good-bye

this country at any rate be its application to live person only consider legitimate when associate with caricature so sponsor in the page of _ punch _ and the composition of mr max beerbohm it have become a accept convention too habitual for remark yet caricature and verbal parody may be as critical both of personality and character as dialogue more seriously design and may have as important a influence not merely upon a public opinion but upon its moral judgment as well the defection of _ punch _ be feel by gladstone to be a serious set-back to the fortune of he home rule policy and tenniel 's cartoon of the grand old janus say quite right to the police who be bludgeon a english mob and quite wrong to the police who be bludgeon a irish one be a personal jibe which hit he hard the customary device where contemporary be concern of disembowel the victim 's name and leave it a skeleton of consonant be a formal concession which in effect concede nothing nor be there any reason why it should for the only valid objection to the medium of dialogue be in case where its form might mislead the reader into mistake fiction for fact and the author 's invention for the _ ipsissima verba _ of the character he portray i hope that this book will attract no reader so unintelligent have choose dialogue for these study of historical event because i find in it a natural and direct means to the interpretation of character my main scruple be satisfy when i have make it plain that they have no more authenticity because they happen to be write in dramatic form than they would have be they write as political essay these be imaginary conversation which never actually take place and though i think they have a nearer relation to the mind of the suppose speaker than have king 's speech to the person who utter they they must merely be take as a personal reading of character and event tribute to man for all of whom i have in one way or another a very great respect and admiration and not least for the one whom with a reticence that be symbolical of the part he play in the downfall of the man of business i have here leave nameless the king-maker note reader of this dialogue may need to

right but when to insist on it look like lose a point in the game -- then they give up the principle to become parasite that be what be happen now it be the slave in the blood come out -- the crisis of the disease that be why i be fight it : and will to the death and when -- when we be dead -- some day : she 'll come to she sens again -- and see then -- this will have help katharine but will it parnell why do not you believe that ireland will be free some day katharine i do when she choose you for she leader parnell -lrb- _ bitterly _ -rrb- a dead leader one whom she can not hurt may do better for she katharine do not say dead parnell i sha not be alive in twenty year my dear and it may take all that katharine without you it will take more parnell it will not be without I that be what i mean they may beat I to-day but i shall still count think of all ireland 's failure grattan 's parliament count ninety-eight count fitzgerald count o'connell count she famine she emigration she rebellion -- all count katharine do butt count parnell he be not a failure : he do not try to do anything if ireland need more failure to make a case for she conviction shall i grudge mine yes all she failure count : they get into the blood why even the silly statue in she street mean more than statue can mean here prosperity forget adversity remember even hatred have its use : it grip and drive man on katharine do you need -- hatred to do that for you parnell yes : till i get love reason conviction be not enough morley say a good thing the other day the english he say mean well by ireland : but they do not mean it much katharine i suppose that be true of some parnell quite true : and what be the most that it amount to compromise morley 's a authority on compromise and yet i like he : i get on with he but he be too thick with gladstone to be honest over this curious _ he _ have to back the convention eh katharine why do he parnell because the political salvation of he party and its leader come before ireland he mean well by she : but he do not mean it so much as all that still he be the only one of they who do not pretend to look on I as a black sheep he too have to work with he material that be politics the nonconformist conscience mean vote -- so it decide he : just as the priest decide I they would decide he in any case i mean and so-so it go on look here upon this picture and on this : ireland try to please england england try now and then to please ireland i do not know which be the more ludicrous but i know that both equally must fail and they have get to see it -- and some day they will it will not be home rule then -lrb- _ so for a while he sit and think he hand in hers then he resume _ -rrb- my ruin what would my ruin matter anyway put it that the make public of we claim -- we right to each other -- be to be allow by any possibility to affect the cause of a nation -- the justice of that cause : do not that fact if true show that the whole basis of the political principle they have so boast and on which we have so blindly rely be utterly and fantastically false and rotten have not we providentially give the world the proof that it need of its own lie katharine we do not give it my dear parnell well they proof have satisfy they anyhow : as they be act on it oh when i see what poor weak thing nation really be -- so inadequately equip for the shaping of they own destiny -- i wonder whether in truth the history we read be not the wrong history -- mere side history to which a false significance have be give because so much blood and treasure have be expend on it which just a little expenditure of common sense might have spare think of all the silly accident and blunder in ireland 's great chapter of accident which have count for so much -- even in these last few year the phoenix park business -- a assassination for which perhaps only a dozen man be responsible -- and at once for that one act more suppression and hatred and coercion be direct against a whole nation : crime act packed jury judge without jury arrest without charge imprisonment without trial so logical be not it what a means for put a foreign government right in the eye of the people who deny its moral authority and then -- pigott that shallow fraud drive to suicide by those who be at first so eager to believe he : and the exposure of he silly forgery turn election make home rule popular come by such means would it be worth it gladstone honourably hoodwink himself all those year accept you as we secret go-between -- and you make no pretence my dear oh i suppose it be the right and gentlemanly thing for he to pretend not to know it be also it seem good politics chamberlain know too -- must have know for chamberlain 's no fool and yet to he friend the deceive husband say nothing it be not politics not then now -- now it be the great stroke and home rule go down under it be that history or be it alice in wonderland if you be my ruin now you be also my ruin then when you be help I to think that i could win justice for a nation from politician like these : win it by any means except by beat they bring they to they knee make they red with the blood of a people always in revolt till they reputation stink to the whole world and when they do at last climb down and accept the inevitable then they main thought will be only how to save they own face -- and make it look a little less like the defeat they know it to be katharine my dear you be so tired do rest parnell i _ be _ rest : for now -- thanks to you -- i have get at the truth political history be a thing make up of accident but not so the fate of man or of nation whose will be set to be free no accident there that you be tie to a man you would not live with who would not live with you -- be a accident but we love be no accident it be wait for we before we know anything you and i have each a star which shine at the other 's birth katharine you star be mine dearest i have not one of my own parnell well if nation wish to be fool let they go to the devil they own way not lay the blame of they own folly on other but have get _ you _ -- would i ever have let you go for any power under heaven why -lrb- as soon as you be free -rrb- do i marry you i know that politically it be a blunder : that over there it would go against we -- prove the case half ireland care nothing for the verdict of a english jury but when we marry they have to believe it then well i want they to believe it i know my love would have wait have i ask she and it be not -- it be not honor my dear it be much more pride : for i be a proud man that i own : and not less since i have win you katharine if you have not be proud dearest you would never have get my love parnell oh yes i should those who love do not love for quality good or bad they love they in the person they love -- that be all you have quality which i do not care about till i find they in you to love be to see life -- new katharine and whole some day -- alone by ourselves -- we will parnell do not we already katharine yes if only -- these other thing do not interfere but i promise so they must parnell my dear when they have quite

but politically it might have make a world of difference katharine yes -- to the world not to we we want to be as we be do not we parnell as we be and as we be -- how long be it -- eleven year ago there be be no change since when i go back to my star i shall have find what i come for that be what matter most soul either find or lose themselves -- live or die i live : i should not have do on this earth but for you -- but for you -lrb- _ there be a pause he sit meditate _ -rrb- katharine and of what -- now parnell the next generation -- possibly the next but one : you and i go and ireland free in this last year we may have do more for that -- than we could ever have plan we have give they a bone to bite on : and there be meat on it -- real meat and because of that they call you my ruin eh i look rather like one i suppose just now but as i come home to-night all my mind be fill with you and i know that to I you be worth far more than all the rest and then suddenly i think -- what be i worth to you katharine this -- that if now you tell I to go -- because it be for you good -- i would go -- glad -- yes glad that you would make I do for you at last something that be hard to do -- for the first time dearest for the first time parnell -lrb- _ deeply move _ -rrb- that so not a accident then eh katharine -lrb- _ embrace he _ -rrb- oh my dear my dear my dear parnell how true to life love make everything -- so clear and straight -- look back now through you i have learn this truth at any rate -- that there be two thing about which a man must never compromise -- first he own soul the right to be himself -- no matter what other may think or do katharine and the other parnell he instinct of trust or distrust in the character of other i have not any real doubt but i compromise with instinct to gain my end : do thing i do not believe be any good -- accept the word of man i do not trust home rule itself be a compromise that i make myself accept but i never really believe in it for you can not limit the liberty of a nation if it be really alive then come the smash -- that wake I and that i be awake at last we love come to be the proofsomethe different have get to be now ireland will have to become more real -- more herself more of a rebel than ever she have be yet if thirty year hence my failure shall have help to bring that about -- a ireland really free -- then i have win -lrb- _ the word come quietly confidently but it be the voice of a exhaust man whose physical resource be nearly at a end for a long time he sit quite still hold he wife 's hand say nothing for he have nothing more to say a high screen behind the couch on which they rest cut off the gaslight only the firelight play fitfully upon the two face suddenly the brightness fall away and over that foreshadowing of death now only three day distant the scene close _ -rrb- the man of business dramati persona joseph chamberlain -lrb- _ ex-minister _ -rrb- jesse colling -lrb- _ he friend _ -rrb- a distinguished visitor a nurse the man of business scene : _ highbury August _ 1913 _ between double-door open from living-room to conservatory sit the shadow of the once great and powerful minister state secretary for the colony to the dark sombre tone of the heavily furnished chamber the gorgeous color of the orchid hang in trail and festoon under they luminous dome of glass offer a vivid contrast yet even greater be that which they present to the draw and haggard feature of the catastrophically aged man whose public career be now over in wheel chair with lower limb wrap in a shawl and support by a foot-rest he sit bent and almost motionless and when he move head or hand it be head or hand only and the motion be slow painful and hesitate as though mind function on body with difficulty uncertain of its ground nevertheless when the door open and the small squat figure of a very old and dear friend advance towards he he face light instantly with tender reverence and affection the newcomer take hold of he hand lift press it lay it back again and when he have seat himself the shadow speak _ chamberlain well colling well jesse colling well my dear chamberlain how be

count be worth trouble about chamberlain do i imagine no i do not i do not imagine anything i be never a man of imagination jesse colling you be when you say that chamberlain no colling when i have do anything it have be because i have have it in my hand to do my hand be empty now some man manage to think with they head only other do it -- with they stomach you might almost say i have never be able to think properly unless i have hold of thing -- have they here in my hand look at they now -lrb- _ with a slow faint gesture he indicate they helplessness then continue : _ -rrb- i be the man of business and now i be out of business so i can not think jesse colling but that business as you call it chamberlain which you make so many of we understand for the first time -- i be a little englander myself once -- that be still go on chamberlain -lrb- _ bitterly _ -rrb- yes it be a fine business jesse colling -lrb- _ startle -rrb- _ do not you still believe in it chamberlain as a business yes but it be go to fail all the same there be nobody to run it now jesse colling we mean to run it chamberlain you 'll see chamberlain i know you do colling you be loyalty itself jesse colling there be other too i be not the only one chamberlain you be the best of they jesse colling no i will not admit that chamberlain name jesse colling the best probably some one we do not yet even know the best be still to come time 's with we chamberlain be it jesse colling do not you think so yourself chamberlain not now i do once jesse colling you always say so chamberlain i say it as long as i believe it : till the star in they course turn against I that break I colling if i could have go on have faith in myself i should not be -- as i be now jesse colling but what -- what make you lose it chamberlain can not you guess -lrb- _ colling shake he head remain valiantly incredulous and there be a pause _ -rrb- i see somebody else -- whose card be not so good -- play with a better hand it be the hand beat I my head 's all right still though it sleep but i have lose my hand look at it -lrb- _ again the gesture illustrative of defeat _ -rrb- throw it away you know who i mean jesse colling -lrb- _ cautiously _ rather reluctantly _ -rrb- i suppose i do chamberlain -lrb- _ watch to see the effect of he news _ -rrb- he be come to-day : to see I colling -lrb- _ surprised _ -rrb- come here chamberlain yes it be all be nicely arrange -- just a call in pass to-morrow 's papers will describe it as a pathetic meeting well when a man have to meet he executioner on friendly term i suppose it be pathetic for one of they -lrb- _ all this be very disconcerting to poor colling he help himself to a half-sentence and stop _ -rrb- jesse colling do he himself -- chamberlain propose it oh yes -- in the most charming way possible be not it amazing how a man with charm can do thing that nobody else dare i never manage to charm anybody jesse colling you make friend -- and keep they chamberlain so do he he have be successful all round : art politics letter society -- he have friend in all i have only be successful in business jesse colling my dear friend be not you forget yourself you come _ out _ of business chamberlain no i only change to business on a larger scale -- carry it on under a bigger name that be how i find myself i have to make thing into a business in order to make a success of they that be my method colling : glorify it as much as you like and up to a point it be good business i do not deny that be how we run local politics invent the caucus : corporation street be the result that be how we manage to run unionism : make a hard and fast contract of it and make they stick to it that be how i run the colony -- and the boer war that be how i be go to run the empire on a preferential tariff that come just too late i would make a mistake jesse colling what mistake chamberlain colling the boer war be not good business it might have be but it last too long any modern war that be not over in six month now be a blunder you 'll find they be able to hold out too long that do for I there have be bee in my bonnet ever since -- all because of it boer first then bannerman then -- balfor just once my business instinct betray I and i be do jesse colling but -- be not the war necessary chamberlain to put the business on a sound footing yes i think so it look like it no it be not but before i quite know there would come a point where we could not go back and so we just have to go on -- and on d'you know what be the cleverest thing say or do during that war you would never guess but it be true campbell-bannerman 's method of barbarism speech we down he for it at the time but it catch on -- it stick and it be on the strength of it -lrb- with c-b as they hope for the future -rrb- that the boer be persuade to make peace : save we face for we they might have go on till we get sick of it and the world too jesse colling i do not -- i can not think you be right chamberlain you be forget thing chamberlain no -- i have have difficulty about think so myself but it have come to I -lrb- _ and so he sit and meditate over the point in he career where as a business man he first jail presently he resume _ : -rrb- when two man whose qualification i use rather to despise beat I at business colling -- it be a facer jesse colling bannerman and -- the other chamberlain come to see I to-day but it will not be a business meeting he 'll not say anything about it -- if he can help jesse colling and you chamberlain perhaps i shall succumb to he charm i have do so before now jesse colling have you and he -- have word ever chamberlain difference of opinion of course word how should we he be always so wonderfully accommodate so polite so apologetic even nobody ever have a finer contempt for he party than he -- not even old dizzy or salisbury or churchill so he could always say the handsome thing to one -- behind its back -- even when he be make burnt-offering to its prejudice jesse colling and when you leave he chamberlain when i leave he he do the thing beautifully so genuinely sorry to lose I so sure of have I with he again before long how could i have go out and work against he after that but it be what -- as a business politician -- i ought to have do jesse colling if you have -- should we have win straight away chamberlain we should have win the party and the party-machine too for the rest it would not have matter wait a year or two yes we should have win but here be this colling : we should have win then we sha not win now time be change : the time for it be over something else be come along -- what i do not know my old fox-scent have go : wind 's against I the colony be grow up too fast they will not separate but they mean to stand on they own foot all the same : in they own way -- not mine we ought to have get they when they be a bit younger : we could have do it then once it flatter they to be call dominion now they be go to be sovereign state and he -- he do not mind he be never for big constructive idea -- only for contrivance : take thing as they come make the best of they -- philosophically -- and get round they and sometimes do it brilliantly jesse colling what will he talk about chamberlain anything that come into he head : the weather the garden the greenhouse the theater he 'll tell I perhaps of a book or two that i ought to read that he have not have time for he 'll say as you say that i be look better than he expect he 'll say something handsome about austen -- quite genuinely mean it then he 'll say he be afraid of tire I then he 'll go have you notice how he shake hand he have not much of a hand -- not a real hand -- but he do it like everything else charmingly jesse colling -lrb- _ a little crestfallen _ -rrb- i think you really like he chamberlain so i do because he have beat I be that any reason for hate he if it be -- after a lifetime of poll and politics one would have to be at hate with half the world no from he point of view he have to beat I and he have do it what i stick at be that he have prove the better business man as i use head and hand -- and heart -lrb- _ and _ heart colling -rrb- -- jesse colling yes yes i know you do chamberlain some people think i have not a heart : hard as nail they call I well as i use those so he use he defeat he doubt he indecision he charm -- and leave he heart out that be the real business-stroke that do for I i like he : he know it whether he ever like I to this day i do not know -- for certain if he do it make no difference that be what i call business jesse colling -lrb- _ warmly _ -rrb- but you have always be honorable chamberlain so have he do not be sentimental colling but some man manage in public life to give you a certain view of they character : so that you count on it and then on occasion they play another -- and get wonderful result if i would have that gift i should have use it and do better he have use it and he have do better i do not whine about it but i would rather colling -lrb- i suppose i be prejudiced -rrb- i would rather he have not ask himself here -- just now : not just now -lrb- _ there be a pause and colling feel that he must say something but find nothing of any value to say he merely commentate with a query _ -rrb- jesse colling what have just now to do with it chamberlain just now dear colling only mean the next few month or so -- possibly a year that be all i have rather he would wait and then just send a wreath with the right sort of inscription on it he could have do that charmingly too and i have not get wreath here for _ he _ for i do not think that even a posy of these would really interest he -lrb- _ and with a weary gesture he point to the orchid as though they be thing of which not impossibly posy might be make _ -rrb- jesse colling -lrb- _ a little perplexed by this introduction of wreath and flower into political affair _ -rrb- what do really interest he he be so interesting himself chamberlain you have hit it colling it be himself not selfishly he stand for so many thing that he value -- that he think good for the world -- necessary for the stability of the social order he be they embodiment : he be the most emblematic figure in the modern world that i know -- in this country at any rate -- represent so much that be good in the great tradition which have get to go and to stave off that day he will do almost anything he would even -- if he think it would enable he the better to prick some of he bubble -- he would even take office under lloyd george -lrb- _ at this point unobtrusively a nurse enter and stand wait _ -rrb- jesse colling i do not think we shall live to see that chamberlain i shall not you may jesse colling -lrb- _ impulsively _ -rrb- chamberlain i do not want to live after you chamberlain -lrb- _ cajolingly _ -rrb- oh yes you do anyway -- i want you to you will send I a wreath that will be worth have -lrb- _ whereat he quaint little companion lean forward and put he two hand pleadingly on the swathe knee want to speak but can not slowly the sick man let down he own and cover they and so hand rest on hand he continue speaking : _ -rrb- say what you like about the business man -- the man who fail : he have know how to make friend -- good one and you jesse colling have be one of the best : i could not have have a better there be someone be wait behind you to give you a hint that you be tire I -- stay too long but you have not : you never have perhaps in the future i sha not see enough of you perhaps from now on my doctor will have to measure even my friend for I : three a day before meal but i shall get life in bit still -- as long as you be allow to come yes nurse you make take he away now -lrb- _ jesse colling rise and stand by he friend with moist eye _ -rrb- jesse colling good-bye my dear joe and -- god bless you chamberlain yes good-bye -lrb- _ hand press and part and jesse calling tip-toe meekly out apologise for the length of he stay by the softness of he go chamberlain 's head drop he face become more draw he hand more rigid and helpless without a word he nurse arrange he pillow prepare he for the sleep to which he unresisting body gradually succumb _ -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- _ two hour later he be awake again and the nurse be remove a tray from which he have just take some nourishment he lift he head and look at she at this sign that he be about to speak she pause presently the word come _ -rrb- chamberlain be he in there wait to see I nurse yes sir chamberlain ask he to come in nurse you want to see he alone sir -lrb- _ there be a pause _ -rrb- chamberlain i think only one at a time be enough -- better for I : do not you nurse it would be less tire for you sir chamberlain yes ask he to come in -lrb- _ so that be settle she go and he sit wait the afternoon sunlight be make the orchid look more resplendently themselves than ever so still so vivid so alive they hang they snake-like head in long pendulous cluster and among they all there be not a single one which show the slightest sign of falling-off or decay presently the door be softly open and the nurse enter only to retire again usher in the distinguished visitor whose brow venerable with intellect and gray with the approach of age crown a figure still almost youthful in its elasticity and grace and perfect in the deliberate ease and deportment of its entry into a situation which many would find difficult as he approach the wheel chair the kindness modesty and distinction of he bearing prepare the way before he and he silence have already say the nicest of nice thing in the nicest possible way before he actually speak this he do not do till he have already take and hold the hand which the other have try to offer _ -rrb- distinguished visitor my dear chamberlain how very good of you to let I come chamberlain not too much out of you way i hope dist v on the contrary i could wish it be more if that might help to express my pleasure in see you again chamberlain well what there be of I you see you be look well dist v and you -- much better than i expect chamberlain do you expect anything dist v i be tell that you have bad day occasionally and be unable to see anybody i hope i be fortunate and that this be one of you good one chamberlain well as they have let you see I i suppose so i do not find much difference between my good and bad day -lrb- will not you sit down -rrb- i be still in the possession of my faculty i sleep well and i do not have pain dist v -lrb- _ seat himself _ -rrb- and my stay with you for a little be not go to tire you chamberlain it be far more likely to tire you i be afraid dist v no indeed not apart from anything else it be a welcome respite on the journey motoring bore I terribly chamberlain then you have really mean come this way in any case dist v i have be long intend to and when last week hewell propose itself all fit together perfectly chamberlain be they have a house-party dist v i think not : i trust not no i believe a hint be drop to they that it be not to be -- that i be feel far too stale for any such mental relaxation chamberlain be you you do not look like it dist v in politics one try not to look like anything but how at the end of the session can one be otherwise chamberlain be all go on there -- as usual dist v yesye i do not find be in opposition make as much difference as i expect as regard work one miss the permanent official who always do it for one wonderful creature -- who first invent they pitt or be it pepy oh no he be one of they a product perhaps of the seventeenth century chamberlain in tudor time prime minister be permanent be not they dist v they head be not execution take the place of election in those day and there be something to be say for it chamberlain yes there be more dignity about it it give a testimonial of character the other do not dist v still electoral defeat be very refreshing rejection by one 's own constituent be sometimes a blessing in disguise : it save one from undue familiarity that have never happen to you have it chamberlain it depend what one mean by -- constituent in the strict sense -- no -lrb- _ and now there be a pause for something have be say that be not merely conversation very charmingly and with a wonderful niceness of tone the distinguished visitor accept the opening that have be give he -rrb- _ dist v chamberlain i have be want to come and see you for a long time chamberlain thank you so i -- guess dist v i write to you -- a letter which you do not answer perhaps it do not seem to require a answer but i hope for one so after not hear i make up my mind to come and see you chamberlain that be very kind of you dist v no it be not it be natural we have work together -- so long and i want to assure myself that there be personally -- that there be now -- no cloud between we no ill-feeling about anything if i think that remotely possible i should regret it more than i can say speak for myself -- chamberlain if you have not think it possible -- should you have come dist v i can not conceive how that would have make any difference chamberlain still if you have not think it possible you would hardly have ask the question dist v well now i have ask it speech be a overrated means of communication -- especially between friend but it have to serve sometimes and you at least chamberlain have never use it as -- talleyrand be it not -- recommend that it should be use -- for concealment chamberlain so you think that -- in word at any rate -- i have be honest dist v i should say pre-eminently chamberlain and -- loyal dist v i have never have difference -- political divergence -- with any man more loyal than you chamberlain chamberlain thank you i value that -- from you so the question 's answer on my side there be no cloud as you tell I i have nothing with which to reproach myself dist v thank you for the reassurance in that case the heaven be clear chamberlain i hope they be properly grateful such a testimonial -- from two man look in opposite direction -- be a embrace one dist v opposite oh i have hope -- though we may not see eye to eye in everything -- that still in the main we be in general agreement chamberlain possibly i daresay a half-sheet of note-paper might still cover we general agreement so long as we only talk about it that serve we for -- two year do it not but i be not meaning -- as to we political opinion i mean that you be still look to the future i can only look back dist v that for you must be a retrospect of deep satisfaction it have make much history chamberlain catastrophe make history -- sometimes dist v you help to avert they chamberlain yes for a time but another may be come and i sha not be here then and if i be i should be no use dist v oh do not say that nor can i agree either no use you good word be a power we still depend on no chamberlain we can not do without you chamberlain you do -- when you accept my resignation dist v for a fix and a agree purpose in a way that only bind we more closely chamberlain i think so then but it have turn out differently dist v have it i should not have say so be i not to count on you still chamberlain as a diminish force yes i sha not disappoint you dist v oh -lrb- _ deprecatingly as of something that need not have be say _ -rrb- but not that at all chamberlain -lrb- _ rub it in _ -rrb- necessarily : one who as i say can only look backward forward i be nothing believe I i have measure myself at last this be no miscalculation -- like the other dist v the other chamberlain my resignation dist v be that one chamberlain it certainly have not the effect i intend dist v surely you be not then intend to force I against my own judgment chamberlain no but i think you and the rest would follow dist v i think we do : i think we still do but sometimes with follower follow take time chamberlain it will take more than my time that be where i miscalculate dist v but my dear chamberlain -- if one may be personal -- you be maintain you strength be you not the doctor -- be hopeful chamberlain the regulation paragraph be supply to the papers if that be what you mean dist v but i have this from member of you own family chamberlain quite so it be they who supply they dist v then if the source be so authoritative surely it must be true chamberlain be newspaper paragraph in such case -- ever true dist v perhaps i be no judge as you know i seldom read they chamberlain be not the probability that they will always overstate the case -- as far as possible dist v that be a course which as a old politician -- speak generally -- i must own have its advantage so often when thing be uncertain one have to act as if one be sure chamberlain yes you have do that -- sometimes sometimes you have not i should not call you a old politician though be old be the thing you have always manage to avoid and yet you have be in at a good many political death first and last dist v that in itself be a ageing experience chamberlain yes i wonder dist v oh but surely chamberlain _ i _ be not sure but i take you word for it dist v in politics somehow the death seem always to exceed the birth : those who go have become more intimate : one have get to know they yes the departure do certainly overshadow the arrival chamberlain yet sometimes they must have come to you as a relief dist v my dear chamberlain do not say that it be not true chamberlain oh i be not thinking of myself just then dist v you be think then of somebody chamberlain yes i be i be think of george wyndham what a beautiful fellow he be so clever so handsome so charming : a man cut out for success by the very look of he and then all at once down and out : the old pack have get he how they hunt he devolution would not they be glad to get that now dist v at the time it be impossible chamberlain yes you accept that i know it break he heart do you go and see he -- when he be die dist v i use to go and see he when i could -- yes frequently we have be great friend not immediately -- a month or two before be the last time i think chamberlain and so with he too you could say that you remain friend to the last you have have a wonderful career : friend enemy they all love you gladstone -lrb- who have not as a rule much love for he political opponent -rrb- make a exception in you case dist v yes i owe a great deal to he generous friendship it give I confidence chamberlain harcourt too always speak of you with affection dist v oh yes we have a brotherly feeling about rosebery you know chamberlain -lrb- _ ignore he diversion _ -rrb- randolph have not though he be bitter dist v randolph be a performer who just once exceed he promise and then could never get back to it that be he tragedy strange how when he lose he follow he brilliancy all go with it chamberlain yes it be strange in one so independent of other he have a great faculty at one time for not care for be -lrb- or seeming -rrb- ruthless it be a gift that a politician must envy it have not be my way to lose my heart in politics : it be not safe but -- you charm I -lrb- _ there be a implication here that the quiet tone have not obscure and so the direct question come _ : -rrb- dist v chamberlain i must ask what be there between we chamberlain nothing -- nothing now at all -- or very little dist v no no you be too sincere to pretend to misunderstand I like that chamberlain in politics can one afford to be quite -- sincere openly i mean dist v you have be -- far more than other i could name chamberlain that be a friendly judgment other would not say so if a man stay in politics till he cease to be important while other remain important there be bind to be a change of relation dist v in we case i do not admit that it have happen chamberlain do not you you be we partyleader i break away so you have to break I from you point of view you be right i think i know the game better than you i make a mistake dist v do you mean then that you intend to break _ I _ chamberlain oh no but i mean to -- persuade you dist v my view be that you do -- very thoroughly surely i go a long way -- concede a great deal chamberlain half a sheet of note-paper be the measure of it yes that speech be a great success and you remain we leader but you halving of that sheet be the beginning of -- my defeat you victory dist v i do not recognize either at this moment we be both defeat in a sense : out of office that be to say chamberlain yes but you will come back i sha not dist v but -- in all its essential -- what you stand for will chamberlain as a hang-fire perhaps while party temporise and readjust themselves to a new balance but never the same thing again the time for it have go i miss it dist v you must not be depress chamberlain great policy new orientation need careful nursing -- testing too condition be change very rapidly chamberlain mine be get worse i have two nurse now -- night and day : and i obey order dist v you do well to remind I you should not have let I tire you -lrb- _ and so say he rise _ -rrb- chamberlain you do not you use to now and then when we do not agree you have the deliberate mind you own fixed rate of progression : one could not hurry you and you semitone and semicircle and semi-quaver use sometimes to worry I i own they do not now : have become a monotone myself i acquiesce _ i be _ the slow one now : you have set I my pace here i sit stock still dist v -lrb- _ lightly divert the conversation from its impending embarrassment _ -rrb- with you old associate still round you i see -lrb- _ and he touch a trail of blossom admiringly as he continue _ : -rrb- they at least in they reflect glory look flourish for they too have have a share in you career have they not chamberlain yes they help I to get into _ punch _ i suppose if not into parliament yet i never think of it till it happen -- 'twa a mere accident would you like to take one with you dist v i do not usually so efface myself but i will with pleasure this one be quite exquisite may i thanks -lrb- _ and the glory of it go to he buttonhole _ -rrb- i notice too that it have a scent chamberlain yes that be a new kind hard to rear there be very few of it in england yet and nowhere grow so well as they do here dist v that be so like you chamberlain -- you be the bear expert everything you touch -- it be in you blood whatever you have do you have do successfully chamberlain so i have you word for it i be say to collin this morning that as a type of the really successful man you have beat I dist v i -- a type of success my dear chamberlain in my wildest dream i aim only at safety and if my hesitation have sometimes distressed you they have be far more distressing to myself you yourself in a moment of friendly candor once describe I -lrb- so i be tell -rrb- as the champion stick-in-the-mud chamberlain so i do and it be true but i say champion if you have not be such a champion at it the mud would have swallow you up alive instead of that you have make it a tower of defense against you enemy that be why i regard you not only as so successful but so british dist v may i at least claim that even for self-defence i have not sling it at my opponent chamberlain no why waste it it be you use not you misuse of it that i so admire if you have not be such a wonderful politician you might have be a great statesman dist v do not that rather indicate failure chamberlain no sometimes the political world have no use for statesman -- except to down they sometimes it prefer politician and perhaps rightly every age make its own peculiar requirement and those who find out when the political line be the better one to follow be the successful one you and i have be -- politician let 's be honest and own it and now my particular politics be over circumstance have empty I out that be different from mere failure great statesman have be failure we have see they go down you and i -- too big too far-seeing for they day but they go down _ full _ with all the weight of they great conviction and principle still to they credit i be empty time have play I out that be the difference dist v i be confident that history will give a different verdict chamberlain will it when exactly do history begin to get write be a man 's reputation for statesmanship safe even after a hundred year what about pitt can one be so sure of he now he european policy may have be a blunder he great work in ireland may yet have to be reverse dist v in reversed circumstance that may become logical but what have hold good for a hundred year i should incline to regard as statesmanship chamberlain hold good fetter a man can not break hold good but they make a prisoner of he all the same policy have do that to nation before now but would you on that score say of they that they have hold good dist v but let I understand my dear chamberlain what exactly in pitt 's policy you now question chamberlain nothing : i can not see far enough ahead to question anything i only say when do history begin to get write we do not know dist v what more can one do than direct it for the generation in which one live that it seem to I be we main responsibility chamberlain well that be what you and i have do how mainly by pull down bigger man than ourselves randolph parnell gladstone -- we get the better of they do not we have you never wonder why man of genius get send into the world -- only to be defeat gladstone be a bigger man than the whole lot of we but we pull he down -- and i enjoy do it parnell for all he limitation be a great man well we get he down too and i confess that give I satisfaction you help to pull randolph down but you do not enjoy do it that be where you and i be different dist v i help chamberlain yes it have to be do and you be sorry for he while you do it -- just as you be sorry for wyndham dist v but i do nothing chamberlain quite so he come down here to fight we in the central division and the conservative be keen for it it be touch and go : unionist be not in such close alliance then he might have succeed you do nothing would not back he -lrb- quite right from my point of view -rrb- randolph go down : never the same man again dist v but my dear chamberlain we have we agreed compact chamberlain a official understanding certainly but that do not prevent I from go to the round-table conference that also be touch and go it might have succeed where would we compact have be then dist v the round-table be merely a interrogation cover a forlorn hope it fail because you remain loyal to you conviction chamberlain it fail because one day two of we lose we temper -- one brag the other bully that be the real reason if gladstone have give I a large enough hand over he first bill d'you suppose i should not have be a home ruler i be to begin with remember dist v stand for a very different bill i imagine chamberlain which you would still have oppose but i should have win dist v certainly if we have lose you it would have make a difference chamberlain i be younger then : i would more push in I but you would have let I go all the same yes i have always admire you courage when the odds be against youso when the time for it come you pull I down too it have to be do and here i be dist v my dear chamberlain you distress I deeply chamberlain of course i do d'you think i have not distressed myself too do i look like a man who have not be through anything dist v then -- there be a cloud between we after all chamberlain no i see you clearly i see myself clearly there be no cloud about it it be all sharp and clear and hard -- hard as nail and i have be able to put it into word -- that now you understand poor randolph do you remember how he tongue stumble and trip he the last time he speak in the house and i see you look on pity he you would get a kind side to you for all you efficiency man like you for that -- that charmit 's be a great asset to you parnell how he try all he life to make a speech and could not but what he say do not matter -- there be the man what a force he might have be -- be what a samson when he pull the whole irish party down -- get they all on top of he to pull with he what d'you think he be do then try to give he irish nation a soul it look like pride pique mere wanton destruction but it be a great idea and if ever they rise to it -- if ever the whole irish nation put its back to the wall as parnell want it to do then -- shake off dependence alliance conciliation compromise it may beat we yet they be afraid of defeat that be why we win a cause or a nation that fear no defeat -- nor any number of they -- that be what win in the long run but do any such nation -- any such cause exist i be not surei be not really sure of anything now only this : that it be better not to live too long after one have fail to go on live then -- be the worst failure of all -lrb- _ as be thus talk himself out he auditor 's solicitous concern have continually increase and now when for the first time the voice break with exhaustion and emotion the other half-rising from he seat interpose with gentle but insistent urgency -rrb- _ dist v my dear chamberlain you be overtax you strength you be do yourself harm you ought not to go on stop i do beg of you chamberlain stop why stop what do it matter now -lrb- _ but even as he speak mind and will cease to contest the point where physical energy fail he manner change he voice become dull and listless of tone _ -rrb- oh yesye you be quite right it be time i be under order now would you mind -- the bell -lrb- _ then as the other be about to rise he perceive that the nurse have already enter and now stand unobtrusive but firm await the moment to reassert she sway _ -rrb- oh it be not necessary there be the nurse come again to remind I that i must not tire myself in tire you -lrb- _ and so under the preside eye of professional attendance the visitor rise and advance to take he leave _ -rrb- thank you -- for come thank you -- for hear I so patientlyyou always do that even though it make no differenceus wonder -- shall i ever see you again dist v you shall i promise chamberlain i wonder dist v i assure you i shall make a point of it believe I i be very grateful for this opportunity you have give I and even more be i grateful for all you long loyalty in the past through all difference through all difficulty i have feel that you be indeed a friend so till we meet again my dear chamberlain good-bye -lrb- _ the two hand meet and part while the nurse move forward to resume she professional duty the distinguished visitor begin to retire _ -rrb- chamberlain good-byeyou can find you way dist v -lrb- _ turn gracefully as be go _ -rrb- perfectly -lrb- _ and treat the door with the same perfection of courtesy as be treat all with whom he come in contact be go to take he leave of other member of the family the door close the nurse be punch the pillow chamberlain speak _ : -rrb- chamberlain so that be the end eh charming fellow -lrb- _ and so say be settle back to the inattention of life to which he have become accustomed _ -rrb- the instrument dramati persona woodrow wilson -lrb- _ ex-president of the united state of america _ -rrb- mr tumulty -lrb- _ he secretary _ -rrb- a gracious presence a attendant the instrument scene _ washington march 4th _ 1921 _ through the large window of this rather stiffly compose sitting-room washington convey a ample and not unimpressive view of its official character the distant architecture rise out of tree be almost beautiful and would be quite if only it could manage to look a little less self-satisfied and prosperous outside be a jubilant spring day inside something which much more resemble the wintering of autumn for though this be a entry over which the door have just open and close it be in fact a exit final and complete from the stage of world-politics make by one who in he day occupy a commanding position of authority and power that day be now over in the distance a occasional blare of brass and the beat of drum tell that procession be still move through the street of the capital celebrate the inauguration of the new president it be the kind of noise which america know how to make a sound of triumph insistent and strained have in it no beauty and no joy the ex-president move slowly across the room bear heavily to one side upon he stick to the other upon the proudly protect arm of he friend mr secretary tumulty into the first comfortable chair that offer he let himself down by slow and painful degree lay 's he stick carefully aside then begin very deliberately to pull off he glove when that be do only then allow himself complete relaxation he sink back in he chair and in a voice of resigned weariness speak _ ex-pre so that be over tumulty it have not tire you too much i hope ex-pre too much for what my dear tumulty i have time to be tire now what else except to be tire be there leave for I to do tumulty obey doctor 's order ex-pre he let I go tumulty -lrb- _ shrewdly _ -rrb- you would have go in any case ex-pre yes -lrb- _ tumulty adjust the cushion at he back _ -rrb- thank you tumulty -lrb- _ seat himself _ -rrb- well governor now you have see he in place what do you think of he ex-pre oh i find he -- quite -- what i expect he to be i think he mean well tumulty a new president always do ex-pre -lrb- _ slowly ponder he word _ -rrb- yes that be true means well tumulty -lrb- _ tactfully provide diversion _ -rrb- the big crowd outside be very friendly i think ex-pre yes could not have be friendlierit let I alone tumulty well of course they would come mainly to see the new president ex-pre of course so have i yes i believe harding 's a good man he be very kind very considerate i feel grateful tumulty -lrb- _ with rich emotion _ -rrb- that be how a good many of we be feel to you governor : to-day very specially it be what i have come back to say ex-pre that be very good of you we have have -- difference of opinion but you have always be loyal tumulty i think president -- forgive I the word slip out ex-pre no matter tumulty i think there be be more loyalty -- at heart -- than you know behind all we difference in the party -lrb- as with such big issue could not be avoid -rrb- -- well they do not cut so deep as they seem to they be all proud of you even though we could not always agree of course there have be exception ex-pre i do not want to judge the exception now -lrb- as perhaps i have do in the past -rrb- more hardly than i judge myself tumulty i have fail tumulty -lrb- _ extenuatingly _ -rrb- in a way -- yes : for a time no doubt ex-pre absolutely tumulty i do not agree ex-pre because you do not know tumulty governor i know a good deal ex-pre oh yes you have be a right hand to I -- all through other be not so i have to leave they alone and -- be alone when i make that choice it seem not to matter : my case be so strong -- and i have such faith in it it be that do for I tumulty chief i be not out to argue with you -- to make you more tired than you be already but if i do not say anything please do not think i be agree with you ex-pre i be accustomed to people not agree with I tumulty yes : too much faith -- not in what i stand for but in myself : perhaps -- though there i be not so sure -- perhaps too little in other to some i give too much : and the mischief be do before i know tumulty you do not need to name he president ex-pre i do not need to name anyone now sometimes a man may know he own point of weakness too well -- guard against they to excess be overcautious because of they and then try to correct himself just for once he be not cautious enough but where i fail be in get the loyalty and cooperation of those who do not agree with I so thoroughly as you do and i ought to have do it for that be a part of government you good executive be the man who get all fish into he net i fail : i catch some good man but i let other go there be fine material to my hand which i do not recognize or do not use so well as i should have do i have not the faculty of let other think for I : when i try it go badly they do not respond so -- i do all myself tumulty -lrb- _ airing himself a little _ -rrb- you always listen to _ I _ governor ex-pre yes tumulty yes and you be not offend when i -- do not pay any attention tumulty when you _ have _ pay attention you mean ex-pres perhaps i do my way of pay attention have strike other differently they think i be one who do not listen -- who do not want to listen it be a terrible thing tumulty when one see and know the truth so absolutely but can not convince other that be be my fate : to be so sure that i be right -lrb- i be as sure of that now as ever -rrb- and yet to fail here -- there -- it have be always the same i go over to pari think to save the peace : there come a point when i think it be save it would have be have the senate back I -- it could have be do then but when i put the case to which already we stand pledge i convinced nobody they do not want justice to be do tumulty but you have a great following governor you have a wonderful reception when you get to pari ex-pre yes : in london too it seem then as if people be only wait to be lead but i be talk of the politician now there be no room for conviction there each must stick to he brief that be what wreck we not one -- not one could i get to own that the right thing be the wise thing to do : that to be just and fear not be the real policy which would have save europe -- and the world look at it now step by step they failure be come home to they but still it be only as failure that they see it -- mere human inability to surmount insuperable difficulty : the greed the folly the injustice the blindness the cruelty of it they do not see and the people do not teach it they they can not no nation -- no victorious nation -- have get it at heart to say we too have sin lest such a thing should ever be say or think one of the term of peace be to hand over all the blame so when the enemy sign the receipt of it the rest be acquit and in that solemn farce the ally find satisfaction what a picture for posterity and when they point and laugh i shall be there with the rest it be we self-righteousness have undo we tumulty it be that which have make we blind and hard -- and dishonest : for there have be dishonesty too because we be exact reparation for a great wrong we do not mind be unjust to the wrongdoer and so in pari we spend month argue prevaricate manoeuvring so as to pretend that none have have any share in bring the evil about when i speak for considerate justice there be no living force behind I in that council of the nation they want they revenge and now they have get it : and look what it be cost they -lrb- _ and then the door open and a attendant enter carry a covered cup upon a tray upon this intrusion the ex-president turn a little grimly but before he can speak tumulty interpose _ -rrb- tumulty you 'll forgive this little interruption governor : i get domestic order to see that you take it you will -lrb- _ the dictatorial expression soften : with a look of mild resignation the ex-president touch the table for the tray to be set down and when the attendant have go he continue _ : -rrb- ex-pre no they would not believe I when i say that to be revengeful would cost more than to be forgiving and still they will not believe that the trouble they be now in come -- not from the destructiveness of the war but from they own destruction of the peace i have the truth in I but i fail i be a voice cry into the void -- a president without a people to back I : a dictator -- of word and they know that my time be short and that i have no power of appeal -- because the heart of my people be not with I if they have any doubt before the vote of the senate tell they tumulty you say the people governor ex-pre the people 's choice tumulty the vote _ for _ the senate and the vote _ of _ the senate : where 's the difference tumulty still i do not think you know how many be with you right through : and i be not speak only of we own people over there it be you stand give hope to the best of they so long as hope be possible but they be all so busy hold they breath maybe they do not make noise enough anyway -- seem you do not hear 'em ex-pre you can not reproach I with it tumulty -- tumulty -lrb- _ expostulant _ -rrb- i be not do that governor ex-pre -- more than i reproach myself if that be true then it be my business to know it but what i ought to have know i realize too late when i hear those shout crowd -- yes then for a while i think it do mean -- victory but in the conference at versaille -- pari -- i be in another world : the shout die out and i be alone i have not expect to be alone -- in there i mean i have reckon -- be it wrong -- on honor counting among those in high place of authority for more than it do we go in pledge up to the hilt : not in detail not in legal term not as politician perhaps but as man of honor -- speak each for the honor of we own nation and that be not enough for whom people stand pledge twice over -- first in secret then publicly -- it be difficult to make they face where honor lie tumulty you mean the secret treaty governor that be be a puzzle to many of we : what you know about they i mean ex-pres tumulty i will not to know they rumor of they reach I of course have i then give they a hearing i might have be charge with complicity the silence which give consent many be anxious that i should know of they -- at a time when opposition would have be very difficult -- premature outside my province and so -- by not know -- i be free : and when i state the basis of the peace term i state they -lrb- and i be secure then in my power to do so -rrb- in term which should in honor have make those secret treaty no longer tenable there be my first great error -- i acknowledge it tumulty : that i believe in honor tumulty -lrb- _ reluctantly -rrb- _ yes i see that but it be the sort of thing one can only see after it have happen you must have get a pretty deep-down insight into character governor when you come to the top of thing over there to the top people i mean ex pres -lrb- _ after a pause reflectively _ -rrb- yes it be very interesting when one get accustom to it : highly select humanity representative of thing -- it be afraid of there daily sit four of we -- if one count head only but we be in fact six or seven or eight character and the character spring up and choke we patriot statesman oh yes but also careerist man whose future depend on the popular vote can not always be themselves -- at least it seem not for we should then have cease to be representative and it be as representative that we have come and so one would sit and listen and watch -- one person and two character lloyd george when he imagination be not swamp in self-satisfaction be quite evangelical to listen to -- sometimes but there he be representative -- not of principle nor of those visionary spark which he strike so easily and throw off like match but of a successful election cry for hang the kaiser and make germany pay and have get he majority he and he majority have become one but for that he might -- he just might yet who can tell that tie he i be alone tumulty -lrb- _ come nobly to the rescue _ -rrb- then take this from I governor : for a man all alone you do wonder ex-pre i do my best but i fail my first mistake be when i believe in honor my second when i let they shut the door yes to that he get I to agree clever clever that be he first win tumulty who governor ex-pre -lrb- _ with a dry laugh _ -rrb- the man who tell I he be on my side the reason -- a kindly mean of save face for those whom he and i be go to persuade -- of make the climb-down easier for they that seem a helpful charitable sort of reason do not it one it would have be hard to refuse i do not so the door be shut to cover defeat and disappointment over the secret treaty then they have I : three against one and they weight tell -- quite apart from mere argument for each have behind he the popular voice -lrb- and when one lose it -- you may remember -- another come and take he place -rrb- but against I the popular voice have shut its mouth : i too be a electioneer -- a defeat one of my lease of power then less than a year remain after the senate election i be nothing in pari they know it : and i could see in they eye that they be glad yes _ he _ be glad too -lrb- _ as he speak he head sink in depression there be a pause _ -rrb- tumulty -lrb- _ in he best sick-bed manner _ -rrb- governor do not you think that you would better rest now ex-pre -lrb- _ ignore the remark _ -rrb- and so the old secret diplomacy balance for power with war as the only sure end of it come back to life and i -- pledge to its secrecy with the rest -- i have to stay dumb i be a drown man then tumulty -- clutch at straw till i become a adept at it there perhaps as you say i do do wonder -- of a kind : all i could anyway that be my plight while there in pari we hold high court and banquet and drink health from dead man 's skull do nobody guess -- outside -- what be go on i give one signal that i thought be plain enough when i send for the _ george washington _ to bring I home again but though i listen for it then there seem no response people be so busy you say hold they breath and _ that _ i could not hear tumulty -lrb- _ zealous in a pause to show he interest _ -rrb- well governor well ex-pre and then rather than let I so go and spoil the general effect -lrb- the one power still leave to I -rrb- they begin to make concession -- concession which i see now do not amount to much and so they persuade I and i stay on and sign my failure with the rest tumulty -lrb- _ for a diversion point to the covered cup _ -rrb- pardon I governor you must obey order you know they be not mine ex-pre -lrb- _ take up the cup with a dry smile _ -rrb- executive authority have teach I that obey order be much simpler than give they : you know when you have get they do -lrb- _ remove the cover he drain the cup and set it down again _ -rrb- there now let you conscience be at rest -lrb- _ after a pause he resume _ : -rrb- tumulty when i face failure when i know that i have fail -- yes do not trouble to contradict I i know dear friend i know that you do not agree and god bless you i also know why -- when i know _ that _ after the whole thing be over and i be out again and free do you suppose i be not tempt to go out and cry the truth -lrb- as some be expect and wish for it to be cry -rrb- in the ear of the whole world -- let all know that i _ have _ fail and so -- that way at least -- separate myself from the evil thing which there sit smile at itself in its hall of mirror -- see no frustrate ghost no death 's head at that feast as i see they i come out a haunt man -- all the more because those i be amongst do not believe in ghost -- not then people who have be overwhelmingly victorious in a great war find that difficult but they will -- some day tumulty well governor and suppose you have yield to this temptation as you call it what be the proposition ex-pre this i have one power -- one weapon still leave to I unimpaired : to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help I god and the proposition be just this : whether to be stark honest even against the apparent interest of the very cause you be out to plead be not in the long run the surest way -- if it be of god -- to help it make good : whether defeat with the whole truth tell be not better than defeat hide away and disown in the hope that something may yet come of it you may get a truer judgment that way in the end though at the time it may seem otherwise yes i _ be _ tempt to cry it aloud -- to make a clean breast of it -- to say we the government of the people the democracy the free nation of the world have fail -- have lose the peace which we could have win because we would not give up the thing which we love so much better -- profit revenge we own too good opinion of ourselves we own self-righteous judgment of other i be tempt to it and yet it have be charge against I that i would not admit failure because i want to save my face tumulty you have never be much scare by what people _ say _ governor that do not count i reckon ex-pre no tumulty but this do -- that where all seem dark i still see light down there among the wreckage something be leave -- a instrument of which i think i see the full future possibility more clearly than other i believe i do still and my main thought then be -- how best to secure that one thing to which half blindly they have agree to win that i be willing to give up my soul tumulty it be the covenant you mean governor ex-pre yes the covenant that at least be win -- seem win -- whatever else be lose some of they be willing to let I have it only because they themselves believe it would prove useless -- just to save my face for all i have to give up in exchange and so i -- let they save my face for I let they think that it be so -- just to give this one thing its chance and so for that and for that alone i bind myself to the treaty -- stand pledge to do my utmost to see it through : a different thing that from tell the truth be i wrong tumulty -- be i wrong tumulty no no governor you do everything a man could -- under the circumstance ex-pre i have say that often to myself : and i hope sometimes that it may be true but a man who give up anything of the truth as he see it for reason however good -- can he ever be sure of himself again it be a new thing for I to ask another man if i have do wrong but that be the way i feel : i do not myself know and once once i be so sure -- that i be right and that i should win -lrb- _ the situation have now become one which the friendly tumulty would like to control but can not as a soul-stirring revelation of character he find it no doubt immensely interesting but to be thus make father confessor of the man whom he have follow with humble and dog-like devotion knock the bottom out of he world altogether moreover he have receive domestic order and be not properly obey they and so dominate by the stronger will he glance apprehensively now and again toward the door hope that it may open and bring relief but himself sit and do nothing meanwhile insistent and remorseless at self-examination the ex-president continue to wear himself out _ -rrb- when a man come really to himself tumulty -- see clearly within -- do it help he toward see also what lie outside beyond and ahead -- make he more sure that as regard other he have do right i do not know -- i would give my life to know -- if what i do when all else have fail be best the political force prejudice antagonism the power of evil around I have be so dubiously deceive and dark that i do not know now whether to have be uncompromisingly true to principle would have do any good perhaps after to-day i shall know better perhaps only now have i become qualify to judge -- a free man at last only in the secrecy of my own heart -- now finally remove from all the interest ambition fear which gather about a man 's public career -- i do most earnestly and humbly pray that in this one thing i do right -- not to discredit myself too utterly in the world 's eye so that _ that _ at least might live tumulty -lrb- _ do he best _ -rrb- it _ will _ live governor ex-pre it _ may _ but in what hand have i have to leave it to man who have no faith in it to man who dislike it to man who will try persistently sedulously day in day out to turn it back to they own selfish end there in those hand its fate will lie -- perhaps for a generation to come and it be only by faith in the common people not in they politician that i dare look forward and hope that the instrument -- blunt and one-sided though it be now -- may yet become mighty and two-edged and sharp a sword in the hand of a giant -- of one whose balance be those of justice not of power but _ i _ sha not see it tumulty it will not be in my day if america have come in i should that be the keystone of my policy : that go my policy have fail that be my faith -- be still for faith can live on when policy lie dead think what it might have be america with that weapon to she hand could have shape the world 's future make it a democracy of free nation -- image and superscription no longer caesar 's -- but man 's that -- that be what i see tumulty perhaps they see it too governor if they do it might help to explain matter ex-pre the covenant be the instrument -- and would have suffice so organised america 's voice in all future contention would have be too strong and just and decisive to be gainsay then life would have be in it then it would have prosper and become mighty it would have mean -- within a generation from now -- world-peace of that i have a sure sense : it would have come to make that possible what i have to yield to present jealousy discord blindness be of no account -- only look far enough for there in the future be the instrument for correct they -- the people 's vote for the first time internationally apply and i have in I such faith that america secure of she place in the world 's council would have work to make justice international and peace no longer a dream be i wrong tumulty be i wrong tumulty -lrb- _ expand himself _ -rrb- no man who believe in america as much as i do will ever say you be wrong governor ex-pre but when america stand out -- when the senate refuse to ratify -- then i _ be _ wrong for then what i have back -- all that remain then -- be a thing of shred and patch nobody can think worse of the treaty than i do with america out of it with the covenant leave the one-sided and precarious thing it now be have we only be in it -- the rest would not have matter call it a dung-heap if you like yet out of it would have spring life it may still but _ i _ sha not see it tumulty and that vision which be then so clear have become a doubt be i wrong -- be i wrong to pretend that i have win anything worth win would it not have be better to say i have fail tumulty forgive I governor : you be look at thing from a tired-out mind that be not fair you know ex-pre but if you know oh if you know against what odds i fight even to get that they know that they have get I down and the only card leave I at last be they own reluctance to let a discredited president go back to he own people and show they he empty hand and tell they that he have fail so a bargain be strike and this one thing be give I that peradventure it might have life -- if i for my part would come back here and plead the ratification of the treaty which they -- and i -- have make could i have do that with any effect have i say that in almost everything i have fail tumulty chief i think you do right but i still feel i be up a back street how could thing have come to fail as much as they do after all it be a just war ex-pre tumulty i have be ask myself whether there can be such a thing as a just war there can be -- please god -- there must be sometimes a just _ cause _ for war when one see great injustice do see it back by the power of a blindly militarise nation march confidently to victory then if justice have any place in the affair of man there be sometimes just cause for war but can there be -- a just war i mean -- when the will to war take hold of a people -- do it remain the same people do war in its hand remain a instrument that can be justly use can it be wage justly can it be win justly can it have be win make to a just peace no something happen : there come a change war in a people 's mind drive justice out can soldier fight without see red -- can a nation not when nation have to fight on the tremendous scale of modern war then they be like those monstrous mechanism of long-range destructiveness which we so falsely call weapon of precision but which be in fact so horribly unprecise that once let loose we can not know what life of harmlessness of innocence of virtue they be go to destroy you find you range you fix you elevation you touch a button : you hear you gun go off and over there among the unarmed -- the weak the defenceless the infirm -- it have do -- what single out for destruction what life or live ten twenty a hundred -- you do not know so with nation when once they have go to war they imprecision become -- horrible though the cause of you war may be just -lrb- _ tumulty give a profound nod pay he chief the compliment of let it be see that he be cause he to think deeply _ -rrb- that be what happen here do you remember do you realize tumulty what a power my voice be in the world -- till we go in -- that because i have the power to keep they back from war -lrb- for there my constitutional prerogative be absolute -rrb- even my opponent have to give weight to my word they be angry impatient but they have to obey and because they could not help themselves they accept point by point my building up of the justice of we cause they do not care for justice but i speak for the nation then and with justice as my one end i drive home my point and then -- we go in after that justice become vengeance when we man go over the trench fight with short arm _ lusitania _ be they cry : and they take few prisoner -- you know that tumulty -lrb- _ over that point the ex-president pause though tumulty see no special reason why he should pause _ -rrb- the _ lusitanium _ have be sink and still we have not go to war and no crowd come to cry it madly outside the white house as they might have do -- if that be how they feel then the _ lusitanium _ lie at the bottom of the sea there be proposal for salve she but i think that there she will remain the salve might tell too much tumulty you mean that talk about fuse cap be on board might have be true would it matter now ex-pre yes it be a horrible thing in any case -- disproportionate like most other act of war -- and it do immeasurable harm to those who think to benefit but this -- i still only guess -- might do too much good -- bring thing a little nearer to proportion again which the treaty do not try to do what i have be realize these last two year be a terrible thing you go to war you get up to it from you knee -- god drive you to it -- unable yes unable to do else you will be to do right you cause be just you be a united nation a people convinced glad selfless with heart heroic and clean and then war take hold of it and it all change under you eye you see the heart of you people become foul get hard self-righteous revengeful you cause remain in theory what it be at the beginning but it all go to the devil and the devil make on it a pile that he can make no otherwise -- because of the virtue that be in it the love the beauty the heroism the giving-up of so much that man 's heart desire that be where he score look at all that valiance that beauty of life go out to perish for a cause it know to be right think of the generosity of that give by the young man think of the faithful courage of the woman who steel themselves to let they go think of the increase of spirit and selflessness which everywhere rise to meet the claim all over the land which go to war that be happen -lrb- and in the enemy 's land it be the same -rrb- make war a sacred and a holy thing and have get it so sanctified then the devil can do with it almost what he like that be what he have do tumulty if angel lead horse by the bridle at the marne -lrb- as a pious legend tell -rrb- at versaille the devil have he muzzled ox tread out the corn and of those -- i be one yes war muzzle you you can not tell the truth if you do it would not be believe and so finally come peace and over that too the devil run up he flag -- cross-bone and a skull tumulty -lrb- _ struggle in the narrow path between wrong and right _ -rrb- but what else governor be you remedy we have to go to war we be leave with no choice in the matter ex-pre no we _ have _ no choice and what other have any choice -- what people i mean but that be what everyone -- once we be at war -- refuse to remember and so we cry _ lusitania _ against thousand of man who have no choice in the matter at all remedy there be only one somehow we must get man to believe that christ be not a mad idealist when he preach he sermon on the mount that what he show for the world 's salvation then be not a sign only but the very instrument itself we have get to make man see that there be something in human nature wait to respond to a new law there be two thing breed in the world -- love and hatred breed the one against the other and there be fear make hatred breed fast and there be fear make love breed slow even as thing now be it have manage -- it have just manage to keep pace but only just if man be not afraid -- love would win that i have come to see be the simple remedy but it be go to be the hardest thing to teach -- because all the world be so much afraid -lrb- _ and then the worn haggard man have thus talk himself out there enter by the benign intervention of providence a gracious presence more confident than he in she own ruling power she move quietly toward they and she voice when she speak be corrective of a situation she do not approve _ -rrb- the presence mr tumulty my dear -lrb- _ rest she hand on the back of the ex-president 's chair she survey they benevolently but critically then she attention be direct to the covered cup standing on its tray _ -rrb- have you take you -- ex-pre my medicine yes you order come through and have be obey the presence it be not medicine i make it myself ex-pre then i beg its pardon -- and yours the presence will you please to remember that you holiday begin at twelve o'clock to-day i be not go to allow any overtime now ex-pre that settle it then tumulty and that mean you be to go i have just be say my dear how much simpler it be to obey order than to give and to get they obey the presence get they obey be quite simple it be merely a matter of how you give they ex-pre you see tumulty -- it be all a matter of how the presence there be someone wait to speak to you on the ` phone : want to know how you be i think i would come and see first ex-pre who be it the presence -lrb- _ indicate the receiver _ -rrb- he be there -lrb- _ the ex-president reach out he hand and tumulty from a adjoining table give he the instrument as he listen they stand watch he _ -rrb- ex-pre oh yes that be very kind of he please will you tell the president with my best thanks that i be greatly enjoy my holiday thank you good-bye -lrb- _ he give the instrument back to the wait tumulty _ -rrb- tumulty -lrb- _ with swelling-bosom _ -rrb- governor that be a great answer ex-pre easily say tumulty but be it true -lrb- _ but tumulty 's breast be such a platform for the generous emotion that he do not really care whether it be true or not and therein between himself and he hero lie the difference grasp he fall leader forcefully by the hand and murmur he adieu in a voice of nobly control emotion he obey the wait eye of the gracious presence and go and as she see he serenely to the door the ex-president look ruefully at he painfully oversqueezed hand and begin rub it softly even the touch of a friend sometimes hurt _ -rrb- -lrb- _ the door close : the two be alone she
