produce by keren vergon rich magahiz and pg distribute proofreader select speech of kossuth condensed and abridged _ with kossuth 's express sanction _ by franci w newman preface to kossuth 's speech nothing appear in history similar to the enthusiasm rouse by kossuth in nation foreign to he except perhaps the kindling for the first crusade by the voice of peter the hermit then bishop prince and people alike understand the danger which overshadow europe from the mohammedan power and by soundly direct though fanatical instinct all christendom rush eastward till the chivalry of the seljuk turk be cripple on the field of palestine now also the multitude of europe uncorrupted by ambition envy or filthy lucre forebode the deadly struggle impend over we all from the conspiracy of crown head see the apathy of they own ruler and know perhaps by dim report the deed of kossuth they look to he as the great prophet and leader by whom policy be at length to be mould into justice and be ready to catch he inspiration before he have utter a word kossuth undoubtedly be a mighty orator but no one be better aware than he that the cogency of he argument be due to the atrocity of we common enemy and the enthusiasm which he kindle to the preparation of the people 's heart he oration be a tropical forest full of strength and majesty tangled in luxuriance a wilderness of self-repetition utterly unsuited to form a book without immense abridgment they contain material adapt equally for immediate political service and for permanence as a work of wisdom and of genius to prepare they for the press be a arduous and responsible duty : the best excuse which i can give for have assume it be that it have be to I a labor of love my task i have feel to be that of a judicious reporter who cut short what be of temporary interest condense what be too amplify for he limit and for written style severely prune down the repetition which be inevitable where numerous -lrb- \* -rrb- audience be address by the same man on the same subject yet amid all these necessary liberty retain not only the true sentiment and argument of the speaker but he form of thought and all that be characteristic of he genius such a operation rightly perform may like a diminish mirror concentrate the brilliancy of diffuse oration and assist they efficacy on mind which would faint under the effort of grasp the original -lrb- footnote \* : the number of speech great and small speak in he american half-year be reckon to be above 500 -rrb- it be true the exuberance of kossuth be often too asiatic for english taste and that excision of word which needful abridgment suggest will often seem to we a gain moreover remember that he be a foreigner and though marvellous in he mastery of we language still naturally often unable to seize the word or select the construction which he desire i have not think i should show honor to he by retain anything verbally unskilful to a certain cautious extent i account myself to be a _ translator _ as well as a _ reporter _ and in undertake so delicate a duty i be happy to announce that i have receive kossuth 's write approval and thanks mere quaintness of expression i have by no means desire entirely to remove where it involve nothing grotesque obscure or monotonous in several passage where i imperfectly understand the thought i have have the advantage of kossuth 's personal explanation which have enable I to clear up the defective report or real obscurity of he word nevertheless i have to confess my conviction that nothing can wholly compensate for the want of systematic revision by the author himself which he great occupation have make impossible the mistake in the report of the speech be sometimes rather subtle and have not rouse my suspicion of this i have be make disagreeably sensible by several erratum communicate to I by kossuth in the first great speech at new york here mark as no vii -lrb- which have be correct in this edition -rrb- nearly all the point on which attempt have be make to misrepresent in england the cause of hungary be clear up in these speech on two subject only do it seem needful here to make any remark : _ first _ on the republicanism of kossuth _ secondly _ on the hungarian levy against italy in the year 1848 1 kossuth be attack by he countryman on opposite grounds : szemerè despise he for not become a republican early enough count casimir bathyanyus reprove he for become a republican at all the fact be these kossuth like all english statesman be a historical royalist not a doctrinaire when the exist reign have become treacherous and lawless he be willing to change the line of succession and make the archduke stephen king when the dynasty have become universally detest and actually expel he approve most heartily -lrb- \* -rrb- the deposition of the hapsburg but still hold himself in suspense as to the future of the constitution by he influence instruction be send to he representative in england which be equivalent to solicit a dynasty from the british government meanwhile szemerè he home secretary take on himself to avow in the diet that the government be republican and no voice of protest be raise in either house indeed mr vucovic who be minister of justice under kossuth state -lrb- see appendix i -rrb- that the government and both house respond unanimously to the republican avowal and that the government remove the symbol of the crown from the public arm and seal the press of all shades assent after this it be clear -lrb- i presume -rrb- to kossuth or at least it soon become so that all sympathy with royal power be go out of the nation 's heart hungarian may settle that amongst themselves : but as for englishman -- when for seven or eight month together the english ministry and english peerage would not stir or speak or whisper to save constitutional royalty and ancient peerage for hungary and for europe while it be yet possible with what face with what decency can englishmen censure kossuth for despair of a cause which be abandon to ruin by ourselves the greatest power interested to maintain it -- which the monarch have wade through blood and perjury to destroy-and which the million of hungary will not -lrb- in he belief -rrb- peril life and fortune to restore -lrb- footnote \* : how unanimous be the whole country be clear by the fact state how spontaneous be the movement and free from all government intrigue see in appendix i this be entirely confirm by we envoy mr blackwell : blue book march -- ap 1848 -rrb- 2 the ministry of loui bathyanyus and kossuth have be attack on opposite grounds -- because they _ do _ and because they do _ not _ attempt to subdue the italian by force of arm the fact be rather complicate but deserve here to be state concisely when the ministry be appoint there be _ already _ hungarian in italy with radetzkus and austrian soldier in hungary the viennese ministry promise to exchange they as fast as could be do without encounter great expense or dislocate the regiment and make they inefficient with this promise the hungarian ministry be force to content itself at the time at a later period when it discover that the austrian commander in hungary have secret order not to fight against the serbian marauder and that the austrian troops could not be trust the hungarian ministry _ desire _ to get back they man from italy for they own defense which desire prove ineffectual yet have be severely blame by some of we monarchist but meanwhile the viennese ministry as early as June 1848 endeavor to buy of the hungarian ministry a increase grant of troops against italy by concede a most energetic king 's speech against the serb with which the archduke palatine be to open and do open the diet on July 2d a part of this speech be quote in appendix ii and indeed it be a loathsome exhibition of austrian treachery the hungarian ministry be press by the argument that since austrium be attack in italy by the king of sardinium the war be not merely against the lombard and that the pragmatic sanction bind hungary to defend the empire if assail from without this lead they to acknowledge the _ principle _ that they be bind to assist if able but they reply that hungary itself must first be secure against marauder and no troops could be spare until the serb be subdue at the same time order be send to radetzki from vienna to offer independence to the lombard and constitutional nationality under the austrian crown to the venetian : hence the hungarian ministry for a time fancy that they would not be fight against the italian as they expect the term to be accept by they when it be farther represent that the italian have reject they -- -lrb- for radetzkus act probably by secret order suppress the despatch and never offer independence to lombardy though the austrian minister make diplomatic capital of they liberality -rrb- -- then the hungarian ministry begin to think the italian unreasonable yet they do not go beyond they abstract principle that hungary ought to grant troops for austrian defense in italy provide 1st that rebellion in hungary itself be repress 2d that the troops should not act against the italian unless the italian have reject the offer of national liberty and a constitution coordinate to those of hungary under the austrian crown the protocol on this subject be draw on July 5th the public speech of kossuth concern it be not until July 22d and in this short interval the treachery of the dynasty have be so display that kossuth could no longer speak in the same tone as a few week earlier for a fuller development of this i refer the reader to appendix iii the real object of the austrian ministry be to ruin the popularity of bathyanyus and kossuth if they could induce they to sacrifice italian freedom or else to accuse they to all the european diplomatist as conspirator against the integrity of the austrian empire if they refuse to oppress the liberty of italy finally the reader have even here proof enough how false be the statement which have be current in english newspaper that kossuth 's visit to america be a failure this be a attempt to practice on we prevalent disgraceful tendency to judge of a cause by its success however the end be not yet see : america have still to act decisively if she would win the lasting glory which we have

future of nation new york appendix kossuth 's speech -lrb- the speech of kossuth in england though masterly in themselves be in great measure supersede by those which he deliver in america where the same subject be treat at far greater length and view from many different aspect from the speech in england i here present only three topic in a rather fragmentary form -rrb- i -- secrecy of diplomacy -lrb- _ first extract : from kossuth 's speech at the guildhall london oct 30th _ 1851 -rrb- the time draw near when a radical change must take place for the whole world in the management of diplomacy its basis have be secrecy : therein be the triumph of absolutism and the misfortune of a free people this have win its way not in england only but throughout the whole world even where not a penny of the national property can be dispose of without public consent it surely be dangerous to the interest of the country and to constitutional liberty to allow such a secrecy that the people not only should not know how its interest be be deal with but that after the crisis be pass the minister should inform they : the dinner have be prepare -- and eat and the people have nothing to do but digest the consequence what be the principle of all evil in europe the encroach spirit of russium -- and by what power have russia become so mighty by its arm -- no : the arm of russium be below those of many power it have become almost omnipotent -- at least very dangerous to liberty -- by diplomatic intrigue now against the secret intrigue of diplomacy there be no surer safeguard or more powerful counteraction than public discussion this must be oppose to intrigue and intrigue be then of no weight in the destiny of humanity \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- _ second extract from a short speech in london may 25th 1858 _ -rrb- i must ask leave to make a remark on the system pursue by you government in they foreign relation you consider yourselve a constitutional nation : i fear that in some respects you be not so there be a latin proverb -lrb- current in hungary -rrb- _ nil de nobis sine nobis _ -- nothing that concern we without we this in many thing you make you maxim you say that none of you money shall be spend without you knowledge and approval and in you internal affair you carry this out but i think that the secrecy in which the transaction of you diplomacy be involve be hardly constitutional of that most important portion of you affair which concern you country in its relation with the rest of europe what knowledge have you if any interpellation be make about any affair not yet conclude my lord the secretary of the foreign office will reply that _ he can not give any answer for the negotiation be still pend _ a little later he will be able to answer that _ as all be now conclude all comment will be superfluous _ one little fact i will just mention by the last treaty with denmark to which you become a party the crown of that kingdom be so settle that only three life stand between it and the czar of russium three life but a fragile barrier when high political aim be concern it be therefore a allow fact that the country which command entrance to the baltic and which in the hand of a unfriendly power would effectually exclude you commerce from that sea may pass into the hand of russium whose pretension in the south of europe you take so much pain to check this you government have do quietly how many be there of you people that know and approve it i hope you will not be offend if i say that i can not understand how yours can be call in this respect a constitutional country \* \* \* \* \* ii -- monarchy and republicanism -lrb- _ from kossuth 's speech at copenhagen house nov 3d 1851 _ -rrb- in my opinion the form of government may be different in different country accord to they circumstance they wish they want england love she queen and have full motive to do so england feel great glorious and free and have full reason to feel so but the fact of england be a monarchy can not be sufficient reason for she to hate and discredit republican form of government in other country differ in circumstance in wish and in want on the other side to the united state of america which under republican government be likewise great glorious and free they republicanism give no sufficient reason to hate and discredit monarchical government in england it entirely belong to the right of every nation to dispose of its domestic concern therefore i claim for my own country also that england see from we past that we cause be just should profess the sovereign right of every nation to dispose of itself and should allow no power whatever to interfere with we domestic matter since i thus regard the internal affair of every nation to be its own separate concern i do not think it become I here in england to speak about the future organization of we country but my behavior have not be everywhere appreciate as i hope i have meet in certain quarter the remark that i be slippery and evade the question now on the point of sincerity i be particularly susceptible i have the sentiment of be a straightforward man and i would not be charge with have steal into the sympathy of england without display my true color therefore i must clearly state that in we past struggle it be not _ we _ who make a revolution we begin peacefully and legislatively to transform the monarchico-aristocratical constitution of hungary into a monarchico-democratical constitution we preserve we municipal institution as we most valuable treasure but to they as well as to the legislative power we give as basis the common liberty of the people instead of the class-privilege of old moreover in place of the old board of council -- which be a corporate body be of course a mockery in regard to that responsibility of the executive which be we chartered right on paper -- we establish the real and personal responsibility of minister in this we merely -lrb- \* -rrb- uphold what be due to we by constitution by treaty by the coronation-oath of every king -- the right to be govern as a self-consistent independent country by we native institution accord to we own law this and all we other reform we effect peacefully by careful legislation which the king sanction and swear to maintain -lrb- footnote \* : many englishman have unjustly accuse the hungarian as have by the law of march 1848 effect a separation of hungary from austria _ even if this be true _ it could not justify the cause of the hapsburg the dynasty yield under the pressure of circumstance -lrb- as alone will dynasty ever yield -rrb- while hungary do but petition legally and be in fact unarm the dynasty swear to the new law and then conspire with croatian serbian and russian to overthrow the law by maraud and force of arm in fact if in January 1849 austrium would have negotiate instead of arrest all hungarian ambassador hungary would have consent to modify the law of march : but the austrian have already in October order the overthrow of the whole hungarian constitution and have no wish to do anything by legal method at the same time the original objection be fundamentally _ false _ no separation of the two country be effect by the law of march 1848 for no legal union ever exist only the crown be unite not the country kossuth rightly compare the union to that which be between england and hanover at any time in the past hungary might have make _ peace _ with a power with which austrium be at _ war _ if the king have not falsify they oath by not assemble the diet : for the diet always have the lawful right of war and peace any mode whatsoever of enforce the coronation oath might accord to this logic be condemn as a separate of austrium and hungary -rrb- nevertheless this very dynasty in the most perjurious manner attack these law this freedom this constitution by arm we defend ourselves by arm victoriously when upon this the perjurious dynasty call in the russian army to beat we down we of course declare the hapsburg to be no longer we sovereign we avow ourselves to be a free and independent nation but fix as yet no definite form of government -- neither monarchical nor republican these be plain fact hungary be not now under lawful government but be be trample down by a foreign intruder who be _ not _ king of hungary be _ neither acknowledge by the nation nor sanction by law _ hungary be in a word in a state of war against the hapsburg dynasty a war of legitimate defense by which alone it can ever regain independence and freedom by such war alone have any nation ever win its freedom from oppressor as you see in switzerland belgium spain portugal france sweden norway greece the united state and england itself i can state it as know to I with the certainty of matter of fact that hungary will never accept the hapsburg as legitimate sovereign in the future nor ever enter into any new moral relation with that perjurious family nor only so but they perjury have so entirely pluck out of my nation 's heart all faith in monarchy and all attachment to it that there be no power on earth to knit the broken tie again : and therefore hungary wish and will to be a free and independent republic -- a republic found on the rule of law secure social order guarantee person property the moral development as well as material welfare of the people -- in a word a republic like that of the united state found on institution inherit from england itself this be the conviction of my people which i share in the very heart of my heart \* \* \* \* \* iii -- communism and the sibylline book -lrb- _ from kossuth 's second speech at manchester nov 12th _ 1851 -rrb- i can understand communism but not socialism i have read many book on the subject i have consult many doctor but they differ so much that i never could understand what they really mean however the only sense which i can see in socialism be inconsistent with social order and the security of property now since france have three time in sixty year fail to obtain practical result from political revolution all europe be apt to press forward into new social doctrine to regulate the future believe then that -- not from my merit but from the state of my country -- i may be able somewhat to influence the course of the next european revolution i think it right plainly to declare beforehand my allegiance to the great principle of security for personal property nevertheless to give success to my endeavor in this direction the rational expectation of the nation of europe must speedily be fulfil else neither i nor more important man can avail to stay revolutionary movement the danger of the case may be illustrate by the ancient story of the sibylline book take hungary as a instance three year ago we should have be extremely well contented with the law as make by we parliament in 1848 _ which law do not break the tie between we and the house of hapsburg _ but then austrium assail we with arm and it become impossible for we to go on with that constitution indeed she herself proclaim it to be dissolve we defeat she and next she call in the russian army hungary be then under the necessity of _ casting off the hapsburg monarchy _ and only the third sibylline book remain yet hungary do not even then renounce monarchy but give instruction to she representative in england to say to the government of this country that _ if they wish to see monarchy establish in hungary we would accept any dynasty they propose _ : but it be not-listened to then come the horror of arad -lrb- \* -rrb- and destroy all we faith in monarchy so the last of the three book be burn -lrb- footnote \* : in arad the hungarian general who surrender by görgy 's persuasion be hang or shoot and simultaneously bathyanyus who have be arrest when he come as a ambassador of peace be judge anew and murder by a second court-martial -rrb- and so wherever man 's reasonable expectation be not fulfil it can not be know where they fluctuation will end every man who be anxious for the preservation of person and property should help the world in obtain rational freedom : if it be not obtain mankind will search after other form of action totally subversive of all exist social order and where the excitement will subside i do not know man like I who merely wish to establish political freedom will in such circumstance lose all they influence and other will get influence who may become dangerous to all establish interest whatsoever \* \* \* \* \* iv -- legitimacy of hungarian independence -lrb- when kossuth have land at staten island thus for the first time set he foot on american soil he be meet by a deputation which make a address to he he reply as follow -lrb- dec 5th 1851 -rrb- -rrb- : -- lady and gentleman : the twelve hour that i have have the happiness to stand on you shore give I augury that during my stay in the united state i shall have a pleasant duty to perform in answer the generous spirit of you people i hope however that you will consider that i be in the first moment of a hard task -- to address you intelligent people in a tongue foreign to I you will not expect from I a elaborate speech but will be contented with a few warmly-felt word citizen accept my fervent thanks for you generous welcome and my blessing upon you sanction of my hope you have most truly state what they be when you announce the destiny of you glorious country and tell I that from it the spirit of liberty will go forth and achieve the freedom of the world yes citizen these be the hope which have induce I in a most eventful period to cross the atlantic i confidently hope that as you have anticipate my wish by the expression of you generous sentiment so you will agree with I that the spirit of liberty have to go forth not only spiritually but materially from you glorious country that spirit be a power for deed but be yet no _ deed _ in itself despotism and oppression never yet be beat except by heroic resistance that be a sad necessity -- but it be a necessity nevertheless i have so learn it out of the great book of history i hope the people of the united state will remember that in the hour of _ they _ nation 's struggle it receive from europe _ more _ than kind wish it receive material aid from other in time past and it will doubtless now impart its mighty agency to achieve the liberty of other land citizen i thank you for have address I not in the language of party but in the language of liberty which be that of the united state i come hither in the name of hungary to entreat not from any _ party _ among you but from you _ whole nation _ a generous protection for my country and for that very reason neither will i intermeddle with any of you party question in england i often avowed this principle inasmuch as the very mission on which i come be to ask that the right of every nation to arrange its domestic concern may be respect notwithstanding this i be sorry to see that before my arrival i have be charge with intermeddle with you presidential election because in one of my address in england i mention the name of you fellow-citizen mr walker as one of the candidate for the presidency i confess with warm gratitude that mr walker utter such sentiment in england as if happily they be also those of the united state will enable I to declare that hungary and europe be free therefore i feel deeply indebted to he but in no respect do i mix myself up with you election i consider no man honest who do not observe towards other nation the principle which he desire to be observe towards he own : and therefore i will not interfere in you domestic question allow I citizen to advert to one expression of you kind address personal to myself you name I kossuth governor of hungary my nomination to be governor be not to gratify ambition never perhaps do i feel sadder than at the moment when that title be confer upon I for i compare my feeble faculty and its high responsibility it be therefore not from ambition that i thank you for the title but because the title rest upon we declaration of independence and by acknowledge it as mine you recognize the rightfulness and validity of that declaration and gentleman i frankly declare that you whole people be bind in honor and duty to recognize it at this moment there be no other legitimate exist law in hungary it be not the proclamation of a man or of a party it be the solemn declaration of the whole nation in _ congress _ assemble it be sanction by _ every village _ and by _ every municipality _ no counter-proclamation have go forth from hungary it have be overturn solely by the invasion of a ambitious _ foreign _ power the czar of russium who can no more legitimately make or unmake a governor of hungary than general santa anna if in you late war he have force he way to washington could have unmade president taylor none of you will admit that violence can destroy righteousness : it can but establish unlawful unrightful _ fact _ if so -- if you own people and not foreign invader be the source of rightful law to _ you _ -- you must in consistency recognize _ we _ independence as legitimate and its declaration as we still rightful law as to the praise which you be so kind as to bestow upon I it be no affectation in I when i declare that i be not conscious of have any other merit than that of be a plain straightforward man a faithful friend of freedom a good patriot and these quality gentleman be so natural to _ every _ honest man that it be scarcely worth while to speak of they for i can not conceive how a man with understanding and with a sound heart can be anything else than a good patriot and a lover of freedom yet my humble capacity have not preserve I from calumny scarcely have i arrive here when i learn that i have be charge in the united state with be a _ irreligious man _ so long as despot exist and have the means to pay they will find man to calumniate those who be oppose to tyranny but suppose i be the most dishonest creature in the world in the name of all that be sacred _ what would that matter in respect to the cause of hungary _ would that cause become less just less righteous less worthy of you sympathy because i for instance be a bad man no i believe you it be not a question in regard to any individual here it be a question with regard to a just cause the cause of a country worthy to take its place in the great family of the free nation of the world until i learn that you refuse to recognize nation whenever they governor fall short of religious perfection i need not care much about attack on my mere personality but one thing i can scarcely comprehend -- that the press -- that mighty vehicle of justice and champion of human rights -- could have find a organ and that in the united state which -lrb- to say nothing of personal calumny -rrb- should degrade itself to assert that it be not the people of hungary it be not myself and my coadjutor that contend for liberty but it be the emperor of austrium who be the champion of liberty do not give it groan gentleman but rather thank it for there can be no better service to any cause than for its opponent to manifest that they have nothing to say but what be ridiculous that _ must _ have be a sacred and just cause whose detractor need to assert that the emperor of austrium be the champion of freedom throughout he own dominion and throughout the european continent i thank you that you have give I full proof that all these calumny have affect neither you judgment nor you heart as this will be the place whence i shall start back for europe i shall once more have the happiness of address you publicly and bidding you a affectionate adieu : -- hope then to be able to thank you for _ act _ as i now thank you for _ sentiment _ \* \* \* \* \* declaration of independence by the hungarian nation -lrb- the reader may be glad to possess the most important portion of this celebrated document the opponent of kossuth have of late pretend that the deposition of the hapsburg _ cause _ the overthrow of hungary but the deposition be not carry until austrium be thoroughly beat and russium _ have engage _ to give she utmost aid this finally unite all hungary at no earlier period would hungary have act with full unanimity in so decisive a step to have delay it longer would not have avert russian invasion and would have cause deep discontent in hungary nothing but the wilful disobedience of görgey who waste a month at buda at this very crisis save the hapsburg from be conquer in vienna before the russian army could possibly come up -rrb- we the legally-constituted representative of the hungarian nation assemble in diet do by these present solemnly proclaim in maintenance of the inalienable natural rights of hungary with all its appurtenance and dependency to occupy the position of a independent european state that the house of lorraine-hapsburg as perjure in the sight of god and man have forfeit its right to the hungarian throne at the same time we feel ourselves bind in duty to make know the motive and reason which have impel we to this decision that the civilized world may learn we have not take this step out of overweening confidence in we own wisdom or out of revolutionary excitement but that it be a act of the last necessity adopt to preserve from utter destruction a nation persecute to the limit of the most enduring patience three hundred year have pass since the hungarian nation by free election place the house of austrium upon its throne in accordance with stipulation make on both side and ratify by treaty these three hundred year have be for the country a period of uninterrupted suffer the creator have bless this country with all the element of wealth and happiness its area of one hundred and ten thousand square mile present in varied profusion innumerable source of prosperity its population numbering nearly fifteen million feel the glow of youthful strength within its vein and have show temper and docility which warrant its proving at once the main organ of civilization in eastern europe and the guardian of that civilization when attack never be a more grateful task appoint to a reign dynasty by the dispensation of providence than that which devolve upon the house of lorraine-hapsburg it would have suffice to do nothing to impede the development of the country have this be the rule observe hungary would now rank among the most prosperous nation it be only necessary that it should not envy the hungarian the moderate share of constitutional liberty which they timidly maintain during the difficulty of a thousand year with rare fidelity to they sovereign and the house of hapsburg might long have count this nation among the most faithful adherent of the throne this dynasty however which can at no epoch point to a ruler who base he power on the freedom of the people adopt a course towards this nation from father to son which deserve the appellation of perjury the house of austrium have publicly use every effort to deprive the country of its legitimate independence and constitution design to reduce it to a level with the other province long since deprive of all freedom and to unite all in a common sink of slavery foiled in this effort by the untiring vigilance of the nation it direct its endeavor to lame the power to check the progress of hungary cause it to minister to the gain of the province of austrium but only to the extent which enable those province to bear the load of taxation with which the prodigality of the imperial house weigh they down have first deprive those province of all constitutional means of remonstrate against a policy which be not base upon the welfare of the subject but solely tend to maintain despotism and crush liberty in every country of europe it have frequently happen that the hungarian nation in despite of this systematize tyranny have be oblige to take up arm in self-defence although constantly victorious in these constitutional struggle yet so moderate have the nation ever be in its use of the victory so strongly have it confide in the king 's plighted word that it have ever lay down arm as soon as the king by new compact and fresh oath have guarantee the duration of its rights and liberty but every new compact be as futile as those which precede it each oath which fall from the royal lip be but a renewal of previous perjury the policy of the house of austrium which aim at destroy the independence of hungary as a state have be pursue unaltered for three hundred year it be in vain that the hungarian nation shed its blood for the deliverance of austrium whenever it be in danger vain be all the sacrifice which it make to serve the interest of the reign house in vain do it on the renewal of the royal promise forget the wound which the past have inflict vain be the fidelity cherish by the hungarian for they king and which in moment of danger assume a character of devotion they be in vain since the history of the

with the enemy of the country with robber or partizan chieftain to oppress the nation : 2 when it attempt to annihilate the independence of the country and its constitution support on oath by attack with a armed force the people who have commit no act of revolt : 3 when the integrity of a country which the sovereign have swear to maintain be violate and its resource cut away : 4 when foreign army be employ to murder the people and to oppress they liberty each of the grounds here enumerate would justify the exclusion of a dynasty from the throne but the house of lorraine-hapsburg be unexampled

kossuth in a few minute reply he begin with apology and then proceed -rrb- : -- permit I to say that in my opinion the word glory should be blot out from the dictionary in respect to individual and only leave for use in respect to nation whatever a man can do for he country even though he should live a long life and have the strongest faculty would not be too much : for he ought to use he utmost exertion and he utmost power in return for the gift he receive whatever a man can do on behalf of he country and of humanity would never be so much as he duty call upon he to do still less so much as to merit the use of the word glory in regard to himself once more i say that duty belong to the man and glory to the nation when a honest man do he duty to he own country and become a patriot he act for all humanity and do he duty to mankind you have bestow great attention upon the cause of hungary and the subject be here well understand generally which be a benefit to I i declare to you all that i find more exact knowledge of the hungarian cause here than in any other place i have be yet i be astonish to see in a report of the proceedings of the united state senate that a member rise and say that we be not struggle for the principle of freedom and of liberty but rather for the support of we ancient charter this gentleman be a misrepresentation of we cause there be a truth in the assertion that we be struggle for we _ ancient rights _ for the right of self-government be a ancient right the right of self-government be ours a thousand year ago and have be guarantee to we by the coronation oath of more than thirty of we king i say that this right be guarantee to we yet it have become a dead letter in the course of time before the revolution of 1848 we be long struggle to enforce we notorious but often invade rights but the whole people be not interested in they : for although they be constitutional rights they be restrict in ancient time not to a particular _ race _ but to a particular _ class _ call noble these do not belong to the magyar alone but to all the race that settle in the country to the sclave to the wallachian the serb and to other whatever they race or they extraction yet none but the _ noble _ be privileged we see that for one class only to be interested in these rights be not enough and we wish to make they a benefit to every man in the country and to replace the old constitution by one which should give a common and universal right to all man to vote without regard to the tongue they speak or the church at which they pray i need not enter further into the subject than to say that we establish a system of practically universal suffrage of equality in representation a just share in taxation for the support of the state and equality in the benefit of public education and in all those blessing which be derive from the freedom of a free people it have be ask by some why i allow a treacherous general to ruin we cause i have always be anxious not to assume any duty for which i might be unsuited if i have undertake the practical direction of military operation and anything go amiss i fear that my conscience would torture I as guilty of the fall of my country as i have not be familiar with military tactic i therefore entrust my country 's cause thus far into other hand and i weep for the result in exile i have try to profit by the past and prepare for the future i believe that the confidence of hungary in I be not shake by misfortune nor break by my calumniator i have have all in my own hand once and if ever i be in the same position again i will act i will not become a napoleon nor a alexander and labor for my own ambition but i will labor for freedom and for the moral well-being of man i do but ask you to enforce you own great constitutional principle and not permit russium to interfere \* \* \* \* \* vii -- hereditary policy of america -lrb- _ speech at the corporation dinner new york dec 11th _ 1851 -rrb- the

rise to reply the enthusiasm with which he be greet be unparalleled it shake the building and the chandelier and candelabra tremble before it every one present rise to he foot and appear excite to frenzy the lady participate in honor the hungarian hero at length the storm of applause subside and then ensue a silence most intense every eye be fix on kossuth and when he commence he speech the noise cause by the drop of a pin could be hear throughout the large and capacious room kossuth 's speech sir -- in return you my most humble thanks for the honor you do I by you toast and by coupling my name with that cause which be the sacred aim of my life i be so overwhelmed with emotion by all it have be my strange lot to experience since i be on you glorious shore that i be unable to find word and know that all the honor i meet with have the higher meaning of principle i beg leave at once to fall back on my duty which be the lasting topic of my reflection my sorrow and my hope i take the present for a highly important opportunity which may decide the success or failure of my visit i must therefore implore you indulgence for a pretty long and plain development of my view concern that cause which the citizen of new york and you particularly gentleman honor with generous interest when i perceive that the sympathy of you people with hungary be almost universal and that they pronounce they feeling in its favor with a resolution such as denote noble and great deed about to follow i might feel inclined to take for grant at least _ in principle _ that we shall have you generous aid for restore to we land its sovereign independence nothing but _ detail _ of negotiation would seem to be leave for I be not my confidence check by be tell that accord to many of you most distinguished statesman it be a ruling principle of you public policy never to interfere in european affair i highly respect the source of this conviction gentleman this source be you religious attachment to the doctrine of those who bequeath to you the immortal constitution which aid by the unparalleled benefit of nature have raise you in seventy-five year from a infant people to a mighty nation the wisdom of the founder of you great republic you see in its happy result what would be the consequence of depart from that wisdom you be not sure you therefore instinctively fear to touch even with improve hand the dear legacy of those great man and as to you glorious constitution all humanity can only wish that you and you posterity may long preserve this religious attachment to its fundamental principle which by no means exclude development and progress : and that every citizen of you great union thankfully acknowledge its immense benefit may never forget to love it more than momentary passion or selfish and immediate interest may every citizen of you glorious country for ever remember that a partial discomfort of a corner in a large sure and comfortable house may be well amend without break the foundation and that amongst all possible means of get rid of that partial discomfort the worst would be to burn down the house with he own hand but while i acknowledge the wisdom of you attachment to fundamental doctrine i beg leave with equal frankness to state that in my opinion there can be scarcely anything more dangerous to the progressive development of a nation than to mistake for a basis that which be none to mistake for a principle that which be but a transitory convenience to take for substantial that which be but accidental or to take for a constitutional doctrine that which be but a momentary exigency of administrative policy such a course of action would be like to a healthy man refuse substantial food because when he be once weak in stomach he physician order he a severe diet let I suppose gentleman that that doctrine of non-interference be really bequeath to you by you washington -lrb- and that it be not i will essay to prove afterwards -rrb- and let I even suppose that you washington impart to it such a interpretation as be equivalent to the word of cain be i my brother 's keeper -lrb- which supposition would be of course a sacrilege but i be force to such supposition : -rrb- i may be entitle to ask be the dress which suit the child still suitable to the full grown man would it not be ridiculous to lay the man into the child 's cradle and to sing he to sleep by a lullaby in the origin of the united state you be a infant people and you have of course nothing to do but to grow to grow and to grow but now you be so far grow that there be no foreign power on earth from which you have anything to fear for you existence or security in fact you growth be that of a giant of old you infant frame be compose of thirteen state and be restricted to the border of the atlantic : now you massive bulk be spread to the gulf of mexico and the pacific and you territory be a continent you right hand touch europe over the wave you left reach across the pacific to eastern asia and there between two quarter of the world there you stand in proud immensity a world yourselve then you be a small people of three million and a half now you be a mighty nation of twenty-four million thus you have fully enter into the second stadium of national life in which a nation live at length not for itself separately but as a member of the great family of human nation have a right to whatever be due from that family _ towards _ every one of its full-grown member but also engage to every duty which that great family may claim _ from _ every one of its full-grown member a nation may either from comparative weakness or by choice and policy as japan and china or by both these motive as paraguay under dr francium -- be induce to live a life seclude from the world indifferent to the destiny of mankind in which it can not or will not have any share but then it must be willing to be also exclude from the benefit of progress civilization and national intercourse while disavow all care about all other nation in the world no citizen of the united state have or ever will have the wish to see this country degrade to the rot vegetation of a paraguay or the mummy existence of a japan and china the feeling of self-dignity and the expansiveness of that enterprize spirit which be congenial to freemen would revolt against the very idea of such a degrading national captivity but if there be even a will to live such a mummy life there be no possibility to do so the very existence of you great country the principle upon which it be found its geographical position its present scale of civilization and all its moral and material interest would lead on you people not only to maintain but necessarily more and more to develop you foreign intercourse then be in so many respects link to mankind at large you can not have the will nor yet the power to remain indifferent to the outward world and if you can not remain indifferent you must resolve to throw you weight into that balance in which the fate and condition of man be weigh you be a power on earth you must be a power on earth and must therefore accept all the consequence of this position you can not allow that any power in the world should dispose of the fate of that great family of mankind of which you be so pre-eminent a member : else you would resign you proud place and you still prouder future and be a power on earth no more i hope i have sufficiently show that should even that doctrine of non-interference have be establish by the founder of you republic that which might have be very proper to you infancy would not now be suitable to you manhood it be a beautiful word of montesquieu that republic be to be found on virtue and you know that virtue between man and man as sanction by we christian religion be but a exercise of that great principle -- thou shalt do to other as thou desirest other to do to thee thus i might rely simply upon you generous republican heart and upon the consistency of you principle but i beg to add some essential difference in material respects between you present condition and that of yore of you twenty-four million more than nineteen be spread over yonder immense territory the richest of the world employ in the cultivation of the soil that honorable occupation which in every time have prove to be the most inexhaustible and most unfailing source of public welfare and private happiness as also the most unwavering ally of freedom and the most faithful fosterer of all those upright noble generous sentiment which the constant intercourse with ever young ever great ever beautiful virtue impart to man now this immense agricultural interest desire large market at the same time afford a solid basis to you manufacturing industry and in consequence to you immensely develop commerce all this place such a difference between the republic of washington and you present grandeur that though you may well be attach to you original principle -lrb- for the principle of liberty be everlastingly the same -rrb- yet not so in respect to the exigency of you policy for if it be to be regulate by _ interest _ you country have other interest to-day than it have then and if ever it be to be regulate by the higher consideration of _ principle _ you be strong enough to feel that the time be already come and i standing here before you to plead the cause of oppressed humanity be bold to declare that there may never again come a crisis at which such a elevation of you policy would prove either more glorious to you or more beneficial to man : for we in europe be apparently on the eye of that day when either the hope or the fear of oppressed nation will be crush for a long time have state so far the difference of the situation i beg leave now to assert that it be a error to suppose that non-interference in foreign matter have be bequeath to the people of the united state by you great washington as a doctrine and as a constitutional principle firstly washington never even recommend to you non-interference in the sense of _ indifference _ to the fate of other nation he only recommend _ neutrality _ and there be a mighty diversity between these two idea neutrality have reference to a state of war between two belligerent power and it be this case which washington contemplate when he in he farewell address advise the people of the united state not to enter into entangle alliance let quarrel power let quarrel nation go to war -- but do you consider you own concern leave foreign power to quarrel about ambitious topic or narrow partial interest neutrality be a matter of convenience -- not of principle but while neutrality have reference to a state of war between belligerent power the principle of non-interference on the contrary lay down the sovereign right of nation to arrange they own domestic concern therefore these two idea of neutrality and non-interference be entirely different have reference to two entirely different matter the sovereign right of every nation to rule over itself to alter its own institution to change the form of its own government be a common public law of nation common to all and _ therefore put under the common guarantee of all _ this sovereign right of every nation to dispose of itself you the people of the united state must recognize for it be the common law of mankind in which because it be such every nation be equally interested you must recognize it secondly because the very existence of you great republic as also the independence of every nation rest upon this ground if that sovereign right of nation be no common public law of mankind then you own independence would be no matter of right but only a matter of fact which might be subject for all future time to all sort of chance from foreign conspiracy and violence and where be the citizen of the united state who would not revolt at the idea that this great republic be not a righteous nor a lawful existence but only a mere accident -- a mere matter of fact if it be so you be not entitle to invoke the protection of god for you great country for the protection of god can not without sacrilege be invoke but in behalf of justice and right you would have no right to look to the sympathy of mankind for yourselve for you would profess a abrogation of the law of humanity upon which be found you own independence you own nationality now gentleman if these be principle of common law of that law which god have give to every nation of humanity -- if to organize itself be the common lawful right of every nation then the interference with this common law of all humanity the violent act of hinder by armed force a nation from exercise that sovereign right must be consider as a violation of that common public law upon which you very existence rest and which be a common law of all humanity be by god himself place under the safeguard of all humanity for it be god himself who command we to love we neighbor as we love ourselves and to do towards other as we desire other to do towards we upon this point you can not remain indifferent you may well remain neutral to war between two belligerent nation but you can not remain indifferent to the violation of the common law of humanity that indifference washington have never teach you i defy any man to show I out of the eleven volume of washington 's writings a single word to that effect he could not have recommend this indifference without cease to be wise as he be for without justice there be no wisdom on earth he could not have recommend it without become inconsistent for it be this common law of mankind which you father invoke before god and man when they proclaim you independence it be he himself you great washington who not only accept but again and again ask foreign aid -- foreign help for the support of that common law of mankind in respect to you own independence knowledge and instruction be so universally spread amongst the enlighten people of the united state the history of you country be such a household science at the most lonely hearth of you remotest settlement that it may be sufficient for I to refer in that respect to the instruction and correspondence between washington and the minister at paris -- the equally immortal franklin -- the modest man with the proud epitaph which tell the world that he wrest the lightning from heaven and the sceptre from the tyrant 's hand i will go further even that doctrine of neutrality which washington teach and bequeath to you he teach not as a constitutional _ principle _ -- a lasting regulation for all future time but only as a matter of temporary _ policy _ i refer in that respect to the very word of he farewell address there he state explicitly that it be you _ policy _ to steer clear of _ permanent _ alliance with any portion of the foreign world these be he very word policy be the word and you know that policy be not the science of principle but of exigency and that principle be of course by a free and powerful nation never to be sacrifice to exigency the exigency pass away like the bubble of a shower but the nation be immortal : it must consider the future also and not only the egotistical dominion of the pass hour : it must be aware that to a immortal nation nothing can be of higher importance than immortal principle again in the same address washington explicitly say in reference to he policy of neutrality that with he a predominant motive have be to _ gain time _ to you country to settle and mature its institution and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which be necessary to give it the command of its own fortune these be highly memorable word gentleman here i take my ground and cast a glance of admiration over you glorious land i confidently ask you gentleman be you institution settle and mature or be they not be you or be you not come to such a degree of strength and consistency as to be the master of you own fortune oh how do i thank god for have give I the glorious view of this country 's greatness which answer this question for I yes you _ have _ attain that degree of strength and consistency in which you less fortunate brethren may well claim you protect hand one word more on washington 's doctrine in one of he letter write to lafayette he say : -- let we only have twenty year of peace and we country will come to such a degree of power and wealth that we shall be able in a just cause to defy any power on earth whatsoever in a just cause now in the name of eternal truth and by all that be dear and sacred to man since the history of mankind be record there have be no cause more just than the cause of hungary never be there a people without the slightest reason more sacrilegiously more treacherously attack or by fouler means than hungary never have crime cursed ambition despotism and violence unite more wickedly to crush freedom and the very life than against hungary never be a country more mortally aggrieved than hungary be all _ you _ suffering -- all _ you _ complaint which with so much right drive you forefather to take up arm be but slight grievance in comparison with those immense deep wound out of which the heart of hungary bleed if the cause of we people be not sufficiently just to insure the protection of god and the support of right-willing man -- then there be no just cause and no justice on earth then the blood of no new abel will moan towards heaven the genius of charity christian love and justice will mourningly fly the earth a heavy curse will fall upon morality -- oppressed man will despair and only the cain of mankind walk proudly with impious brow about the ruin of liberty on earth now allow I briefly to consider how you foreign policy have grow and enlarged itself i will only recall to you memory the message of president monroe when he clearly state that the united state would take up arm to protect the american colony of spain now free republic should the holy -lrb- or rather unholy -rrb- alliance make a attempt either to aid spain to reduce the new american republic to they ancient colonial state or to compel they to adopt political system more conformable to the policy and view of that alliance i entreat you to mark this well gentleman not only the force introduction of monarchy but in general the interference of foreign power in the contest be declare sufficient motive for the united state to protect the colony let I remind you that this declaration of president monroe be not only approve and confirm by the people of the united state but that great britain itself join the united state in the declaration of this decision and this policy i further recall to you memory the instruction give in 1826 to you envoy to the congress of panama richard anderson and john sergeant where it be clearly state that the united state would have oppose with they whole force the interference of the continental power in that struggle for independence it be true that this declaration to go even to war to protect the independence of foreign state against foreign interference be restricted to the continent of america for president monroe declare in he message that the united state can have no concern in european straggle be distant and separate from europe by the great atlantic ocean but i would remark that this indifference to european concern be again a matter not of principle but of temporary exigency -- the motive of which have by the lapse of time entirely disappear -- so much that the balance be even turn to the opposite side president monroe mention _ distance _ as a motive of the above-stated distinction well since the prodigious development of you fulton 's glorious invention distance be no longer calculate by mile but by hour and be so europe be of course less distant from you than the greater part of the american continent but let even the word distance be take in a nominal sense europe be nearer to you than the greatest part of the american continent -- yea even nearer than perhaps some part of you own territory president monroe 's second motive be that you be separate from europe _ by the atlantic _ now at the present time and in the present condition of navigation the atlantic be no separation but rather a link as the means of that commercial intercourse which bring the interest of europe home to you connect you with it by every tie of moral as well as material interest there be immense truth in that which the french legation in the united state express to you government in a able note of 27th October past : -- america be closely connect with europe be only separate from the latter by a distance scarcely exceed eight day ' journey by one of the most important of general interest -- the interest of commerce the nation of america and europe be at this day so dependent upon one another that the effect of any event prosperous or otherwise happen on one side of the atlantic be immediately feel on the other side the result of this community of interest commercial political and moral between europe and america -- of this frequency and rapidity of intercourse between they be that it become as difficult to point out the geographical degree where american policy shall terminate and european policy begin as it be to trace out the line where american commerce begin and european commerce terminate where may be say to begin or terminate the idea which be in the ascendant in europe and in america it be chiefly in new york that i feel induce to urge this because new york be by innumerable tie connect with europe -- more connected than several part of europe itself it be the agricultural interest of this great country which chiefly want a outlet and a market now it be far more to europe than to the american continent that you have to look in that respect on this account you can not remain indifferent to the fate of freedom on the european continent : for be sure gentleman -- and i would say this chiefly to the gentleman of trade -- should absolutism gain ground in europe it will it must put every possible obstacle in the way of commercial intercourse with republican america : for commercial intercourse be the most powerful convoyer of principle and be sure the victory of absolutism on the european continent will in no quarter have more injurious national consequence than against you vast agricultural and commercial interest then why not prevent it while it be still possible to do so with comparatively small sacrifice rather than abide that fatal catastrophe and have to mourn the immense sacrifice it would then cost even in political consideration now-a-days you have stronger motive to feel interested in the fate of europe than in the fate of the central or southern part of america whatever may happen in the institution of these part you be too powerful to see you own institution affect by it but let europe become absolutistical -lrb- as unless hungary be restore to its independence and italy become free be sure it will -rrb- -- and you child will see those word which you national government speak in 1827 fulfil on a larger scale than they be mean that the absolutism of europe will not be appease until every vestige of human freedom have be obliterate even here and oh do not rely too fondly upon you power it be great assuredly you have not to fear any single power on earth but look to history mighty empire have vanish let not the enemy of freedom grow too strong victorious over europe and then unite they would be too strong even for you and be sure they hate you most cordially they consider you as they most dangerous opponent absolutism can not sleep tranquilly while the republican principle have such a mighty representative as you country be yes gentleman it be the fear of drive the absolutist to fanatical effort which induce you great statesman not to extend to europe the principle on which they act towards the new world and by no mean the publicly avowed feeble motive every manifestation of you public life in those time show that i be right to say so the european nation be about 1823 in such a degraded situation that indeed you must have feel anxious not to come into any political contact with that pestilential atmosphere when as mr clay say in 1818 in he speech about the emancipation of south america paris be transfer to st petersburg but scarcely a year later the greek nation come in its contest to a important crisis which give you hope that the spirit of freedom be wake again and at once you abandon the principle of political indifference for europe you know you clay and you webster speak as if really they be speak for my very cause you know how you citizen act in behalf of that struggle for liberty in a part of europe which be more distant than hungary : and again when poland fall you know what spirit pervade the united state i have show you how washington 's policy have be gradually change : but one mighty difference i must still commemorate you population have since monroe 's time nearly double i believe or at least have increase by million and what sort of man be these million be they only native-born american no european emigrant many be man who though citizen of the united state be by the most sacred tie of relationship attach to the fate of europe that be a consideration worthy of reflection with you wisest man who will ere long agree with I that in you present condition you be at least as much interested in the state of europe as twenty-eight year ago you father be in the fate of central and southern america and really so it be the unexampled sympathy for the cause of my country which i have meet with in the united state prove that it be so you generous interference with the turkish captivity of the governor of hungary prove that be so and this progressive development in you foreign policy be in fact no longer a mere instinctive ebullition of public opinion which be about hereafter to direct you governmental policy the opinion of the people be _ already _ avow as the policy of the government i have a most decisive authority to rely upon in say so it be the message of the president of the united state he excellency millard fillmore make a communication to congress a few day ago and there i read the paragraph : -- the deep interest which we feel in the spread of liberal principle and the establishment of free government and the sympathy with which we witness every struggle against oppression _ forbid that we should be indifferent _ to a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power be invoke to stifle public sentiment and repress the spirit of freedom in any country now gentleman here be the ground which i take for my earnest endeavor to benefit the cause of hungary i have only respectfully to ask : be a principle which the public opinion of the united state so resolutely profess and which the government of the united state with the full sentiment of its responsibility declare to you congress to be a ruling principle of you national government -- be that principle mean to be serious indeed it would be a most impertinent outrage towards you great people and you national government to entertain the insulting opinion that what the people of the united state and its national government profess in such a solemn diplomatic manner could be mean as a mere sport with the most sacred interest of humanity god forbid that i should think so therefore i take the principle of you policy as i find it establish -- and i come in the name of oppressed humanity to claim the unavoidable practical consequence of you own freely choose policy which you have avow to the whole world to claim the realization of those expectation which you the sovereign people of the united state have choose of you own accord to raise in the bosom of my countryman and of all the oppress you will excuse I gentleman for have dwell so long upon that principle of non-interference with european measure : but i have find it to be the stone of stumble throw in my way when i speak of what i humbly request from the united state i have be charge as arrogantly attempt to change you exist policy and since i can not in one speech exhaust the complex and mighty whole of my mission i choose on the present opportunity to develop my view about that fundamental principle : and have show not theoretically but practically that it be a mistake to think that you have at any time such a principle and have show that if you ever entertain such a policy you have be force to abandon it -- so much at least i hope i have achieve my humble request to you active sympathy may be still oppose by -- i know not what other motive but the objection that you must not interfere with european concern -- this objection be dispose of once and for ever i hope it remain now to inquire whether since you have profess not to be indifferent to the cause of european freedom -- the cause of hungary be such as to have just claim to you active and effectual assistance and support it be gentleman to prove this i do not now intend to enter into a explanation of the particulars of we struggle which i have the honor to conduct as the choose chief magistrate of my native land it be highly gratifying to I to find that the cause of hungary be -- except some ridiculous misrepresentation of ill-will -- correctly understand here i will only state now one fact and that be that we endeavor for independence be crush by the armed interference of a foreign despotic power -- the principle of all evil on earth -- russium and state this fact i will not again intrude upon you with my own view but recall to you memory the doctrine establish by you own statesman firstly -- i return to you great washington he say in one of he letter to lafayette my policy be plain and simple i think every nation have a right to establish that form of government under which it conceive it can live most happy and that no government ought to interfere with the internal concern of another here i take my ground : -- upon a principle of washington -- a _ principle _ not a mere temporary policy calculate for the first twenty year of you infancy russium _ have _ interfere with the internal concern of hungary and by do so have violate the policy of the united state establish as a lasting principle by washington himself it be a lasting principle i could appeal in my support to the opinion of every statesman of the united state of every party of every time but to save time i pass at once from the first president of the united state to the last and recall to you memory this word of the present annual message of he excellency president fillmore : -- let every people choose for itself and make and alter its political institution to suit its own condition and convenience i beg leave also to quote the statement of you present secretary of state mr webster who in he speech on the greek question speak thus : -- the law of nation maintain that in extreme case resistance be lawful and that one nation have no right to interfere in the affair of another well that precisely be the ground upon which we hungarian stand but i may perhaps meet the objection -lrb- i be sorry to say i have meet it already -rrb- -- well we own that it have be violate by russium in the case of hungary but after all what be hungary to we let every people take care of itself what be that to we so some speak : it be the old doctrine of private egotism every one for himself and god for we all i will answer the objection again by the word of mr webster who in he speech on the greek question have profess that the internal sovereignty of every nation be a law of nation -- thus go on but it may be ask ` what be all that to we ' the question be easily answer _ we be one of the nation _ and we as a nation have precisely the same interest in international law as a private individual have in the law of he country the principle which you honorable secretary of state profess be a principle of eternal truth no man can disavow it no political party can disavow it thus happily i be able to address my prayer not to a party but to the whole people of the united state and will go on to do so as long as i have no reason to regard one party as oppose or indifferent to my country 's cause but from certain quarter it may be avowed well we acknowledge every nation 's sovereign right we acknowledge it to be a law of nation that no foreign power interfere in the affair of another and we be determine to respect this common law of mankind but if other do not respect that law it be not ours to meddle with they let I answer by a analysis : -- _ every nation have the same interest in international law as a private individual have in the law of he country _ that be a acknowledged principle with you statesman what then be the latter relation do it suffice that a individual do not himself violate the law must he not so far as be in he power also prevent other from violate the law suppose you see that a wicked man be about to rob -- to murder you neighbor or to burn he house will you wrap yourself in you own virtuous lawfulness and say i myself neither rob nor murder nor burn but what other do be not my concern i be not my brother 's keeper _ i sympathize with he _ but i be not call on to save he from be rob murder or burn what honest man of the world would answer so none of you none of the people of the united state i be sure that would be the damned maxim of the pharisee of old who thank god that they be not as other be we savior be not content himself to avoid trading in the hall of the temple but he drive out those who be trade there the duty of enforce observance to the common law of nation have no other _ limit _ than the power to fulfil it of course the republic of st marino or the prince of monaco can not stop the czar of russium in he ambitious annoyance it be ridiculous when the prince of modena refuse to recognize the government of loui philippe -- but to whom much be give from he will much be expect say the lord every condition have not only its rights but also its own duty and whatever exist as a power on earth be in duty a part of the executive government of mankind call to maintain the law of nation woe a thousandfold woe to humanity should there be no force on earth to maintain the law of humanity woe to humanity should those who be as mighty as they be free not feel interested to maintain the law of mankind because they be rightful law -- but only in so far as some partial money-interest would desire it woe to mankind if every despot of the world may dare to trample down the law of humanity and no free nation make these law respect people of the united state humanity expect that you glorious republic will prove to the world that _ republic be found on virtue _ -- it expect to see you the guardian of the law of humanity i will come to the last possible objection i may be tell you be right in you principle you cause be just and you have we sympathy but after all we _ can not _ go to war for you country we can not furnish you army and fleet we can not fight you battle for you there be the rub who can exactly tell what would have be the issue of you own struggle for independence -lrb- though you country be in a far happier geographical position than we poor hungarian -rrb- have france give such a answer to you forefather in 1778 and 1781 instead of send to you aid a fleet of thirty-eight men-of-war and auxiliary troops and 24000 musket and a loan of nineteen million and what be far more than all this do it not show that france resolve with all its power to espouse the cause of you independence but perhaps i shall be tell that france do this not out of love of freedom but out of hatred against england well let it be but let I then ask shall the curse of olden time -- hatred -- be more efficient in the destiny of mankind than love of freedom principle of justice and the law of humanity and be america in the day of steam navigation more distant from europe to-day than france be from america seventy-three year ago however i most solemnly declare that it be not my intention to rely literally upon this example it be not my wish to entangle the united state in war or to engage you great people to send out army and fleet to raise up and restore hungary not at all gentleman i most solemnly declare that i have never entertain such expectation or such hope and here i come to the practical point the principle of evil in europe be the enervating spirit of russian absolutism upon this rest the daring boldness of every petty tyrant to trample upon oppressed nation and to crush liberty to this moloch of ambition have my native land fall a victim it be with this that montalembert threaten the french republican it be russian intervention in hungary which govern french intervention in rome and give german tyrant hardihood to crush all the endeavor for freedom and unity in germany the despot of the european continent be league against the freedom of the world that be a matter of fact the second matter of fact be that the european continent be on the eve of a new revolution it be not necessary to be initiate in the secret preparation of the european democracy to be aware of that approach contingency it be point out by the french constitution itself prescribe a new presidential election for the next spring now suppose that the ambition of loui napoleon encourage by russian secret aid await this time -lrb- _ which i scarcely believe _ -rrb- and suppose that there should be a republic in france of course the first act of the new french president must be at least to recall the french troops from rome nobody can doubt that a revolution in italy will follow or if there be no peaceful solution in france but a revolution then every man know that whenever the heart of france boil up the pulsation be feel throughout europe and oppressed nation once more rise and russium again interfere now i humbly ask with the view of these circumstance before you eye can it be convenient to such a great power as this glorious republic to await the very outbreak and not until then to discuss and decide on you foreign policy there may come as under the last president at a late hour agent to see how matter stand in hungary russian interference and treason achieve what the sacrilegious hapsburg dynasty fail to achieve you know the old word while rome debate saguntum fall so i respectfully press upon you my first entreaty : it be that you people will in good time express to you central government what course of foreign policy it wish to be pursue in the case of the approach event i have mention and i most confidently hope that there be only one course possible consistently with the above recorded principle if you acknowledge that the right of every nation to alter its institution and government be a law of nation -- if you acknowledge the interference of foreign power in that sovereign right to be a violation of the law of nation as you really do -- if you be _ forbid to remain indifferent _ to this violation of international law -lrb- as you president openly profess that you be -rrb- -- then there be no other course possible than neither to interfere in that sovereign right of nation nor to allow any other power whatever to interfere but you will perhaps object to I that amount to go to war i answer : no -- that amount to prevent war what be want to that effect it be want that be aware of the precarious condition of europe you national government should as soon as possible send instruction to you minister at london to declare to the english government that the united state acknowledge the sovereign right of every nation to dispose of its own domestic concern have resolve not to interfere but also not to let any foreign power whatever interfere with this sovereign right in order to repress the spirit of freedom in any country consequently to invite the cabinet of st jame 's into this policy and declare that the united state be resolve to act conjointly with england in that decision in the approach crisis of the european continent such be my first humble request if the citizen of the united state instead of honor I with the offer of they hospitality would be please to pass convenient resolution and to ratify they to they national government -- if the press would hasten to give its aid and in consequence the national government instruct its minister in england accordingly and by communication to the congress as it be wont give publicity to this step i be entirely sure that you would find the people of great britain heartily join this direction of policy no power could feel peculiarly offend by it no exist relation would be break or injure : and still any future interference of russium against the restoration of hungary to that independence which be formally declare in 1849 would be prevent russian arrogance and preponderance would be check and the oppressed nation of europe soon become free there may be some over-anxious man who perhaps would say but if such a declaration of you government be not respect and russium still do interfere then you would be oblige by this previous declaration to go to war and you do not desire to have a war that objection seem to I as if somebody be to say if the vault of heaven break down what shall we do my answer be but it will not break down even so i answer but you declaration _ will _ be respect -- russium will not interfere -- you will have no occasion for war -- you will have prevent war be sure russium would twice thrice consider before provoke against itself besides the roused judgment of nation -- -lrb- to say nothing of the legion of republican france -rrb- -- the english lion and the star-surrounded eagle of america remember that you in conjunction with england once before declare that you would not permit european absolutism to interfere with the formerly spanish colony of america do this declaration bring you to a war quite the contrary it prevent war so it would be in we case also let I therefore most humbly entreat you people of the united state to give such practical direction to you generous sympathy for hungary as to arrange meeting and pass such resolution in every possible place of this union as i take the liberty to mention above the second measure which i beg leave to mention have reference to commercial interest in later time a doctrine have steal into the code of international law which be as contrary to the commercial interest of nation as to they independence the pettiest despot of the world be permit to exclude you commerce from whatever port he please he have only to arrange the blockade and you commerce be shut out or if capture venice bleeding lombardy or my prostrate but resolute hungary rise to shake off the austrian tyrant 's yoke -lrb- as surely they will -rrb- that tyrant believe he have the right from that very moment to exclude you commerce from the uprisen nation now this be a absurdity -- a tyrannical invention of tyrant violate you interest -- you independence the united state have not always regard thing from the despotic point of view i find in a note of mr everett minister of the united state in spain dated madrid jan 20 1826 these word : -- in the war between spain and the spanish american colony the united state have freely grant to _ both _ party the hospitality of they port and territory and have allow the agent of _ both _ to procure within they jurisdiction in the way of lawful trade _ any _ supplies which suit they convenience now gentleman this be the principle which humanity expect for you own and for mankind 's benefit to see maintain by you and not yonder fatal course which permit tyrant to draw from you country every facility for the oppression of they nation but forbid nation to buy the means of defense that be not the principle of you washington when he speak of harmony of friendly intercourse and of peace he always take care to apply he idea to _ nation _ and not to _ government _ -- still less to tyrant who subdue nation by foreign arm the sacred word nation with all its natural rights should not be blot out at least from _ you _ political dictionary : and yet i be sorry to see that the word nation be often replace by the word government gentleman i humbly wish that the public opinion of the people of the united state conscious of its own rights should loudly and resolutely declare that the people of the united state will continue its commercial intercourse with any or every nation be it in revolution against its oppressor or be it not and that the people of the united state expect confidently that its government will provide for the protection of you trade i feel assure that you national government see public opinion so pronounced will judge it convenient to augment you naval force in the mediterranean : and to look for some such station for it as would not force the navy of republican america to make disavowal inconsistent with republican principle or republican dignity only because king so-and-so be he even the curse king of naple grant the favor of a anchoring place for the naval force of you republic i believe you illustrious country should everywhere freely unfurl the star-spangled banner of liberty with all its congenial principle and not make itself in any respect dependent on the glorious smile of the king bomba et compagne the third object of my wish gentleman be the recognition of the independence of hungary when the critical moment arrive you own declaration of independence proclaim the right of every nation to assume among the power of the earth the separate and equal station to which the law of nature and nature 's god entitle they the political existence of you glorious republic be found upon this principle upon this right we nation stand upon the same ground : there be a striking resemblance between you cause and that of my country on the 4th July 1776 john adams speak thus in you congress sink or swim live or die survive or perish i be for this declaration in the beginning we do not go so far as separation from the crown but ` there be a divinity which shape we end ' these noble word be present to my mind on the 14th April 1849 when i move the forfeiture of the crown by the hapsburg in the national assembly of hungary we condition be the same and if there be any difference i venture to say it be in favor of we you country before this declaration be not a _ self-consisting independent _ state hungary be through the lapse of a thousand year through every vicissitude of this long period while nation vanish and empire fall _ the self-consisting independence of hungary be never dispute _ but be recognize by all power of the earth sanction by treaty make with the hapsburg dynasty at the era when this dynasty by the freewill of my nation which act as one of two contracting party be invest with the kingly crown of hungary even more this independence of the kingdom be acknowledge to make a part of the international law of europe and be guarantee not only by foreign european government such as great britain but also by several of those once constitutional state which belong formerly to the german and after its dissolution to the austrian empire this independent condition of hungary be clearly define in one of we fundamental law of 1791 in these word : -- hungary be a free and independent kingdom have its own self-consistent existence and constitution and not subject -lrb- \* -rrb- to any other nation or country in the world this therefore be we ancient right _ we be not dependent on nor a part of the austrian empire as you country be dependent on england _ it be clearly define that we owe to austria nothing but good neighborhood and the only tie between we and austrium be that we elect to be we king the same dynasty which be also the sovereign of austrium and occupy the same line of hereditary succession as we king but by accept this we forefather with the consent of the king again declare that though hungary accept the dynasty as we hereditary king all the other franchise rights and law of the nation shall remain in full power and intact and we country shall not be govern like the other dominion of that dynasty but accord to we constitutionally establish authority we could not belong to the austrian empire for that empire do not then as yet exist while hungary have already exist as a substantive kingdom for many century and for some two hundred and eighty year under the government of that hapsburgian dynasty the austrian empire as you know be establish only in 1806 when the rhenish confederacy of napoleon strike the deathblow of the german empire of which franci ii of austrium be not _ hereditary _ but _ elect _ emperor that hungary have belong to the _ german _ empire be a thing which no man in the world ever imagine yet it be only now that the hapsburgian tyrant profess a intention to melt hungary into the german confederation but you know this intention to be in so striking opposition to the european public law that england and france solemnly protest against it so that it be not carry out even to-day the german empire have die its late emperor franci also king of hungary choose to entitle himself austrian emperor in 1806 but even in that fundamental charter he solemnly declare that hungary and its annexed province _ be not intend to make and will not make a part of the austrian empire _ subsequently he enter with this empire into the german confederation but hungary as well as lombardy and venice not make part of the austrian empire still remain separated and be not receive into the confederacy -lrb- footnote \* : in the original latin _ obnoxium _ not entangled or compromise with any other -rrb- the law which we succeed to carry in 1848 of course altered nothing in that old chartered condition of hungary we transform the peasantry into freeholder and abolish feudal incumbrance we replace the political privilege of aristocracy by the common liberty of the whole people give to the people at large representation in the legislature transform we municipality into democratic corporation introduce equality before the law for the whole people in rights and duty and abolish the immunity of taxation which have be enjoy by the class call _ noble _ secure equal religious liberty to all secure liberty of the press and of association provide for public gratuitous instruction of the whole people of every confession and of whatever tongue in all this we do no wrong all these be as you see internal reform which do not at all interfere with we allegiance to the king and be carry lawfully in peaceful legislation _ with the king 's own sanction _ besides this there be one other thing which be carry we be formerly govern by a board of council which have the express duty to govern accord to we law and be responsible for do so but we find by long experience that a corporation can not really be responsible and that this be the reason why the absolutist tendency of the dynasty succeed in encroach upon we liberty so we replace the board of council by minister the empty responsibility of a board by the individual responsibility of man -- and _ the king consent to it _ i myself be name by he minister of the treasury that be all but precisely here be the rub the dynasty could not bear the idea that we would not give to its ambition the life sweat of we people it be not contented with the 1500000 dollar which be generously appropriate to it yearly it dread that it would be disabled in future from use we brave army against we will to crush the spirit of freedom in the world therefore it resort to the most outrageous conspiracy and attack we by arm and upon receive a false report of a great victory this young usurper issue a proclamation declare that hungary shall no more exist -- that its independence its constitution its very existence be abolish and it shall be absorb like a farm or fold into the austrian empire to all this hungary answer thou shalt not exist tyrant but we will and we banish he and issue the declaration of the deposition of he dynasty and of we separate independence so you see gentleman that there be a very great difference between you declaration and ours -- it be in we favor there be another difference you declare you independence of the english crown when it be yet very doubtful whether you would be successful we declare we independence of the austrian crown only after we in legitimate defense be already victorious when we have actually beat the pretender and have thus already prove that we have strength to become a independent power one thing more : we declaration of independence be not only overwhelmingly vote in we congress but every county every municipality solemnly declare its consent and adherence to it so it become sanction not by mere representative but by the whole nation positively and by the fundamental institution of hungary and so it still remain nothing have since happen on the part of the nation contrary to this declaration one thing only happen -- a foreign power russium come with its armed bondsman and aid by treason have overthrow we for a while now i put the question before god and humanity to you free sovereign people of america can this violation of international law abolish the legitimate character of we declaration of independence if not then here i take my ground because i be in this very manifesto entrust with the charge of governor of my fatherland i have swear before god and my nation to endeavor to maintain and secure this act of independence and so may god the almighty help I as i will -- i will until my nation be again in the condition to dispose of its government which i confidently trust -- yea more i know -- will be republican and then i retire to the humble condition of my former private life equalling in one thing at least you washington not in merit but in honesty that be the only ambition of my life amen here then be my third humble wish : that the people of the united state would by all constitutional means of its wonted public life declare that acknowledge the legitimacy of we independence it be anxious to greet hungary amongst the independent power of the earth and invite the government of the united state to recognize this independence _ at the earliest convenient time _ that be all let I see the principle announce : the rest may well be leave to the wisdom of you government with some confidence in my own respectful discretion also so much for the people of the united state in its public and political capacity but if that sympathy which i have the honor to meet with be really intend to become beneficial there be one humble wish more which i entertain : it be a respectful appeal to generous feeling gentleman i would rather starve than rely for myself and family on foreign aid but for my country 's freedom i would not be ashamed to go beg from door to door i have take the advice of some kind friend whether it be lawful to express such a humble request for i feel it a honorable duty neither to offend nor to evade you law i be tell it be lawful there be two means to see this my humble wish accomplish the first be by spontaneous subscription the second be by a loan the latter may require private consultation in a narrower circle as to subscription the idea be bring home to my mind by a plain but very generous letter which i have the honor to receive and which i beg to read it be as follow : -- cincinnatus o nov 14 1851 m loui kossuth governor of hungary : -- sir -- i have authorize the office of the ohio life insurance and trust company in new york to honor you draft on I for one thousand dollar respectfully yours w smead i beg leave here publicly to return my most humble thanks to the gentleman for he ample aid and the delicate manner in which he offer it and it come to my mind that where one individual be ready to make such sacrifice to my country 's cause there may perhaps be many who would give they small share to it if they be only apprise that it will be thankfully accept however small it may be and it come to my mind that million of drop make a ocean and the united state number many million of inhabitant all warmly attach to liberty a million dollar pay singly would be to I far _ more _ precious than pay in one single draft for it would practically show the sympathy of the people at large would i be so happy as you washington be when he also for you glorious country 's sake in the hour of you need call to france for money sir i have do i come to you shore a exile : you have pour upon I the triumph of a welcome such as the world have never yet see and why because you take I for the representative of that principle of liberty which god have destine to become the common benefit of all humanity it be glorious to see a free and mighty people so greet the principle of freedom in the person of one who be persecute and helpless be bless for it you generous deed will be record and as million of europe 's oppressed nation will even now raise they thanksgiving to god for this ray of hope which by this act you have throw on the dark night of they fate even so through all posterity oppressed man will look to you memory as to a token of god that there be a hope for freedom on earth since there be a people like you to feel its worth and to support its cause \* \* \* \* \* viii -- on nationality -lrb- _ speech at the banquet of the press new york _ -rrb- at this banquet mr bryant the poet preside and numerous speech be deliver among which be one by the well-known author mr bancroft lately ambassador in england this gentleman close by say that when the illustrious governor of hungary utter the solemn truth that europe have no hope but in republican institution -- that be a renunciation to the world that the austrian monarchy be sick and die and that vitality remain in the people alone and as he utter that truth not he own race only -- not the magyar only but every nationality of hungary all the fifteen or twenty million within its limit -- all cry out that he be the representative of they conviction -- that he be the man of they affection that he be the utterer of truth on which they rely we guest cross the atlantic and he be receive and what be the great fact that constitute he reception he find there the military arrange to do he honor and among those who on that day bear arm be man of every tongue that be speak between the steppe of tartary eastward towards the pacific ocean the great truth that be pronounce on that occasion -- i do not fear to utter it -- be let who will cavil _ la solidarité des peuples _ -- the sublime truth that all man be brother -- that all nation too be brethren and be responsible for one another the chairman also speak eloquently in introduce the third toast which be briefly loui kossuth as mr bryant pronounce he name kossuth rise and be receive with multifarious demonstration of enthusiasm at last he proceed as follow : -- gentleman -- i know that in you hand the independent republican press be a weapon to defend truth and justice a torch light at the fire of immortality a spark of which glister in every man 's soul and prove its divine origin : and as the cause of my country be just and true and want nothing but light to secure support from every friend of freedom every noble-minded man -- for this reason i address you with joy gentleman though it be sorrowful to see how austrian intrigue distort plain open history into a tissue of falsehood find they way even into the american press i be proud and happy that the immense majority of you conscious of you noble vocation and instinct with the generosity of freedom protect we sacred rights against the dark plot of tyranny you independent press have likewise prove that its freedom be the most efficient protection even against calumny a far better one than restrictive prevention which condemn the human intellect to eternal minority i address you gentleman with the greater joy because through you i have the invaluable benefit of reach the whole of you great glorious and free people eighty year ago the immortal franklin 's own press be almost the only one in the colony : now you have above three thousand newspaper with a circulation of five million of copy i be tell that the journal of new york state alone exceed in number those of all the rest of the world outside of you great union and that the circulation of the newspaper of this city alone nearly reach that of the whole empire of great britain but what be more -- i boldly declare that except in the united state there be scarcely anywhere a practical freedom of the press indeed concern norway i be not quite aware but throughout the european continent you know how the press be fetter in france under nominally republican government all the fruit of victorious revolution be nipt by the blast grip of _ centralize _ power -- legislative and administrative omnipotence the independence of the french press be crush the government can not bear the free word of public opinion and in a republic the shout vive la république be become almost a crime this be a mournful sight but be a efficient warning against centralization it be chiefly great britain which boast of a free press and assuredly in one sense the freedom be almost unlimited : for i see placard with the printer 's name state that queen victorium be no lawful queen and all those who rule ought to be hang but man only laugh at the foolish extravagance nevertheless i hope the generous people of great britain will not be offend when i say that they press be not practically free its freedom be not real for it be not a _ common benefit _ to all : it be but a particular benefit that be a _ privilege _ taxation there forbid the use of newspaper to the poor absence of taxation enable you journal to be publish at one tenth or even one twentieth of the english price : hence several of you daily papers reach from thirty to sixty thousand reader while in england one paper alone be on this scale -- the london ` time ' which circulate thirty thousand perhaps such be the condition of you press in address you i address a whole people nor only so but a whole intelligent people the wide diffusion of intelligence among you be in fact prove by the immense circulation of you journal it be not solely the cheap price which render you press a common benefit and not a mere privilege to the richer but it be the universality of public instruction it be glorious to know that in this flourish young city alone nearly a hundred thousand child receive public education annually do you know gentleman what i consider to be you most glorious monument if it be as i have read that when you engineer draw geometrical line to guide you wander squatter in the solitude where virgin nature adore she lord they place on every thirty-sixth square of the district mark out to be a township a modest wooden pole with the glorious mark popular education this be you proudest monument in my opinion not you geographical situation not you material power not the bold enterprize spirit of you people be the chief guarantee of they future but the universality of education : for a whole people once become intelligent never can consent not to be free you will always be willing to be free and you be great and powerful enough to be as good as you will my humble prayer in my country 's cause i address to you entire nation : but you gentleman be the engineer through whom my cause must reach they it be therefore highly gratifying to I to see not isolate man but the powerful complex of the great word press grant I this important manifestation of generous sentiment i beg you to consider that whatever and wherever i speak be _ always _ speak to the press and for all the imperfection of my language let I plead for you indulgence as one of you professional colleague : for indeed such i have be yes gentleman i commence my public career as a journalist you under you happy institution know not the torment of write with hand fetter by a austrian censor to sit at the desk with a heart full of the necessity of the moment a conscience stir with righteous feeling a mind animated with conviction and principle and a whole soul warm by a patriot 's fire -- to see before you eye the scissors of the censor ready to lop you idea maim you argument murder you thought render vain you laborious day and sleepless night -- to know that the people will judge you not by what you have feel thought write but by what the censor will let you say -- to perceive that the prohibition have no rule or limit but the arbitrary pleasure of a man who be doom by profession to be a coward and a fool -- oh he little scissors suspend over one be a worse misery than the sword of damocle oh to go on day by day in such a work of sisyphus believe I be no small sacrifice of any intelligent man to fatherland and humanity and this be the present condition of the press not in hungary only but in all country curse by austrian rule indeed we recent reform give freedom of the press not to my fatherland only but indirectly to vienna prague lemberg in a word to the whole empire of austrium and this must ensure you sympathy to we contrariwise the interference of russium have crush the press on the whole european continent freedom of the press be incompatible with the preponderance of russium and with the very existence of the austrian dynasty the swear enemy of every liberal thought this must engage you generous support to sweep away those tyrant and to raise liberty where now foul oppression rule some time back there appear in certain new york papers systematic falsehood which go so far as to state that we the hungarian have struggle for oppression while it be the austrian dynasty which stand up for liberty such effrontery astonish even one who have see russian treachery we may be misrepresent scorned jeer at censured we martyr whose blood cry for revenge may be laugh at as fool hero who will command the veneration of history may be call don quixote but that among freeman and profess republican even the honor of a unfortunate nation in its most mournful suffering should not be sacred -- that be indeed a sorrowful page in human history you can not expect I to enter into a special refutation of this compound of calumny i may reserve it for my pen but inasmuch as the basis of all the calumny lie in general ignorance concern the relation of the magyar to other race of hungary permit I to speak on the question of nationality a false theory of which play so mischievous a part in the destiny of europe no word have be more misrepresent than the word nationality which be become in the hand of absolutism a dangerous instrument against liberty let I ask you gentleman : be you the people of the united state a _ nation _ or not have you a _ national _ government or not you answer yes : and yet you be not all of one blood nor of one language million of you speak english other french german italian spanish danish and even several indian dialect : yet you be a nation neither you central government nor those of separate state nor you municipality legislate or administer in every language speak among you yet you have a national government now suppose many of you be strike with the curse of babel and exclaim this union be a oppression we law we institution we state and city government be a oppression what be union to we what be rights what avail law what be freedom what be geography what be community of interest to we they be all nothing language be everything let we divide the union divide the state divide the very city divide the whole territory accord to language let the people of every language become a separate state : for every nation have a right to national life and to we the language and nothing else be the nationality unless the state be found upon language its organization be tyranny what then would become of you great union what of you constitution the glorious legacy of you greatest man what of those immortal star on mankind 's moral sky what would become of you country itself whence the spirit of freedom soar into light and rise hope irradiate the future of humanity what would become of this grand mighty complex of you republic should she integrity ever be rent by the fanatic of language where now she walk among the rise temple of liberty and happiness she soon would tread upon ruin and mourn over human hope but happy art then free nation of america found on the only solid basis -- liberty a principle steady as the world eternal as the truth universal for every climate for every time like providence tyrant be not in the midst of you to throw the apple of discord and raise hatred in this national family hatred of _ race _ that curse of humanity that venomous ally of despotism glorious it be to see the oppress of diverse country -- diverse in language history habit -- wander to these shore and become member of this great nation regenerate by the principle of common liberty if language alone make a nation then there be no great nation on earth : for there be no country whose population be count by million but speak more than one language no it be not language only community of interest of rights of duty of history but chiefly community of institution by which a population vary perhaps in tongue and race be bind together through daily intercourse in the town which be the centre and home of commerce and industry : -- besides these the very mountain-ranges the system of river and stream -- the soil the dust of which be mingle with the mortal remains of those ancestor who bleed on the same field for the same interest the common inheritance of glory and of woe the community of law and institution common freedom or common oppression : -- all this enter into the complex idea of nationality that this be instinctively feel by the common sense of the people nowhere be more manifestly show than at this very moment in my native land hungary be declare by franci joseph of austrium _ no more to exist _ as a nation no more as a state it be and be put under martial law stranger alien to we law and history as well as to we tongue rule now where we father live and we brother bleed to be a hungarian be become almost a crime in we own native land well : to justify before the world the extinction of hungary the partition of its territory and the reincorporating of the dissect limb into the common body of servitude the treacherous dynasty be anxious to show that the hungarian be in a minority in they own land they hope that intimidation and terrorism would induce even the very magyar to disavow they language and birth they order a census of race to be make they perform it with the iron rule of martial law and deal so arbitrarily that thousand of woman and man who profess to be magyar who profess not to know any other language than the magyar be notwithstanding all they protestation put down as sclave serb german or wallachian because they name have not quite a hungarian sound and still what be the issue of this malignant plot that of the twelve million of inhabitant of hungary proper the magyar turn out to be more than eight million some two million more than we know the case really be the people instinctively feel that the tyrant have the design through the pretext of language to destroy the existence of the complex nation and it meet the tyrannic plot as if it answer we be and must be a nation and if the tyrant take language only for the mark of nationality then we be all magyar and mark well gentleman this happen not under my governorship but under the rule of austrian martial law the cabinet of vienna become furious it think of a new census but prudent man tell they that a new census would give the whole twelve million as magyar thus no new census be take but on the european continent there unhappily have grow up a school which bind the idea of nationality to the idea of language only and join political pretension to it there be some who advocate the theory that exist state must cease and the territory of the world be divide anew by language and nation separate by tongue you be aware that this idea if it be not impracticable would be a curse to humanity -- a deathblow to civilization and progress and throw back mankind by century it would be a eternal source of strife and war : for there be a holy almost religious tie by which man 's heart be bind to he home and no man would ever consent to abandon he native land only because he neighbor speak another language than himself he heart claim that sacred spot where the ash of he father lie -- where he own cradle stand -- where he dream the happy dream of youth and where nature itself bear a mark of he manhood 's toil the idea be worse than the old migration of nation be nothing but despotism would rise out of such a fanatical strife of all mankind and really it be very curious nobody of the advocate of this mischievous theory be willing to yield to it for himself -- but other he desire to yield to it every frenchman become furious when he alsace be claim to germany by the right of language -- or the border of he pyrenee to spain -- but there be some amongst the very man who feel revolt at this idea who claim of germany that it should yield up large territory because one part of the inhabitant speak a different tongue and would claim from hungary to divide its territory which god himself have limit by its range of mountain and the system of stream as also by all the link of a community of more than a thousand year to cut off we right hand transylvanium and to give it up to the neighbouring wallachium to cut out like shylock one pound of we very breast -- the banat -- and the rich country between the danube and theiss -- to augment by it turkish serbium and so forth it be the new ambition of conquest but a easy conquest not by arm but by language so much i know at least that this absurd idea can not and will not be advocate by any man here in the united state which do not open its hospitable shore to humanity and greet the flock million of emigrant with the right of a citizen in order that the union may be cut to piece and even you single state divide into new-framed independent country accord to language and do you know gentleman whence this absurd theory spring up on the european continent it be the idea of panslavismus -- that be the idea that the mighty stock of sclavonic race be call to rule the world as once the roman do it be a russian plot -- it be a dark design to make out of national feeling a tool to russian preponderance over the world perhaps you be not aware of the historical origin of this plot it be after that most immortal act of tyranny the third division of poland that the chance of fate bring the prince czartorinsky to the court of catherine of russium he subsequently become minister of alexander the czar it be in this quality that with the noble aim to benefit he fall fatherland he claim from the young czar the restoration of poland suggest for equivalent the idea of russian preponderance over all nation of the old sclavonic race i believe he intention be sincere i believe he do not mean to overlook those natural border which besides the affinity of language god himself have draw between the nation but he forget that he might be no longer able to master the spirit which he would raise and that a undesired fanaticism might force sundry fantastical shape into he framework by which the frame itself must burst in piece he forget that russian preponderance can not be propitious to liberty he forget that it can not be favourable even to the development of the sclave nationality because sclavonic nation would by this idea be degrade into mere russian that be absorb by despotism russium get hold of the fanciful idea very readily may be that young alexander have in the first moment noble inclination the warm heart of youth be susceptible to noble instinct it be not common in history to find young prince so premature in tyranny as francis-joseph of austrium but a few year of power be sufficient to extinguish every spark of noble sentiment if there be one in alexander 's heart upon the throne of the romanoff the man be soon absorb by the autocrat the traditional policy of st petersburg be not a atmosphere in which the plant of regeneration can grow and the fanciful idea become soon a weapon of oppression and of russian preponderance -- russium avail herself of the idea of panslavism to break turkey down and to make a obedient satellite out of austrium turkey still withstand she but austria have fall into the snare russium send out its agent its money its venomous secret diplomacy it whisper to the sclave nation about hatred against foreign dominion -- about independence of religion connect with nationality under its own supremacy but chiefly it speak to they of panslavism under the protectorate of the czar the million of he large empire also all oppress -- all in servitude -- all a tool to he ambition they too he flatter with the idea of become ruler of the world in order that they might not think of liberty : he know that man 's breast can not maintain in ascendancy two great passion at once he give they ambition and exclude the spirit of liberty this ambition get hold of all the sclave nation through europe so panslavism become the source of a movement not of nationality but of the dominion of language that word language replace every other sentiment and so it become a curse to the development of liberty only one part of the sclavonic race see the matter clear and withstand the current of this dark russian plot these be the polish democrat -- the only one who understand that to fight for liberty be to fight for nationality therefore they fight in we rank and be willing to flock in thousand upon thousand to aid we in we struggle but we could not arm they so i would not accept they we ourselves have a hundredfold more hand ready to fight than arm -- and there be nobody in the world to supply we with arm now let I see what be the condition of hungary under these circumstance eight hundred and fifty year ago when the first king of hungary st stephen become christian himself convert the hungarian nation to christianity it be the roman catholic clergy of germany whom he invite to assist he in he pious work they do assist he but the assistance as happen with human nature be accompany by some worldly design hungary offer a wide field to the ambition of foreigner and they persuade the king to adopt a curious principle which he lay down in he last will and testament -- that it be not good for the people of a country to be but of one extraction and speak but one tongue a second rule be to adopt the language of the church -- latin -- for the language of government legislature law and all public proceedings this be the origin of that fatality that democracy do not grow up for century in hungary the public proceedings be in latin the law give in latin public instruction carry on in latin the great mass of the people who be agriculturist do not partake in any of this and the few who in the rank of the people partake in it become sever and alienate from the people 's interest this dead latin language introduce into the public life of a living nation be the most mischievous barrier against liberty the first blow to it be stricken by the reformation the protestant church introduce the national language into the divine service become a medium to the development of the spirit of liberty and so we ancient struggle for religious liberty be always connect with the maintenance of political rights but still latin public life go on down to 1780 at that time joseph of hapsburg aim at centralization replace the latin by the german tongue this rouse the national spirit of hungary and we forefather see that the dead latin language exclude the people from the public concern can not be propitious to liberty and anxious to oppose the design of the viennese cabinet to germanize hungary and _ so melt it into the common absolutism of the austrian dynasty _ -- i say anxious to oppose this design by a cheerful public life of the people itself from the year 1790 begin to pass law in the direction that by-and-by step by step the latin language should be replace in the public proceedings of the legislature and of the government by a living language familiar to the people itself and what be more natural than that be in the necessity to choose one language they choose the magyar the more so since those who speak hungarian be not only more than those who speak any one of the other language but be if not more than at least equal to all those who speak several other language together be so kind to mark well gentleman no other language be oppress -- the hungarian language be enforce upon nobody wherever another language be in use even in public life of whatever church -- whatever popular school -- whatever community -- it be not replace by the hungarian language it be only the dead latin which by-and-by become eliminate from the diplomatic public life and replace by the living hungarian in hungary in hungary i say gentleman be please to mark : never be this measure extend into the municipal life of croatium and sclavonium which though belong for 800 year to hungary still be not hungary but a race with distinct local institution the croatian and sclavonian themselves repeatedly urge we in the common parliament to afford they opportunity to learn the hungarian language that have the right they might also enjoy the benefit of be employ in the government office of we common hungary this opportunity be afford to they but nobody be force to make use of it while neither with they own municipal and public life nor with the domestic social religious life of any other people in hungary itself do the hungarian language ever interfere it replace only the latin language which no people speak and which be contrary to liberty because it exclude the million from public life willing to give freedom to the people we expel that latin tongue which be a obstacle to its future we do what every other nation in the old world have do clearing by it the way to the universal liberty you country be happy even in that respect be a young nation you do not find the latin tongue in you way when you establish this republic so you do not want a law to eject it from you public life you have a living language which be speak in you congress in you state legislature and by which you government rule it be not the native language of you whole people -- and yet no man in the union take it for a oppression that legislature and government be not carry on in every language speak in the united state and one thing i have to mention yet this replace of the latin language by the hungarian be not a work of we recent measure it be do before step by step from 1791 when we carry in 1848 we democratic reform and give political social civil and full religious freedom to the whole people we extend we care to the equal protection of every tongue and race afford to all equal right to aid out of the public fund for the moral religious and scientific development in church and in school nay we extend this even to political affair sanction the free use of every tongue in the municipality and communal corporation as well as in the administration of justice the promulgation of the law in every tongue the right to petition and to claim justice in each man 's tongue the duty of the government to answer in the same all this be grant and thus far more be do in that respect also than any other nation ever accord to the claim of tongue by far more than the united state ever do though there be no country in the world where so many different language be speak as here it be therefore the most calumnious misrepresentation to say that the hungarian struggle for the dominion of they own _ race _ no we struggle for civil political social and religious freedom common to all against austrian despotism we struggle for the great principle of _ self-government against centralization _ because centralization be absolutism and be inconsistent with constitutional rights austrium have give the very proof of it the house of austrium have never the intention to grant constitutional life to the nation of europe i will prove that on another occasion but the friend of the hapsburg say it have grant a constitution -- in march 1849 well where be that constitution now it be not only never execute but it be three month ago formally withdraw even the word ministry be blot out from the dictionary of the austrian government schwarzenberg be again house court and state chancellor as metternich be only metternich rule not with the iron rule of martial law over the whole empire of austrium as schwarzenberg do metternich _ encroach upon _ the constitutional rights of hungary transylvanium croatium and slavonium schwarzenberg have _ abolish _ they and young francis-joseph have melt all the nation together into common bondage where the promise _ equality of nationality _ be carry out most literally to be sure for they be all equally oppressed and all be equally rule by absolutist principle and by the german language and why be that illusory constitution withdraw because it be a lie from the begin a impossibility it be found on the principle of centralization it centralize thirteen different nation which have have no political history in common except to have groan under austrian rule under such circumstance to have a common life be a absurdity augment by deceit i can not exhaust this vast topic in one speech we want republican institution so found on self-government everywhere that the people themselves may be sovereign everywhere this be the cause for which i humbly request you protect aid it be the cause of oppressed europe it be the cause of germany bleeding under some thirty petty tyrant who lean on that league of despot the basis of which be petersburg it be the cause of fair but unfortunate italy which in so many respects be now dear to we heart we have a common enemy so we be brother in arm for freedom and independence i know how italy be situate and i dare confidently to declare there be no hope for italy but in that great republican party at the head of which mazzinus stand it have nothing to do with communistical scheme or the french doctrine of socialism : but it will that italy be free and republican whither else could italy look for freedom and independence if not to that party which mazzinus lead to the king of naple perhaps let I be silent about that execrated man or to the dynasty of sardinium and piedmont this profess to be constitutional yet it capture those poor hungarian soldier who seek a asylum in piedmont -- capture and deliver they to austria to be shoot : and they _ be _ shot increase the number of those 3742 martyr whom radetzky murder on the scaffold during three short year the house of savoy be become the blood-hound of austrium against fugitive hungarian gentleman the generous sympathy of public opinion here -lrb- god be bless -rrb- be strongly arouse to the wrong and suffering of hungary i look to _ you _ aid to keep that sympathy alive -- to urge the formation of society to collect fund and support a loan -- to move in favor of the proposition which i have the honor to express at the corporation banquet consider not the weakness of my address but only the strength of my cause and follow the generous impulse of you republican heart accord to it the protective aid of the free independent press then i may yet see fulfil the noble word of you chairman 's poetry : -- truth crush have to earth shall rise again the eternal year of god be hers but error wound writhe in pain and die _ among _ -lrb- let I add sir -rrb- _ with all _ she worshipper in the course of the same evening one of the toast drunk be to the political exile of europe to which michael doheny esq a irish exile first respond in a speech full of animosity against england after he mr dana make the follow speech which may be a useful comment on that of kossuth my friend who have take he seat speak in he own right as a political exile from ireland a country than which none have more deeply suffer from the woe of foreign domination i speak here by no such title and yet if any man may without presumption claim to speak in behalf of the political exile and rebel against tyranny of several nation of all nation indeed it be a american for he be not only himself the heir of a nation of rebel but he whole lineage be cosmopolitan and he may boast that he be akin to all the race of europe we have no exclusive origin thank god in the vein of we country there flow the blood of a thousand tribe just as we language be make up of a thousand idiom we hear a good deal from certain quarter about the greatness of race the practical energy of this race the artistic genius of the other and the great intellectual quality of another america disprove of all these dogma and establish in they stead the higher principle that all race be capable of a noble development under noble institution give freedom to the celt the slavon or the italian or whatever other people give they freedom and independence establish among they the great principle of _ local self-government _ and the earth do not more surely revolve in its orbit than they will in due time ripen into all the excellence and all the dignity of humanity man make and control institution but institution in they turn make man and if a people under providence be endow with institution that have give free play and healthy growth to the most useful and admirable power of man it be not for that people to boast of its race as better than other race and thank god like the pharisee that it be not as other man no it be for that people to see the cause of its good fortune in its institution and to remember that it have responsibility and that it owe a help hand to other that honestly struggle for such benefit especially be this the case with the american people make up as they be from all race and absorb yearly as they do so much of the best blood of all america have thriven and grow strong upon the misfortune of europe we toast specially refer to the political exile of europe but the truth be that all the exile of that continent be political every shipload of emigrant that seek we shore have be banish by political cause for have the institution of they country be such as to secure to they freedom and the prosperity of freedom do you think they would have forsake they home and the home of they father to seek new home beyond the ocean we owe then to europe a debt for all this population and power that it have fling upon we shore and how else can we pay it except by do what we can to help the european nation to gain they freedom and form institution under which there will be no political exile for one i go for pay that debt accord to we means and opportunity i see the other day in the street a large body of european of various nation march along with a red flag in pari or rome or vienna such a procession would have be impossible or if it could have get into the street it would have be assail by the soldiery and its member either shoot down or fling into prison yet in new york they go peacefully on they way make they demonstration in all freedom and no trouble or harm come of it very many of those man be political exile and why not because they be bad man for here in new york nothing could be more quiet and appropriate than they behavior but they prove that from whatever country there be political exile there the institution be bad i know we be in the habit of hear about red republican and socialist as man who be dangerous on account of they opinion and who have deserve to be banish from france from germany from italy i will not now say anything about those opinion but this i do say that a country where all opinion and every opinion can not be hold and freely discuss have a bad system of government and bad institution it be not the man nor they opinion that stand condemn but the government and institution therefore it be that we must sympathize with such exile without regard to they opinion and pray earnestly and labor earnestly for the elevation of all country to freedom \* \* \* \* \* ix -- on military institution -lrb- _ speech to the new york militia December 16th _ -rrb- the first division consist of four brigade be present to kossuth in the castle garden major-general sandford then proceed to address kossuth as follow : -- governor kossuth : -- it be with no ordinary feeling of gratification that i have this opportunity of address you in the name and on behalf of the citizen soldier of the city of new york with a unbounded admiration of you devotion to the great cause of constitutional liberty and of that indomitable firmness with which you have persevere under all circumstance in sustain it they be most happy to testify upon you arrival in we city they sense of you service in that cause which they be organize to sustain and now they be again assemble to greet you with a heart-felt welcome and to listen to the voice of one whom they have learn to respect to love and to venerate the body of man now present to you about five thousand in number represent the first division of new york state militia the division enrol about fifty thousand man in this city and upon staten island and the law of we state only impose upon the general body the duty of appear armed and equipped once in each year at a annual parade appoint for that purpose but out of this large number the law provide for the organization of those who be willing and desirous to acquire that degree of military science to fit they upon any sudden emergency of domestic insurrection or of foreign aggression to sustain the law and support the institution of we country they uniform and equip themselves at they own expense and they serve without pay satisfy with the consciousness that they be discharge a duty to they country and qualify themselves to sustain the honor of we flag and the freedom win by we father they represent fairly all class of we citizen we hard-working and ingenious mechanic -- we enterprising and energetic merchant -- we intelligent professional man -- we grocer butcher baker and cartman be all to be find in we rank exhibit in public spirit energy and intelligence a body of man not to be surpass even in this country of active enterprise and widely diffused intelligence it be amongst such man devote to such a service that you may feel well assure the intelligence of the noble struggle of the hungarian people for they rights and liberty be receive with the deepest feeling and the progress of you contest watch with the most earnest solicitude they exult in you victory as the triumph of freedom over oppression and despotism -- they see in you almost superhuman energy and dauntless courage the heart of a people determine to be free they rejoice that a great nation with kindred principle and institution be establish as a independent republic amidst the despotism of europe but alas all they hope and anticipation be blast such a example amidst the down-trodden subject of the arbitrary government of europe be view with alarm by they despotic ruler and the enslaved horde of the imperial russian be hurl upon the free son of hungary even with such mighty odds we should not have despair for hungary have she be afford but one year of peaceful preparation to complete she organization and develop she resource she gallant son upon she own soil and battle for they home they altar and they independence would have be unconquerable but treason and despotism combined triumph over freedom then commence a scene of horror and cruelty such as despot only and the minion of despot can perpetrate hungarian liberty may be cast down but can not be destroy the sacred flame burn unquenched in the heart of the people and will again burst forth a glorious light to enlighten the nation -- but a consuming fire to they oppressor but when and how shall this be accomplish sir we believe and feel with you that this will be accomplish whenever the free people of america unite with those kindred nation of europe which sustain and shall secure free institution will support and insist upon that great moral principle of international law which you have recently so eloquently and ably expound -- that one nation should not interfere with the domestic concern of another establish this great and just principle and hungary would again assume she station among the nation of the earth -- free and independent establish this great principle and germany and italy would also soon be free sir we believe in this great principle we believe it to be a principle of justice and humanity we believe it to be the inalienable right of every people to establish such form of government as be best adapt to they condition and as they may deem best calculate to ensure they own rights liberty and pursuit of happiness and we believe that this great principle of international law should be the basis of the intercourse of nation and that we have no more right to make free with the form of government of other nation than with they form of religion but this principle be concede and establish how be it to be enforce how be the despotic dynasty of europe to be prevent from lend they combine energy to crush every germ of freedom amongst those who if leave to themselves would like hungary be free and independent solely by the method which you have so ably develop solely by induce those nation which be strong enough to maintain the principle of international law -- to unite in they support and by such union effectually to guarantee the peace of the world to effect this most desirable object you have adopt the true method you would operate upon the public opinion and public opinion operating upon free government create and establish public and international law but when we see this great principle of non-intervention violate -- when we see a free and united people crushed and trample upon by foreign despot because they have dare to proclaim and establish equal rights and privilege as the basis of they own institution must we look tamely on and see the life-blood of freedom crush out by the iron heel of barbaric despotism and hear the death-groan of the brave and free without daring to express we feeling or to extend the hand of sympathy and comfort to the suffering son of liberty no in the name of outraged justice and humanity no we will openly warmly and freely express we sympathy in the cause of freedom and we approbation of the devotion the endurance and the gallantry of she son we will by all constitutional mode endeavor to sustain those principle which will terminate this outrage upon the sacred law of justice and humanity we will further aid this cause by contribute we share to the contribution offer by we people to enable you to advance the establishment of those principle so important to the emancipation of you beloved hungary and so essential to the preservation of civil and religious liberty and now upon this interesting occasion i hail the presence of this noble company of faithful and devoted son of hungary you companion in exile and in prison and present they to this division man who like we father pledge they sacred honor to sustain the independence of they country -lrb- here there be a outburst of cheer and colonel berczenszy and the other hungarian companion in arm of kossuth all rise and be again greet with another burst of enthusiastic cheer -rrb- we receive they as friend and brother and as martyr in the same holy cause of constitutional liberty in which we father fight and bleed and suffer and triumph and in which we trust and believe you will also live to triumph and rejoice in the bosom of you own you native land loud applause follow the conclusion of this address kossuth then rise and say -- general and gentleman -- i accept with the highest gratitude the honor to meet the first division of the new york state militia who have in they capacity of citizen soldier honor I on my arrival by they participation in the generous welcome which i meet with have also by the military honor bestow on I so much contribute to impart to this great demonstration that public character which can not fail to prove highly beneficial to the cause which i hold up before the free people of this mighty republic and which i dare confidently to state be the great question of freedom and independence to the european continent i entreat you gentleman not to expect any elaborate speech from I because really i be unprepared to make one you be citizen soldier a glorious title to which i have the ambition of aspire so i hope you will kindly excuse I if i endeavor to speak to you _ as _ soldier do you know gentleman what be the finest speech i ever hear or read it be the address of garibaldus to he roman soldier in the last war when he tell they : -- soldier what i have to offer you be fatigue danger struggle and death -- the chill of the cold night the open air and the burning sun -- no lodgings no munitions no provision -- but force march dangerous watchpost and continual struggle with bayonet against battery let those who love freedom and they country follow I that be the most glorious speech i ever hear in my life but of course that be no speech for to-day i will speak so when i again meet the soldier of hungary to fight once more the battle of freedom and independence -lrb- after various compliment to general sandford on the appearance of he soldier and the good order of the republic kossuth continue as follow : -rrb- i thank you for the explanation of the organization and discipline of this gallant division europe have many thing to learn from america it have to learn the value of free institution -- the expansive power of freedom -- the practical value of local self-government as oppose to centralization but one of the most important lesson you give to europe be in the organization of the militia of the united state you have the best organize army in the world and yet you have scarcely a standing army at all that be a necessary thing for europe to learn from america -- that great standing army must cease but they can cease only _ then _ when the nation be free for great standing army be not national institution they be the instrument of dynastic violence or foreign despotism the existence of tyranny impose on europe great standing army when the nation once become free they will not want they because they will not war with each other freedom will become a friendly link among nation but as far as they may want they you example show that a popular militia like yours be the mightiest national defense thirty-seven year ago a great battle be fight at new orlean which show what a defense you country have in its militia nay more you history prove that this institution afford the most powerful means of offensive war should war become indispensable i be aware gentleman that you war with mexico be chiefly carry on by volunteer i know what a distinguished part the volunteer of new york take in that war and who be these volunteer who be those from new york city and of other regiment they be of you militia the source of that military spirit which be the glory of you country and its safety when need in time of war or social disorder i learn all this from the united state and it be my firm intention to carry out this militia organization in hungary my idea be and still be to do so and i will endeavor with the help of god to carry it out my idea be there be duty towards one native land common to every citizen and public instruction and education must have such a direction as to enable every citizen to perform they one of these duty be to defend it in time of danger to take up arm for its freedom and independence and security my idea be to lay such a foundation for public instruction in the school that every boy in hungary shall be educate in military skill so much as be necessary for the defense of he native land and those who feel inclined to adopt the profession of arm might complete they education in higher public school and university as be the case in the profession of the bar and physic and the pulpit but i would have no distinction among the citizen to defend we country be a common duty and every one must know how to perform it take the basis of you organization as a example for hungary hungary would have at least one million of man ready to defend it against the oppression of any power whatever that the militia of hungary thus develop would be the most solid guardian of my country 's freedom and independence we have show in we past struggle the glorious deed which the unnamed hero of the people achieve prove what with previous preparation they could do in defense of they native land often they have go into battle without know how to fire or cock a musket but they take battery by they bayonet and they achieve glorious deed like those that be class among the deed of immortality we have not either wish or inclination for conquest we be content with we native land if it be independent and free for the maintenance of that independence and freedom we establish by law the institution of the national guard it be like you militia i consider the organization to be like a porcupine which move on its own road quietly but when attack or when danger approach stretch forth its thorn may god almighty grant that i may soon see develop in my native land the great institution of a national guard the power of hungary thus establish be a basis indispensable to the freedom of europe i will prove this in a few word the enemy of european freedom be russium now can hungary be a barrier to secure europe against this power of russium i answer : yes you be a nation of twenty-four million and you have a organize militia of some three million hungary be a nation of fifteen million and at least can have one million of brave citizen soldier i hope this may be regard then as a positive proof of what i say about the ability of hungary to resist the power of despotism and defend europe against russian encroachment another thing be the weakness of russium herself for she be not so strong as people generally believe it have take she whole power to put down hungary and all she can raise consist of 750000 man then you must consider that the russian territory be of immense extent and that its population be oppressed tranquillity and the order of the grave -- not the order of contentment -- be keep in russium itself only by the armed soldiery of the czar now it be not much when i say that 250000 man be indispensable to keep tranquillity in the interior of that empire 100000 man be necessary to guard its frontier extend from siberium to turkey 100000 to keep down the heroic spirit of oppressed poland take all this together and you will see that russium scarcely can at the utmost employ 300000 man in a foreign war and really it have not more engage as history will prove in the greatest struggle it make for existence -- it could not bring more into the field the million of citizen soldier would not require to be so brave as they be to be a match for those 300000 man and therefore the first result of restore independence in hungary would be -- should the czar once more have the arrogant intention to put he foot upon mankind 's neck as he blasphemously boast he have the authority of god to do -- the repression of he power by hungary not only would it be repress but hungary could assault he in a quarter where she would find powerful ally he financial embarrassment be very great for you know that even in the brief war in hungary he be necessitate to raise a loan in england we should have for we ally the oppressed people and we step would be mark by the liberation of all who be now enslave first among we ally would be the polish nation which be not restricted to the poland of the map but extend through the wide province of gallicium lithuanium & c these be proof that the might of russium be not so immense that it should intimidate a nation fighting in a just cause with hungary once free russium would never dare to threaten european liberty again but if russium be so weak as i have show she to be why you may say do i ask you support and aid against she interference because russium be only thirty hour ' distance from hungary and one of she large army stand prepare to move at any time against the liberty of we people before we could have time to develop we resource this be the motive why i ask in the name of my country the great and beneficial support of the united state to check and prevent russian interference in hungary so that we may have _ time _ to erect it into a insurmountable barrier and impregnable fortress against the despotism of the czar this i say be the reason why i claim aid from the united state and ask it to assume its rightful executive in the police of nation that be the only glory which be want to the lustre of you glorious star the militia of the united state have be the assertor of the independence and liberty of this country and the guardian of its security have now scarcely any other call and i confidently hope that be you condition you will not deny you generous support to the great principle of non-interference in the next struggle which hungary will make for freedom and independence which even now be feel in the air and be point out by the finger of god himself my _ second _ earnest wish and hope be that the people will see that they commerce with other people whether in revolution or not shall be secure it be not so much my interest as it be you right and i hope the militia of the united state will ever be ready to protect oppressed humanity my _ third _ humble claim be that this great republic shall recognize the legitimate independence of hungary the militia of this country fight and bleed for that principle upon you own soil so by the glory of you predecessor -- by all the blessing which have flow from you struggle which make you glory and happiness -- you will feel inclined to support this my humble claim for the recognition of the legitimate independence of my fatherland i thank you for the generous sympathy and for the reception and welcome of my companion the devoted son of hungary who be ready to sacrifice life and fortune to the independence of they native land there be several among they who be already soldier before we struggle and they employ they military skill in the service of they country but there be other who be not soldier yet whose patriotism lead they to embrace the cause of they native land and they prove to be brave and efficient supporter of the freedom for which they fight thank you for the sympathy you have express for they i promise you gentleman that they will prove themselves worthy of it i will point out to they the most dangerous place and i know they will acquit themselves honourably and bravely as to myself i have here a sword on my side give to I by a american citizen this be a gift from a citizen of the united state i take it as a token of encouragement to go on in that way by which with the blessing of almighty god i shall yet be enable again to see my fatherland independent and free i swear here before you that this american sword in my hand shall be always faithful in the cause of freedom -- that it shall be ever foremost in the battle -- and that it shall never be polluted by ambition or cowardice \* \* \* \* \* x -- condition essential for democracy and peace -lrb- _ reply to the address of the democrat of tammany hall new york dec 17th _ -rrb- mr sickle who make the address close by state that he contribute to the cause of hungary a golden dollar fresh from the free mine of the pacific add that he trust million would follow and that the almighty dollar if still the proverb of a money-making people would become a symbol of its noblest instinct and truest ambition kossuth in reply after warm thanks decline the personal praise bestow on he and sketch the series of event by which the austrian tyranny have convert he from insignificance into a man of importance he then proceed to comment on france -lrb- \* -rrb- as follow : -- i hope that the great french nation will soon succeed to establish a true republic but i have come to the conviction that for freedom there be no duration in centralization which be a legacy of ambitious man to be conqueror power must be centralize but to be a free nation self-government must reign in family village city county state as power now be lodge in france the government have in its hand a army of half a million of man under that iron discipline which be need in a standing army it have under its control a budget of more than a thousand million franc it can dispose of every public office in france it have a civil army of more than 500000 man : the mayor of the least village derive he appointment from the government all the police all the _ gen d'arme _ be in its hand now gentleman be it not clear that -- with such authority and force -- not to become dangerous to liberty every president need to be a washington and washington be not so thickly strew around woe to the country whose institution be such that they freedom depend on the personal character of one man be he the best man in the world he will not overcome the essential repugnance of he position to freedom when france abandon this _ centralization _ and carry out she own principle of liberty equality fraternity by _ local self-government _ she will be the great basis of european republic as to sovereignty of the people i take it that the right to cast a vote for the election of a president once in four year do not exhaust the sovereign rights of a nation a people decide about its own matter must be everywhere master of its own fate in village commune as much as in elect its chief officer -lrb- footnote \* : the news of the _ coup d'état _ have not yet reach he -rrb- you have speak about certain person who will have peace at any price of course you feel that permanent peace _ can not _ be have at any less price than that which buy justice : nor can there be justice where be no freedom under oppression be neither contentment nor tranquillity there be some who prefer be oppress to the danger of shake off oppression but i be sure there be million who fear death less than enslavement peace therefore will not exist though all you rothschild and baring help the despot to withhold material aid from the oppress will not avert the war but by deprive the leader of the means of concert will simply make the struggle more linger : a result surely not desire by friend of peace but sir i thank you for you dollar the ocean be compose of drop the greatest result be achieve not by individual but by the humble industry of mankind incessantly bring man nearer to the aim providentially destine for he not all the rothschild together can wield such sum as poor people can for the poor count by million those dollar of the people have another great value one million of they give by a million of man give hope to the popular cause : it give the sympathy and support of a million man i bless god for that word of yours that the one dollar should be follow by many for then you example would not only in a financial respect be a great benefit but afford a foundation for that freedom which the almighty design for the nation here be a great glory for you country to aim at it be glorious to stand at the top of the pyramid of humanity more glorious to become yourselve the pillar on which the welfare of human nature rest for this mankind look to you country with hope and confidence \* \* \* \* \* xi -- hungary and austrium in religious contrast -lrb- _ address in the plymouth church at brooklyn dec 18th 1851 _ -rrb- the rev h w beecher have assure kossuth of the deep and religious interest long feel and express towards he within those very wall : kossuth reply declare that he feel himself always in the power of god and believe christianity and freedom to be but one cause he go on to add : the cause of hungary be strongly connect with the principle of religious liberty on earth in the first war of the sixteenth century a battle be fight by the moslem in hungary by which the power of we nation be almost overthrow at that time the monarchy be elective a hungarian who be governor of transylvanium be choose king but another party elect ferdinand of austrium to be king of hungary a long struggle ensue in which the prince of transylvanium call in turkish aid against the house of austrium in the hour of necessity the house of austrium comply with the wish of my nation whenever my country have take up arm but no sooner be the sword lay down than this dynasty always neglect to perform its promise in the midst of the last century under marium theresa those who do not belong to the catholic faith be almost exclude from all office joseph succeed who be a tolerant man but scarcely be he in he grave when the emperor franci renew persecution and it be only in 1848 that religious liberty be establish to every creed when the house of austrium take arm against the law of 1848 they take arm against religious liberty in we parliament it be roman catholic who stand in the van of battle for religious liberty : but when i say this i must state it without draw any commentary from it it be reserve to we revolution to show the development of the glorious cause of freedom when my country impose on I the duty to govern the land i be ready to show the confidence i have in religious freedom i choose a catholic minister to be minister of education in hungary and he fully justify the confidence i repose in he he have show that we constitution be found upon equality that it regard all man as citizen and make no distinction of profession it be only under free institution that a clergyman can remain a clergyman with burn heart towards he own duty and yet when call to perform the duty of a citizen be no longer a clergyman but a citizen could the church of rome have appreciate this principle and have act upon it my friend mazzinus be not now necessary for the freedom of italy but as rome do not appreciate it the temporal power of the pope will probably fall at the next revolution my principle be that the church shall not meddle with politics and government will not meddle with religion in every society there be political and civil concern on one side and on the other social concern for the first civil authority must be establish -- in political and civil respects every one have to acknowledge the power of its jurisdiction but in respect to social interest it be quite the contrary religion be not a institution -- it be a matter of conscience for the support of these principle i ask you generous aid you know that whenever the house of austrium attain to any strength its first step be to break down religious liberty and austrium be help by russium which be even still less propitious to these principle you remember the insolence or hardship to which in russium those people be subject who do not belong to the greek church at the present time the poor jew be subject to great indignity and compel if not to shave off they hair to cut it in a particular manner so as to distinguish they from member of the greek church but hungary by the providence of god be destine to become once more the vanguard of civilization and of religious liberty for the whole of the european continent against the encroachment of russian despotism as it have already be the barrier of christianity against islamism kossuth then proceed to explain that any money contribute by the generosity of the american public would not be employ as a warlike fund for which it would be utterly insignificant but solely as a means of enable the oppress to concert they measure after this he canvass _ the three prop _ of austrium and point out the weakness of they all viz its loan -- its army -- and russia its loan run fast to a bankruptcy its army be compose of nation which hate it under the austrian government the tyrol perhaps alone have escape bombardment scaffold and jail fill with patriot the army be raise by forcible conscription and contain some hundred thousand hungarian who recently fight and conquer austrium whom austria now keep in drill to serve against she when the time come as to the third prop -- russium -- possibly for some day yet in the future it may support austrium but not in a long war : austrium can never stand in a long war i be tell -lrb- say kossuth -rrb- that some who call themselves man of peace cry out for _ peace at any price _ but be the present condition peace be the scaffold peace -- that scaffold on which in lombardy during the peaceful year the blood of 3742 patriot have be shed when the prison of austrium be fill with patriot be that peace or be the discontent of all the nation peace i do not believe that the lord create the world for _ such _ a kind of peace as that -- to be a prison -- to be a volcano boil up and ready to break out no : but with justice and liberty there will be contentment and with contentment peace -- lasting peace consistent peace : while from the tyrant of the world there be oppression and with oppression the break forth of war \* \* \* \* \* xii -- public piracy of russium -lrb- _ reply to the address of the bar of new york dec 19th 1851 _

mature by the wisdom and experience of age but which have be recognize by all eminent jurist to be found upon the define principle of christianity from that great source of law we have learn that as member of the family of mankind we duty be not bound by the territorial limit of the government which protect we nor circumscribe as to time or space we have frame a constitution of government and

distant land have not suffer be not suffer in vain government be create for the benefit of the many and not of the few a day a hour of retribution will yet come the almighty promise will not be forget -- vengeance be mine -- i will repay it saith the lord kossuth thereupon reply : -- gentleman -- highly as i value the opportunity to meet the gentleman of the bar i should have feel very much embarrassed to have to answer the address of that corporation before such a numerous and distinguished assembly have not you sir relieved my well-founded anxiety by justly anticipate and appreciate my difficulty let I hope that herein you be the interpreter of this distinguished assembly 's indulgence gentleman of the bar you have the noble task to be the first interpreter of the law to make it subservient to justice to maintain its eternal principle against encroachment and to restore those principle to life whenever they become obliterate by misunderstanding or by violence my opinion be that law must keep pace in its development with institution and intelligence and until these be perfect law be and must be with they in continual progress justice be immortal eternal and immutable like god himself and the development of law be only then a progress when it be direct towards those principle which like he be eternal and whenever prejudice or error succeed in establish in customary law any doctrine contrary to eternal justice it be one of you noblest duty gentleman -- have no write code to fetter justice within the bond of error and prejudice -- it be one of you noblest duty to apply _ principle _ -- to show that a unjust custom be a corrupt practice a abuse and by show this to originate that change or rather development in the unwritten customary law which be necessary to make it protect justice instead of oppose and violate it if this be you noble vocation in respect to the private law of you country let I entreat you gentleman to extend it to that public law which regulate the mutual duty of nation towards each other rule the destiny of humanity you know that in that eternal code of nature and of nature 's god which you forefather invoke when they raise the colony of england to the rank of a free nation there be no pettifogging subtlety but only everlasting principle : everlasting like those by which the world be rule you know that when artificial cunning of ambitious oppressor succeed to pervert those principle and when passive indifference or thoughtlessness submit to it as weakness must submit : it be the noble destiny -- let I say duty -- of enlighten nation alike powerful as free to restore those eternal principle to practical validity so that justice light and truth may sway where injustice oppression and error have prevail raise high the torch of truth cast its beam on the dark field of arbitrary prejudice become the champion of principle and you people will be the regenerator of international law it will a tempestuous life have somewhat sharpened my eye and have it even not do so still i would dare to say i know how to read you people 's heart it be conscious of you country 's power it be jealous of its own dignity it know that it be able to restore the law of nation to the principle of justice and right and know its ability its will shall not be lack let the cause of hungary become the opportunity for the restoration of true and just international law mankind be come to the eleventh hour in its destiny one hour of delay more and its fate may be seal and nothing leave to the generous inclination of you people -- so tender-hearted so noble and so kind -- but to mourn over murder nation its beloved brethren in humanity i have but to make a few remark about two objection which i be tell i shall have to contend with the first be that it be a lead principle of the united state not to interfere with european nation i may perhaps assume that you have be please to acquaint yourselve with what i have elsewhere say on that argument viz that the united state have never entertain or confess such a principle or at any rate have abandon it and have be force to do so : which indicate it to have be only a temporary policy i state the mighty difference between neutrality and non-interference so i will only briefly remark that a like difference exist between alliance and interference every independent power have the right to form alliance but be not under duty to do so : it may remain neutral if it please neither alliance nor neutrality be matter of principle but simply of policy they may hurt interest but do not violate law whereas with interference the contrary be the case interference with the sovereign right of nation to resist oppression or to alter they institution and government be a violation of the law of nation and of god : therefore non-interference be a duty common to every power and every nation and be place under the safeguard of every power of every nation he who violate that law be like a pirate : every power on earth have the duty to chase he down as a curse to human nature there be not a man in the united state but would avow that a pirate must be chase down and no man more readily than the gentleman of trade a gentleman who come yesterday to honor I with the invitation of cincinnatus that rise wonder of the west -- with eloquence which speak volume in one word designate as _ piracy _ the interference of foreign violence with the domestic concern of a nation there be such a move power in a word of truth that word have relieve I of many long speech i no longer need to discuss the principle of you foreign policy : there can be no doubt about what be lawful what be a duty against piracy you naval force be and must be instruct to put down piracy wherever they meet it on whatever geographic line whether in european or in american water you send you commodore decatur for that purpose to the mediterranean who tell the dey of algier that if he claim powder he will have it with the ball and no man in the united state imagine this to oppose you receive policy nobody then object that it be the ruling principle of the united state not to meddle with european or african concern rather if you government have neglect so to do i be sure the gentleman of trade would have be foremost to complain now in the name of all which be please to god and sacred to man if all be ready thus to unite in the outcry against a rover who at the danger of he own life board some frail ship murder some poor sailor or take a few bale of cotton -- be there no hope to see a similar universal outcry against those great pirate who board not some small cutter but the beloved home of nation who murder not some few sailor but whole people who shed blood not by drop but by torrent who rob not some hundred weight of merchandize but the freedom independence welfare and the very existence of nation oh god and father of human kind spare -- oh spare that degradation to thy child that in they destiny some bale of cotton should more weigh than those great morality alas what a pitiful sight a miserable pickpocket a drunken highway robber chase by the whole human race to the gallows : and those who pickpocket the life-sweat of nation rob they of they welfare of they liberty and murder they by thousand -- these high-handed criminal proudly raise they brow trample upon mankind and degrade its law before they high reverential name and term themselves most sacred majesty but may god be bless there be hope for human nature for there be a powerful free mighty people here on the virgin soil of america ready to protect the law of man and of heaven against the execrated pirate and they associate but again i be tell the united state as a power be not indifferent we sympathize deeply with those who be oppress we will respect the law of nation but we have no interest to make they respect by other towards other interest and always interest oh how cupidity have succeed to misrepresent the word be there any interest which could outweigh the interest of justice and of right interest but i answer by the very word of one of the most distinguished member of you profession gentleman the present honorable secretary of state : -- the united state as a nation have precisely the same interest -lrb- yes _ interest _ be he word -rrb- in international law as a private individual have in the law of he country he be a member of the bar who advance that principle of eternal justice against the mere fact of policy and now that he be in the position to carry out the principle which he have advance i confidently trust he will be as good as he word -lrb- \* -rrb- and that he honorable colleague the gentleman of the bar will remember they call to maintain the permanent principle of justice against the encroachment of accidental policy -lrb- footnote \* : see the extract from mr webster 's speech at the washington banquet -rrb- but i may be answer -- if we -lrb- the unite state -rrb- avow that we will not endure the interference of russium in hungary -lrb- for that be the practical meaning i will not deny -rrb- and if russium should not respect we declaration then we _ might _ have to go to war well i be not the man to decline the consequence of my principle i will not steal into you sympathy by evasion yes gentleman i confess _ should _ russium not respect such a declaration of you country then you be force to go to war or else be degrade before mankind but gentleman you must not shrink back from the mere _ word _ war you must consider what be the probability of its occurrence i have already state publicly my certain knowledge how vulnerable russium be how weak she be internally but the best clue to you as to what will be she future conduct if you act decisively will be gain by examine the extreme caution and timidity with which in the late event she feel she way before she interpose by force the last french revolution break out in February 1848 the czar hate republic -- name and thing but he do not interfere against the france of lamartine any more than against the france of loui philippe in 1830 why not he dare not but he resort to he natural and he most dangerous weapon _ secret diplomacy _ he send male and female intriguer to pari and succeed in turn the revolution into a mock republic but from the pulsation of the great french heart every tyrant have tremble the german nation take its destiny into its own hand and propose to itself to become one in frankfort the throne in berlin quake the austrian emperor flee from he palace a few week after he have with he own hand wave the flag of freedom out of he window in vienna a austrian parliament meet a constitution be devise for polish gallicium link by blood history and nature to the poland domineer over by the czar while on its western frontier another polish province posen be wrapt in revolutionary flame you can imagine how the czar rage how he wish to unite all mankind in one head so that he might cut it off with a single blow and still he nowhere interfere why not again i say he be prudently afraid however the french republic become very innocent to he -- almost a ally in some respects really a ally in other as in the case of unfortunate rome the gentleman of frankfort prove also to be very innocent the hope of germany fail -- the people be shoot down in vienna prague lemberg -- the austrian mock parliament be send from vienna to kremsen and from kremsen home only hungary stand firm steady victorious -- the czar have nothing more to fear from all revolutionary europe -- nothing from germany -- nothing from france he have no fear from the united state since he know that you government then be not willing to meddle with european affair : so he have free hand in hungary but one thing still he do not know and that be -- what will _ england _ and what will _ turkey _ say if he interfere -- and that consideration alone be sufficient to check he so anxious be he to feel the pulse of england and of turkey that he send first a small army -- some ten thousand man -- to help the austrian in transylvanium and send they in such a manner as to have in case of need for excuse that he be call to do so _ not by austrium only but by that part of the people also which deceive by foul delusion stand by austrium _ oh it be a infernal plot we beat down and drive out he 10000 man together with all the austrian -- but the czar have win he game he be hereby assure that he would have no foreign power to oppose he when he dare to violate the law of nation by a armed interference in hungary so he interfere with all he might it be a torture even to remember how like a dream vanish all we hope that there be yet justice on earth when i see my nation as a handful of brave man forsake to fight alone that immense battle for humanity when i see russian diplomacy steal like secret poison into we rank introduce treason into they -- but let I not look back it be all in vain the past be past _ forward _ be my word and forward i will go for i know that there be yet a god in heaven and there be a people like you on earth and there be a power of decide will here also in this bleeding heart it be my motto still that there be no difficulty to he who will but so much be a fact so much be sure that _ the czar do not dare to interfere until he be assure that he would meet no foreign power to oppose he _ show he free people of america -- show he in a manly declaration that he will meet you force if he dare once more to trample on the law of nation -- accompany this declaration with a augmentation of you mediterranean fleet and be sure he will not stir you will have no war and austrium fall almost without a battle like a house without foundation raise upon the sand hungary -- my poor hungary -- will be free and europe 's oppressed continent able to arrange its domestic concern even without my appeal to you sympathy you have the source in you own generous heart this meeting be a substantial proof of it receive my thanks i have do gentleman i be wear out i must reserve for another occasion what i would say further be i able i know that when i speak in this glorious country there be the mighty engine of the press which enable I to address the whole people let I now say that the ground on which the hope of my native land rest be the principle of justice right and law to the maintenance of these you have devote you life gentleman of the bar i leave they under you professional care and trust they will find many advocate among you \* \* \* \* \* xiii -- claim of hungary on the female sex -lrb- _ speech to the lady of new york _ -rrb- the rev dr tyng have speak in the name of the lady of new york and conclude with the word : and now sir the lady whom i have the honor to represent know you history and fully aware of its vast importance desire themselves to be the audience and to hear the voice of kossuth and the claim of hungary kossuth reply as follow : -- i would i be able to answer that call i would i be able suitably to fill the place which you kindness have assign to I you be please to say that austrium be blind to let I escape be assure that it be not the merit of austrium she would have be very glad to bury I alive but the sultan of turkey take courage and notwithstanding all the remonstrance of austrium i be free lady wear out as i be still i be very glad that the lady of new york condescend to listen to my farewell when in the midst of a busy day the watchful care of a guardian angel throw some flower of joy in the thorny way of man he gather they up with thanks : a cheerful thrill quiver through he heart like the melody of a aeolian harp but the earnest duty of life soon claim he attention and he care the melodious thrill die away and on he must go on he go joyless cheerless and cold every fiber of he heart bent to the earnest duty of the day but when the hard work of the day be do and the stress of mind for a moment subside then the heart again claim its right and the tender finger of we memory gather up again the violet of joy which the guardian angel throw in we way and we look at they with delight while we cherish they as the favorite gift of life -- we be as glad as the child on christmas eve these be the happiest moment of man 's life but when we be not noisy not eloquent we be silent almost mute like nature in a midsummer 's night repose from the burning heat of the day lady that be my condition now it be a hard day 's work which i have have to do here i be deliver my farewell address and every compassionate smile every warm grasp of the hand every token of kindness which i have receive -lrb- and i have receive so many -rrb- every flower of consolation which the lady of new york have throw on my thorny way rush with double force to my memory i feel happy in this memory -- there be a solemn tranquillity about my mind but in such a moment i would rather be silent than speak you know lady that it be not the deepest feeling which be the loudest and besides i have to say farewell to new york this be a sorrowful word what immense hope be link in my memory with its name -- hope of resurrection for my fatherland -- hope of liberation for the european continent will the expectation which the mighty outburst of new york 's heart foreshadow be realize or will the ray of consolation pass away like a electric flash oh could i cast one single glance into the book of futurity no god forgive I this impious wish it be he who hide the future from man and what he do be well do it be not good for man to know he destiny the sense of duty would falter or be unstrung if we be assure of the failure or success of we aim it be because we do not know the future that we retain we energy of duty so on will i go in my work with the full energy of my humble ability without despair but with hope it be eastern blood which run in my vein if i have somewhat of eastern fatalism it be the fatalism of a christian who trust with unwavering faith in the boundless goodness of a divine providence but among all these different feeling and thought that come upon I in the hour of my farewell one thing be almost indispensable to I and that be the assurance that the sympathy i have meet with here will not pass away like the cheer which a warble girl receive on the stage -- that it will be preserve as a principle and that when the emotion subside the calmness of reflection will but strengthen it this consolation i want and this consolation i have because lady i place it in you hand i bestow on you motherly and sisterly care the hope of europe 's oppressed nation -- the hope of civil political social and religious liberty oh let I entreat you with the brief and stammer word of a warm heart overwhelm with emotion and with sorrowful care -- let I entreat you lady to be watchful of the sympathy of you people like the mother over the cradle of she beloved child it be worthy of you watchful care because it be the cradle of regenerated humanity especially in regard to my poor fatherland i have particular claim on the fairer and better half of humanity which you be the _ first _ of these claim be that there be not perhaps on the face of the earth a nation which in its institution have show more chivalric regard for lady than the hungarian it be a praiseworthy trait of the oriental character you know that it be the moorish race in spain who be the founder of the chivalric era in europe so full of personal virtue so full of noble deed so devoted to the service of lady to heroism and to the protection of the oppress you be tell that the lady of the east be degrade to less almost than a human condition be seclude from all social life and pen up within the harem 's wall and so it be but you must not judge the east by the measure of european civilization they have they own civilization quite different from ours in view inclination affection and thought we in hungary have gain from the west the advantage of civilization for we woman but we have preserve for they the regard and reverence of we oriental character nay more than that we carry these view into we institution and into we law with we the widow remain the head of the family as the father be as long as she live she be the mistress of the property of she deceased husband the chivalrous spirit of the nation suppose she will provide with motherly care for the want of she child and she remain in possession so long as she bear she deceased husband 's name under the old constitution of hungary -lrb- which we reform upon a democratic basis -- it have be aristocratic -rrb- the widow of a lord have the right to send she representative to the parliament and in the county election of public functionary widow have a right to vote alike with the man perhaps this chivalric character of my nation so full of regard toward the fair sex may somewhat commend my mission to the lady of america we _ second _ particular claim be that the source of all the misfortune which now weigh so heavily upon my bleeding fatherland be in two lady -- catharine of russium and sophium of hapsburg the ambitious mother of this second nero francis-joseph you know that one hundred and fifty year ago charle the twelfth of sweden the bravest of the brave foresee the growth of russium and fear that it would oppress and overwhelm civilization venture with a handful of man to attack its rise power after immortal deed and almost fabulous victory one loss make he a refugee upon turkish soil like myself but happier than myself he succeed in persuade turkey of the necessity of check russium in she overweening ambition and curtail she growth on go mehemet baltadjus with he turk and meet peter the czar and pen he up in a corner where there be no possibility of escape there mehemet hold he with iron grasp till hunger come to he aid nature claim she rights and in a council of war it be decide to surrender to mehemet then catharine who be present in the camp appear in person before the grand vizier to sue for mercy she be fair and she be rich with jewel of nameless value she go to the grand vizier 's tent she come back without she jewel but she bring mercy and russium be save from that celebrated day date the downfall of turkey and the growth of russium out of this source flow the stream of russian preponderance over the european continent the depression of liberty and the nameless suffering of poland and of my poor native land be the dreadful fruit of catharine 's success on that day curse in the record of the human race the second lady who will be curse through all posterity in she memory be sophium the mother of the present usurper of hungary -- she who have the ambitious dream to raise the power of a child upon the ruin of liberty and on the neck of prostrate nation it be she ambition -- the evil genius of the house of hapsburg in the present day -- which bring desolation upon we i need only mention one fact to characterize what kind of a heart be in that woman on the anniversary of the day of arad where we martyr bleed she come to the court with a bracelet of ruby set in so many rose as be the number of head of the brave hungarian who fall there declare that she joyfully exhibit it to the company as a memento which she wear on she very arm to cherish in eternal memory the pleasure she derive from the killing of those hero at arad this very fact may give you a true knowledge of the character of that woman and this be the _ second _ claim to the lady ' sympathy for oppressed humanity and for my poor fatherland we _ third _ particular claim be the behavior of we lady during the last war it be no arbitrary praise -- it be a fact -- that in the struggle for we rights and freedom we have no more powerful auxiliary and no more faithful executor of the will of the nation than the woman of hungary you know that in ancient rome after the battle of cannae which be win by hannibal the senate call on the people spontaneously to sacrifice all they wealth on the altar of they fatherland every jewel every ornament be bring forth but still the tribune judge it necessary to pass a law prohibit the lady of rome to wear more than half a ounce of gold or particoloured splendid dress now we want in hungary no such law the woman of hungary bring all that they have you would have be astonish to see how in the most wealthy house of hungary if you be invite to dinner you would be force to eat soup with iron spoon when the wound and the sick -- and many of they we have because we fight hard -- when the wound and the sick be not so well provide as it would have be we duty and we pleasure to do i order the respective public functionary to take care of they but the poor wounded go on suffering and the proper officer be but slow in provide for they when i see this one single word be speak to the lady of hungary and in a short time there be provision make for hundred of thousand of sick and i never meet a single mother who would have withhold she son from share in the battle but i have meet many who order and command they child to fight for they fatherland i see many and many bride who urge on the bridegroom to delay they day of happiness till they should come back victorious from the battle of they fatherland thus act the lady of hungary a country deserve to live a country deserve to have a future when the woman as much as the man love and cherish it but i have a stronger motive than all these to claim you protect sympathy for my country 's cause it be she nameless woe nameless suffering in the name of that ocean of bloody tear which the impious hand of the tyrant wring from the eye of the childless mother of the bride who behold the executioner 's sword between they and they wedding day -- in the name of all these mother wife bride daughter and sister who by thousand of thousand weep over the grave of magyar so dear to they heart -- who weep the bloody tear of a patriot -lrb- as they all be -rrb- over the face of they beloved native land -- in the name of all those torture stripe with which the flog hand of austrian tyrant dare to outrage human nature in the womankind of my native land -- in the name of that daily curse against austrium with which even the prayer of we woman be mixed -- in the name of the nameless suffering of my own dear wife -lrb- here the whole audience rise and cheer vehemently -rrb- -- the faithful companion of my life -- of she who for month and for month be hunt by my country 's tyrant with no hope no support no protection but at the humble threshold of the hard-working people as noble and generous as they be poor -- in the name of my poor little child who when so young as to be scarcely conscious of life have already to learn what a austrian prison be -- in the name of all this and what be still worse in the name of liberty trodden down i claim lady of new york you protect sympathy for my country 's cause nobody can do more for it than you the heart of man be as soft wax in you tender hand mould it lady mould it into the form of generous compassion for my country 's wrong inspire it with the noble feeling of you own heart inspire it with the consciousness of you country 's power dignity and might you be the framer of man 's character whatever be the fate of man one stamp he always bear on he brow -- that which the mother 's hand impressed upon the soul of the child the smile of you lip can make a hero out of the coward and a generous man out of the egotist one word from you inspire the youth to noble resolution the lustre of you eye be the fairest reward for the toil of life you can kindle energy even in the breast of broken age that once more it may blaze up in a noble generous deed before it die all this power you have use it lady in behalf of you country 's glory and for the benefit of oppressed humanity and when you meet a cold calculator who think by arithmetic when he be call to feel the wrong of oppressed nation convert he lady you smile be command and the truth which pour forth instinctively from you heart be mightier than the logic articulate by any scholar the perus exclude from paradise bring many generous gift to heaven in order to regain it she bring the die sigh of a patriot the kiss of a faithful girl imprint upon the lip of she bridegroom when they be distort by the venom of the plague she bring many other fair gift but the door of paradise open before she only when she bring with she the first prayer of a man convert to charity and brotherly love for he oppressed brethren and humanity remember the power which you have and which i have endeavor to point out in a few brief word remember this and form association establish lady ' committee to raise substantial aid for hungary now i have do one word only remain to be said-a word of deep sorrow the word farewell new york new york that word will for ever make every string of my heart thrill i be like a wander bird i be worse than a wander bird he may return to he summer home i have no home on earth here i feel almost at home but forward be my call and i must part i part with the hope that the sympathy which i have meet here in a short transitory home will bring I yet back to my own beloved home so that my ash may yet mix with the dust of my native soil lady remember hungary and -- farewell \* \* \* \* \* xiv -- result of the overthrow of the french republic -lrb- _ speech at the citizen ' banquet philadelphium dec 26th _ -rrb- mr dalla the chairman make a eloquent address advocate the cause of hungary against russium and avow the duty of america to give warlike aid this speech be the more remarkable as come immediately after the arrival of the news of loui napoleon 's usurpation the mind of the public be naturally so full of the event that kossuth could not avoid to discuss it but the topic be so threadbare to the reader that it will suffice here to preserve a few sentiment in the opening kossuth complain of forge letter and forge cheque send to annoy he and anonymous letter of false accusation circulate against he proceed from this to public topic and the certainty of a new convulsion in europe he say that it might prove in the future highly dangerous to the moneyed interest if the world be persuade that the holder of great disposable wealth use it to aid despotism and that the possession of it check the generous propensity to forward the triumph of freedom if the world be confirm in this persuasion the result will be painfully feel by those gentleman whose treasure be always open for the despot to crush liberty with such moneylender have excite boundless hatred in all that section of europe which have have to suffer from they ready financial aid to despotism i -lrb- say kossuth -rrb- be no socialist no communist and if i get the means to act efficiently i shall so act that the inevitable revolution may not subvert the rights of property : but so much i confidently declare -- that to the spreading of communist doctrine in certain quarter of europe nobody have so much contribute as those european capitalist who by incessantly aid the despot with they money have inspire many of the oppress with the belief that financial wealth be dangerous to the freedom of the world rothschild be the most efficient apostle of communism in regard to loui bonaparte 's temporary success kossuth argue that it would secure when france make she next move for freedom two result beneficial to liberty : first that in future the french republican would abandon they delusive and disastrous centralization we have show -lrb- say he -rrb- in hungary that for a nation to be invincible its life must not be bind up with its metropolis henceforward in european aspiration centralization be replace by federative harmony i thank loui napoleon for it _ you _ principle of local self-government gentleman be hitherto profess on the continent of europe chiefly by we hungarian : now they will conquer the world -- a new victory for humanity have the old french republic stand it would have perpetuate the curse of _ great standing army _ which be instrument of ambition and a waste pestilence again the blow strike by loui napoleon have force he nation into the common destiny of europe it have forbid france ever in future to play a separate game and think to keep she own liberty without effectively espouse the cause of foreign liberty what be the sum of all this first that there be nothing in the news from france to alter any judgment which you might previously have form or cause you any suspense secondly it only more than ever claim from you a immediately decisive conduct the success of freedom now depend entirely on what policy the united state of america will adopt well gentleman it may be that the united state have no reply to the hope of the world you will then see a mournful tear in the eye of humanity and its breast heave with sigh we presume you be so powerful that you can afford not to care about the tread down of the law of nation and the funeral of european freedom you be so glorious at home that you can afford to lose the glory -lrb- at so rare a crisis -rrb- of save liberty and justice on earth yet in you own hour of trial you ask and receive military and naval aid from france you president have inform the world that you be not willing to allow the strong arm of a foreign power to suppress the spirit of freedom in any country if after this you tell I that you be _ afraid _ of russium and be _ too weak _ to help we -- and would rather be on good term with the czar than rejoice in the liberty and independence of hungary italy germany france -- dreadful as it would be i would wipe away my tear and say to my brethren let we pray and let we go to the lord 's last supper and thence to battle and to death i would then leave you gentleman with a die farewell and with a prayer that the sun of freedom may never drop below the horizon of you happy land i be in philadelphium the city of brotherly love the city of

i be already grateful during my stay in new york to receive the expression of you sentiment and you generous resolution they become the more beneficial to I because i be on my way and very near to washington city where the elect of you national confidence stand in they proud position as conservator of those lofty interest which bind you thirty-one star of sovereign state into one mighty constellation of freedom power and right where the congress and government of this vast republic watch over the common weal of you united country and hereby make you a power on earth a fullgrown member of that great family of nation which have one father in heaven be brethren and should act as brethren among the interest intrust by you to the congress and government you _ foreign policy _ be nearly the most important this in a great and powerful nation can have no other basis than eternal law and christian morality even you peculiar interest be in my belief best serve when you foreign policy rest not on transitory consideration but on everlasting principle even in private life no man can entirely cut himself off from other a man willing to attempt it would be a exile in he own country a exile in he own city a exile in he family just so with nation which in the larger family of man be individual member if a nation seclude itself it be a exile in the midst of humanity no man lady and gentleman be independent of he fellow-man no nation however powerful be independent of other nation put the richest the strongest man for a single week wholly apart from family city country and he will quickly learn he essential weakness in a nation the consequence of total isolation be not feel as soon but it will at length be feel as surely the _ hour _ of nation be count by _ year _ yet the secluded nation self-exile from mankind dwindle away woe to the people whose citizen care only for they own present and not for the future of they country the future in which they have to live immortally by child and child 's child with whose glory and happiness and power they ought now to sympathize man or nation seclude be like the silk-worm which secrete itself in a self-woven case and at length creep out to die so will it at length be with the nation which be wrap up in self it be one of you glory that some portion of you unite republic be farther from other portion than hungary be from baltimore : mere distance be therefore no reason why you should be unconcerned about we fate you be not too far for commercial intercourse with the most distant coast of europe and especially since the invention of one of you citizen have be bring to higher perfection the ocean rather unite you to we than separate you would you have the _ advantage _ of the connection without the _ duty _ which spring out of it disregard of duty sooner or later kill advantage i need not remind you what a link of nature blood language science industry religion civilization exist between you and we and bind we ever tighter you can not help feeling at home we condition in europe we peace or war we civilization or barbarism we freedom or oppression we wealth or starvation progress or retrogression _ must _ act upon you just as you condition react upon we the link between the destiny of christendom can not be cut asunder in fact there never yet be a time when europe more demand that you should have _ some _ policy towards it and indifference be none at all at this moment it be under universal oppression of _ social political _ and _ religious _ liberty -- the three treasure which make you glory and happiness this oppression be order by russium and execute by she satellite the elect president of france have impiously stab the constitution to make himself emperor the austrian ministry have openly declare that the absolutist power will maintain he thus the impulse of revolution have be give its vibration will be feel throughout europe and in my fatherland never will you have a opportunity more glorious for you and more favourable to mankind for adopt a real policy found upon principle the people of hungary have abundant motive to risk life for freedom and independence once we have a nationality now we have none once we have a constitution -- by the blessing of god we succeed to transform it three year ago from a aristocratic to a democratic one -- now hungary have no constitution at all for a thousand year we be a free people we be now so no longer like a flock of sheep we be appropriate not by the austrian empire not by the nation but by a despotic ambitious family we have freedom of the press not nineteen year ago i begin the struggle and endure three year imprisonment for it but we win that great right of mankind -- free expression of think now there be no press at all in hungary there be only the hangman and martial law we establish equal protection for every religion now there be equal oppression for all the protestant church have its own self-government for its church and school win by victorious arm and secure by a hundred law now the law be tear down and the freedom of church and school be go the catholic church have control of its own estate now day by day the nearly bankrupt austrian government be overgrow that property by the poisonous weed of a new loan on which it vegetate a curse to every nation on the continent such be the condition of the catholic church concern which i -- a protestant not only by birth but also by conviction -- declare that during a whole lifetime when hungary be struggle for religious liberty that church contend in the foremost rank for the rights of we protestant so much do we value the freedom of conscience that the very think be repugnant to we all that there should be unequal rights of citizenship between protestant and catholic and professor of the faith of mose zeal for religious freedom will kindle magyar to struggle as long as there be blood in we vein as during three century so the late war be for religious independence as well as civil indeed still earlier we be the barrier of christendom against the invade mahommedan we succeed lately in free the agriculture of hungary and transform peasant into freeholder now the austrian dynasty be stealthily bring back feudal rights in free the peasant we provide for indemnification of landlord austria tax the peasant very heavily and do not -lrb- for she can not -rrb- indemnify the landlord because she violence and wastefulness do not know how to turn we public estate to account she favor a few landlord only who be faithful tool of she oppression during we struggle we issue paper-money -- it be call the kossuth-bank-note austrium disavow it and command its surrender yet twenty million be firmly hold by the people as valuable after a new revolution before we fall under the stroke of russian interference the taxation permit by we parliament be only four and a half million of dollar austria now impose sixty we people burn they tobacco-seed and cut down they vine rather than endure she tax such be the motive which austria give to hungary _ not _ to make a new revolution there be not a single interest which she have not mortally wound the mind the heart dignity conscience self-esteem hatred love revenge besides every material interest of every class be engage to the struggle the oppression of hungary have ratify the oppression of all we continent since she have fall italy have be completely crush the moderate freedom of germany have be put down by austrium with the support of russium lastly the usurpation of loui napoleon have be make possible without the restoration of hungary europe can not be free from russian thraldom under which nationality be erase no freedom be possible all religion be subject to like slavery gentleman the emperor napoleon speak a prophetic word when he say that in fifty year all europe would be either republican or cossack hungary once free europe be republican hungary permanently crush all europe be cossack and what do hungary _ need _ for freedom not that other nation should fight we proper battle against we immediate oppressor we have heart loving freedom and ready to shed they blood for it we have army fully equal to austria we want only fair play let the united state feel itself to be as it be a power on earth bind to aid in the police of the nation and in the name of violate right let it say to the russian intruder keep back hand off let the brave magyar fight they own battle _ else _ we must take they part for century perhaps you will have no more glorious opportunity than now hitherto the word glory have be connect with conquest and oppression take the new glory for yours by assure to all nation exemption from the conspiracy of tyrant that be what i _ first _ humbly request and hope -lrb- kossuth proceed as in former speech to explain he other request viz _ secondly _ free commerce with america whether hungary be in war with

that they will be sovereign of the earth here sit man whose glory be to acknowledge the law of nature and of nature 's god and to do what they sovereign the people will sir there be history in these contrast history of past age and history of future century may be often record in small fact the particulars to which the passion of live man cling as if human finger could arrest the wheel of destiny these particulars die away it be the issue which make history and that issue be always coherent with its cause there be a necessity of consequence wherever the necessity of position exist principle be the _ alpha _ : they must finish with _ omega _ and they will thus history may be often tell in a few word before the heroic struggle of greece have yet engage you country 's sympathy for the fate of freedom in europe then so far distant and now so near chateaubriand happen to be in athen and he hear from a _ minaret _ raise upon the propylaeum 's ruin a turkish priest in the arabic language

there be equally a history of future age write in the honor bestow by you on my humble self the first governor of independent hungary drive from he native land by russian violence a exile on turkish soil protect by a mahommedan sultan from the blood-thirst of christian tyrant cast back a prisoner to far asia by diplomacy be at length rescue from he asiatic prison when america cross the atlantic charge with the hope of europe 's oppressed nation he plead as a poor exile before the people of this great republic he country 's wrong and its intimate connection with the fate of the european continent and in the boldness of a just cause claim that the principle of the christian religion be raise to a law of nation to see that not only be the boldness of the poor exile forgive but that he be console by the sympathy of million encourage by individual association meeting city and state support by effective aid and greet by congress and by government as the nation 's guest honor out of generosity with that honor which only one man before he receive -lrb- a man who have deserve they from you gratitude -rrb- with honor such as no potentate ever can receive and this banquet here and the toast which i have to thank you for : oh indeed sir there be a history of future age in all these fact they will go down to posterity as the proper consequence of great principle sir though i have a noble pride in my principle and the inspiration of a just cause still i have also the consciousness of my personal insignificance never will i forget what be due from I to the _ sovereign source _ of my public capacity this i owe to my nation 's dignity and therefore respectfully thank this highly distinguish assembly in my country 's name i have the boldness to say that hungary well deserve you sympathy that hungary have a claim to protection because it have a claim to justice but as to myself i be well aware that in all these honor i have no personal share nay i know that even that which might seem to be personal in you toast be only a acknowledgment of a historical fact very instructively connect with a principle valuable and dear to every republican heart in the united state of america as to ambition i indeed never be able to understand how anybody can love ambition more than liberty but i be glad to state a historical fact as a principal demonstration of that influence which institution exercise upon the character of nation we hungarian be very fond of the principle of municipal self-government and we have a natural horror against centralization that fond attachment to municipal self-government without which there be no provincial freedom possible be a fundamental feature of we national character we bring it with we from far asia a thousand year ago and we preserve it throughout the vicissitude of ten century no nation have perhaps so much struggle and suffer for the civilized christian world as we we do not complain of this lot it may be heavy but it be not inglorious where the cradle of we savior stand and where he divine doctrine be found there now another faith rule : the whole of europe 's armed pilgrimage could not avert this fate from that sacred spot nor stop the rush wave of islamism from absorb the christian empire of constantine _ we _ stop those rush wave the breast of my nation prove a breakwater to they we guard christendom that luther and calvin might reform it it be a dangerous time and its danger often place the confidence of all my nation into one man 's hand but there be not a single instance in we history where a man honor by he people 's confidence deceive they for he own ambition the man out of whom russian diplomacy succeed in make a murderer of he nation 's hope gain some victory when victory be the chief necessity of the moment and at the head of a army circumstance give he the ability to ruin he country but he never have the people 's confidence so even he be no contradiction to the historical truth that no hungarian whom he nation honor with its confidence be ever seduce by ambition to become dangerous to he country 's liberty that be a remarkable fact and yet it be not accidental it spring from the proper influence of institution upon the national character we nation through all its history be educate in the school of local self-government and in such a country grasp ambition have no field have no place in man 's character the truth of this doctrine become yet more illustrate by a quite contrary historical fact in france whatever have be the change of government in that great country -- and many they have be to be sure -- we have see a convention a directorate consul and one consul and a emperor and the restoration and the citizen king and the republic through all these different experiment centralization be the keynote of the institution of france -- power always centralize omnipotence always vested somewhere and remarkable indeed france have never yet raise one single man to the seat of power who have not sacrifice he country 's freedom to he personal ambition it be sorrowful indeed but it be natural it be in the garden of centralization that the venomous plant of ambition thrive i dare confidently affirm that in you great country there exist not a single man through whose brain have ever pass the thought that he would wish to raise the seat of he ambition upon the ruin of you country 's liberty if he could such a wish be impossible in the united state institution react upon the character of nation he who sow wind will reap storm history be the revelation of providence the almighty rule by eternal law not only the material but also the moral world and as every law be a principle so every principle be a law man as well as nation be endow with free-will to choose a principle but that once choose the consequence must be accept with self-government be freedom and with freedom be justice and patriotism with centralization be ambition and with ambition dwell despotism happy you great country sir for be so warmly attach to that great principle of self-government upon this foundation you father raise a home to freedom more glorious than the world have ever see upon this foundation you have develop it to a living wonder of the world happy you great country sir that it be select by the blessing of the lord to prove the glorious practicability of a federative union of many sovereign state all preserve they state-rights and they self-government and yet unite in one -- every star beam with its own lustre but altogether one constellation on mankind 's canopy upon this foundation you free country have grow to prodigious power in a surprizingly brief period a power which attract by its fundamental principle you have conquer by it more in seventy-five year than rome by arm in century you principle will conquer the world by the glorious example of you freedom welfare and security mankind be about to become conscious of its aim the lesson you give to humanity will not be lose the respect for state-rights in the federal government of america and in its several state will become a instructive example for universal toleration forbearance and justice to the future state and republic of europe upon this basis those mischievous question of language-nationality will be get rid of which cunning despotism have raise in europe to murder liberty smaller state will find security in the principle of federative union while they will preserve they national freedom by the principle of sovereign self-government and while larger state abdicate the principle of centralization will cease to be a blood-field to unscrupulous usurpation and a tool to the ambition of wicked man municipal institution will ensure the development of local element freedom formerly a abstract political theory will be bring to every municipal hearth and out of the welfare and contentment of all part will flow happiness peace and security for the whole that be my confident hope then will the fluctuation of germany 's fate at once subside it will become the heart of europe not by melting north germany into a southern frame or the south into a northern not by absorb historical peculiarity into a centralized omnipotence not by mix all in one state but by federate several sovereign state into a union like yours upon a similar basis will take place the national regeneration of sclavonic state and not upon the sacrilegious idea of panslavism which mean the omnipotence of the czar upon a similar basis shall we see fair italy independent and free not unity but _ union _ will and must become the watchword of national member hitherto tear rudely asunder by provincial rivalry out of which a crowd of despot and common servitude arise in truth it will be a noble joy to you great republic to feel that the moral influence of you glorious example have work this happy development in mankind 's destiny nor have i the slightest doubt of the efficacy of that example but there be one thing indispensable to it without which there be no hope for this happy issue it be that the oppressed nation of europe become the master of they future free to regulate they own domestic concern and to this nothing be wanted but to have that fair play to all _ for _ all which you sir in you toast be please to pronounce as a right of my nation alike sanction by the law of nation as by the dictate of eternal justice without this fair play there be no hope for europe -- no hope of see you principle spread yours be a happy country gentleman you have more than fair play you have active and effectual aid from europe in you struggle for independence which once achieve you use so wisely as to become a prodigy of freedom and welfare and a lesson of life to nation but we in europe -- we unhappily have no such fair play with we against every pulsation of liberty all despot be unite in a common league and you may be sure that despot will never yield to the moral influence of you great example they hate the very existence of this example it be the sorrow of they thought and the incubus of they dream to stop its moral influence abroad and to check its spread at home be what they wish instead of yield to its influence we shall have no fair play the cossack already rule by loui napoleon 's usurpation to the very border of the atlantic ocean one of you great statesman -- now to my deep sorrow bind to the sick bed of far advance age -lrb- \* -rrb- -- -lrb- alas that i be deprive of the advice which he wisdom could have impart to I -rrb- -- you great statesman tell the world thirty year ago that pari be transfer to st petersburg what would he now say when st petersburg be transfer to pari and europe be but a appendage to russium -lrb- footnote \* : henry clay since decease -rrb- alas europe can no longer secure to europe fair play england only remain but even england cast a sorrowful glance over the wave still we will stand we ground sink or swim live or die you know the word it be you own we will follow it it will be a bloody path to tread despot have conspire against the world terror spread over europe and persecute by way of anticipation from pari to pesth there be a gloomy silence like the silence of nature before the terror of a hurricane it be a sensible silence disturb only by the thousandfold rattle of musket by which napoleon prepare to crush the people who give he a home when he be a exile and by the groan of new martyr in sicily milan vienna and pesth the very sympathy which i meet in england and be expect to meet here throw my sister into the dungeon of austrium well god 's will be do the heart may break but duty will be do we will stand we place though to we in europe there be no fair play but so much i hope that no just man on earth can charge I with unbecome arrogance when here on this soil of freedom i kneel down and raise my prayer to god : almighty father of humanity will thy merciful arm not raise up a power on earth to protect the law of nation when there be so many to violate it it be a prayer and nothing else what would remain to the oppress if they be not even permit to pray the rest be in the hand of god sir i most fervently thank you for the acknowledgment that my country have prove worthy to be free yes gentleman i feel proud at my nation 's character heroism love of freedom and vitality and i bow with reverential awe before the decree of providence which have place my country into a position such that without its restoration to independence there be no possibility for freedom and independence of nation on the european continent even what now in france be come to pass prove the truth of this every disappointed hope with which europe look towards france be a degree more add to the importance of hungary to the world upon we plain be fight the decisive battle for christendom _ there _ will be fight the decisive battle for the independence of nation for state rights for international law and for democratic liberty we will live free or die like man but should my people be doom to die it will be the first whose death will not be record as suicide but as a martyrdom for the world and future age will mourn over the sad fate of the magyar race doom to perish not because we deserve it but because in the nineteenth century there be nobody to protect the law of nature and of nature 's god but i look to the future with confidence and with hope manifold adversity could not fail to impress some mark of sorrow upon my heart which be at least a guard against sanguine illusion but i have a steady faith in principle once in my life indeed i be deplorably deceive in my anticipation from suppose principle to exist in quarter where it do not i do not count on generosity or chivalrous goodness from the government of england and france but i give they credit for selfish and instinctive prudence i suppose they to value parliamentary government and to have foresight enough to know the alarming danger to which they would be expose if they allow the armed interference of russium to overturn historical limited representative institution but france and england both prove to be blind and deceive I it be a horrible mistake and have issue in a horrible result the present condition of europe which ought to have be foresee by those government exculpate I for have err through expect they to see they own interest well there be a providence in every fact without this mistake the principle of american republicanism would for a long time yet not have find a fertile soil on that continent where it be consider wisdom to belong to the french school now matter stand thus : that either the continent of europe have no future at all or this future be american republicanism and who can believe that two hundred million of that continent which be the mother of such a civilization be not to have any future at all such a doubt would be almost blasphemy against providence but there be a providence indeed -- a just a bountiful providence and in it i trust with all the piety of my religion i dare to say my very self be a instrument of it even my be here when four month ago i be yet a prisoner of the league of european despot in far asia and the sympathy which you glorious people honor I with and the high benefit of the welcome of you congress and the honor to be you guest to be the guest of you great republic -- i a poor exile -- be there not a very intelligible manifestation of providence in it -- the more when i remember that the name of you guest be by the furious rage of the austrian tyrant nail to the gallows i confidently trust that the nation of europe have a future i be aware that this future be vehemently resist by the bayonet of absolutism but i know that though bayonet may give a defense they afford no seat to a prince i trust in the future of my native land because i know that it be worthy to have one and that it be necessary to the destiny of humanity i trust to the principle of republicanism and whatever may be my personal fate so much i know that my country will preserve to you and you glorious land a everlasting gratitude a toast in honor of mr webster the secretary of state have then be propose that gentleman respond in a ample speech of which the follow be a extract : -- gentleman i do not propose at this hour of the night to entertain you by any general disquisition upon the value of human freedom upon the inalienable rights of man or upon any general topic of that kind but i wish to say a few word upon the precise question as i understand it that exist before the civilized world between hungary and the austrian government and i may arrange the thought to which i desire to give utterance under two or three general head and in the first place i say that wherever there be in the christian and civilized world a nationality of character -- wherever there exist a nation of sufficient knowledge and wealth and population to constitute a government then a national government be a necessary and proper result of nationality of character we may talk of it as we please but there be nothing that satisfy the human be in a enlighten age unless he be govern by he own countryman and the institution of he own government no matter how easy be the yoke of a foreign power no matter how lightly it sit upon the shoulder if it be not impose by the voice of he own nation and of he own country he will not he can not and he _ mean _ not to be happy under its burden there be not a civilized and intelligent man on earth that enjoy entire satisfaction in he condition if he do not live under the government of he own nation -- he own country whose volition and sentiment and sympathy be like he own hence he can not say this be not my country it be the country of another power it be a country belong to somebody else therefore i say that whenever there be a nation of sufficient intelligence and number and wealth to maintain a government distinguish in its character and its history and its institution that nation can not be happy but under a government of its own choice then sir the next question be whether hungary as she exist in we idea as we see she and as we know she be distinct in she nationality be competent in she population be also competent in she knowledge and devotion to correct sentiment be competent in she national capacity for liberty and independence to obtain a government that shall be hungarian out and out upon that subject gentleman i have no manner of doubt let we look a little at the position in which this matter stand what be hungary hungary be about the size of great britain and comprehend nearly half of the territory of austrium -lrb- accord to one authority its population be 14 million and a half -rrb- it be state by another authority that the population of hungary be _ nearly _ 14000000 that of england -lrb- in 1841 -rrb- nearly 15000000 that of prussium about 16000000 thus it be evident that in point of power so far as power depend upon population hungary possess as much power as england _ proper _ or even as the kingdom of prussium well then there be population enough -- there be people enough who then be they they be distinct from the nation that surround they they be distinct from the austrian on the west and the turk on the east and i will say in the next place that they be a _ enlighten _ nation they have they history they have they tradition they be attach to they own institution -- institution which have exist for more than a thousand year gentleman it be remarkable that on the western coast of europe political light exist there be a sun in the political firmament and that sun shed he light on those who be able to enjoy it but in eastern europe generally speak and on the confines between eastern europe and asia there be no political sun in the heaven it be all a arctic zone of political life the luminary that enlighten the world in general seldom rise there above the horizon the light which they possess be at best crepuscular a kind of twilight and they be under the necessity of grope about to catch as they may any stray gleam of the light of day gentleman the country of which you guest to-night be a native be a remarkable exception she have show through she whole history for many hundred of year a attachment to the principle of civil liberty and of law and order and obedience to the constitution which the will of the great majority have establish that be the fact and it ought to be know wherever the question of the practicability of hungarian liberty and independence be discuss it ought to be know that hungary stand out from it above she neighbor in all that respect free institution constitutional government and a hereditary love of liberty gentleman my sentiment in regard to this effort make by hungary be here sufficiently well express in a memorial address to lord john russell and lord palmerston say to have be write by lord fitzwilliam and sign by he and several other peer and member of parliament the follow language be use the object of the memorial be to ask the mediation of england in favor of hungary while so many of the nation of europe have engage in revolutionary movement and have embark in scheme of doubtful policy and still more doubtful success it be gratify to the undersign to be able to assure you lordship that the hungarian demand nothing but the recognition of ancient rights and the stability and integrity of they ancient constitution to you lordship it can not be unknown that that constitution bear a striking family-resemblance to that of we own country gentleman i have say that a national government where there be a distinct nationality be essential to human happiness i have say that in my opinion hungary be thus capable of human happiness i have say that she possess that distinct nationality that power of population and that of wealth which entitle she to have a government of she own and i have now to add what i be sure will not sound well upon the upper danube and that be that in my humble judgment the imposition of a foreign yoke upon a people capable of self-government while it oppress and depress that people add nothing to the strength of those who impose that yoke in my opinion austrium would be a better and a stronger government to-morrow if she confine the limit of she power to hereditary and german dominion especially if she see in hungary a strong sensible independent neighbouring nation because i think that the cost of keep hungary quiet be not repay by any benefit derive from hungarian levy or tribute and then again good neighborhood and the goodwill and generous sympathy of mankind and the generosity of character that ought to pervade the mind of government as well as those of individual be vastly more promote by live in a state of friendship and amity with those who differ from we in mode of government than by any attempt to consolidate power in the hand of one over all the rest gentleman the progress of thing be unquestionably onward it be onward with respect to hungary it be onward everywhere public opinion in my estimation at least be make great progress it will penetrate all resource it will come more or less to animate all mind and in respect to that country for which we sympathy to-night have be so strongly invoke i can not but say that i think the people of hungary be a enlighten industrious sober well-inclined community and i wish only to add that i do not now enter into any discussion of the form of government which may be proper for hungary of course all of you like myself would be glad to see she when she become independent embrace that system of government which be most acceptable to ourselves we shall rejoice to see we american model upon the lower danube and on the mountain of hungary but that be not the first step it be not that which will be we first prayer for hungary the first prayer shall be that hungary may become independent of all foreign power that she destiny may be entrust to she own hand and to she own discretion i do not profess to understand the social relation and connection of race and of twenty other thing that may affect the public institution of hungary all i say be that hungary can regulate these matter for herself infinitely better than they can be regulate for she by austrium and therefore i limit my aspiration for hungary for the present to that single and simple point hungarian independence : -- hungarian independence hungarian control of she own destiny and hungary as a distinct nationality among the nation of europe the toast be receive with enthusiastic applause the president then announce the next toast -- the rights of state be only valuable when subject to the free control of those to whom they appertain and utterly worthless if to be determine by the sword of foreign interference mr dougla of illinoi one of the candidate for the presidency in respond speak at length and denounce the injustice and folly of england in the close he say : -- he regard the intervention of russium in the affair of hungary as a palpable violation of the law of nation that would authorize the united state to interfere if russium or austrium or any other power should interfere again then he would determine whether or not we should act he action depend upon the circumstance as they should then be present in the mean time however he would proclaim the principle of the law of nation : he would instruct we minister abroad to protest the moment there be the first symptom of the violation of these law he would show to europe that we have as much right to sympathize in a system of government similar to we own as they have in similar circumstance in he opinion hungary be better adapt for a liberal movement than any other nation in europe in conclusion mr dougla beg leave to offer the follow sentiment : -- hungary : when she shall make she next struggle for liberty may the friend of freedom throughout the world proclaim to the ear of all european despot hand off a clear field and a fair fight and god will protect the right the toast be receive with the greatest applause colonel florence submit the follow sentiment : -- the american minister to france whose intervention defeat the quintuple treaty general cass reply in a very energetic speech in which he state that he be approach the age of three score year and ten turn to kossuth he say : -- leader of you country 's revolution -- asserter of the rights of man -- martyr of the principle of national independence -- welcome to we shore sir the ocean more merciful than the wrath of tyrant have bring you to a country of freedom and of safety that be a proud day for you but it be a prouder day for we when you leave the shore of old hellespont and put you foot upon a american deck protect by american cannon with the star of we country float over you you could defy the world in arm and sir here in the land of washington it be not a barren welcome that i desire to give you but much further than that i be willing to go i be willing to lay down the great principle of national rights and adhere to they the sun of heaven never shine on such a government as this and shall we sit blindfold with we arm cross and say to tyranny prevail in every other region of the world -lrb- cry of no no -rrb- i thank you for the response every independent nation under heaven have a right to establish just such a government as it please and if the oppress of any nation wish to throw off they shackle they have the right without the interference of any other and with the first and greatest of we president -- the father of he country -- i trust we be prepare to say that we sympathize with every oppressed nation which unfurl the banner of freedom and i be willing as a member of congress to pass a declaration to-morrow in the name of the american people maintain that sentiment a toast be then propose : turkey : she noble hospitality extend to a fall patriot even at the risk of war prove she to be worthy of the respect and friendship of liberal nation kossuth reply as follow : -- sir i feel very thankful for have the opportunity to express in this place my everlasting gratitude to the sultan of turkey and to he noble people i be not a man to flatter any one before god nation and principle i bow -- before none else but i bow with warm and proud gratitude before the memory of the generous conduct i meet in turkey and i entreat you kind permission to state some fact which perhaps may contribute something to a better knowledge of that country because i be confident that when it be once better know more attention will be bestow on its future firstly as to myself when i be in that country and russium and austrium in the full pride of they victory be impose they will upon the sultan and claim the surrender of I and my associate it be true that a grand divan be hold at constantinople and not very favourable opinion be pronounce by a certain party oppose to the exist government in turkey whereby the sublime porte itself be lead to believe that there be no help for we poor exile but to abandon we faith and become mohammedan in order that turkey might be able to protect we i thereupon make a declaration which i believe i be bind in honesty to make but i owe it to the honor of the sultan to say openly that even before i have declare that i would rather die than accept this condition -- before that declaration be convey to constantinople and before any one there could have get knowledge that i have appeal to the public opinion of england in relation thereto -- before all this be know at constantinople when the decision of that great divan be announce to the sultan to be unfavourable to the exile he out of the generosity of he own heart without know what we be willing to accept or not to accept declare : they be upon the soil they have trust to my honor to my justice -- to my religion -- and they shall not be deceive rather will i accept war than deliver they up that be entirely he merit but notwithstanding these high obligation which i feel towards turkey i never will try to engage public sympathy and attention towards a country -- towards a power -- upon the basis of one fact but there be many consideration in reference to turkey which merit the full attention of the united state of america when we make a comparison between the turkish government and that of austrium and russium in respect to religious liberty the scale turn entirely in favor of turkey there be not only toleration for all religion but the government do not mix with they religious affair but leave these entirely to they own control whereas under austrium although self-government be secure by three victorious revolution by treaty which ensure these revolution and by hundred of law still austria have blot out from hungary the self-government of the protestant church while turkey accord and protect the self-government of every religious denomination russium -lrb- as be well know -rrb- take religion as a political tool persecute the roman catholic and indeed the greek and jew in such a manner that the heart of man must revolt against it the sultan whenever a fanatic dare to encroach on the religious freedom of any one at all in he wide dominion be the inexorable champion of that religious liberty which be permit everywhere under he rule again i must cite from the history of hungary this fact that when one-half of hungary be under turkish dominion and the other half under austrian religious liberty be always encourage in that part which be under the turkish rule and there be not only a full development of protestantism but unitarianism also be protect yet by austrium the unitarian be afterwards exclude from every civil right because they be unitarian although we revolution restore they natural rights such be the condition in respect to religious liberty under the austrian and under the turkish dominion now in respect to municipal self-government hungary and all those different province which be now oppose to the austrian empire -- if indeed a empire which only rest upon the goodwill of a foreign master can be say to exist or even to vegetate -- all those different province be absorb by austrium there be not one which have not in former time a constitutional life not one which austrium do not deprive of it by centralize all power in she own court such be the principle of christian rule take on the other hand the turk in turkey i have not only see the municipal self-government of city develop to a very considerable degree but i have see administration of justice very much like the institution of the jury i have see a public trial in a case where one party be a turk and the other party a christian where the municipal authority of the christian and of the turkish population be call together to be not only the witness of the trial but mutually to control and direct it with perfect publicity but more yet : there exist wallachium and moldavium under turkish dominion and the turkish nation which have conquer that province and be dominant yet out of respect for national self-government have prescribe to its own self not to have the right of a house to dwell in or a single foot of soil in that land in all the domestic concern of the province -- which for century have have a charter by which the self-government of wallachium and moldavium be ensure -- it be worthy to mention that the turk have never break he oath whereas in the european continent there be scarcely a single dynasty whether king prince duke or emperor which have not break faith before god and man now the existence of this turkey great as the present power of europe be be indispensable to the security of europe you know that in the crimea in the time of catherine potemkin write the word here pass the way to constantinople the policy indicate by he at that time be always the policy of st petersburg and it be of constantinople that napoleon rightly say that the power which have it in command if it be willing be able to rule three-quarter of the world now it be the intention it be the consistent policy of the russian cabinet to lay hold of constantinople and therefore to protect the independent existence of turkey be necessary to europe : for if turkey be crush russium become not only entirely predominant as she already be but become the single mistress of asia and of europe and to uphold this independence of turkey gentleman nothing be wanted but some encouragement from such a place as the united state since turkey have lose the possession of buda in hungary its power be decline but why because from that time european diplomatist begin to succeed in persuade turkey that she have no strength to stand by herself and by and bye it become the rule in constantinople that every petty interior question need european diplomacy now i say turkey have vitality such as not many nation have it have a power that not many have turkey want nothing but a consciousness of its own power and encouragement to stand upon its own foot and this encouragement if it come as counsel as kind advice out of such a place as the united state i be confident will not only be thankfully hear but also very joyfully follow that be the only thing which be want there and besides this political consideration that the existence of turkey as it be be necessary to the future of europe there be also high commercial consideration proper to interest and attract the united state the freedom of commerce on the danube be a law of nation guarantee by treaty and yet there exist _ no _ freedom it be in the hand of russium turkey to be sure be very anxious to re-establish freedom but there be nobody to back she in she demand turkey can also present to the manufacturing industry of such a country as the united state a far larger and more important market than all china with she two hundred and fifty million of inhabitant but one consideration i can mention -- and though it have no reference to the public opinion here i beg permission to avail myself of this opportunity to pronounce it and give it publicity -- and that be that i hope in the name of the future freedom and independence of the european nation those province of turkey which be inhabit by christian will not out of theoretical passion and out of attachment to a mere word neglect that course of action which alone can lead they to freedom and independence gentleman i declare that should the next revolutionary movement in europe extend to the turkish province of moldavium and servium -- and should turkey hereby fall -- this would not become a benefit to those province but would benefit russium only because then turkey no more exist all those province will be naturally absorb by russium whereas to hold fast to turkey -- that turkey which respect religious liberty give they entirely and fully self-government so much gentleman i desire to express i believe you will excuse I for the inappropriate manner in which i have acquit myself of this which i consider to be my duty in express my thanks to turkey i declare before you that i be fully convince of the identity of interest between hungary and turkey we have a common enemy -- therefore hungary and turkey be by natural tie draw into a close alliance against that enemy i declare that not only out of gratitude but also out of a knowledge of this community of interest i will never in my life let a opportunity escape where i in my humble capacity can contribute to the glory welfare and happiness of turkey but will consider it the duty of honor toward my country to be the truest most faithful friend of the turkish empire \* \* \* \* \* xviii -- aspect of america toward england -lrb- _ speech at the anniversary of the battle of new orlean jan 8 _ -rrb- fp blair esq in the name of the democratic association pronounce a elaborate address vindicate the interposition of the king of france to aid the american colony when they revolt from england and point out that america in defense of she institution may be call on to support the mass of the european nation as a breakwater between herself and despotism he show the certain danger to which english freedom would be expose from the triumph of despotism and ask : -- what have we to expect from neutrality we may anticipate the treatment which we receive from both belligerent when napoleon press on to empire over all the nation as russium do now can we hope that when the war be intend to exterminate the principle of which we government be the great exemplar we people will be allow the immunity of free trade with the belligerent to grow rich and strong by they calamity the impending danger can only be avert from we by the ability of the people of europe now keep down by military mercenary to rise and assert they own rights to encourage such effort be the duty of every free people and of all that would be free shall we government hesitate to denounce as a violation of the law of nation the intervention of the czar shall it hesitate to declare it a justification of a counter-intervention we countryman will not assent to the one-sided doctrine they will intervene to lift up those stricken down by intervention -- the exile from europe -- _ liberty _ and _ loui kossuth _ the band strike up the well-known marseille hymn and kossuth rise to respond be receive with prolonged cheer the music have cease three hearty cheer be give and loui kossuth respond to the toast and the address in the follow remark which be receive with warm enthusiasm : -- gentleman : i feel sincerely gratify with the honor of be invite to be present on this solemn occasion dedicate to the memory of a glorious as well as highly responsible fact in you history there be high political wisdom in the custom yearly to revive the memory of civil virtue and national glory in the mind of the living generation because nothing else be so efficient to keep alive the spirit of patriotism -- that powerful genius which like the angel of scripture guard with flame sword the paradise of national liberty and independence happy the land where the history of the past be the history of the people and not a mere flattery of king and doubly happy the land where the reward of the past be brighten by present glory present happiness and where the noble deed of the dead instead of be a mournful monument of vanish greatness which sadden the heart though it ennoble the mind be a lasting source of national welfare to the age and to posterity but where as in this you happy land national history be the elementary basis of education -- where the very schoolboy be better acquaint with the history of he country than in monarchy almost the professor be -- in such a country it would be indeed but a ridiculous parading of vanity for a stranger to dwell upon fact which every child be better acquaint with than he can be allow I therefore gentleman rather briefly to expound what be the practical philosophy of that great victory which you be assemble to celebrate -- what be the moral of the strain as it present itself to the inquirer 's mind as a man have to pass through several period of age each of they marked with its own peculiarity before he come to a settle position in life even so a nation a nation have first to be bear then to grow then it have to prove its passive vitality by undergo a trial of life afterwards it have to prove its active force to rise within its own immediate horizon at last it must take its proper seat amongst the nation of the world as a power on earth every one of these period of national life must be go through there be no help for it it be a necessary process of life and every one of these life-period have its own natural condition which must be accept as a necessity even if we should not be please with it gentleman have pass through the ordeal of a earnest life with the prospect of yet have to steer through stormy gale it be natural that while i grasp my helm i gaze at history as my compass and there be no history more instructive than yours because you have concentrate within the narrow scope of a few year that natural process of national life which elsewhere be achieve only through century it would be a mistake and a mistake not without danger to believe that you nation be still in its youth because it have live but seventy-five year the natural condition of nation be not measure by year but by those period of the process of life which i have mention and there be no nation on earth in whose history those period be so distinctly mark as in yours first you have to be bear that be the period of you glorious struggle for independence endless honor be to those who conduct it you be baptize with blood as it seem to be the destiny of nation but it be the genius of freedom which stand god-father at you baptism and give to you a lasting character by give you the christian name of _ republic _ then you have to grow and indeed you have grow with the luxuriant rapidity of the virgin nature of the american soil washington know the nature of this soil fertilize by the blood of you martyr and warm by the sun of you liberty he know it when he tell you father that you want but twenty year of peaceful growth to defy any power whatsoever in a just cause you have grow through those twenty year and wisely avoid to endanger you growth by undertake a toil not become to you grow age and there you stand about another twenty year look resolutely but unpretendingly around if there be anybody to question that you be really a nation the question be put in 1812 and decide by that glorious victory the anniversary of which you celebrate to-day that victory have a deeper meaning in you history than only that of a repulse invasion it mark a period in you national life -- the period of acknowledged unshakeable security of you national existence it be the consummation of you declaration of independence you have prove by it that the united state possess a incontestable vitality have the power to preserve that independent national position which you father establish by the declaration of independence in reality it be the victory of new orlean by which you take you seat amongst the independent nation of the world never to be contest through all posterity if the history of new orlean show the security of you national existence the victorious war against mexico prove that also you national interest must be respect the period of active vitality be attain it remain yet to take you seat not amongst the _ nation _ of the earth for _ that _ you have since the day of new orlean but amongst the _ power _ on earth what be the meaning of that word power on earth the meaning of it be to have not only the power to guard you own particular interest but also to have a vote in the regulation of the common interest of humanity of which you be a independent member -- in a word to become a tribunal enforce the law of nation precisely as you supreme court maintain you own constitution and law and indeed all argument of statesmanship all philosophy of history would be vain if i be mistake that you great nation be arrive at this unavoidable period of life the instinct of the people be in the life of a nation precisely that which conscience be in the life of man before we in we private life arrive at a clear conviction what course we have to adopt in this or that occurrence the conscience -- that inexplicable spirit in we breast -- tell we in a pulsation of we heart what be right or what be wrong and this first pulsation of conscience be very trustworthy then come the reflective operation of the mind : it now and then lull conscience to sleep now and then modify particulars and now and then raise it to the degree of conviction but conscience be in advance of the mind so be the instinct of the people -- the conscience of nation nor need the highest intellectual power of individuality to feel offended at the idea that the instinct of the people be always the first to feel the right and wrong it be the pulsation of the heart of the nation it be the advertisement of conscience which never heave without reason without necessity indeed gentleman it be not my presence here which elicit that majestic interest for national law and international rights nay i have not be here but for the pre-existence of this interest it raise glorious interpreter during the struggle of greece when indeed i be yet too young to be in public life it flash up kindle by poland 's heroic struggle and it blaze high and broad when we be fight the sacred battle of independence for the european continent have this interest and sympathy not exist long ago i be not now here my very freedom be the result of it and may i be permit to mention that there be several concern quite unconnected with the cause of hungary which have much contribute to direct public opinion to feel interested in the question of foreign policy so naturally connect with the question what be international law you relation with mexico and central america the threaten intervention of european power in the possible issue of a recent case which bring so much mourning into many family in the united state the question about the sandwich island which european diplomacy appear to contemplate as a appropriate barrier between you pacific state and the indian and chinese trade the sad fate of a american citizen now condemn to the galley in africa and several other consideration of press concern must necessarily have contribute to excite the interest of public opinion for the settlement of the question what be and what shall be law amongst nation -- law not dictate by the whim of ambitious despot but found upon everlasting principle such as republic can acknowledge who themselves live upon principle the cause of hungary be implicate with the very question of right in which you country in so many respects be concern it happen to lie so broad across the principle of international law as to occupy not only the instinct of the people but also the calm reflection of you statesman conspicuous by mature wisdom and patriotism and herein be the key besides the generosity congenial to freemen why the cause which i plead be honor with so rapid a progress in public sentiment and let I entreat you permission for one topic more i receive during my brief stay in england some one hundred and thirty address from city and association all full of the same warm sympathy for my country 's cause which you also have so generously testify that sympathy be accord to I notwithstanding my frank declaration that i be a republican and that my country when restore to independence can be nothing but a republic now this be a fact gratify to every friend of progress in public sentiment highly prove that the people be everywhere honorable just noble and good and do you know gentleman which of these numerous address be the most glorious to the people of england and the most gratifying to I it be one in which i hear you washington praise and sorrow avow that england have oppose that glorious cause upon which be found the noble fame of that great man and the address -- -lrb- numerous they be indeed -rrb- -- in which the hope and resolution be express that england and the united state forget the sorrow of the past will in brotherly love go hand in hand to support the eternal principle of international law and freedom on earth yes indeed sir you be right to say that the justice of you struggle which take out of england 's hand a mighty continent be openly acknowledge even by the english people itself the memory of the day of new orlean must of course recall to you mind the wrong against which you so gloriously fight oh let I entreat you bury the hatred of past age in the grave where all the crime of the past lie moulder with the ash of those who sin and take the glorious opportunity to benefit the great cause of humanity one thing let I tell you gentleman _ people _ and _ government _ be different thing in such a country as great britain be it be sorrowful enough that the people have often to pay for what the government sin let it not be say in history that even the people of the united state make a kindred people pay for the sin of its government and remember that you can mightily react upon the public opinion of britain and that the people of britain can react upon the course of its own government it be indeed a great misfortune to see the government of great britain push by irritation to side with the absolutist power against the oppressed nation about to struggle for independence and liberty even ireland could only lose by this and besides its own loss this might perhaps be just the decisive blow against liberty whereas if the government of england otherwise remain as it be do but unite with you not to allow foreign interference with we struggle on the continent this would become almost a sure guarantee of the victory of those struggle and accord as circumstance stand that would be indeed the most practical benefit to the noble people of ireland also because freedom independence and the principle of natural law could not fail to benefit they cause which so well merit the sympathy of every just man and they have also the sympathy -- i know it -- of the better half of england itself hatred be no good counsellor gentleman the wisdom of love be a better one what people have suffer more than my poor hungary have from russium shall i hate the people of russium for it oh never i have but pity and christian brotherly love for it it be the government it be the principle of the government which make every drop of my blood boil and which must fall if humanity be to live we be for century in war

have not here be honor with the same demonstration of local cordiality as in other place i do not with you attribute to diplomatic influence i know well the skill of russian diplomacy which indeed at moldovarica instruct all its representative to marry moldovarican lady but i also know that the framer of you constitution wisely discourage the development of municipal life in the district of columbium lest local influence and pressure from without on the seat of the central legislature might unduly sway the national council just so we have often know a single street in paris coerce the deliberation of the nation columbium have as i understand by a exceptional arrangement no true local self-government be deficient in local movement nevertheless i have receive _ private _ expression

million of man oppress by austrium if those thirty-five million desire it though to emperor of austrium have occupy a immoral position refuse it to you : and if the people of hungary bohemia and italy

envoy who come to inquire and report during we struggle have be authorize to recognize the legitimacy of we cause and of we proceeding and even now the moral effect would be great for such a act can not stand alone it point to you future policy towards every other nation moreover it would enlarge the lawful field of action for private sympathy and would enable I to accept many thing which i can not now i do not mean title -- which i value not i care only for my country 's dignity but it appertain to its dignity that its solemnly express will be recognize by you government legislature of you

want and he exhort he hearer never to cease act until the government take the high ground necessary to secure to hungary the simple justice she demand in conclusion he give the third toast : hungary -- betray but not subdue she constitution violate she people in chain she chief in exile the star of freedom will yet shine through the dark night of she adversity kossuth in response open by lament that the perpetual claim upon he time and the pressure of sorrowful feeling on he heart make it impossible for he to study how to address they suitably he proceed to say : but to what purpose be eloquence here have you not anticipate my wish have you not sanction my principle be you not go on to action as generous man do who be conscious of they power and of they aim well to what purpose then be eloquence here i have only to thank -- and that be more eloquently tell by a warm grasp of the hand than by all the skilful arrangement of word i beg therefore you indulgence for lay before you some mere fact which perhaps may contribute to strengthen you conviction that the people of the united state in bestow its sympathy upon my cause do not support a dead cause but one which have a life and whose success be rationally sure let I before all cast a glance at the enemy and let those impose upon by the attitude of despotism in 1852 consider how much stronger it be in 1847-8 france be loll by loui philippe 's politics of peace at any price into apathy man believe in the solidity of he government no heart-revolting cruelty stir the public mind no general indignation from offended national self-esteem prevail the stability of the public credit encourage the circulation of capital and by that circulation large mass of industrious poor find if not contentment at least daily bread the king be take for a prudent man and the private morality of he family cast a sort of halo around he house the spirit of revolution be reduce to play the meager game of secret association not second by any movement of universal interest -- the spirit of radical innovation be restrain into scientific polemic read by few and understand by fewer there be a faith in the patriotic authority of certain man whose reputation be that of be liberal one part of the nation live on from day to day without any stir passion in entire passiveness the other believe in gradual improvement and progress because it have confidence in the watchful care of partizan leader the combat of parliamentary eloquence be consider to be a storm in a glass of water and the highest aspiration of party be to oust the ministry and take they place and yet the prohibition of a public banquet blow asunder the whole complex like mere chaff germany be tranquil because the honest pretension of the ambition of she statesman be satisfy by the open list of parliamentary eloquence the public life of the nation have gain a field for itself in legislative debate -- a benefit not enjoy for century the professor be transfer to the legislative floor and the college to the parliament the nation be gratify by improvement in the law and by the oratory of she renowned man who never fail to flatter the national vanity it believe itself to be really in full speed of greatness and listen contented and quiet -- like a intelligent audience to a interesting lecture -- even in respect to the unity of great germany the custom-association -lrb- zollverein -rrb- become a idol of satisfied national vanity and of cheerful hope science and art be grow fast speculative research of political economy meet a open field in social life man conscious of higher aim wander afar into new home despair to find a field of action in they native land material improvement be the ruling word and the lofty spirit of freedom be blighted by the contact of small interest and yet a prohibit banquet at paris shake the very foundation of this artificial tranquillity and the princely throne of germany tremble before the rise spirit of freedom though it be grope in darkness because unconscious of its aim italy -- fair unfortunate italy -- look into the mirror of its ancient glory heave with gloomy grief but the sky of the heaven be as clear and blue above as it ever be since creation 's dawn : and it sing like the bird in a cage place upon a bough of the bloom orange tree and then pius ix place himself at the head of italian regeneration become popular as no man in rome since rienzus 's time in 1848 man hear with surprise on the coast of the adriatic my name couple in _ viva _ with the name of pius ix but the sarcasm of madame de stael -- that in italy man become woman -- be still believe true so that too many of the italian themselves despair of conquer austrium without charle albert austrium have not for century and prussium never yet have experience what sort of a thing a revolution be and the fall of the vault of the sky would have be consider less improbable than a popular revolution in berlin or vienna where metternich rule in triumphant proud security the house of austrium be consider as a mighty power on earth respect because think necessary to europe against the preponderance of russium no people under the dominion of this dynasty have a national army and all be divide by absurd rivalry of language keep up by metternich 's machiavelism the nation be divide none of they be conscious of its strength but all be aware of the united strength of a disciplined and large imperial army the regiment of which have never yet fight one against another and never yet have break the spell of the black and yellow flag by tear it to piece with they own hand and yet when pari stir and i make a mere speech in the hungarian parliament the house of austrium be presently at the mercy of the people of vienna metternich be drive away and he absolutism replace by a promise of constitutional life in gallicium the odium connect with the despotic austrian rule have by satanic craft be throw upon those class which represent the ancient polish nationality and the well-deserved hatred of aristocratic oppression though live only in traditional remembrance have prevail in the sentiment of the common people over the hatred against austrium though despotic and a stranger so much so that to triumph over the ill-advised untimely movement of 1846 austrium have nothing to do but open the field to murder by grant a two dollar ' reward for every head of a polish land proprietor and in hungary the people of every race be equally exclude from all political right -- from any share of constitutional life the endeavor of myself and my friend for internal improvement -- for emancipation of the peasantry -- for the people 's restoration to its natural rights in civil political social and religious respects be cramp by the hapsburg policy but the odium of this cramping be throw by austrium upon we own conservative party : and thus we national force be divide into antagonistic element besides the idea of panslavism and of national rivalry raise by russium and foster by austrium divert the excitement of the public mind from the development of common political freedom and hungary have no _ national _ army its regiment be fill with foreign element and scatter over foreign country while we own country be guard with well-disciplined foreign troops and what be far worse than all this hungary by long illegality corrupt in its own character deprive of its ancient heroic stamp germanize in its saloon sap in its cottage and hut impress with the unavoidable _ fatality _ of austrian sovereignty and the knowledge of austrian power seclude from the attention of the world which be scarcely aware of its existence -- hungary have no hope in its national future because it have no consciousness of its strength and be highly monarchical in its inclination and generous in its allegiance to the king no man dream of the possibility of a revolution there and he who would have suggest it would only have gain the reputation of a madman such be the condition of europe in the first half of February 1848 never yet seem the power of despot more steady more sure yet one month later every throne on the continent tremble except the czar 's the existence of dynasty depend upon the magnanimity of they people and europe be all on fire and in what condition be europe now every man on earth be aware that thing can not endure as they be _ formerly million believe that a peaceful development of constitutional monarchy be the only future reserve for europe now nobody on the european continent any longer believe that constitutional monarchy can have a future there _ absolutist reaction go with all that arrogance which revolt every sentiment and infuriate the very child in its mother 's arm the promise the word the oath of a king be become equivalent to a lie and to perjury faith in the morality of king be pluck out even to the last root from the people 's heart the experiment of constitutional concession be think dangerous to the dynasty as soon as they become aware that the people of europe be no imbecile child that can be lull to sleep by mockery but that it will have reality thus the king on the greater part of the continent throw away the mask of liberal affectation deceive every expectation break every oath and embark with a full gale upon the open sea of unrestricted despotism they know that love they can no longer get so we have be tell openly that _ they will not have _ love _ but _ money to maintain large army and keep the world in servitude on the other hand the nation assail in they moral dignity and material welfare degrade into a flock of sheep keep only to be shear -- equally with the king detest the mockery of constitutional royalty which have prove so ruinous to they royalty have lose its sacredness in france germany italy austria and hungary both party equally recognize that the time have come when the struggle of principle must be decide absolutism or republicanism -- the czar or the principle of america -- there be no more compromise no more truce possible the two antagonist principle must meet upon the narrow bridge of a knife-edge cast across the deep gulf which be ready to swallow he who fall it be a struggle for life and death that be the condition of the european continent in general a great terrible bloody uprising be unavoidable that be know and feel by every one and every sound man know equally well that the temporary success of loui napoleon 's usurpation have only make the terrible crisis more unavoidable ye man of peace at any price do not shut you eye wilfully to the finger of god point to the _ mene tekel upharsin _ write with gigantic letter upon the sky of europe despot never yield to justice mankind inspire with the love of freedom will not yield up its manhood tamely peace be impossible gentleman the success of my mission here may ensure the victory of freedom may prevent torrent of martyr ' blood may weaken the earthquake of impending war and restore a solid peace but be sure the certainty of the european struggle do not depend upon you generous support nor would my failure here even retard the outbreak of the hurricane should we not meet here with that support which you glorious republic in its public capacity and you generous citizen in they private capacity can afford without jeopardize you own welfare and you own interest -lrb- and assuredly it never come into my mind to desire more -rrb- -- should we meet with no support here be crush again and absolutism consolidate its power upon the ruin of murder nation i indeed can not but believe that it would become a historical reproach of conscience lie like a incubus upon the breast of the people of the united state from generation to generation i mean the idea that have you not withhold that support which you might have afford consistently with you own interest hungary perhaps would be a free flourishing country instead of be blot out from the map and europe perhaps free and absolutist tyranny sweep from the earth you then would in vain shed a tear of compassion over we sad fate and mourn over the grave of nation : nor only so but the victory of absolutism could not fail to be feel even here in you mighty and bless home you would first feel it in you commercial intercourse and ere long you would become inevitably entangled for as soon as the czar have secure the submission of all europe he would not look indifferently upon the development of you power which be a embodiment of republican principle i be not _ afraid _ to answer the question as to what be we means and chance of success -- but prudence command I to be discreet still some consideration i may suggest the spell of austrium be break it be now notorious that the might of the dynasty though discipline well provide and support by deluded race which have be rouse to the fury of extermination against we -- it be now notorious that all this satanically combined power prove unable to withstand the force of hungary though we be surprize and unprepared and have no army and no arm no ammunition no money no friend and be secluded and forsake by the whole world it be prove that austrium could not conquer we magyar when we be take unaware who can believe that we could not match she now that we be aware and predetermined yes if unprepared in material resource we be yet prepare in self-consciousness and mutual trust we have learn by experience what be require for we success in former time hungary be the strength of austrium now austrium be weak _ because _ it have occupy hungary it be strong by the unity of its army the power of which be found upon the confidence in this unity that confidence be break since one part of that army raise the tri-colour flag and cast to the dust the double-headed eagle the black and yellow flag which be the emblem of the army 's unity formerly the austrian army believe that it be strong enough to uphold the throne now it know that it be nothing by itself and rest only upon the support of the czar that spirit-depressing sentiment be so diffused among the troops that only take the reliance upon russium away or make it doubtful whether russium will interfere or not and the austrian army will disperse and fall asunder almost without any fight because it know that it have its most dangerous enemy within its own rank and be so far from have any cement that no man himself attach to that perjure dynasty can trust the man beside he in the rank but watch every movement of he arm in such a army there be no hope for tyrant the old soldier feel humiliate by the issue of we struggle they be offend by have no share in the reward throw away on despise court favorite the old croat regiment feel outraged in they national honor by be deceive in they national expectation the recruit bring with they recollection of they bombard city and of the oppression of they family and in that army be 140000 hungarian who fight under we tri-coloured flag against austrium and whose burning feeling of national wrong be inspire by the glorious memory of they victory oh have we have in 1848 such a army of disciplined soldier as austrium itself keep now for we never have one cossack tread the soil of hungary and europe would now be free or let austrium dismiss they and they will be discipline soldier at home the trumpet of national resurrection will reach they wherever they be hungary have the conviction of she strength _ the formerly hostile race all oppress like we now feel themselves to have be deceive and unite with we _ we have no opposite party in the nation some there be ambitious man or some incorrigible aristocrat perhaps : but these be no party they always turn towards the sun and they melt away like snow in march and besides hungary the people in austrium too in italy in prussium in all germany be conscious of its strength every large city on the continent have be in the power of the people and have have to be regain by bombarding and by martial law italy have redeem its heroic character at milan venice brescium and rome -- all of they immortal page in italian history glorious source of inspiration heroism and self-conscious strength and now they know they aim and be unite in they aim and burn to show to the world that the spirit of ancient rome again rise in they and then to take into consideration the financial part without money there be no war now the nation when once engage in the war will find means enough for home-support of the war in the rich resource of they own land whereas the despot lose the disposal of those resource by the outbreak of insurrection and be reduce entirely to foreign loan which no emperor of austrium will find again in any new revolution and mark well gentleman every friendly step by which you great republic and its generous people testify its lively interest for we just cause add to the prospects of success diminish the credit of the despot and by embarrass they attempt to find loan may be of decisive weight in the issue though absolutism be much more favourably situate in 1847 than in 1851 it be overtake by the event of 1848 when but for the want of unity and concert the liberal party must have triumph everywhere that unity and concert be now attain why should not absolutism in 1852 be as easily shake as in 1848 the liberal cause be stronger everywhere because conscious of its aim and prepared absolutism have no more bayonet now than in 1848 without the interference of russium we success be not only probable but be almost sure and as to russia -- remember that if at such a crisis she think of subdue hungary she have poland to occupy finland to guard turkey to watch and circassium to fight herein be the reason why i confidently state that if the united state declare that a new intervention of russium will be consider by you glorious republic a violation of the law of nation that declaration will be respect and russium will not interfere be please to consider the consequence of such renew interference after the passive acceptance of the first have prove so fatal to europe and so dangerous even to england itself we can scarcely doubt that if ever russia plan a new invasion england could not forbear to encourage turkey not to lose again the favourable opportunity to shake off the preponderance of russium i have live in turkey i know what enthusiasm exist there for that idea and how popular such a war would be turkey be a match for russium on the continent the weak point of turkey lie in the nearness of sevastopol the russian harbor and arsenal to constantinople well a english fleet or a american fleet or both join station at the mouth of the bosphorus may easily prevent this danger without one cannon 's shot and if this be prevent turkey alone be a match for russium and turkey would not stand alone the brave circassian triumphant through a war of ten year would send down 80000 of they unconquerable horseman to the plain of moscow and poland would rise and sweden would remember finland and charle the xii with hungary in the rear screen by this very circumstance from she invasion and austrium fall to piece from want of foreign support russium _ must _ respect you protest in behalf of international law or else she will fall never to rise again gentleman i thank you for the patience with which you have listen to this exposition -- long and tedious because i have no time to be brief and beg leave to assure you of my lasting gratitude for all the generous favor you have be and will yet be please to bestow upon my cause let I proclaim my fervent wish in this sentiment : pennsylvanium the keystone state -- may it by its legitimate influence upon the destiny of this mighty power on earth and by the substantial generosity of its citizen soon become the keystone of european independence hon j h walker speaker of the senate and several other speaker follow all decidedly sympathize with the hungarian and advocate intervention for non-intervention the speaking continue until after midnight \* \* \* \* \* xxiii -- agency of russian ascendancy and supremacy -lrb- _ pittsburg festival jan 26th _ -rrb- kossuth be receive in the masonic hall which be fill to overflow after a eloquent address to he from the chairman a w loomi esq he reply : sir the highly interesting instruction which you kindness have afford I about that new and wonderful world of the west in the entrance of which i now stand impress I with a presentiment of unlooked for event since i have be in the united state i have feel as if my guardian angel whisper that in _ the west _ the hope of my bleeding country will be realize it be a unconscious instinct -- a ray shooting above the horizon from the yet unseen sun you sir have show I the sun itself in full majesty you have transform my instinct into conviction here then upon the threshold of the west i bow with awe and joy as the fireworshipper of old persium to the source of life and light it be indeed joyful sir as you say to see politician sectarian philanthropist of all class unite in spontaneous sympathy for a cause plead by a stranger i recognize in it the bounty of providence i see the truth reveal that as magnetism pervade the universe so there be a sentiment which independent of party affection and bubble passion pervade the breast of mankind and that be the love of freedom justice and right the chord of freedom pass through all heart and whoever touch it elicit harmony the harmony be in the chord not in he who touch it there be no skill in the breeze which sweep over the aeolian harp yet a sweet harmony burst forth from its vibration the harmony of sympathy which i meet be the most decisive proof gentleman that the cause which i plead be indeed the cause of liberty the love of which gush up spontaneously in human bosom gentleman the cause of hungary even be it _ not _ the cause of europe and of all earthly freedom deserve you sympathy and active protection like other free nation we be brave the austrian dynasty be perjure and treacherous and we bravest bleed on the scaffold tyranny be cruel : only the people know how to be generous in victory -- let I rather say the people _ be _ generous : for the future i hope it will be _ just _ i hope this not because there be any deep truth in the irish poet who sing revenge on a tyrant be sweetest of all : not for that reason but i hope that the oppressed nation will not again stop half way and sacrifice they future to untimely generosity for they have all pay too cruelly for the lesson that _ with tyrant there be no faith _ so there must be no deal with they yet gentleman it be not for hungary 's worth nor for hungary 's suffering that i claim protection for she but because as in _ she _ the law of nation have be strikingly trample down so in _ she _ this law must be vindicate else the league of despot will be able to enforce it as a precedent against all free nation no law will henceforth be sure on earth and oppression will rule the world it be indeed a new doctrine that all despot have a right to interfere with every attempt of a people to regulate its own institution and that oppression in each separate nation be to be uphold by a foreign czar accord to this freedom and independence be everywhere proscribe as inconsistent with the security of absolutism -- to which every other consideration be to yield i have be indeed astonish to meet the reply that the cause which i plead be not worthy of much consideration since after all it be only the cause of _ one country _ i have read that the borgia be wont to say that italy be like the artichoke which must be eat leaf by leaf let I tell those with whom hungary be but one leaf of the artichoke that the despot who be allow to nibble each leaf separately will manage to dispose of the whole my opponent say i myself confess my cause to be that of one country only : for in claim non-interference i show my desire to abandon all other country but my own to they oppressor i may be permit to ask -- be there any truth in the world which may not be distort into a mockery russium be the strength of oppression she force in the background embolden every petty tyrant and make every oppressed nation despond : _ not _ because she be so very powerful but because all foresee distinctly that she will act unshrinkingly in the tyrant 's favor so soon as he need it we fight beat crushed the austrian emperor of course not without sacrifice you know that you own brave duquesne grey lose in one action more than half they man now if after a victory gain at such a price russium step in with a fresh force well provide with every means of war though that force be not such as one could not resist it be formidable as a rearguard fall fresh upon a nation exhaust with its very victory suppose that at the close of you own mexican victory you have to meet a fresh host of 100000 well-disciplined man what would have be the fate of you gallant army which enter the city of montezuma that be the key of russian preponderance but consider the consequence of we defeat austrium be restore -- _ not _ to its independent position -- _ that _ be lose forever but to the position of a tyrant at home obedient to the wink of he master abroad rely on the precedent establish by russium -- naple spain and degrade france interfere in rome after this austrium and prussium quarrel for german supremacy but before they draw the sword go to the czar for permission the czar at warsaw reply : i forbid you to quarrel reconstruct the german confederacy of 1815 and add to it no constitutional element send you two army to hesse cassel crush the people who there resist by law the grand duke 's attempt to overthrow the swear constitution as to schleswig holstein i want to have it reserve to denmark as a satrapy for my servant and nephew the german confederacy have dare to countenance its rebellion shall be punish by have to request austrium to send a army against it so order the czar and so it be do and after it be do the czar order the withdrawal of the pageant of a constitution which in the hour of need the emperor of austrium have promise to he empire it be withdraw when thus every popular movement be crushed every shadow of freedom withdraw the scaffold of hungary and italy saturated with blood the prison fill with martyr the exile drive from every asylum in the european continent and germany reduce to a condition worse than when the unholy alliance be at the full tide -- _ then _ the czar write a autograph letter to loui napoleon the perjured president of france assure he of he imperial grace and benevolent support if he would strike a deathblow to the french republic and loui napoleon strike the blow such be the result of the overwhelming preponderance of russium impose upon europe by its interference in hungary suppose now that i succeed in my sacred mission -- sacred because it be the cause of law and of all the oppress -- suppose russian interference check then hungary will crush the totter austrian dynasty : italy deliver from foreign dominion will sportively dispose of its petty tyrant the nation of austrium will become free and a valuable ingredient in german liberty at the result of a glorious struggle in hungary burning shame will mount to the cheek of the french and loui napoleon will be shake off let interference by the combination of despot be check let nation become master of they own fate -- and rely upon the magic power of you glorious example republican institution will spread as the light of the sun yes gentleman it be not for _ one _ country that i ask you support my ground be as broad as the world for it be the ground of eternal principle common to all humanity no man on the pretext that he heart be with some other nation -- german italian pole french no man on the pretext that he be a universal philanthropist ought to refuse he sympathy to hungary for its cause happen in this crisis to comprise the rest if i be a pole a german or a italian egotistically patriotic i could not serve my country better than by attack russium the only substantial enemy what would the petty prince of germany have be in 1848 without prussium and what be prussium when she capital be in the hand of the people but for the certainty of the czar 's support what be the petty despot of italy without austrium and what be austrium when she army drive from the soil of hungary in a series of pitched battle be so demoralize that nothing but the treacherous disobedience of a general prevent we brave militia from extinguish in vienna and olmutz the decrepit absolutism of the hapsburg what hinder _ I _ from afterwards crush it the intervention of russian despotism -- always the primal cause of evil absolutism have understand and declare that its repose be impossible whilst a free press and free institution exist any where formerly the absolutist adhere to the principle of legitimacy or the divine right of a hereditary dynasty and provide this false principle be respect they do not object to the development of constitution which preserve attachment to monarchy but now they have throw away they own principle of dynastical legitimacy and have no rule but to oppress freedom everywhere whoever will join they in that work be welcome though he be a usurper thus it come to pass that henry of bourbon be reject by the despot while loui napoleon have receive from the czar a autograph letter of approval and from austrium complimentary gift will the united state remain inactive while free institution be systematically extinguish can they look on indifferently because seventy year ago it be a wise doctrine appropriate to they childhood not to care about european politics it be publicly report that russium have decide to absorb turkey and mean to grant italy to austria belgium and the rhenish province to france and the rest of germany to prussia the czar act like the persian king of old when they send garment of honor to they satrap fling in the addition of a few province of kingdom to they satrapy and oh almighty father of humanity be there no power on earth to stop this execrable annihilation of human and national rights of freedom and independence -- though there be a republic powerful enough to do so -- a republic found upon the very principle which the despotic power have put under a inexorable ban gentleman i have dwell perhaps too long on the condition of europe but it be necessary to show that though there be no russian eagle paint over the public office in germany italy france still the russian frontier be really extend to the atlantic people of free america beware ere it be too late hurriedly and by sudden violence all civil and religious liberty must for the repose of absolutism be trample out of europe and by more deliberate perpetration by diplomacy persuasion and gold the way must be prepare to trample it out elsewhere by ulterior violence and here i claim permission to say something about the most dangerous power of russium its diplomacy it be worthy of consideration that while russium starve she army and underpay she official who live by peculation still abroad she devote greater resource to she diplomacy than any other power have ever do act on the maxim that man be not influence by fact but by opinion respect fact -- not by thing as they be but by thing as they be believe to be she find it easier and cheaper through a diplomatic agency to impress the world with a belief in a strength she have not than to try to organize or attain that strength and to come to that aim russian diplomacy be not restricted to diplomatic proceedings brilliant saloon of fascinating lady as well as marriage be equally department of russian diplomacy the secret-service money at the disposal of all other diplomatist be always limit and have only be exceptionably use but every russian diplomatist in whom confidence be repose have _ unlimited credit _ and be allow to disburse any sum to achieve a adequate result they traditional experience teach they how to attain they point they discretion can be rely on and they understand every possible means of reach man directly and indirectly pull frequently the string of thoroughly unconscious puppet constantinople be the great workshop of diplomatic skill worthy of more close interest than have hitherto be bestow upon it from america -- because there will be strike the most dreadful blow to the independence of europe in constantinople when russium wish to turn a grand vizier out of office it do not attack he : it praise he rather and spread the rumor of have he in its pay and it be sure that foreign influential diplomatist will then turn out for it the hate grand vizier when on the other hand a grand vizier be waver in he position and russium like he to continue in office it attack he with ostentatious publicity russium hate not always the man whom it appear to hate and love not always the man whom it appear to love russian diplomacy be a subterraneous power slippery like a snake burrow like the mole and when it have to come out in broad daylight it watch to the leave when it look to the right russium give instruction never to allow she to be directly defend by the press that would lead to discussion and further exposure with regard to herself she want silence -- the silence of the grave but she agent devote month of scheming and any sum require to attack she opponent to get up discord or the appearance of division amongst they or to popularize any momentary view which suit she policy and she delight in do so through apparently hostile and therefore unsuspected agent thus russia be powerful by a army hold ready as a rearguard to support needy despot with powerful by its ascendancy over the european continent powerful by have push other despot into extremity where they have lose all independent vitality and can not escape throw themselves into the iron grasp of the czar but above all russium be powerful by its secret diplomacy still this colossus gigantic as it appear to be -- like to the idol with front of brass but foot of clay may be overturn -- easily overturn from its fragile pedestal if the glorious republic of the united state oppose to it with resolute attitude the law of nation and do not abandon principle in favor of _ accomplished _ criminal _ fact _ the mournful condition of hungary seem to be point out by providence to the united state as a opportunity to save mankind from russium without any sacrifice at all whereas if this opportunity be lose -- i say it with the inspiration of prophecy -- there be many here in this hall who will yet see the day when the united state shall have to wrestle for life and death with all europe absorb by russium i know where i stand gentleman i know you power and the indomitable heroic spirit of you people it be not with the intention to create apprehension that i say this : the people of the united state fear nobody on earth it may be that russium even after have absorb europe will not dare to attack the united state directly but it may be that it will dare even this some domestic dissension may come -- -lrb- no nation be safe against it -rrb- -- the passion of particular interest may cause some momentary discord russium will foster it by its secret diplomacy to which nothing be sacred on earth and when irritation come to the pitch and the tie of affection become for a moment loose then perhaps russium may step in at a moment of interior weakness from which not the greatest nation be exempt russium will begin by _ divido _ and will perhaps come to _ impero _ all this may happen i can say neither yes nor no but one thing i be sure of and that be that russium triumphant in europe can and will attack you in you most vital interest and can hurt you mortally _ without even resort to war _ be sure gentleman so soon as russium have consolidate its undisputed preponderance the first step will be to exclude the commerce of america from europe by a prohibitory system of custom duty it will do it it must do it firstly because commerce be the convoyer of principle that be more sure yet than what a gentleman of new york so eloquently say -- that the _ steam engine be a democrat _ absolutism could not for a single moment rule europe with security if europe remain in commercial intercourse with republican america and secondly russium will exclude you trade from europe because -lrb- and let the great valley of the west mark it -rrb- because you immensely expand agriculture be the most dangerous competitor to russian wheat or corn in the market of europe either you must be exclude from the trade with europe or russium can not find a market for its corn if you ask _ how soon _ be such a exclusion of you produce from europe by russian influence possible i reply : possibly within a single year for within a year if we can not recommence the struggle russium may accomplish the partition of europe principle can only be balance by principle -- absolutism by republican institution -- unrighteous interference by the law of nation -- despotism by civil and religious liberty this be the cause which i advocate it be not the cause of hungary alone it be yours -- it be the world 's it have a determination as absolute and extreme as despotism hungary would have be too content if russium have not interfere merely to defend herself against austria the immediate instrument of she oppression now the independence of europe and the independence of hungary with it can only be secure on the moskwa and on the neva in the kremlin and in the great hall of st george for this purpose in which you yourselve be so vitally interested we do not claim for you to fight we battle for we look to the nation of europe groan under russium 's weight look in the first line to sweden and from sweden across poland to hungary and from hungary to turkey and to brave circassium pronounce in favor of the law of nation with the determination which show that you mean to act and i say russium _ will _ respect you declaration or else it will have a war from sweden down to turkey and circassium so soon as it move with 160000 to 200000 man against hungary -lrb- and with less it could not -rrb- all those nation will be aware that there be the last opportunity afford to they by providence to shake off russium 's yoke and they will avail themselves of this opportunity -- be sure of it the momentary fall of hungary be too painful a lesson to they but again i be answer in case of such a war you will be entangled in it to this i say that you will have to fight a war single-handed and alone within less than five year against russium and all europe if you do not take the position which i humbly claim but if you take this position the necessity of this war will be avert from you and russian preponderance will be check and you protestation respect without have to go to war because there be another sanction which you may add to you protestation -- a sanction powerful as a threat of war and yet no war at all that sanction will be the declaration of congress that as the intervention of a foreign power in the domestic affair of any nation be a violation of the law of nation by the fact of such intervention you neutrality law of 1818 be suspend in as far as the interfere or interference-claiming power be concern in other word that the citizen of the united state be at liberty to follow they own inclination in respect to such a foreign power which violate the law of nation this sanction would be sufficient because the enterprize spirit of you high-minded people be too well know not to be fear by all the despot of the world you law which forbid you citizen to partake in a armed expedition abroad be found upon the sentiment that to a foreign power with which you be on term of _ amity _ the regard of friendship be due but you without become inconsistent with you own fundamental principle can not consider yourself to be in good friendship with a power which violate the law of nation : so you may well withdraw the regard of friendship from it without resort to war between friendship and hostility there be yet a middle position -- that of be neither friend nor enemy -- therefore permit to every private individual to act as he please thus the conditional recall of you neutrality law would enforce the respect to you protestation without bring you country into the moral obligation to maintain you protestation by war i hope those who share my principle but hesitate to pronounce on account of the possibility of a war will be please to consider this humble suggestion and will see that with my principle war will be avert from the united state and by oppose my principle the united state will soon be force into dangerous difficulty out of which they can not be extricate but by a war which they will have to fight single-handed and alone -lrb- after this kossuth proceed to speak on _ catholicism _ but this subject be treat afterwards more amply in he speech at st loui against the jesuit -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* while kossuth be address he audience at pittsburg a special envoy from massachusett arrive mr erastus hopkin of northampton one of the representative of the state legislature at the vote of the legislature the governor -lrb- jan 15th -rrb- depute mr hopkin to convey to kossuth a solemn public invitation and at the close of kossuth 's speech -lrb- jan 27th -rrb- permission be grant by the president of the evening to allow mr hopkin ' credentials to be read upon which that gentleman say : -- mr president after the soul-stirring proceedings of this afternoon i dare hardly venture to obtrude upon you attention it be indeed very far from my expectation when i come a pilgrim on a toilsome journey at this inclement season of the year that i would be enable to mingle the congratulation of the citizen of the ` old bay state ' to governor kossuth with those of the people of alleghany county but sir my message although not address to this meeting be address to one whom we in common with you love and whom we all delight to honor turn to kossuth mr hopkin then address he as follow : governor kossuth : i be direct by he excellency the governor of massachusett to present to you the accompany resolve of the legislature invite you to visit they capital during the present session the resolve be _ in fact _ no less than in its term _ in the name and in behalf of the people of the commonwealth _ have with this announcement deliver to you the document entrust to my charge i must be consider as have exhaust my official function yet sir have have the honor of introduce the resolve to the legislature of massachusett -lrb- cheer -rrb- and witness with pleasure the unanimous and instant concurrence of she four hundred representative -lrb- renew cheer -rrb- i will venture to add a few word beyond the record -- only such word however as can not fail to be consonant with the sentiment and heart of she people the people of massachusett would have you accept this act of she constitute authority as _ no unmeaning compliment _ never in she history as a independent state with one single and illustrious exception have massachusett tender such a mark of respect to any other than the chief magistrate of these unite state and even in the present instance much as she admire you patriotism you eloquence you untiring devotedness and zeal -- deeply as she be move by you plaintive appeal and supplication in behalf of you native and oppressed land -- greatly as she be amaze by the irrepressible elasticity with which you rise from under the heel of oppression with fortitude increase under suffering with assurance grow stronger as the darkness grow deeper -lrb- cheer -rrb- still it be not one or all these quality combine that can lead she to swerve from she dignity as a independent state to the mere worship of man -lrb- applause -rrb- no but it be because she view you as the advocate and representative of certain great _ principle _ which constitute she own vitality as a state -- because she view you as the representative of human rights and freedom in another and far distant land -- it be because she view you as the rightful but exile governor of a people whose past history and whose recent deed show they to be worthy of some better future than that of russian tyranny and austrian oppression -- that she seek to welcome you to she border : that she seek to attest to a gaze world that to the cause of freedom she be not insensible and that to the oppression of tyrant she be not indifferent mr hopkin then proceed to recount the public glory of massachusett which he sum up in religion education and freedom -- a tricolor for the world he avow massachusett to be the birth-place of american liberty and state that she government be carry on in 322 city and township literally democratic assembly which levy they own tax sustain they own school police tribunal & c and receive and pay local fund four or five time larger than those of the state treasury the seat of government say he be a fiction in massachusett save as it signify the heart of the people come to she border witness the truth of all and more than i have utter as you shall find it attest by we institution by the plenitude of we hospitality and by the acclamation of one million soul kossuth reply briefly with thanks and cordial assent \* \* \* \* \* xxiv -- reply to the pittsburg clergy -lrb- _ jan 26th _ -rrb- the substance of he speech be report as follow : -- he say that he receive with a thankful heart this testimonial of respect and welcome from the reverend minister of the gospel whose heart and mind be deeply imbue with regard and desire for _ truth _ he have be teach to reverence the word of god because it guarantee freedom to man and there be nothing more intimately associate with the idea of freedom than the right of every mind to search for truth in its own way -- the right of private judgment therefore in receive the approbation of so reverend and learn a body he feel that he receive the approbation of religion itself and as if a angel voice from heaven have declare to he -- the cause you plead have find favor before heaven you may encounter hostility you may be overtake by calumny you may endure suffering and trial and temptation you may even suffer martyrdom -- but the cause will triumph trust to he who strengthen the arm of david against the mighty goliath and learn to say in truth : lord thy will be do when he think thus and feel thus he be not weak but strong the suffering and trial which he have endure have strengthen he body even as the holy influence of religion have strengthen he soul he be not leave as the fragile flower that remain bow and bent before the blast for he could now look forward with more of hope and of trust for the future of he own beloved land when he hear such glorious truth so warmly proclaimed and when he see such evidence of real sympathy for the cause of hungary they speak of the protestant church he claim no merit on account of he belief but he too be a protestant -- not by education merely but from he own study conviction he could believe nothing merely because he might be command to do so but solely as the result of he own conviction truth be as uncorruptible and imperishable as god himself and he will spread it throughout all the world but the triumph of truth can not be achieve by persecution opposition or political oppression this glorious principle can only be triumphant when the nation of the earth shall become free from oppression because it be only under the protection of free institution -- a free press free controversy freedom of speech and free popular education -- where it be you privilege to preach and that of the neighbor to hear -- that the political independence of a people can be preserve oppression be everywhere accompany by the demoralization of the mass and they adoption of infidelity or fanaticism while under the teaching of freedom religion become a growth of the soul he would urge they to go on and support that cause which they believe to be sanctify by truth it have be say that true religion can never cease to be republican if this be true he would ask what could more promote the glorious cause than the influence of the united state exert among the nation of the world toward the general acknowledgment of that doctrine among nation which be lay down for the government of man -- what ye would that man should do unto you do ye even so to they this fundamental truth should be declare a part of the international law of the world and the gospel would then become the bulwark of liberty to all mankind thus we may see that the triumph of genuine liberty can best be secure by recognize religion as the true basis of the law of nation he who shall be instrumental in incorporate this grand doctrine among those law will be equal or perhaps superior to a luther or a melancthon a calvin or a huss a cranmer or any other of the world 's greatest reformer the people of this republic have all this within they grasp and he hope the almighty would hasten the day when it shall be do he have often hear that the people of this country love to be call a great people and he have many time hear they call a great people to _ be _ a great people however the people of this country must really _ act _ as a great people he urge upon the minister of the gospel that they should warn they flock against the horrid doctrine of _ materialism _ nothing be more hostile to national greatness than when the poor see the rich govern only by pecuniary consideration -- leave nothing for the mind and the soul or undervalue virtue and talent he thankfully acknowledge the deep solemnity of he feeling when for he humble self such solemn manifestation be observe and while commend he bleeding country to they love he could only refer they to the savior 's word as the guide for they prayer and they watchfulness \* \* \* \* \* xxv -- hungarian loan -lrb- _ melodeum cleveland _ -rrb- kossuth have be present at the melodeum to the mayor be publicly address by mr starkweather in a highly energetic speech which end by salute he as rightful governor of hungary kossuth reply : -- sir if i be not mistake it be now the 156th time -lrb- since i enter america -rrb- i be sure that it be the 34th time since i leave washington on the 12th of January -- that i have have the honor to address a american audience in that tongue which i learn from shakespeare while confine in a austrian prison for have dare to claim the right of a free press which now like the hundred-handed briareus of old pour my word by thousand of channel into the heart of million of freeman who comprize in they national capacity a mighty republic destine to enforce the law of nation upon which rest the deliverance of the world from a overwhelming despotism the press be nobly recompense I the way of providence be wonderful may the free press never forget its living principle justice and truth may it always be watchful with its thousand eye that the secret craft of diplomacy may never succeed to degrade one organ of the american press into a unconscious russian tool act on by blind animosity or by exclusive predilection sir -- after have speak so often and so much and the free press have convey my principle my argument and my prayer in almost every homestead of this great republic i may be well permit to believe that the stage of speaking be pass and the stage of practical action have come almost every packet bring such news of absolutist reaction in europe and almost every new step of the despotic power be accompany by such incident that it be indeed unpardonable neglect if when providence have place so much influence in my hand by the confidence of nation bestow upon I i should not use all possible energy to circumvent the influence of evil to combine the effort of the good to check the plot of vile and the waywardness of err or weak character -- often the unconscious tool of the vile to direct the action of inconsiderate friend and above all to accomplish those preparation which be indispensable to meet the exigency of the future -- in short to attain that crisis at which i humbly claim protection for principle from the people of the united state in they public capacity and substantial aid from they private generosity you of course be aware that all these thing together present a vast field for which every moment of my time would scarcely suffice often be i ask what be the instrumentality for this my activity but this question can not be answer publicly as i be quite unwilling to let the enemy learn my secret however so much i may state that it be not without a definite aim and clear hope that i devote all that yet remain in I of energy and strength if i do not hope -- if under certain condition i have not a assurance of success -- i would prefer tranquillity to action though it be the tranquillity of the grave there be _ two _ mode in which free nation may aid the cause of european independence -- namely _ politically _ and _ privately _ as to the first i avow with intense gratitude that the great national jury the people give and give incessantly its favourable verdict you state legislature be pronounce its vote and the cause be move before the high court of you national congress in regard to aid by _ private fund _ i rejoice to see local association clustering round the central one of northern ohio in cleveland but i desire that such effort may not be delay until i come in person : for i can possibly come only to a few already in new york i start the idea of a national hungarian loan in share of one five and ten dollar with the facsimile of my signature and of larger share of fifty and of a hundred dollar with my autograph i prepare the smaller share for generous man who be not rich yet desire to help the great cause of freedom it be a noble privilege of the richer to do greater good but remember it be not a gift it be a loan : for either freedom have no name on earth or hungary have a future yet and let hungary be once again independent and she have ample resource to pay that small loan if the people of the united state remember the aid receive in they own dark hour vouchsafe to I such a loan hungary have no public debt it have fifteen million of population a territory of more than one hundred thousand square english mile abundant in the greatest variety of nature 's blessing if the doom of oppression be take from it the state of hungary have public land property administer badly worth more than a hundred million of dollar even at the low price at which it be already a established principle of my administration to sell it in small share to suit the poorer class hungary have rich mine of gold silver copper quicksilver antimony iron sulphur nickel opal and other mine hungary have the richest salt mine in the world -- where the extraction of one hundred weight of the purest stone salt amount to but little more than one shilling of you money -- and though that be sell by the government at the price of two to three and a half dollar and thus the consumption be of course very restricted this still yield a net revenue of five million of dollar a year -- to the government -- but no there be not government it be usurpation now suck out the lifeblood of the people crush the spirit of freedom by soldier hangman policeman and harass the people in its domestic life and the sanctuary of its family with oppression worse than a free american can conceive you see by this gentleman that when hungary be once free -- and free it will be -- she have ample resource to repay you generous loan within a year without any taxation of the people itself and pay it well because every shilling of you generous aid will faithfully be employ for its restoration to freedom and independence i may point to my whole life as a guarantee to that purpose i have million at my disposal entrust to I by my people 's confidence and here i stand penniless and poor not know what my child will eat to-morrow if i die to-day and i be proud that i be poor and i pledge my honor to you that every shilling of what you generosity give for hungary will be employ for hungary 's benefit in fact as i have provide for the contingency of anything befalling I so also i be ready if it be you people 's will to admit any control consistent with the necessary condition of success -lrb- after this kossuth proceed to speak on the aspect of republicanism towards catholicism and the fortune of ireland a subject more fully treat in other speech -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* address to kossuth from the state committee of ohio governor kossuth : -- as chairman of the committee appoint for that purpose by a resolution of the general assembly of the state of ohio i have the honor to tender to you in the name and in behalf of the state a cordial welcome to the capital we proffer this greet as a small tribute of that admiration which you courage you integrity and above all you self-denying devotion to the cause of hungarian freedom have rouse in we breast wonder not sir at the enthusiasm which you presence excite in a people who cherish with fond recollection and reverence the smallest relic of that time when liberty wrestle with oppression in america and who hail the anniversary of she triumph with such grateful remembrance of those brave and patriotic man who work out we full measure of national happiness in you we behold a living embodiment of those great principle which we cherish with such tender affection you be the realization of that virtue that courage that civil and military genius which shed such lustre on we early history you call to mind more freshly than poetic or historic page song

authoritative and enduring form than can possibly be do by any declaration or expression of mine in no part of the united state have you course be more warmly approve or you great talent persevere energy and devoted patriotism more universally admire this sir be sufficiently evince in the cordial and heartfelt welcome that have everywhere await you since you entrance into the state free and independent themselves the people of ohio can not look with indifference on the great contest in which you be engage the history of that fearful struggle which result in the achievement of they own independence be still fresh in they recollection always on the side of the oppressed no cold or calculate policy can suppress or control they sympathy the cause of hungary which you so eloquently plead and which it be you high and sacred mission to maintain be the cause of freedom in every quarter of the world the principle involve in that cause form the basis of we own institution the source of we present prosperity and greatness and the foundation of all we hope and anticipation of the future it would be strange indeed if a cause so pure and holy or a champion so gifted should fail to

flourishing commonwealth -- to its hall of legislation which in you own fatherland be the scene of some of you proudest triumph and to the heart of a free generous and sympathizing people kossuth 's reply mr president -- the general assembly of ohio have magnanimously bestow upon I the high honor of this national welcome it be with profound veneration that i beg leave to express my fervent gratitude for it be even no principle for the future connect with the honor which i now enjoy still the past would be memorable as history and not fail to have a beneficial influence continuously to develop the spirit of the age almost every century have have one predominant idea which impart a common direction to the activity of nation this predominant idea be the spirit of the age invisible yet omnipresent impregnable all-pervading scorn abused oppose and yet omnipotent the spirit of we age be democracy all _ for _ the people and all _ by _ the people nothing _ about _ the people _ without _ the people that be democracy and that be the ruling tendency of the spirit of we age to this spirit be oppose the principle of despotism claim sovereignty over mankind and degrading nation from the position of a self-conscious self-consistent aim to the condition of tool subservient to the authority of ambition one of these principle will and must prevail so far as one civilization prevail the destiny of mankind be link to a common source of principle and within the boundary of a common civilization community of destiny exist hence the warm interest which the condition of distant nation awake now-a-days in a manner not yet record in history because humanity never be yet aware of that common tie as it now be with this consciousness thus develop two opposite principle can not rule within the same boundary -- democracy and despotism in the conflict of these two hostile principle until now it be not right not justice but only success which meet approbation and applause unsuccessful patriotism be stigmatize with the name of crime revolution not crown by success be style anarchy and revolt and the vanquish patriot be drag to the gallows by victorious despotism man do not consider _ why _ he die on the gallows but the fact itself that _ there _ he die impart a stain to he name and though impartial history now and then cast the halo of a martyr over a unsuccessful patriot 's grave yet even this be not always sure tyrant have often perverted history by adulation or by fear but whatever that late verdict might have be for he who dare to struggle against despotism at the time when he struggle in vain there be no honor on earth -- victorious tyranny mark the front of virtue with the brand of a criminal even when a exist authority be mere violence worse than that of a pirate to have oppose it unsuccessfully be sufficient to ensure the disapproval of all who hold any authority the people indeed never fail to console the outcast by its sympathy but authority feel no such sympathy and rather regard this very sympathy as a dangerous symptom of anarchy when the idea of justice be thus pervert -- when virtue be thus deprive of its fair renown and honor be thus attack -- when success like that of loui napoleon 's be gain through connivance -- all this become a immeasurable obstacle to the freedom of nation which never yet be achieve but by a struggle -- a struggle which success raise to the honor of a glorious revolution but failure lower to the reputation of a criminal outbreak mr president i feel proud at the accident that in my person public honor have be restore to that on which alone they ought to be bestow -- righteousness and a just cause whereas until now honor be lavish only upon success i consider this as a highly important _ fact _ which can not fail to encourage the resolution of devoted patriot who though not afraid of death may be excuse for recoil before humiliation senator representative of ohio i thank you for it in the name of all who may yet suffer for have do the duty of a patriot you may yet see many a man who out of you approbation will draw encouragement to noble deed for there be many on earth ready to meet misfortune for a noble aim but not so many ready to meet humiliation and indignity besides in honor I you have approve what my nation have do you have honor all hungary by it and i pledge my word to you that we will yet do what you have approve the approbation of we conscience we have -- the sympathy of you generous people have meet we -- and it be no idle thing that sympathy of the people of ohio -- it weigh as the sovereign will of two million of freeman you have add to it the sanction of you authority you people 's sympathy you have frame into a law sacred and sure in its consequence on which humanity may rely but sir high though be the value of this noble approbation it become a invaluable benefit to humanity by these resolution by which the general assembly of ohio acknowledge the justice of those principle which it be my mission to plead in my injured country 's name declare that the mighty and flourishing commonwealth of ohio be resolve to resist the eternal law of nation to they due sway too long contemn by arbitrary power it be indeed a sorrowful sight to see how nation bleed and how freedom wither in the iron grasp of despotism league for universal oppression of humanity it be a sorrowful sight to see that there be no power on earth ready to maintain those eternal law without which there be no security for any nation on earth it be a sorrowful sight to see all nation isolate themselves in defense while despot league in offence the view have change a bright lustre be spread over the dark sky of humanity the glorious galaxy of the united state rise upon oppressed nation and the bloody star of despotism fading at you very declaration will soon vanish from the sky like a meteor legislator of ohio it may be flattering to ambitious vanity to act the part of a execrated conqueror but it be a glory unparalleled in history to protect rights and freedom on earth the time draw near when by virtue of such a declaration as yours share by you sister state europe 's liberated nation will unite in a mighty choir of hallelujah thank god that he paternal care have raise the united state to the glorious position of a first-born son of freedom on earth washington prophesy that within twenty year the republic of the united state would be strong enough to defy any power on earth _ in a just cause _ the state of ohio be not yet bear when the wisest of man and purest of patriot utter that prophecy and god the almighty have make the prophecy true by annex in a prodigiously short period more star to the proud constellation of you republic and increase the lustre of every star more powerfully than washington could have anticipate in the brightest moment of he patriotic hope rejoice o my nation in thy very woe wipe off all thy tear and smile amidst thy torture like the dutch hero de wytt there be a providence which rule thou wast o my nation often the martyr who by thy blood didst redeem the christian nation on earth even thy present nameless woe be providential they be necessary that the star-spangled banner of america should rise over a new sinaus -- the mountain of law for all nation thy suffering be necessary that the people of the united state powerful by they freedom and free by the principle of national independence that common right of all humanity should stand up a new mose upon the new sinaus and shout out with the thundering voice of its twenty-five million -- hear ye despot of the world henceforward this shall be law in the name of the lord you god and we god ye shall not kill nation ye shall not steal they freedom and ye shall not covet what be you neighbor 's ohio have give its vote by the resolution i have the honor to hear it be the vote of two million and it will have its constitutional weight in the council of washington city where the delegate of the people 's sovereignty find they glory in do the people 's will sir it will be a day of consolation and joy in hungary when my bleeding nation read these resolution which i will send to she they will flash over the gloomy land and my nation unbroken in courage steady in resolution and firm in confidence will draw still more courage more resolution from they because it be well aware that the legislature of ohio would never pledge a word to which the people of ohio will not be true in case of need sir i regret that my illness have disable I to express my fervent thanks in a manner more become to this assembly 's dignity i beg to be excuse for it and humbly beg you to believe that my nation for ever and i for all my life will cherish the memory of this benefit \* \* \* \* \* xxviii -- the misery and the strength of hungary -lrb- _ columbus feb 7th to the association of friend of hungary _ -rrb- on feb 7th be hold the first regular meeting of the ohio association of the friend of hungary in the city hall of columbus governor wood address the association as its president and in the course of he speech say : -- this be a cause in which the people of the united state feel much interest much have be say on the doctrine of intervention and non-intervention there be a time when if i ventured to speak a word on any question in this state it be receive with authority the opinion i now express have be form with the same deliberation as those i express with authority in another capacity there have seem to be a combined effort on the part of despot in europe to put down free institution it be the duty of freeman to oppose this effort -- to resist the principle that every civic community have not a right to regulate its own affair whenever one nation interfere with the internal concern of another it be a direct insult to all other nation there be a combined effort in continental europe to overthrow all free and liberal institution this accomplished what next -- the effort of tyrant will be direct to we institution it will be they aim to break we down must not we prevent this event -- _ peaceably if we can -- forcibly if we must _ no power will prevail with tyrant and usurper but the power of gunpowder or steel kossuth in reply turn to governor wood say : before address the assembly i humbly entreat you excellency to permit I to express out of the very heart of my heart my gratitude and fervent thanks for those lofty generous principle which you have be please now to pronounce i know those principle would have immense value even if they be only a individual opinion but when they be express by he who be the elect of the people of ohio they doubly manifoldly increase in weight the restoration of hungary to its national independence be my aim to which i the more cheerfully devote my life because i know that my nation once master of its own destiny can make no other choice in the regulation of its institution and of its government than that of a republic found upon democracy and the great principle of municipal self-government without which as oppose to centralization there be no practical freedom possible other nation enjoy a comparatively tolerable condition under they exist government -- though aware of they imperfection may shrink from a revolution of which they can not anticipate the issue while they know that in every case it be attend with great sacrifice and great suffering for the generation which undertake the hazard of the change but that be not the condition of hungary my poor native land be in such a condition that all the horror of a revolution when without the hope of happiness to be gain by it be preferable to what it live to endure now the very life on a bloody battle-field where every whistle musket-ball may bring death -- afford more security more ease and be less alarming than that life which the people of hungary have to suffer now we have see many a sorrowful day in we past we have be by we geographical position destine as the breakwater against every great misfortune which in former century rush over europe from the east it be not only the turk when they be yet a dangerous conquer race which my nation have to stay by wade to the very lip in its own heroic blood no the still more terrible invasion of batu khan 's -lrb- the mongol -rrb- rage million pour down over europe from the steppe of tartary -- who come not to conquer but to destroy and therefore spare not nature not man not the child in its mother 's womb it be hungary which have to stay its flood from devour the rest of europe nevertheless all which hungary have ever suffer be far less than it have to suffer now from the tyrant of austrium himself in he turn nothing but the slave of ambitious russium oh it be a fair beautiful land my beloved country rich in nature 's blessing as perhaps no land be rich on earth when the spring have strew its blossom over it it look as the garden of eden may have look and when the summer ripen nature 's ocean of crop over its hill and plain it look like a table dress for mankind by the lord himself and still it be here in columbus that i read the news that a terrible dearth that famine be spread over the rich and fertile land how should it not where life-draining oppression weigh so heavily that the landowner offer the use of all he land to the government merely to get free from the taxation -- where the vintager cut down he vineyard and the gardener he orchard and the farmer burn he tobacco seed to be rid of the duty and they vexation -- there of course must dearth prevail and famine raise its hideous head yet the tyrant add calumny to oppression by attribute the dearth to a want of industry after have create it by oppression there exist no personal security of property nor be the verdict not guilty when pronounce by a austrian court sufficient to ensure security against prison nay against death by the executioner -- through a new trial order to find a man guilty at any price poor loui bathyanyus be thus treat even now persecution be go on -- hundred be arrest secretly and send to prison and they property confiscate though they be already acquit by the very haynaus _ even to whisper that a man or woman be arrest in the night be consider a crime _ and punish by prison or if the whisperer be a young man by send he to the army there to taste when he dare to frown the corporal 's stick _ no man know what be forbid what not _ because there exist no law but the arbitrary will of martial court -- no protect institution -- no public life -- free speech forbid -- the press fetter -- complaint a crime -- when we consider all this indeed it be not possible not to arrive at the conviction that come what may a new war of revolution in hungary be not a matter of choice but a matter of unavoidable necessity because all that may come be not by far so terrible as that which be but i be often ask -- what hope have hungary should she rise again pardon I gentleman for say that i can not forbear to be surprize as often as i hear this question why the emperor of austrium fresh with he bloody victory over italy vienna lemberg prague attack we in the fulness of he power when we have no expectation and be least in the world prepare to meet it we be assault on several side we fortress be in the hand of traitor we have as yet no army at all we be secluded from all the world -- forsake by all the world -- without money -- without arm -- without ammunition -- without friend -- have nothing for we but the justice of we cause and the people burn with patriotism -- man who go to the battlefield almost without know how to cock they gun but still within less than six month we beat all the force of austrium -- we crush it to the dust and in despair the proud tyrant flee to the foot of the czar beg he assistance for he sacrilegious purpose and pay he by the sacrifice of honor independence and all he future in contemplate these fact who can doubt that we be now a match for austrium then we have no army -- now we have 120000 brave magyar who fight for freedom and motherland enlist in the rank of austrium form they weakness and we strength then hostile nation be oppose to we now they be friendly and be with we then no combination exist between the oppressed nation -- now the combination exist then we oppressor take he own time to strike -- when he be best and we be worst prepare : -- now we will take we time and strike the blow when it be best for we and worst for he in a word then every chance be against we and we almost in a condition that the stoutest heart falter and we only take up the gauntlet because we very soul revolt against the boundless treachery -- now every chance be for we and it be the native which throw the gauntlet into the tyrant 's face we very misfortune ensure we success -- because then we have some something to lose now we have nothing we can only gain -- for i defy the sophistry of despotism to invent anything of public or private oppression which be not already inflict upon we but i be upon the question of success -- when i moot that question -- upon what repose the success of hungary it always occur to my mind that the last administration of the united state send a gentleman over to europe during the hungarian struggle _ not _ with order to recognize the independence of hungary but just to look to what chance of success we have now suppose that the united state take into consideration the right of every nation to dispose of itself and true to that policy which it have always follow to take established fact as they be and not to investigate what chance there might or might not be for the future but always recognize every new government everywhere -- suppose that it have send that gentleman with such a instruction to hungary : what would have be the consequence if the government of hungary which exist then and indeed exist very actively for it have create army have beat austrium and drive she last soldier from hungarian territory -- if that government have be recognize by the united state of course commercial intercourse with the united state in every respect would have be lawful accord to you existing international law the emperor of austrium the czar of russium because they be recognize power have full liberty to buy you cannon gunpowder musket -- everything that would have be the case with hungary that legitimate commerce with the people of the united state with hungary of course would have be protect by the navy of the united state in the mediterranean now man we have enough -- but arm we have none that would have give we arm and have beat austrium already we would have beat russium and i instead of have now the honor of address you here would perhaps have dictate a peace in moscow but the gentleman be send to _ investigate the chance _ of success upon he investigation hungary perish let I entreat you friend of hungary do not much hesitate about success while rome deliberate saguntum fall i fear that by too long investigate what chance we have the chance of success will be compromise which by speedy help could have be ensure well i be answer -- there be no doubt about it -- hungary be a match for austrium you have beat austria it be true but russium -- there be the rub precisely because there be the rub i come to the united state rely upon the fundamental principle of you great republic to claim the protection and maintenance of the law of nation against the armed interference of russium that be precisely what i claim that accord no intervention of russium can take place the word of america will be respect not out of consideration for you dignity but because the czar and the cabinet of russium atrocious and unprincipled as they be be no fool and will not risk they existence therefore you word will be respect you have a act of congress pass in 1818 by which the people of the united state be forbid by law to take any hostile step against a power with which the united state be at amity well suppose congress pronounce such a resolution -- that in respect to any power which violate the law of nation we recall this neutrality law and give full liberty to follow its own will -lrb- applause -rrb- now in declare this congress have prevent a war because it have be point out to the people in what way that pronunciation of the law of nation be to be support and the enterprize spirit of the people of the united state be too well know as its sympathy for the cause of hungary be too decidedly express not to impart a conviction to the czar of russium that though the united state do not wish to go to war so the law of nation will be enforce _ peaceably if possible _ -lrb- turn to governor wood -rrb- _ forcibly if necessary _ but as i again and again meet the doubt whether you protest even with such sanction will be respect i farther answer -- let I entreat you to try it cost nothing you be not bind to go farther than you will -- try _ perhaps _ it will be respect and if it be humanity be rescue and freedom on earth reign where despotism now rule it be worth a trial besides i beg to remind you of my second and third request either of which might bring a practical solution of this doubt at present whoever will may sell arm to austrium but you forbid you own citizen to sell arm to hungary and this though the rule of austrium have no legitimate basis but rest on unjust force while you have avow the cause of hungary to be just such a state of you law be not neutrality and be not righteous towards _ we _ nor be it fair towards you _ own people _ if venice be to-day to shake off the yoke of austrium austrium will forthwith forbid all of you to buy and sell with venice well : i say that be not fair towards you own citizen any more than to the venetian true you have not the right to open any market by force towards a nation which be unwilling to deal with you but you have a clear right to deal with one which desire it in spite of any belligerent who choose to forbid you how could the fact of hungary or venice rise up against they oppressor justify austrium in damage the lawful commerce of america with those nation on this turn my second principle which i consider of high importance for the come struggle that the united state would declare they resolve to uphold they commercial intercourse with every nation which be ready to accept it thirdly i claim that you would recognize the hungarian declaration of independence as have be legitimate my enemy have misrepresent this as if i desire to be recognize as _ de facto _ the governor of hungary this be mere absurdity that be not the question -- _ be _ i governor or not governor the question be -- _ be _ the declaration of independence of hungary in the judgment of the people of the united state a legitimate one to which my nation have a right -- or be it not i believe america can not answer no because you very existence rest on a similar act and if that declaration be make what will be the consequence of it what will be the practical result why that very moment when i or whoever else upon the basis of this declaration recognize to be legitimate by you republic shall take a stake upon hungarian independence and issue a proclamation declare that a national government exist that very moment the existence of the government will be recognize and the gentleman who will be send to europe will not be send to investigate what chance we have of success but into what diplomatic relation we shall come and what will be the consequence a legitimate commercial intercourse of america then i can fit out man of war -- steamer and everything -- and you law will not prevent I the government of hungary will then be a friendly power and therefore accord to you law everything might be do for the benefit of my country -- and who know what a benefit it might secure to yourselve as regard my use of any pecuniary aid i declare that i will respect the law of every nation where i have the honor even temporarily to be i will employ that aid which the friend of hungary may place at my disposal for the benefit of my country to be sure but only in such a way as be not forbid by or contrary to you law now to make a armed expedition against a friendly power -- that be forbid but if hungary rise upon the basis of a recognize legitimate independence then what be necessary for it to prepare for come into that position be lawful i have take the advice of the highest authority in that respect i be not so bold as to become the interpreter of you law but i have ask be that lawful or be it not from the highest authority in law matter of the united state now to return to hungary in what condition be it in the beginning of my talk i mention the invasion of tartarian horde then the wild beast spread over the land and cause the few remnant of the people to take refuge in some castle and fortress and fortify place and in the most remote and sterile ground the wild beast feed on human blood now again the wild beast be spread terribly and why because to have a single pistol to have a sword or a musket be a crime which be punish by several year ' imprisonment such be now the condition of hungary therefore you may now see that the country be disarm and of what importance be it for that success about which i hear now and then doubt to have arm prepare in a convenient lawful manner -lrb- after this kossuth speak in some detail concern the pecuniary contribution and close with complaint of he painfully over-worked chest which have much impede he speech -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xxix -- ohio and france contrast as republic -lrb- _ reception at cincinnatus _ -rrb- kossuth have be receive by a vast assemblage of the people of cincinnatus be address in they name by the honorable caleb smith from whose speech the follow be extract : -- you progress through a portion of the whole state which originally constitute the american confederacy have call forth such manifestation of public feeling as leave no doubt that the liberty enjoy by the people of those state have create in they heart a generous sympathy for the advocate of civil liberty who have endeavor to establish free institution in europe the brilliant success which attend the first effort of the hungarian patriot excite the hope that the tricoloured flag unfurl on the shore of the danube would like the star and stripe of we own republic become the emblem and the hope of freedom the intervention of russium in violation of the law of nation in defiance of justice and right and in disregard of the public sentiment of the civilized world for a time at last disappointed this hope and the exultation it excite be follow by a mournful sadness when russian arm and domestic treason combine cause the hungarian flag to trail in the dust hungary fail to establish she independence but fail only when success be impossible the effort she have make have not be wholly lose the seed which she have sow in agony and blood will yet sprout and bring forth fruit the memory of she devoted son who have fall in the cause of liberty will be perpetuate upon the living tablet of the heart of freedom 's votary throughout the world the spirit of the martyr shall whisper hope and consolation to the heart of she survive child and from out the dungeon of she captive patriot shall go forth the spirit of liberty to cheer and animate they countryman you be engage in a high and holy mission the redemption of you fatherland from oppression be worthy of you effort and may god prosper they and may you find in this free land such sympathy and aid as will strengthen you heart for the stern trial which await you in you own country kossuth reply : -- sir -- before i answer you let I look over this animated ocean that i may impress upon my memory the look of those who have transform the wilderness of a primitive forest into a immense city of which there exist a prediction that by the year of we lord 2000 it will be the greatest city in the world the west the west the region of the father of river there thou canst see the cradle of a new-born humanity so i be tell by the learn expounder of descriptive geography who believe that they know the world because they have see it on map the west a cradle why a cradle be the sleep place of a child wrap in swaddle clothes and cry for the mother 's milk people of cincinnatus be you that child which awaken in a unwatched moment liberate he tender hand from the swaddle band sweep away by he left arm the primitive forest plant by the lord at creation 's dawn and raise by he right hand this mighty metropolis why if that be you childhood 's pastime i be awed by the presentiment of you manhood 's task for it be write that it be forbid to man to approach too near to omnipotence and that people here which create this rich city and change the native wood of the red man into a flourishing seat of christian civilization and civilized christianity -- into a living workshop of science and art of industry and widely spread commerce and perform this change not like the drop which by fall incessantly through century dig a gulf where a mountain stand but perform it suddenly within the turn of the hand like a magician that people achieve a prouder work than the giant of old who dare to pile os upon pelion but excuse I the comparison be bad those giant of old heap mountain upon mountain with the impious design to storm the heaven you have transform the wilderness of the west into the dwelling-place of a enlighten industrious intelligent christian community that it may flourish a living monument of the wonderful bounty of divine providence -- a temple of freedom which glorify god and bid oppressed humanity to hope and yet when i look at you citizen of cincinnatus i see no race of giant astonishing by uncommon frame : i see man as i be wont to see all my life and i have live almost long enough to have see cincinnatus a small hamlet compose of some modest log-house separate by dense wood where savage beast and savage indian lurk about the lonely settler who as the legend of jacob wetzel and he faithful log tell have to wrestle for life when they leave they poor abode what be the key of this rapid wonderful change the glorious city of old be found by hero whom posterity call demi-god and whose name survive they work by thousand of year who be you hero who stand god-father at the birth of the queen of the west i look to history and find not he name but instead of one mortal man 's renowned name i find in the record of you city 's history a immortal being 's name and that be _ the people _ the word sparkle with the lustre of a life invigorating flame and that flame be liberty freedom regulate by wise institution base upon the great principle of national independence and self-government this be the magical rod by which the great enchanter _ the people _ have achieve this wonderful work sir there be a mighty change go on in human development formerly great thing be do by great man whose name stand in history like milestone mark the march of mankind on the highway of progress it be mankind which march and still it pass unnoticed and unknown of he history have make no record but of the milestone only and have call they great man the lofty frame of individual greatness overshadow the people who be ready to follow but not prepare to go without be lead humanity and its progress be absorb by individuality because the people which stand low in the valley get giddy by look up to the mountain 's top where its leader stand it be the age of childhood for nation child cling to the lead string as to a necessity and feel it a benefit to be lead but the leader of nation change soon into king ambition claim as a right what merit have gain as a free offering arrogance succeed to greatness and out of the child-like attachment for benefit receive the duty of blind obedience be frame by the iron hand of violence and by the craft of impious hypocrisy degrading everything hold for holy by man -- religion itself -- into a tool of oppression on earth it be the era of uncontroverted despotism which with sacrilegious arrogance claim the title of divine rank and mankind advance slowly in progress because it be not conscious of its own aim oppression be take for a gloomy fatality the scene have change nation have become conscious of they rights and destiny and will tolerate no master nor will suffer oppression any longer the spirit of freedom move through the air and remember that you be morally somewhat responsible for it inasmuch as it be you glorious struggle for independence which be the first upheaving of mankind 's heart rouse to self-conscious life even by that first effort she gloriously achieve the national independence of america though gifted with all the blessing of nature 's virginal vitality you would never have succeed to achieve this wonderful growth which we see if you have employ you conquered national independence merely to take a new master for the old one and mark well gentleman a nation may have a master even if it have no king -- a nation may be call a republic and yet be not free -- _ wherever centralization exist there the nation have either sell or lend either alienate or delegate its sovereignty _ and wherever this be do the nation have a master -- and he who have a master be of course not he own master power may be centralize in many -- the centralization by and by will be concentrate in few as in ancient venice or in one as in france at the time of the _ uncle _ some forty year ago and again in france now that the _ nephew _ have he bloody reign for a day yes gentleman if that generation of devoted patriot who achieve the independence of the united state have merely change the old master for a new one with the name of a emperor or a king or of a omnipotent president you country be now just something like brazil or mexico or the republic of south america all of they independent as you know and all except brazil even republic and all rich with nature 's blessing and offer a new home to those who fly from the oppression of the old world -- and yet all of they old before they be young and decrepit before they be strong have the founder of you country 's independence follow this direction which lead the rest of america astray cincinnatus would be a hamlet yet as it be in jacob wetzel 's time and ohio instead of be a first-rate star in the constellation of you republic would be a appendage of neighbouring eastern state -- a not yet explore desert mark in the map of america only by line of northern latitude and western longitude the people a real sovereign you institution secure real freedom because found on the principle of self-government union to secure national independence and the position of a power on earth and all together have no master but god omnipotence not vest in any man in any assembly -- and a open field to every honest exertion -- because civil political and religious liberty be the common benefit to all not limited but by itself -lrb- that be by the unseen but not unfelt influence of self-given law -rrb- that be the key of the living wonder which spread before my eye let I recall to you memory a curious fact it be just a hundred year ago that the first trading house upon the great miamus be build by daring english adventurer at a place later know as laramie 's store then the territory of the twigtwee indian the trade house be destroy by frenchman who possess then a whole world on the continent of america well twenty-four year later france aid you america in its struggle for independence and oh feel not offend in you proud power of to-day when i say that independence would not then have be achieve without the aid of france since that time france have be twice a republic and change its constitution thirteen time and though thirty-six million strong it have lose every foot of land on the continent of america and at home it lie prostrated beneath the foot of the most inglorious usurper that ever dare to raise ambition 's bloody seat upon the ruin of liberty and you republic it have grow a giant of power and ohio out of the ruin of a trading-house into a mighty commonwealth of two million of free and happy man who shout out with a voice like the thunderstorm to the despot of the old world ye shall stop in you ambitious way before the power of freedom ready to protect the common law of all humanity what a glorious triumph of you institution over the principle of centralized government oh may all the generation yet unborn and all the million who will yet gather in this new world of the west which soon will preponderate in the scale of the union where all the west weigh nothing fifty year ago -- may they all ever and ever remember the high instruction which the almighty have reveal in this parallel of different result sir you say that ohio can show no battle field connect with recollection of you own glorious revolution let I answer that the whole west be a monument and cincinnatus the fair cornice of it if you eastern sister state have instruct the world how nation become independent and free the west show to the world what a nation once independent and really free can become allow I to declare that by stand before the world as such a instructive example you exercise the most effective revolutionary propaganda for if the mis-result of french revolution discourage the nation from shake off the ` oppressor ' yoke you victory -- and still more you unparalleled prosperity -- have encourage oppressed nation to dare what you dare egotist and hypocrite may say that you be not responsible for it you have bid nobody to follow you : -- and it may be true that you be not responsible before a tribunal still you be sufficiently free not to feel offend by a true word therefore i say you be responsible before you own conscience for you example have start a new doctrine the teacher of a new doctrine be morally bind not to forsake he doctrine when assail in the person of he disciple \* \* \* \* \* xxx -- war a providential necessity against oppression -lrb- _ to the clergy of cincinnatus _ -rrb- the clergy of cincinnatus address kossuth by the mouth of the rev mr fisher among other topic this gentleman say : -- we wish to _ you _ first and through you to the world to express we respect for those heroic clergyman who dare to offer public prayer to almighty god for the success of you arm we have not forget the manner in which austrium attempt to dragoon they tongue into silence and they soul into abject submission nor can we believe that a country with such pastor -- that a country whose religious interest be confide to man ready to pray against the despot will be suffer by we heavenly father to remain trodden down and to have she name blot out of the history of nation if in the great battle of freedom the heart of the minister of religion at the altar beat in sympathy with the heart of the minister at the council board and the soldier in the battle-field there be then a union of the moral intellectual and physical force of a nation which we have be teach to believe would generally and ultimately be victorious we frankly confess to you that we hope that hungary be not to share the fate of unhappy poland be ground first on the large element of a protestant ministry she embrace and secondly on the advance which the nation be make in a true understanding of the principle of republican freedom we believe the cause of hungary to be just against the usurpation of king and perjure prince -- against the interference of foreign power to assist in tread on the spark of liberty anywhere on the earth and especially in such a land as yours we claim the privilege at the fit time of enter we protest and express toward such act we deepest abhorrence and while we desire most earnestly the advent of universal peace and rejoice that the power of moral principle be increase in the world and anticipate the day when the nation shall learn war no more yet we be fully convince both from the holy scripture and the history of the past that under the overrule providence of god war occasion by the oppression the ambition and the covetousness of man be often the means of break up the stagnant water of superstition and irreligion and secure to the truth a position from which it may most successfully send abroad its light and mould the heart of a nation to religion and peace _ despotism be _ in we view _ a perpetual war of a few upon the many _ and we must unlearn some of the earliest lesson that we mother teach we and we father illustrate in they life before we can cease to sympathize with the assertor of they rights against the force or the fraud of they fellow-men and since the sad issue of revolution after revolution in infidel france there be not a few of we who have indulge the hope -lrb- especially since you visit to we shore -rrb- that in central europe in you native land among a undebauched and a bible-reading people a government might arise that would accord freedom of conscience to all and shine as a light of virtuous republicanism upon the darkness around in meeting you thus we design no mere display no ineffective parade of word we wish to give whatever weight of influence we may bear in this community to the cause of freedom in you native land to assist in secure to you and you nation such aid as a nation situate as we be can _ wisely _ give so as best to subserve the interest of liberty and humanity in all the world we regard the moral influence of this country as of the first importance and the peaceful working of republican institution as a daily protest against despotism and for ourselves we pledge to you and you country that we will in public and private bear you cause upon we heart and invoke in you behalf the intervention of a arm that no earthly power can resist kossuth reply at length the follow be a extract from he speech : -- you have be please to refer to war as under certain circumstance a instrumentality of divine providence -- and indeed so it be great thing depend upon the exact definition of a word there be i suppose nobody on earth who take war for a moral or happy condition every man must wish peace but peace must not be confound with oppression it be we duty i believe to follow the historical advice of the scripture which very often have point out war as a instrumentality against oppression and injustice you have very truly say that despotism be a continued war of the few against the many of ambition against mankind now if that be true -- -lrb- and true it be -- for war be nothing else than a appeal to force -rrb- -- then how can any person claim of oppressed nation not to resort to war who make war those who defend themselves or those who attack other now if it be true that despotism be a continued attack upon mankind then war come from that quarter and i have no where in the world hear that a unjust attack should not be oppose by a just defense it be absurd to entreat nation not to disturb a peace which do not exist what would have become of christianity in europe -lrb- and in further consequence also in america -rrb- if in those time when mohammedanism be yet a conquer power hungary out of love of peace have not oppose mohammedanism in defense of christianity what would have become of protestantism when assail by charle v by philip ii and other do luther or other forbid the use of arm against arm to protect for man the right of private judgment in matter of salvation i have see war i know what a immense machine it be what a immense misfortune and with what suffering it be connect believe I there be no nation which love war but many that fear war less than they hate oppression which prevent both they happiness on earth and the development of private judgment for salvation in eternity you have be please to assure I that you take the cause of hungary for a just cause i most respectfully thank you for it i consider you judgment of immense value in that respect why because you be too deeply penetrate by the sacred mission to which you have devote you life ever to approve anything which you would not consider consistent and in harmony with you position as minister of the gospel and therefore when you give I the verdict of justice for the cause of hungary i take you approbation as a sanction from the principle of the christian religion let I therefore entreat you gentleman to bestow you action you prayer and that which in the gospel be connect with prayer -- watchfulness upon my country 's cause it be not without design that i mention this word watchfulness for it would be not appropriate for I to speak any word which might excite mere passion i rely upon principle in they plainness and make no appeal to blind excitement but i venture to throw out the hint that in certain quarter even the word _ religion _ be employ as a tool against that cause which you pronounce to be just and therefore i may be permit to claim from minister of christ -- from protestant clergyman -- from american protestant clergyman that they will not only pray for that cause but also be watchful against that abuse of religion for the oppression of a just cause you have farther state that as american clergyman you entertain the conviction that a free gospel can only be permanently enjoy under a free civil government now what be free gospel the trumpet of the gospel be of course sound from the moral influence of the truth which be deposit by divine providence in the holy scripture no influence can be more powerful than that of the truth which god himself have reveal and nevertheless you say that for permanent enjoyment of this moral influence the field of free civil government be necessary so it be now let I make the application of these very truth in respect to the moral institution of you country i entirely trust that all other institution which we know now will by and bye disappear before the moral influence of _ you _ institution as be prove by the wonderful development of this country -- but under one condition that the nation be restore to national independence : since so long as absolutist power rule the world there be no place no field _ for _ the moral influence of you institution precisely as the moral influence of the gospel can not spread without a free civil government so the influence of you institution can spread only upon the basis of national independence as a common benefit to every nation you will i hope generously excuse I for have answer you generous sentiment in such a plain manner my indisposition have give I no time to prepare for the honor of meeting you in such a way as i would have wish you have give joy consolation and hope to my heart and encouragement to go on in that way which you honor with you welcome and you sympathy and i shall thank this you generosity in the most effective manner by follow you advice and by further use those exertion which have meet you approbation \* \* \* \* \* xxxi -- on washington 's policy -lrb- _ speech on the anniversary of washington 's birthday cincinnatus _ -rrb- a splendid entertainment be prepare to which six hundred person sit down after the toast many energetic speech be make mr corry say : -- the time have come for we mighty republic to stand by its friend and brave its enemy there be a confederation of tyrant now march across the cinder of europe be we to take no heed of they aggression at we door it be for we to aid the people of the old world against they tyrant as we be aid to get rid of ours ohio will not fail in she duty the president of the evening mr jame j foran observe : -- in 1849 we hold in this city the first meeting i believe in the united state on this subject and express we indignation at the unwarrantable interference of russium we declare it to be we duty as a free and powerful government to notify to russia that she interference in the affair of hungary must cease or the united state would cast they strength on the side of justice and right against tyranny and oppression in the great struggle which be approach between liberty and absolutism we shall be compel to act a part it will not do to rely altogether on either a just cause or the interposition of providence it be well to have both of these but to add to they we own exertion be indispensable to human success here in the wilderness in the bosom of the great west in the city of one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitant whence emanate the first public move in america for he personal cause and also he liberation from captivity do we welcome loui kossuth the champion of self-government in europe kossuth in response say : -- mr president : i consider it a particular favor of providence that i be permit to partake on the present solemn occasion in pay the tribute of honor and gratitude to the memory of you immortal washington a architect have raise a proud and noble building to the service of the almighty he admirer desire to erect a monument to he memory how be it do he name be inscribe upon the wall with these additional word : you seek he monument -- look around let he who look for a monument of washington look around the united state the whole country be a monument to he you freedom you independence you national power you prosperity and you prodigious growth be a monument to washington there be no room leave for panegyric none especially to a stranger whom you have full reason to charge with arrogance be he able to believe that he feeble voice could claim to be notice in the mighty harmony of a nation 's praise let I therefore instead of such a arrogant attempt pray that that god to whose providential intention washington be a glorious instrument may impart to the people of the united state the same wisdom for the conservation of the present prosperity of the land and for its future security which he give to washington for the foundation of it allow I sir to add washington 's wisdom consist in do all which accord to the circumstance _ of he time _ and the condition of he country be necessary to he country 's freedom independence welfare glory and future security i pray to god that the people of this republic and all those whom the people 's confidence have entrust with the honorable charge of direct the helm of the commonwealth may be endow with the same wisdom of do all which _ present _ circumstance and the _ present _ condition of you country point out to be not only consistent with but necessary to you country 's present glory present prosperity and future security surely that be the fittest tribute to the memory of washington that be the most faithful adherence to the doctrine which he bequeath to you by far a better tribute and by far a more faithful adherence than to do literally the same that he do amid circumstance quite different from those you be now surround with and in a condition entirely different from that in which you and the world be now the principle of washington be for ever true and should for ever be the guide star to the united state but to imitate literally the accidental policy of washington would be to violate he principle if the spirit of washington could raise its voice now in this distinguished circle of american patriot it would loudly and emphatically protest against such a course and would denounce it as not only injurious to he memory but also as dangerous to the future of this republic which he found with such eminent wisdom and glorious success i have see sir the people of the united state advise to regard the writings of washington as the mahommedan regard the koran consider everything which be not to be find in the koran as useless to heed now this parallel i indeed take for a very curious compliment to the _ memory of washington _ -- a compliment at which he immortal spirit must feel offended i be sure why to what purpose be the immortal light of heaven beam in man 's mind if it be wise not to make any use of it to what purpose all that assiduous care about public instruction and about the propagation of knowledge and intelligence if the writings of washington be the koran of america forbid the right of private judgment which the great majority of you nation claim as a natural right even in respect to the holy bible that book of divine origin look to the east where the koran rule obstruct with its absolutism the development of human intellect : what do you behold there you behold mighty nation a noble race of man interesting in many respects teem with germ of vitality and still fall fast into decay because doom to stagnation of they intelligence by that blind faith in they koran 's absolute perfection which we see recommend as a model to the people of this republic whose very existence rest on progress indeed gentleman i dare to say that i yield to nobody in the world in reverence and respect to the immortal memory of washington he life and he principle be the guide star of my life to that star i look up for inspiration and advice during the vicissitude of my stormy life hence i draw that devotion to my country and to the cause of national freedom which you gentleman and million of you fellow-citizen and you national government be so kind as to honor by unexampled distinction though you meet it not brighten by success but meet it in the gloomy night of my existence in that helpless condition of a homeless wanderer in which i must patiently bear the title of a _ import rebel _ and of a _ beggar _ in the very land of washington for have dare to do what washington do for have dare to do it with less skill and with less success but heaven know not with less honesty and devotion than he do well it be useless to remark that washington would probably have end with equal failure have he country not meet that foreign aid for which they honourably _ beg _ it be useless to remark that he would undoubtedly have fail if after the glorious battle of yorktown he have meet a fresh enemy of more than two hundred thousand man such as we meet and have be forsake in that new struggle by all the world it be useless to remark that success should not be the only test of virtue on earth and fortune should not change the devotion of a patriot into a outrage and a crime and particularly not when success be only tear out of the hand of patriotism by foreign violence and by the most sacrilegious infraction of the common law of all humanity all this be useless to say i must bear many thing -- must bear even malignity -- but can bear it more easily because against the insult of some who plead the cause of despot in you republic i have for consolation the tranquillity of my conscience the love of my countryman the approbation of generous friend and the sympathy of million in that very land where i meet the title of a _ import rebel _ i be say sir that i yield to no man on earth in reverence to the memory of the immortal washington indeed i consider it not inconsistent with this reverence to say : never let past age bind the life of future -- let no man 's wisdom be _ koran _ to you doom progress to stagnation and judgment to the meager task of a mere rehearse memory thus i would speak should even that which i advocate be contrary to what washington teach -- even then i would appeal from the thought of a man to the spirit of advanced mankind and from the eighteenth century to the present age but fortunately i be not in that necessity what i advocate be not only not in contradiction but in strict harmony with washington 's principle so much so that i have nothing else to wish than that washington 's doctrine should be quote fairly as a system and not by pick out single word and conceal that which give the interpretation to these word indeed i can wish nothing more than that the _ principle _ of washington should be follow and i may also be permit to say that not every word of washington be a principle and that what he recommend as a policy accord to the exigency of he time he never intend to recommend as a rule for ever to be follow even in such circumstance which he with all he wisdom could neither foresee nor imagine and i may be perhaps permit to wish the people of the united state should take for a truth even in respect to the writings of washington what we be teach by the minister of the gospel in respect to the holy scripture -- that by the discretion of private judgment a distinction must be make between what be essential and what be not between what be substantial and what be accidental between what be a principle and what be but a history -lrb- kossuth proceed to argue concern the just interpretation of washington 's word as in he new york speech and continue : -rrb- but what be the present condition upon the basis of which i humbly plead allow I in answer to quote the word of one of you most renowned statesman the present secretary of state you will find then gentleman that every word he then speak be yet more true and more appropriate to-day the holy alliance say mr webster be a alliance of crown against the people -- of sovereign against they own subject -- the union of the physical force of all government against the rights of all people in all country its tendency be to put a end to all nation as such extend the principle of that alliance and the nation be no more there be only king it divide society horizontally and leave the sovereign above and all the people below it set up the one above all rule all restraint and put down the other to be trample beneath we foot this be the condition of thing to which i claim the attention of republican america : moreover for its own interest 's alike i claim its attention to the follow word from the same statesman worthy of the most earnest consideration precisely now-a-days to every american the declaration of -- say : the power have a undoubted right to take a hostile attitude in regard to those state in which the overthrow of the government may operate as a example mark oh mark gentleman how this abominable doctrine be carry out in hungary in prussium in schleswig holstein and in hesse cassel now the american statesman proceed to maintain that every sovereign in europe who go to war _ to repress a example _ be monstrous indeed if this principle be allow what become of the united state be you not as legitimate object for the operation of that principle as any we attempt to set a example on the other side of the atlantic you think that when oppress you might lawfully resist oppression we in hungary think the same but against we be that monstrous principle of armed intervention _ against set up a example _ so let I therefore ask with mr webster : be you so sick of you liberty and its effect as to be willing to part with that doctrine upon which you very existence rest do you forget what you as a people owe to _ lawful resistance _ and be you willing to abandon the law and rights of society to the mercy of the ally despot who have unite to crush they everywhere neutrality why indeed that would be a strange explanation of neutrality if you would sanction by you indifference the hostile alliance of all despot against republican nay against constitutional principle on earth but suppose hungary rise once more to do what washington do -lrb- and be sure it will -rrb- and russium interfere again and you remain again -lrb- what some of you call -rrb- neutral -- that be you remain indifferent -- what be the consequence czar nichola and emperor francis-joseph may buy and carry away arm ammunition armed ship -- nay even armed sympathizer -lrb- if they find they -rrb- -- to murder hungary with and you will protect that commerce and consider it a lawful one but if i buy the same you do not protect that commerce and if i would enlist a armed expedition for what the czar may do against hungary you would send I to prison for ten year be that neutrality the people of hungary crush by violence shall be nothing its sovereign right nothing but the piracy of the czar encroach upon the sacred rights of mine and many other nation shall be regard as legitimate against which the united state though grow to mighty power on earth able without any risk of its own security to maintain the law of nation and the influence of its glorious example should still have nothing to object only because washington more than half a century ago declare neutrality appropriate to the infant condition of he country then and be anxious to gain time that you country might settle and mature its recent institution and progress to that degree of strength when it would be able to defy any power on earth in a just cause no gentleman my principle may be reject by the united state but never will impartial history acknowledge that by do thus the united state follow the principle of washington the ruling policy of washington may be sum up in the word _ national self-preservation _ to which he as the generous emotion of he noble breast prompt be ever incline to subordinate everything and he be right self-preservation must be the chief principle of every nation but the _ mean _ of this self-preservation be different in different time to-day i confidently dare state the duty of self-preservation commend to the united state not to allow that the principle of absolutism should become omnipotent by have a charter guarantee to violate the law of nature and of nature 's god which washington and he heroic associate invoke when they proclaim the independence of this republic a second principle of washington and precisely in regard to foreign nation be to extend you commercial relation that be again a principle gentleman which i boldly can invoke to the support of my humble claim because if the league of despot become omnipotent in europe it be certain that the commerce of republican america will very soon receive a death blow on the other side of the atlantic whereas the maintenance of the law of nation by afford a fair field to hungary italy and germany to settle they account with they own domestic oppressor would open a vast field to you commercial relation larger than imagination can conceive the third principle of washington be to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world well sir i do not solicit alliance i solicit the maintenance of the law of nation that the unholy alliance of despot may not interfere with the natural right of nation upon which yourselve have establish the lofty hall of you national independence it be on the stream of these rights that you be bear on in a rapid and irresistible course of prosperity believe I gentleman that course you can not check -- you could not abandon the privilege upon which you embark without expose to a shipwreck the glorious future of you existence and allow I to state that my poor country have some particular claim to be protect by the consistency of you principle because _ we be the first nation towards which you have not exercise you principle _ you say you recognize every _ de facto _ government well why be this not do with hungary we shake off the yoke of the austrian dynasty we declare we national independence and do thus not in a untimely movement of popular excitement but after we become _ de facto _ independent after we have by crush we enemy in we struggle of legitimate defense and drive he out from we country prove to the world that we have sufficient strength to take we position amongst the independent nation of the earth and still the united state -lrb- which they never yet have do -rrb- withhold the benefit of they recognition which we have full reason to believe would have be immediately follow by other recognition and thus would have prevent the foreign interference of russium by encourage we national independence within those boundary of diplomatic communication which no isolate power dare yet to disregard sir i have study the history of you immortal washington and have from my early youth consider he principle as a living source of instruction to statesman and to patriot i now ask you to listen to washington himself when in that very year in which washington issue he farewell address m adet the french minister present he the flag of the french republic washington as president of the united state answer officially with these memorable word : bear in a land of liberty have early learn its value have engage in a perilous conflict to defend it have devote the best year of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my country my anxious recollection my sympathetic feeling and my best wish be irresistibly attract whensoever in any country i see a oppressed nation unfurl the banner of freedom thus speak washington have i not then full reason to say that if he be alive he generous sympathy would be with I and the sympathy of a washington never be and never would be a barren word washington who raise the word honesty as a rule of policy never would have profess a sentiment which he wisdom as a statesman would not have approve sir here let I end i consider it already as a immense benefit that you generous attention connect the cause of hungary with the celebration of the memory of washington spirit of the depart smile down from heaven upon this appreciation of my country 's cause watch over those principle which thou hast take for the guide star of thy noble life and the time will yet come when not only thine own country but liberate europe also will be a living monument to thy immortal name -lrb- many other toast and highly energetic speech follow which we limit force we to exclude -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xxxii -- kossuth 's credentials -lrb- _ farewell to ohio feb 25th _ -rrb- sir -- i be about to bid a affectionate farewell to cincinnatus and through cincinnatus to the commonwealth of ohio -- that bright morning star of consolation and of hope rise from the west over the gloomy horizon of hungary 's and of europe 's dark night ohio how that name thrill through the very heart of my heart with inexpressible pleasure like the first trumpet sound of resurrection in the ear of the choose just ohio how i will cherish that very name the dearest of my soul after the name of my beloved own dear fatherland how i long for word of flame to express all the warmth of my heartfelt gratitude and still how poor i feel in word precisely because my heart be so full so full that i can scarcely speak -- because every pulsation of my blood be fervent prayer to god for ohio 's glory and happiness let I dispense with empty word -- let what ohio _ do _ _ do _ and _ will do _ for the cause of european freedom be its own monument i have meet many a fair flower of sympathy in this great united republic but all ohio have be to I a bloom garden of sympathy from the first step on ohio 's soil to the last -- along all my way up to cleveland down to columbus and across to cincinnatus and also beyond the line of my joyful way -- in every city in every town in every village in every lonely farm i have meet the same generosity the same sympathy the people penetrate by one universal inspiration of lofty principle tell I everywhere that hungary must yet be free that the people of ohio will not permit the law of nation of justice and of humanity to be trample down by the sacrilegious combination of despotism that the people of ohio take the league of despot against liberty and against the principle of national self-government for a insult offer to the great republic of the west that it take it for a insult which ohio will not bear but will put all the weight of its power into the political scale would that all the united state with equal resolution might spurn that insult to humanity that be the language which ohio speak to I through hundred of thousand of freeman -- that be the language which ohio speak to I through she senator and representative in they high legislative capacity -- that be the language which ohio speak to I through she chief whom it have elevate to govern the commonwealth and to execute the people 's sovereign will the executive power the legislature the people all unite in that harmony of generous protection to the just cause which i humbly plead but that be not all yet sympathy and political protection i have meet also everywhere and have meet it as well in the public opinion of the people as in the executive and legislative department of several state though it be a due tribute of acknowledgment to say that nowhere to that extent and in equal universality as in ohio but that be yet not all the sympathy of ohio be rich in fair fruit of substantial aid -- from the hall of the state legislature down to the humble abode of noble-minded work man -- and association of the friend of hungary spread through that powerful commonwealth promise a permanent noble protection to the cause i plead even the present occasion of bidding farewell to ohio be of such a nature as to entitle I by its very organization to the hope that you consider you noble task of aid the cause of hungary not yet do but that you have determine to go on in a practical direction till the future develop by you active protection prove to be richer yet in fruit than the present be consider the almost universal pronouncement of public opinion in this great and prosperous commonwealth -- consider the practical character of the people of the west the natural efficiency of this organization and _ who _ be those who with generous zeal have devote themselves to carry it out on a large extent -- i may be well excuse for entertain some expectation of no common success -- of a success which also in other part of this great union may prove decisive in its effect no greater misfortune could be meet with than disappointment in such expectation which we have be by the strongest possible motive encourage to conceive to be disappoint in hope we have justly rely on would be beyond all imagination terrible in its consequence i shudder at the very idea of the boundless woe it could not fail to be attend with not for myself -- i attach not much value to my own life -- but for thousand nay for million of man i know gentleman that _ here _ the question be entirely matter of time but in regard to time i be permit to say so much the outbreak of the unavoidable decisive struggle between the two opposite principle of freedom and despotism be hurry on in europe by two great impulse the first be the insupportability of oppression connect with the powerfully develop organization of the oppressed which by its very progress impose the necessity of no delay be pleased earnestly to reflect upon what i rather suggest than explain and be please also to read between the line i of course speak not of anything relate to you country i state simply european fact of which every think man the czar and they satellite themselves be fully aware though the how and the where they can not grasp the second impulse hurry event to a decision be that very combined scheme of activity which the despot of europe too evidently display they know full well that they be on the brink of a inevitable retribution that they crime have push they to the point where either they power will cease for ever to exist or they must risk all for all in former time they rely at the hour of danger upon the generous credulity of nation by seemingly submit when the people arise irresistible they conjure the fury of the storm they save themselves by promise and when the danger be over they restore they abused power by break they oath and by deceive they nation by this atrocious impiety you have see several victorious revolution in europe deprive of they fruit and sink to nothing by have make compromise with royal perjury i be too honest gentleman not to confess openly that i myself share this error of the old world -- i myself plead guilty of that fatal european credulity the tyrant who by falsehood have gain they end be aware that they have no security that the nation have lose faith in they oath and will never be cheat again hence gentleman a very essential novelty in the present condition of europe formerly every revolution be follow by some slight progress in the development of constitutionalism a little more liberty to the press some sort of a trial by jury a nominal responsibility of minister or a mockery of popular representation in the legislature -- something of that sort always result momentarily out of former revolution and then the consciousness of be deceive by vile mockery lead to new revolution but when in 1848 and 1849 we victory in hungary have shake to the very foundation the artificial building of oppression so that there be no more hope leave to tyranny but to shelter itself under the wing of russium the czar tell they -- well i accept the part of become you master ye king and i will help you but _ you must be obedient _ you yourselve have encourage revolution by make concession to they i like not this everlasting resurrection of revolution it disturb my sleep i be not sure not to find it at my own home some fine morning i therefore will help you my servant but under the condition that it be not only the bold hungarian who must be crush it be _ revolution _ which must be crush its very spirit in its very vitality everywhere and to come to this aim you must abandon all shame as to swear promise withdraw every concession make to the spirit of revolution not the slightest freedom no privilege no political right no constitutional aspiration must be permit all and everything must be level by the equality of passive obedience and absolute servitude look to my russium i make no concession i rule with a iron rod and i be obey all you must do the same and not govern but domineer by universal oppression that be my sovereign will -- obey thus speak the czar it be no opinion which i relate it be a fact a historical fact which the czar openly proclaim on several occasion particularly in that characteristic declaration to which the high-minded general cass allude in he remarkable speech on _ non-intervention _ in the senate of the united state on the 10th day of February the czar nichola complain that _ insurrection have spread in every nation with a audacity which have gain new force in proportion to the concession of the government _ declare that he consider it he divine mission to crush the _ spirit of liberty _ on earth which he arrogantly term the spirit of insurrection and of anarchy by this you have the definition of what be mean by the word of war for what principle shall rule _ the issue must be feel not only in europe but here also and everywhere _ the issue will not leave a chance for a new struggle either to king or to nation for a long time perhaps and probably for century in that condition you can see the key of the remarkable fact that when i leave my asiatic prison under the protection of the star-spangled flag -- nation of different climate different language different institution different inclination unite in the pronunciation of sympathy expectation encouragement and hope around my poor humble self -- italian french portuguese the people of england belgian german swiss and swede it be the instinct of common danger it be the instinct of necessary union it be no mere tribute of recognition pay to the important weight of hungary in the scale of this intense universal struggle it be still more a call of distress entrust by the voice of mankind to my care to bring it over to free america as to the natural and most powerful representative of that spirit of liberty against which the league tyrant be wage a war of extermination with inexorable resolution yes it be a call of distress entrust to my care to remind america that there be a tie in the destiny of nation and that those be digging a bottomless abyss who forsake the spirit of liberty when within the boundary of common civilization half the world utter in agony the call of universal distress that be the mission with which i come to you shore and believe I gentleman that be the key of that wonderful sympathy with which the people of this republic answer my humble appeal there be blood from we blood in these noble american heart there be the great heart of mankind which pulsate in the american breast there be the chord of liberty which vibrate to my sigh let ambitious fool let the pigmy who live on the scanty food of personal envy when the very earth quake beneath they foot let even the honest prudence of ordinary household time measure eternity with that thimble with which they be wont to measure the bubble of small party interest and take the dreadful roaring of the ocean for a storm in a water glass let those who believe the weather to be calm because they have draw a nightcap over they ear and bury they head into pillow of domestic comfort do not hear satan sweeping in a hurricane over the earth let envy ambition blindness and the pettifogging wisdom of small time artistically investigate the question of my official capacity or the nature of my public authority let they scrupulously discuss the immense problem whether i still possess or possess no longer the title of my once-governorship let they ask for credentials discuss the limit of my commission as representative of hungary i pity all such frog and mouse fighting i claim no official capacity -- no public authority -- no representation boast of no commission of no write and seal credentials i be nothing but what my generous friend the senator of michigan have justly style I a private and banish man but in that capacity i have a nobler credential for my mission than all the clerk of the world can write the credential that i be a man -- the credential that i be a patriot -- the credential that i love with all sacrifice devotion my oppressed fatherland and liberty the credential that i hate tyrant and have swear everlasting hostility to they the credential that i feel the strength to do good service to the cause of freedom good service as perhaps few man can do because i have the iron will in this my breast to serve faithfully devotedly indefatigably that noble cause i have the credential that i trust to god in heaven to justice on earth that i offend no law but cling to the protection of law i have the credential of my people 's undeniable confidence and its unshaken faith to my devotion to my manliness to my honesty and to my patriotism which faith i will honestly answer without ambition without interest as faithfully as ever but more skilfully because school by adversity and i have the credential of the justice of the cause i plead and of the wonderful sympathy which not my person but that cause have meet and meet in two hemisphere these be my credentials and nothing else to whom this be enough he will help I so far as the law permit and be he good pleasure to whom these credentials be not sufficient let he look for a better accredit man i have too lively a sentiment of my own modest dignity ever to condescend to polemic about my own personal merit or ability i believe my life have be public enough to appertain to the impartial judgment of history but it may have perhaps interested you to hear how in a small and inconsiderable circle of the hungarian emigration the idea be start that i must be oppose because i have declare against all compromise with the house of austrium or with royalty and because by declare that my direction will be in every case only republican i make every arrangement without revolution impossible that i should be thus attack at this crisis do look like a endeavor to check a benefit to my country but i can not forbear humbly to beseech you do not therefore think less favourably of my nation and of the hungarian emigration for which i be sorry that i can do very little because i devote myself and all the success i may meet with to a higher aim -- to my country 's freedom and independence believe I gentleman that my country and its exile martyr son be highly worthy of you generous sympathy though some few of the number do not always act as they should they be but few who do so and it would be unjust to measure all of we by the fault of some few upon the whole i be proud to say that the hungarian emigration be scrupulous to merit generous sympathy and to preserve the honor of the hungarian name remember that though you be republican still here in the very metropolis of ohio a man be find to lecture for russo-austrian despotism and to lecture with the astonishing boldness of a immense ignorance but that good man i can dismiss with silence the more because it be with high appreciation and warm gratitude that i see a honorable gentleman animated with the most generous sentiment of justice and right take immediately upon himself the task of refutation i may perhaps be permit to remark that that learn and honorable gentleman besides have nobly advocate the cause of freedom justice and truth have also well merit of he co-religionary who belong together with himself _ to the roman catholic church _ gentleman i have but one word yet and it be a sad one -- the word of farewell cincinnatus ohio farewell may the richest blessing of the almighty rest upon thee in every heart and in the heart of my people thy name will for ever live a glorious object for we everlasting love and gratitude \* \* \* \* \* xxxiii -- harmony of the executive and of the people in america -lrb- _ speech at indianapolis _ -rrb- kossuth be receive at the state house of indianapoli by governor wright who in the course of he address say : although i participate with my fellow-citizen in the pleasure occasion by you presence among we yet it be not as a _ individual _ that i greet you with the word of welcome and hospitality no sir -- it be in the name of the people of the state whom i represent and whose warrant i feel that i have and i bid you welcome to-day and assure you not only of my own but of they sympathy and encouragement in the great cause you so ably represent he close with the word : if it shall be you fortune to lead you countryman again in the contest for liberty be assure that the people of the united state at least will not be indifferent nor if need be inactive spectator of a conflict that may involve not only the independence of hungary but the freedom of the world again i bid you a most cordial welcome to the state of indiana kossuth reply : -- governor -- amongst all that i have be permit to see in the united state 's nothing have more attract my attention than that part of you democratic institution which i see develop in the mutual and reciprocal relation between the people and the constitute public authority in that respect there be a immense difference between europe and america for the understanding of which we have to take into account the difference of the basis of the political organization and together with it what the public and social life have develop in both hemisphere the great misfortune of europe be that the present civilization be bear in those curse day when republicanism set and royalty rise it be a gloomy change nearly twenty century have pass and torrent of blood have water the red-hot chain and still the fetter be not break nay -- it be we lot to have bear its burning heat -- it be we lot to grasp with iron hand the wheel of its crush car destiny -- no providence -- be hold the balance of decision the tongue be waver yet one slight weight more into the one or into the other scale will again decide the fate of age of century upon this mischievous basis of royalty be raise the building of authority not of that authority which command spontaneous reverence by merit and the value of its service but of that authority which oppress liberty hence the authority of a public officer in unfortunate europe consist in the power to rule and to command and not in the power to serve he country well -- it make man oppressive downward while it make they creep before those who be above law be not obey out of respect but out of fear a man in public office take himself to be better than he countryman and become arrogant and ambitious and because to hold a public office be seldom a claim to confidence but commonly a reason to lose confidence it be not a mark of civic virtue and of patriotic devotion but a stain of civic apostacy and of venality it be not a claim to be honor but a reason to be distrust so much so that in europe the sad word of the poet be indeed a still more sad fact -- when vice prevail and impious man bear sway the post of honor be a private station so be it even in my own dear fatherland before we unfortunate but glorious revolution of 1848 the principle of royalty have so much spoil the nature and envenom the character of public office that -lrb- of course except those who derive they authority by election -- which we for we municipal life conserve amongst all the corruption of european royalty through century -rrb- no patriot accept a office in the government : to have accept one be to have resign patriotism it be one of the brightest principle of we murder revolution -- that public office be restore to the place of civic virtue and open to patriotism by be raise from the abject situation of a tool of oppression to the honorable position of serve the country well alas that bright day be soon overpower by the gloomy cloud of despotism bring back to we sunny sky by the freezing gale of russian violence and on the continent of europe there be night again there be scarcely one country where the wish and the will of the people be reflect in the government there be no government which can say : my voice be the echo of the people 's voice -- i say what my people feel i proclaim what my people will i be the embodiment of he principle and not the controller of he opinion : the people and myself -- we be one no on the continent of europe people and government be two hostile camp what immense mischief pregnant with oppression and with nameless woe be encompass within the circle of this single fact how different the condition of america it be not _ man _ who rule but _ the law _ and law be obey because the people be respect the general will by respect the law public office be a place of honor because it be the field for patriotic devotion government have not the arrogant pretension to be the master of the people but have the proud glory to be its faithful servant a public officer cease not to be a citizen he have doubly the character of a citizen by share in and by execute the people 's will and whence this striking difference it be because the civilization of america be found upon the principle of democracy it be bear when royalty decline and republicanism rise hence the delightful view not less instructive than interesting that here in america instead of the clash dissonance between the word government and people we see they melting into one accord of harmony thus here the public opinion of the people never can fail to be a direct rule for the government and reciprocally the word of the government have the weight of a fact by the people 's support when you government speak it be the people which speak sir i most humbly thank you excellency that you have be please to afford to I the benefit of hearing and see that delightful as well as happy harmony between the people and the government of the state of indiana in the support of that noble and just cause which i plead on the issue of which not the future of my country only depend but together with it the future condition of all those part of we globe which be confine within the boundary of christian civilization which be sure of it gentleman in the ultimate issue will have the same fate sir it be not without reason that at indianapoli in particular -- and to you excellency the truly faithful the high-minded and the deservedly popular chief magistrate of this commonwealth i speak that word it be not the first time that you excellency surround as now have speak as the honor organ of the public opinion of indiana it be not yet two year since you excellency do the same on the occasion of a visit of the favorite son of kentucky governor crittenden i well remember the topic of you eloquence it be the solicitude of indiana in regard to the glorious union of these republic may god preserve it for ever but precisely because you the favorite son of indiana and the honor representative of the sovereign people of indiana -- in one accord of perfect harmony esteem the gordian knot of the union above all allow I to say once more that if the united state permit the principle of non-interference to be blot out from the code of nation on earth foreign interference mingle with some domestic discord perhaps with that which two year ago call forth you patriotic solicitude for the union yes foreign interference mingle with some of you domestic discord will be the alexander who will cut asunder the gordian knot of you union in this we present century republic exist upon principle : they be secure only when they act upon principle he who do not accept a principle assert by another will not long enjoy the benefit of it himself and nation always perish by they own sin oh may those whom you united people entrust with the noble care to be guardian of you union -- be please to consider that truth ere it be too late sir to the state of indiana i be in many respects particularly oblige true i have have invitation to visit many other state but the invitation from the state of indiana be first receive please to accept my warmest thanks i have see in other state a harmony between the people and the government but nowhere have the governor of a state condescend to represent the people in a public welcome nowhere step out as the orator of the people 's sympathy and its sentiment i most humbly thank you for this honor in maryland the governor introduce I to the legislature in pennsylvanium the chief magistrate be the organ of a common welcome of the legislature and citizen in massachusett he take the lead as the people 's elect in recommend my principle to the legislature -- and in ohio the chief magistrate by accept the presidency of the association of the friend of hungary become generally the executive of the people 's practical sympathy which so magnanimously respond to the many political manifestation of its representative in the legislature let I hope sir that as you have be generously pleased to be the interpreter of indiana 's welcome and sympathy you will also not refuse to become the chief executive magistrate to the practical development of the same i may cordially thank in the name of my cause the people of indiana its governor and representative for the high honor of the legislature 's invitation and of this public welcome \* \* \* \* \* xxxiv -- importance of foreign policy and of strengthen england -lrb- _ speech at louisville march 6th _ -rrb- at the court house louisville kossuth be address by bland ballard esq and reply as follow : whatever be the immediate issue of that discussion about foreign policy which now so eminently occupy public attention throughout the united state from the capitol and white-house at washington down to the lonely farm of you remotest territory one fact i have full reason to take for sure and that be : that when the trumpet-sound of national resurrection be once bear over the wave of the atlantic announce to you that nation have rise to assert those rights to which they be call by nature and nature 's god -- when the roaring of the first cannon-shot announce that the combat be begin which have to decide which principle be to rule over the christian world -- absolutism or national sovereignty -- there be no power on earth which could induce the people of the united state to remain inactive and indifferent spectator of that great struggle in which the future of the christian world -- yes the future of the united state themselves be to be decide the people of the united state will not remain indifferent and inactive spectator and will not authorize will not approve any policy of indifference you yourself have tell I so sir in the position of every considerable country there be a necessity of a certain course to adopt which can not be avoid and may be almost call destiny the duty as well as the wisdom of statesman consist in the ability to steer in time the vessel into that course which if they neglect to do in time the price will be higher and the profit less there be scarcely anything which have more astonished I than the fact -- that for the last thirty-seven year almost every christian nation have share the great fault of not care much about what be call foreign matter foreign policy precisely the great nation england france america which might have regulate the course of they government for a very considerable period abandon almost entirely that part of they public concern which with great nation be the most important of all because it regulate the position of the country in its great national capacity the slightest internal interest be discuss publicly and regulate previously by the nation before the government have to execute it but as to the most important interest -- the national position of the country and its relation to the world secret diplomacy a fatality of mankind step in and the nation have to accept the consequence of what be already do though they subsequently reprove it in england i four month ago avowed that all the interior question together can not equal in importance the exterior _ there _ be sum up the future of britain : and if the people of england do not cut short the secrecy of diplomacy -- if it do not in time take this all absorb interest into its own hand as it be wont to do with every small home interest it will have to meet immense danger very soon as this danger have already seriously accumulate by former neglect here too in the united state there be no possible question equal in importance to foreign policy and especially in regard to european matter and i say that if the united state do not in due time adopt such a course as will prevent the czar of russium and he despotic satellite from believe that the united state give they entirely free field to regulate the condition of europe which can not fail to react morally and materially on you condition then indeed embarrassment suffering and danger will accumulate in a very short time over you great britain it be clear as matter now stand can avoid a war with the continental power of europe only by join they alliance or at least by give they security that england will not only not support the liberal movement on the continent but that it will submit to the policy of the absolutist power it be not impossible that england will yield do not forget gentleman that a english ministry be it tory or whig be always more or less aristocratic and it be in the nature of aristocracy that it may love its country well but indeed aristocracy more there be therefore always some inclination to be on good term with whoever be a enemy to what aristocracy consider its own enemy that be democracy this consideration together with the above mention carelessness of the people about foreign policy give you the key to many event which else it would be impossible to understand people against another people should never feel hatred but brotherly sympathy the memory of oppression suffer from government should never be impart to nation and child should never be hate despise or punish because they father have sin we hungarian wrestle for century with turkey and now we be friend true friend and natural ally against a common enemy several of my own ancestor lose they life in turkish war or they property in ransom out of turkish captivity yet to I it be a turkish sultan who save my life and give bread to thousand of my countryman which no other power do on earth such be the change of time it be russium which crush my bleeding fatherland yet the inexorable hatred of my heart do not extend to the people of russium i love that people -- i pity its poor unfortunate instrument of despotism wherever there be a people there be my love therefore let the passionate excitement of past time subside before the prudent advice of present necessity you be blood from england 's blood bone from its bone and flesh from its flesh the anglo-saxon race be the kernel around which gather this glorious fruit -- you republic every other nationality be oppress it be the anglo-saxon alone which stand high and erect in its independence you the younger brother be entirely free because republican they the elder brother be monarchical but they have a constitution and they have many institution which even you retain and by retain they have prove that they be institution congenial to freedom and dear to freemen the free press the jury free speech the freedom of association the institution of municipality the share of the people in the legislature be english institution the inviolability of person and the inviolability of property be english principle england be the last stronghold of these principle in europe be this not enough to make you stand side by side with those principle in behalf of oppressed humanity if the united state and england unite in policy now and make by they impose attitude a breakwater to the ambitious league of despotism the anglo-saxon race with all who gather around that kernel will not only have the glorious pleasure of have save the christian world from be absorb by despotism but you especially will have the noble satisfaction of have contribute to the progress and to the development of freedom in england scotland and ireland themselves : for the principle of national sovereignty independence and self-government when restore on the continent of europe must in a beneficent manner reach upon those island themselves they may remain monarchical if it be they will to do so but the parliamentary omnipotence which absorb all that _ you _ call _ state _ rights and self-government will yield to the influence of europe 's liberated continent england will govern its own domestic concern by its own parliament and scotland its own and ireland its own just as the state of you galaxy do the three country be destine to mutual connection by they geographical relation by far more than new york with louisiana or carolina with californium by conserve the state-rights of self-government to all of they they will unite in a common government for the common interest as you have do _ union and not unity must be the guide star of the future _ with every power compose of several distinct body and though i be a republican more perhaps than thousand who be citizen of a republic inasmuch as i have know all the curse of have have a king -- still such a development of great britain 's future be it even connect with monarchy i a true republican would hail with fervent joy to contribute to such a future i indeed should consider more practical support to the cause of freedom to the cause of ireland itself than out of passionate aversion either for past or present wrong to discourage nay almost force great britain to submit to the threatening attitude of despot or even to side with they against liberty out of such a submission there can never result any good to any one in the world and certainly none to you -- none to the nation of europe -- none to ireland -- but increase oppression to europe and ireland and danger to you yourselve i therefore say that a war side by side with england against the league despot if war should become a necessity be not a idea to look on in advance with aversion you have unite with england on a far less important occasion and should england _ not _ yield to the despot i most confidently ask whoever in the united state incline to judge matter accord to the true interest of he country and not by private passion whether you _ could _ remain indifferent in a struggle the issue of which either would make england omnipotent on earth or crush liberty down throughout the world leave america expose to the pressure of victorious despotism and before all exclude republican america from every political and commercial relation with all europe should england see that she will not stand alone in protest against interference she will she must protest against it because it be the condition of she own future but if the united state should again adhere to the policy of indifference -lrb- which be no policy at all -rrb- then indeed england may perhaps yield to the threatening attitude of the absolutist power the policy of the united state may now decide the direction of the policy of england and thus prevent immense mischief incalculable in its consequence even for the future of the united state themselves it be here i take the opportunity briefly to refer to a assertion of a american statesman who hold a high place in you affection and in my respect he advance the theory that should you now take the course which i humbly claim the despot of europe would be provoke by you example to interfere with you institution and turn upon you in the hour of you weakness and exhaustion because you have set a example of interference i indeed be at a loss to understand that be it interference i claim no precisely the contrary if you now declare that you very existence be found on that principle of the eternal law of nature and of nature 's god -- that every nation have the independent right to regulate its domestic concern to fix its institution and its government -- you can not contemplate with indifference that the absolutist power form a league of mutual support against this principle of mankind 's common law you therefore protest against this principle of foreign interference i indeed can not understand by what logic such a protest could be take up by the despotic power as a pretext for interference in you domestic concern my logic be entirely different it run thus if you country remain a indifferent spectator of the violation of the law of nation by foreign interference _ then _ it have establish a precedent -- it have consent that the principle of interference become interpolate into the book of international law and you will see the time when the league of despot command the whole force of oppressed europe will remind you thus : russium have interfere in hungary because it consider the example set up by hungary dangerous to russia america have silently recognize the right of that interference france have interfere in rome because the example of the roman democracy be dangerous to prance america have silently agree the absolutist government in protection of they divine right have league in a saintly alliance with the openly avowed purpose to aid one another by mutual interference against the spirit of revolution and the anarchy of republicanism america have not protest against it therefore the principle of foreign interference against every dangerous example have by common consent of every power on earth -- contradict by none not even by america -- become a established international law and remind you thus they will speak to you in the very word of that distinguished statesman to whom i respectfully allude you have quit the ground upon which you national existence be found you have consent to the alteration of the law of nation -- the existence of you republic be dangerous to we _ we therefore believe that you anarchical -lrb- that be republican -rrb- doctrine be destructive of and that monarchical principle be essential to the peace and security and happiness of we subject will obliterate the bed which have nourish such noxious weed we will crush you down as the propagandist of doctrine too destructive to the peace and good order of the world _ i have quote the very word very unexpectedly give to publicity -- word which i out of respect and personal affection do not answer then precisely because i take the interview for a private one even now i refrain from enter into further discussion out of the same consideration of respect though i be challenge by this unlooked for publicity i will say nothing more but after have quote the very word i leave to the public opinion to judge whether they authority be against or for a national protest against the principle of foreign interference let once the principle become establish with you silent consent and you will soon see it bring home to you and bring home in a moment of domestic discord which russian secret diplomacy and russian gold will skilfully mix you may be sure of it and this mighty union will be shake by that very principle of foreign interference which you silently let be establish as a uncontroverted rule for the despot of the earth great country be under the necessity of hold the position of a power on earth if they do not thus foreign power dispose of they most vital interest indifference to the condition of the foreign world be a wilful abdication of they duty and of they independence neutrality as a constant rule be impossible to a great power only small country as switzerland and belgium can exist upon the basis of neutrality great power may remain neutral in a particular case but they can not take neutrality for a constant principle and they chiefly can not remain neutral in respect to principle great power can never play with impunity the part of no power at all neutrality when take _ as a principle _ mean indifference to the condition of the world indifference of a great power to the condition of the world be a chance give to foreign power to regulate the interest of that indifferent foreign power look in what light you appear before the world with you policy of indifference look at the instruction of you navy in the mediterranean recently publish forbid american officer even to speak politics in europe look at the correspondence of you commodore and consul frighten to they very soul that a poor exile on board a american ship be cheer by the people of italy and france and charge he for the immense crime of have meet sympathy without any provocation on he part look at the cry of astonishment of european writer that american in europe be so little republican look how french napoleonist papers frown indignantly at the idea that the congress of the united state dare to honor my humble self look how they consider it almost a insult that a american minister true to he always profess principle dare to speak about european politics look how one of my aristocratical antagonist who quietly keep house in france where i be not permit to pass and who a tool in other hand would wish to check my endeavor to benefit my country because he would like to get home in some other way than by a revolution and into a republic -- look how he from paris in london papers dare to scorn the idea that america could pretend to weigh anything in the scale of european event do you like this position free republican of america and yet that be you position in the world now and that position be the consequence of you adhering to you policy of indifference at a time when you need to act like

england and america while he be yet a helpless and powerless refugee within turkish hospitality but when the people be gather around he in free country shoulder to shoulder -- when even the heart of statesman begin to open to he and hope dawn in the hungarian sky once more then it be these arrow of detraction darken the air shot from the court of the french usurper or from the pensioner of autocratic bounty you patient labor and forbearance in you country 's cause while thus assail have win for you sir we sincere respect and another wreath at the hand of the muse of history kossuth reply : gentleman -- during my brief sojourn in you hospitable city i have hear so much local pettiness and so much hypocritical tactic of man import from austrium to advocate the cause of russo-austrian despotism in republican america and chiefly in you city here that indeed i begin to long for the pure air where the merry sunshine as well as the melancholy drop of rain the roaring of the thunder storm equally as the sigh of the breeze tell to the oppressor and they tool and not only to the oppress that there be a god in heaven who rule the universe by eternal law the almighty father of humanity omnipotent in wisdom bountiful in he omnipotence just in he judgment and eternal in he love the lord who give strength to the boy david against goliath who often make out of humble individual efficient instrument to push forward the condition of mankind towards that destiny which he merciful will have assign to it -- he will against which neither the proud ambition of despot nor the skill of they obsequious tool can prevail -- in he i put my trust and go cheerfully on in my duty i be in the right way to benefit the cause noble and just and great to which i devoted my life for if there be no success in what i be engage the despot would neither fear nor hate nor persecute I they persecution impart more hope to my breast than all you kindness and i give you my word that if i have the consciousness of have well merit in my past the hatred and the fear of tyrant and they instrument so may god bless I as i will do all a mortal man can do to merit that hatred and that fear still more why be i not stand on the bank of the mississippus cheer welcome and support as warmly and as heartily as when i step first upon you glorious shore opposition hostility venomous calumny have exhaust all mean to check the sympathy of the people and have that sympathy subside have it abate be it check no it roll on swell as i advance -- here i have again a impose evidence before my eye here in st loui my namesake city where so much and that so perseveringly be do to prevent this evidence yes it roll and will roll on swell till it will finally submerge all endeavor to mislead the instinct of freeman to fetter the energy of the nation to stifle its spirit and to check the grow aspiration of the people 's upright heart when the struggle be about principle indifference be suicide nay indifference be impossible : for indifference about the fate of that principle upon which you national existence and all you future rest -- be passive submission to the opposite principle -- it be almost equivalent to a alliance with the despot _ he who be not for freedom be against freedom _ there be no third choice the people 's instinct feel the danger of lose a irreparable opportunity and hence the fact never yet meet in history that a homeless exile become a object of such sympathy rolling on like a sea in spite of all the passionate rage of my enemy and all the christian tolerance of the reverend father jesuit which they in such a evident manner show to I it be time to advertise they by a few remark that i be aware of they hostility and ready to meet it openly i make this advertisement by design here because it be not my custom to attack from behind or in the dark mine be not the famous doctrine _ that the end sanctify the means _ i like to meet the enemy face to face -- a fair field and fair arm and in one thing more i will not imitate my reverend opponent i will never indulge in any personality never act otherwise than become to a gentleman if they choose to pursue a different course let they do so and let they earn the fruit of it my humble person i entirely submit to the good pleasure of they passion if they tell you gentleman that i be no great man they speak the truth be on good term with my conscience i do not much care to be on bad term with czar and emperor they obedient servant and the reverend father jesuit nay if i be on good term with they i scarcely could remain on good term with my conscience so much for myself -- now a few word as to the question between we i be claim moral and material aid against that czar of russium who be the most bloody persecutor of roman catholic the present pope himself before the revolution when he be yet more of a high priest than of a italian despot and care more about spiritual than temporal business openly and bitterly complain in the council of the cardinal against that bloody persecution which the roman catholic have suffer from the czar of russium now consider that i plead for republican principle to which the reverend father jesuit should be _ here _ warmly attach if they be willing to have the reputation of good citizen and not to be traitor to you republic which afford to they not only the protection of its law but also the full enjoyment of all the privilege of you republican freedom -- it be indeed a strange striking fact to see these reverend father here in a republic so warmly advocate the cause of despotism and so passionately persecute the cause i humbly plead which at the same time be the cause of political freedom and religious liberty for numerous million of roman catholic throughout europe as i be somewhat acquaint with the terrible history of that order i think to find the explanation of this striking fact in the historical ambition of that order to rule the world -- this they everlasting standard idea to which they in all time sacrifice everything and misuse even the holiest of all religion as a instrument to that ambition but here in st loui i get hold of a definite circumstance which make the matter quite clear i hold in my hand the print catalogue of the society of jesuit in the province of missourus as they term you state herein i see that amongst the thirty-five member officiate in the college of the father jesuit in st loui there be not less than _ eight _ reverend father jesuit import from austrium now you see why i be so persecute here this plain fact tell the story of a big book but amongst all that the reverend gentleman oppose to I there be only two consideration to which the honor of my cause and of my nation force I to answer in a few remark they charge against I that my cause be hostile to the roman catholic religion and to get the irish citizen to side with they for the support of russo-austrian despotism they charge I that i be no friend of ireland i as to the catholic religion -- i indeed be a protestant not only by birth but also by conviction and warmly penetrate by this conviction i would delight to see the same share by the whole world but before all i be mortally oppose to intolerance and to sectarism i consider religion to be a matter of conscience which every man have to arrange between god and himself and therefore i respect the religious conviction of every man i claim religious liberty for myself and my nation and must of course respect in other the right i claim for myself there be nothing in the world capable to rouse a greater indignation in my breast than religious oppression but particularly i respect the catholic religion as the religion of some seven million of my countryman to whom i be bind in love in friendship in home recollection in gratitude and in brotherhood with the most sacred tie and i be proud to say that as in general it be a pre-eminent glory of my country to be attach to the principle of full religious liberty without any restriction for all to all so it be the particular glory of my roman catholic countryman not to be second to any in the world on the one side in attachment to they own religion and on the other side in toleration for other religion the austrian dynasty have be continually encroach upon the chartered right of protestantism who be those who struggle in the first rank for we rights we roman catholic countryman it be a glorious sight almost unparalleled in history but be also fully appreciate by the hungarian protestant all of we man by man would rather sacrifice life and blood and goods than to allow that a hair 's breadth should be crush from the religious liberty of we roman catholic countryman now what position take the roman catholic of hungary in we past struggle there be not only no difference between they and the protestant in they devotion for we country 's freedom and independence but they accord to the importance of they number take in the struggle a very pre-eminent part the roman catholic bishop of hungary protest against the perjurious treachery of the dynasty many of they suffer even now for they devotion to justice liberty and right and who be the jesuit who dare to affirm that he be more devoted to the catholic religion than the bishop of hungary we battalion be fill with roman catholic volunteer catholic priest lead they faithful flock to the battle field we national convention be compose in majority of catholic -- all the catholic population without any exception consent to and cheer enthusiastically my be elect governor of hungary though i be a protestant i have and i have they friendship they devotion they support and when i form the first ministry of independent hungary not only a full half of the new ministry i entrust to roman catholic but especially i nominate a roman catholic bishop to be minister of public instruction and all the protestant of my country hail the nomination with applause such be the cause of hungary who dare now to charge I that that cause be hostile to the roman catholic religion but i be ally with mazzinus with the roman and with the italian thus go on the charge : and these curse italian be enemy to the pope not to the pope as high priest of the roman catholic church but as despotic sovereign of rome and he corrupted temporal government -- the worst of human invention how long have it be a principle of the roman catholic religion that the roman should not be republican and that the high priest of the roman church should be a despotic sovereign over the roman nation and in that capacity be a devoted ally and obedient servant to the czar of russium the swear enemy and bloody persecutor of roman catholicism why when in 1849 the french republic send a army against the roman republic to restore the pope not to he spiritual authority because that be by nobody contradict but to he temporal despotism the whole danger could have be avert by the roman by become _ en masse _ protestant the idea be pronounce in rome and not a single roman accept it they prefer to struggle without hope of victory -- they prefer to bleed and to die rather than to abandon they faith now who can dare to insult that people -- who can dare to insult the roman catholic of hungary croatium italy germany poland france -- who can dare to insult the thousand of thousand of roman citizen of the united state -- senator governor judge -- man of all public and private position -- who can dare to insult they as hostile to they own religion because they unite to support that cause which i plead and because they side with republican freedom with civil and religious liberty against russo-austrian despotism who can dare to affirm that he represent the catholic religion if three million of catholic roman do not represent it the reverend father jesuit perhaps i take the liberty to say in a few word : they be that society which clement xiv the high priest of the roman catholic church abolish as dangerous to the roman catholic religion they be those whom every roman catholic king exclude from he territory as dangerous to religion and social order they be those the ascendancy of whom have always be a period of disaster and confusion to the roman catholic church they be those who now make a alliance or rather a compact of submission with the czar of russium like that which evil-doer accord to the superstition of past age make with the evil spirit and here in free republican america they plead the cause of russian despotism the cause of that czar who be the relentless persecutor of catholicism who force the unite greek catholic in the polish province by every imaginable cruelty to abjure they connection with rome and carry out at a far greater expense of human life than ferdinand and isabellum or loui xiv the most stupendous proselytism which violence have yet achieve more than a hundred thousand human being have die of misery or under the lash as the minsk nun be prove to have be kill before he terrify these unhappy million into a submission against which they conscience revolt yet with this man red with catholic blood and damned with the million curse of they co-religionist the rev father jesuit be in alliance and why because it be a characteristic of that order to be ambitious to rule the world to achieve this they have now make the pope the obedient satrap of the czar into the enormity of this enlighten catholic see clearly roman catholic of hungary of poland of italy germany and france have understand this be it possible that those of this republic should less understand it why in italy and rome itself a majority of the catholic clergy be hostile to the temporal authority of the pope and sympathize with mazzinus so generally that of _ seventeen _ conspirator recently arrest for conspire in favor of the republic against austrium _ sixteen _ be _ priest _ belong to the humbler order of the clergy gentleman i be sorry to have to argue such a question in the united state if it be indeed true that amongst the roman catholic here a opposition be get up against we cause let they remember that in oppose I they oppose the independence and freedom of million of hungarian catholic -- of catholic italy -- of the catholic half of germany and of catholic france they be support the czar the most bloody enemy of they religion yet i be glad to be able to say that not all the roman catholic here be oppose to I i have warm friend and kind protector among they the gallant general shield -- mr downs the senator from louisiana -- the warm-hearted governor of maryland -- judge le grand at baltimore and many other of my kindest friend be roman catholic from new york onward multitude of roman catholic have share the general sympathy and why not surely freedom be a treasure to every religious denomination whatsoever -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- footnote \* : some sentence have be add from the pittsburg speech at the end of which the same subject be treat -rrb- so much for the charge that the cause which i plead -- the cause of million of roman catholic -- be hostile to the roman catholic religion should i be force to enter upon this topic once more i will take the heart-revolting history of those who have thus calumniate we cause into my hand and recall to the memory of public opinion the terrible page of blood ambition countless crime and intolerance but i hope there will be no occasion for it ii now as to ireland where be a man on earth with uncorrupted soul and with liberal instinct in he heart who would not sympathize with poor unfortunate ireland where be a man loving freedom and right in whom the wrong of green erin would not stir the heart who could forbear warmly to feel for the fatherland of the grattan of o'connell and of wolfe tone i indeed be such that wherever be oppression and a people there be my love but why do i not plead erin 's wrong i be ask my answer be : be i not plead the principle of liberty and be the cause of freedom not the cause of ireland i see all the despot of the european continent unite in a crusade against liberty there be two power still neutral the position of which may well decide for or against despotism these two power be great britain and america if the almighty bless my endeavor -- if i could succeed to contribute something that america and by its influence over the public opinion of the people of england great britain itself should side with liberty from whatever consideration -- from whatever interest against despotism -- then indeed i boldly declare before god and man that i have achieve a greater benefit and do a better service to the future of ireland than all who go about loudly cry about erin 's wrong and not do anything for the triumph of that cause which be about to be decide and be the cause of all nation who be oppressed and of all who be or will be free whereas if by unite in the chorus of empty word i should contribute to alarm not only the government but also the people of england and to force that government to side with despotism in the decisive struggle against liberty -lrb- to which that government be as it be aristocratical feel but too much inclined -rrb- then indeed i be sure i should do such a wrong to the future of ireland as the sacrifice of my life and torrent of blood and the suffering of generation could not expiate be sure therefore gentleman that every man who plead for liberty plead for ireland be sure that every blow stricken for liberty be stricken also for ireland that not always the most noisy be the best friend and prudent activity be often better service than any show of eloquent word and so let I hope that while it be sure that he who be for freedom be for ireland it also will be find that irish blood can never be against liberty and as to you all gentleman let I hope that however the advocate of despotism may try to mislead public opinion in free america the uncorrupted noble instinct of the people will prove to the world that it be not in vain that the down-trodden spirit of liberty raise the sign of distress towards you and that the wrong and the oppress can confidently appeal for help for justice and for redress to the free and powerful republic of america i thank you gentleman for the patience with which you have listen during this torrent of rain it show that you sympathy be warm and sincere -- one which can not be cool down or wash away \* \* \* \* \* xxxvi -- the ides of march -lrb- _ farewell speech at st loui march 15th _ -rrb- lady and gentleman : to-day be the fourth anniversary of the revolution in hungary anniversary of revolution be almost always connect with the recollection of some patriot death-fallen on that day like the spartan at thermopylae martyr of devotion to they fatherland almost in every country there be some proud cemetery or some modest tomb-stone adorn on such a day by a garland of evergreen the pious offering of patriotic tenderness i past the last night in a sleepless dream and my soul wander on the magnetic wing of the past home to my beloved bleeding land and i saw in the dead of the night dark veil shape with the paleness of eternal grief upon they brow but terrible in the tearless silence of that grief glide over the churchyard of hungary and kneel down to the head of the grave and deposit the pious tribute of green and cypress upon they and after a short prayer rise with clenched fist and gnash tooth and then steal away tearless and silent as they come -- steal away because the blood-hound of my country 's murderer lurk from every corner on that night and on this day and lead to prison those who dare to show a pious remembrance to the beloved to-day a smile on the lip of a magyar be take for a crime of defiance to tyranny and a tear in he eye be equivalent to a revolt and yet i have see with the eye of my home-wandering soul thousand perform the work of patriotic piety and i see more when the pious offerer steal away i see the honor dead half rise from they tomb look to the offering and whisper gloomily still a cypress and still no flower of joy be there still the chill of winter and the gloom of night over thee fatherland be we not yet revenge and the sky of the east reddened suddenly and quiver with bloody flame and from the far far west a lightning flash like a star-spangled stripe and within its light a young eagle mount and soar towards the quiver flame of the east and as he draw near upon he approach the flame change into a radiant morning sun and a voice from above be hear in answer to the question of the dead : sleep yet a short while mine be the revenge i will make the star of the west the sun of the east and when ye next awake ye will find the flower of joy upon you cold bed and the dead take the twig of cypress the sign of resurrection into they bony hand and lay down such be the dream of my wake soul and i prayed and such be my prayer : father if thou deemest I worthy take the cup from my people and give it in they stead to I and there be a whisper around I like the word amen such be my dream half foresight and half prophecy but resolution all however none of those dead whom i saw fall on the 15th of march they be victim of the royal perjury which betray the 15th of march the anniversary of we revolution have not the stain of a single drop of blood we the elect of the nation sit on that morning busily but quietly in the legislative hall of old presburg and without any flood of eloquence pass we law in short word that the people shall be free the burden of feudality cease the peasant become free proprietor that equality of duty equality of rights shall be the fundamental law and civil political social and religious liberty the common property of all the people whatever tongue it may speak or in whatever church pray and that a national ministry shall execute these law and guard with its responsibility the chartered ancient independence of we fatherland two day before austrium 's brave people in vienna have break its yoke and sum up despot in the person of its tool old metternich drive he away and the hapsburg tremble in they imperial cavern of imperial crime tremble but treacherous and lie and false write with yard-long letter the word constitution and free press upon vienna 's wall and the people in joy cheer the inveterate liar because the people know no falsehood on the 14th i announce the tiding from vienna to we parliament at presburg the announcement be swiftly carry by the great democrat the steam-engine upon the billow of the danube down to old buda and to young pesth and while we in the house of representative pass the law of justice and freedom the people of pesth rise in peaceful but majestic manifestation declare that the people should be free at this manifestation all the barrier raise by violence against the law fall of themselves not a drop of blood be shed a man who be in prison because he have dare to write a book be carry home in triumph through the street the people arm itself as a national guard the window be illuminate and bonfire burnt and when these tiding return back to presburg blended with the cheer from vienna they warm the chill of we house of lord who readily agree to the law we propose and there be rejoice throughout the land for the first time for century the farmer awake with the pleasant feeling that he time be now he own -- for the first time go out to till he field with the console thought that the ninth part of he harvest will not be take by the landlord and the tenth by the bishop both have fully resign they feudal portion and the air be brighten by the lustre of freedom and the very soil bud into a bloom paradise such be the memory of the 15th of march 1848 one year later there be blood but also victory over the land the people because free fight like demi-god seven great victory we have gain in that month of march on this very day the remains of the first 10000 russian flee over the frontier of transylvanium to tell at home how heavily the blow fall from free hungarian arm it be in that very month that one evening i lay down in the bed whence in the morning windischgrätz have rise : and from the battle-field -lrb- isaszeg -rrb- i hasten to the congress at debreczin to tell the representative of the nation : it be time to declare we national independence because it be really achieve the hapsburg have not the power to contradict it more nor have they but russium have experience by the test of its first interference that there be no power on earth caring about the most flagrant violation of the law of nation and see by the silence of great britain and of the united state that she may dare to violate those law we hero have to meet a fresh force of nearly 200000 russian no power cheer we bravely win independence by diplomatic recognition not even the united state though they always profess they principle to be that they recognize every de-facto government we therefore have the right to expect a speedy recognition from the united state we struggle rise to european height but we be leave alone to fight for the world and we have no arm for the new battalion gather up in thousand with resolute heart and empty hand the recognition of we independence be withhold commercial intercourse for procure arm abroad be impossible -- the gloomy feeling of entire forsakedness spread over we tired rank and prepare the field for the secret action of treachery until the most sacrilegious violation of those common law of nation be achieve and the code of nature and of nature 's god be drown in hungary 's blood and i who on the 15th of march 1848 see the principle of full civil and religious liberty triumph in my native land -- who on the 15th of march 1849 see this freedom consolidate by victory -- one year later on the 15th of march 1850 be on my sorrowful way to a asiatic prison but wonderful be the work of divine providence it be again in the month of march 1851 that the generous interposition of the united state cast the first ray of hope into the dead night of my captivity and on the 15th of march 1852 the fourth anniversary of we revolution guide by the bounty of providence here i stand in the very heart of you immense republic no longer a captive but free in the land of the free not only not despond but firm in confidence of the future because raise in spirit by a swell sympathy in the home of the brave still a poor a homeless exile but not without some power to do good to my country and to the cause of liberty as my very persecution prove such be the history of the 15th of march in my humble life who can tell what will be the character of the next 15th of march nearly two thousand year ago the first caesar find a brutus on the ides or 15th of march may be that the ides of march 1853 will see the last of the caesar fall under the avenge might of a thousand-handed brutus -- the name of whom be the people -- inexorable at last after it have be so long generous the seat of caesar be first in the south from the south to the east from the east to the west and from the west to the north that be they last abode none be lasting yet will the last and worst prove luckier no it will not while the seat of caesar be toss around and throw back to the icy north a new world become the cradle of a new humanity where in spite of the caesar the genius of freedom raise -lrb- let we hope -rrb- a everlasting throne the caesar of the north and the genius of freedom have not place enough upon this earth for both of they one must yield and be crush beneath the heel of the other which be it which shall yield -- america may decide allow I to add a few remark in dry and plain word on other subject it be not necessary to explain why i be attack by russium austrium and they ally but some of you gentleman may have feel surprised to see that two hungarian have join in the attack both of whom accept of the office of minister from my hand and hold that office under my good pleasure and from my will till we all three proceed into exile on the same evening my two assailant now live and act under the protection of loui napoleon who do not permit I even to pass through france you may yet find perhaps some more join they but the number will not be large oh the bitter pang of a exile 's daily life be terrible i have see many a character falter under the constant petty care of how to live which stand firm like a rock under the storm of a quake world therefore i should not be surprise to find yet some few join in those attack as i have neither means nor time to care for the want of individual not even of my own child what i get be not mine but my country 's and must be employ to secure its future prospects and it may be that other may avail themselves of this circumstance and show some temporary compassion to private misfortune _ under the condition of secession from I _ with the purpose of be then able to say that the cause of hungary be hopeless because not even the hungarian exile live in concord that may happen thus with some few for hunger be painful : but few they will be the immense majority of my brother exile will rather starve than yield to such a snare there may be some also that will fall victim to the craft of skilful aristocratic diplomatist who would fain keep or get the reputation of liberal man but without the necessity of become really liberal that class of influential person may give some hope -- even some half indefinite promise of support to the cause of hungary -lrb- which they never intend to fulfil -rrb- under the condition of a peaceful compromise with the house of austrium upon a monarchical-aristocratical basis and not in that way which i have proclaim openly in england know that every root of the monarchical principle be tear out from the breast of the people of hungary so that we can never be knit again therefore the future of hungary can only be republican and there be no door to that future but to continue the struggle there may perhaps be some few honest but weak man who weary of a homeless life would fain return home even under the condition of monarchical-aristocratical compromise which some skilful diplomatist make glitter into they eye but as to those two who do good service to the tyrant of they and my country the very circumstance that they be silent when i -lrb- because a prisoner -rrb- be not able to work much but be try to check my endeavor now that i be about to achieve something which can only prove to be a benefit to hungarian -- smaller or greater but only a benefit and in no case a harm this very circumstance show the nature of they attack but as to the pretence by which they try to lull to sleep they own conscience that be reveal to I by a copy of a confidential communication of one of they silent associate to a private circle of friend where it be state that as i have declare exclusively for a republic a party must be get up under the nominal leadership of bathyanyus on a monarchical basis _ because my view leave no hope to get home in a honorable manner otherwise than by a revolution _ that be the key of the dispute as to myself i be a republican and will never be a subject to a king any more than be a king myself but i love my country too sincerely to favor the course i would pursue on my own private sentiment alone i know the hapsburg and i know my country i have weigh my people 's revolution wish and will and weigh the condition of the only possible success upon this basis i act and be happy to say that the considerate prudence of a statesman and the duty of a patriot not only act in full harmony with my own personal republican conviction but indeed can not allow I in any other course either freedom and we popular rights have no future not only in hungary but indeed in europe or that future will be can be and shall be only republican for the hungarian it be more than foolish to think that either a insurrectionary war can be prevent in europe or that that war can terminate otherwise than either by a consolidated despotism or republicanism no other issue be possible therefore however mean be the private motive of the hostility of those my very few hungarian enemy i pity they out of too great a desire to get home they have make they return in every case impossible not all the power of earth could afford they security at home against the indignation of the people not if i succeed to liberate my country for the people will consider they as traitor who have do all they could to prevent that liberation not if i should fail because then the people will believe that they counter-machination be what cause I to fail so much for they but the confidence with which i look to the republican freedom of hungary have be confirm by consider how weak must the case be of those who urge you to indifference when they be force to resort to the argument that we have no chance of success i have often answer that objection which in itself be a distrust in god in justice in right and in the blessing of humanity allow I to-day in addition only one remark two day ago the rumor be spread that loui napoleon be kill it be remarkable to see how those who countenance despotism grow livid by despair and how those who doubt about we success rise in spirit and in confidence some time ago a similar false rumor cause almost a commercial crisis in the cotton market of new orlean now how can the security of that cause be trust where the mere possible death of a single individual and of such a individual can so crush every calculation upon the solidity of the peace of oppression allow I to draw you attention to a circumstance which one of you countryman william henry trescott of south carolina have recommend to public attention already in the year 1849 in he pamphlet entitle ' a few thought on the foreign policy of the united state ' the position of the united state undergo a immense change as soon as you boundary extend to the pacific extensive commercial relation with asia become a necessity you feel it -- the very movement now commence in respect to japan bear witness to it let those movement be complete and whom will you meet russium that be the old story everybody who be willing to have some influence in the east must meet russium whose sterling thought be to exclude all other power from the east england be to you the competitor in the commerce of the east and competitor may well have a fair field for they both but russium be not a competitor there she be a _ enemy _ look to the mediterranean sea and remember the everlasting thought of russium to crush turkey and to get hold of constantinople what be the key of this eternal fond desire inherit from peter the great it be not the mere desire of territorial aggrandizement the real key be that it be only by the possession of constantinople that russia a great territorial power already can become also a great maritime power the mediterranean be what russium want to be the mistress of europe asia of africa and of the world but the sultan sit on the bosphorus confines the navy of the czar to the black sea a interior lake without any outlet but by the beautiful bosphorus constantinople take it be russium which control the mediterranean : -- a circumstance of such immense importance that mr trescott say it would be a sufficient reason for direct and positive interference -- that be for war there -- there -- _ in turkey will be decide the fate of the world _ perhaps there will be not only the end but also the beginning of the end and some american politician say the united state can do nothing for europe 's liberty but turkey can -- hold only the bosphorus against a inroad from sebastopol -- turkey with its brave four hundred thousand man -- the natural ally of all those european nation who will who must struggle against russian preponderance how wonderful the bosphorus in the hand of the sultan save the world from russian dominion and yet i be ask what can america do for europe how many men-of-war have you in the mediterranean i would you have more would you have some other anchorage in the mediterranean for you glorious flag turkey have many a fine harbor and a great deal of good will the turkish agha now would not be afraid to see cheer for instance by the inhabitant of mytilene the american flag should it ever happen that that flag be cast in protection around my humble self nay i be sure they would smilingly join in the harsh but cordial _ khôsh guelden sepa gueldin _ which be more than a thrice welcome in you language but the word welcome remind I that i have to say to you farewell -- and that be a sad word in the place where i have meet so warm a welcome but it must be do can i hope to have the consolation of know that in bidding farewell to my namesake city i leave high-minded man who remember that they have see the hungarian exile on the ides of march will have faith in the future of freedom 's just cause and make the central city of the great united republic the center of numerous association of the friend of hungary in the great west whence i confidently hope the sun of freedom will move towards the east lady and gentleman i bid you farewell a heartfelt affectionate farewell -lrb- from st loui kossuth proceed farther south but we do not find any novelty in he speech at new orlean march 30th the most notable thing in that meeting be the cordial pronouncement of the hon e w moise in the name of the city authority and people of new orlean in favor of hungary and governor kossuth : thus distinctly show that the commercial metropolis of the south sympathize with european liberty equally as the north but it be sufficient here to have indicate the fact -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xxxvii -- history of kossuth 's liberation -lrb- _ jackson mississippus -- -lrb- visit to senator foote -rrb- April 1st _ -rrb- kossuth have feel it a duty of gratitude on he return from new orlean to visit jackson the chief city of mississippus in order to express he thanks in person to senator foote then governor of the state for have move a resolution in the senate to send a steamer to constantinople for kossuth and afterwards a resolution tender to he a cordial national welcome at washington on he propose this visit he receive a enthusiastic invitation from the citizen at large as be expound to he by governor foote in a very cordial speech which end with the word : in the name of the sovereign people of mississippus and by the special request of those of we citizen whom you see before you and around you i now bid you welcome to we own capital and pray that a bounteous providence may vouchsafe to you and the sacred cause of which you be the advocate its most auspicious countenance and protection kossuth reply : you excellency have be please to bestow a word of approbation upon the manner in which i have speak and act since i be here in the united state especially as to frankness : which frankness on another side have occasion much hostility toward I allow I on the present occasion to exercise that same frankness if i be less frank i should perhaps tell you i have a fond desire to see mississippus and thank the citizen for sympathy to my country but i claim not a merit which i do not possess i do not come to meet the people my only motive be one of gratitude toward you sir one anxiety have weigh upon my breast ever since i have be in the united state and that be lest i lose the opportunity to say to you with a warm grasp of the hand and in a few but heartfelt word how thankful i feel for the important part you have be please to take in my liberation from captivity i hope to god you will never have reason to regret what you have do for I allow I to state that there be something providential in the fact and in the time of intercession in my behalf the sultan be a generous man i can bear testimony to that when russium and austrium proudly rely upon they army and the flush of victory arrogantly demand that we should be surrender to the hangman of my fatherland and when the majority of the divan -lrb- the great council of turkey -rrb- take a shortsighted view of the case and influence by the impending danger have already consent to the arrogant demand and when in consequence thereof the abandonment of we religion be propose as the only means to save we life then the sultan inform of the matter and follow the noble impulse of he generous heart declare that he would prefer to perish rather than dishonor he name -- he would therefore accept the danger of war rather than disregard the great duty of humanity -- thus if he be doom to perish he would at least perish in a honorable way by that noble resolution we life be save but european diplomacy step in to convert the accord hospitality into a prison -lrb- \* -rrb- the sultan be leave alone not support not encourage by any one soever but assail by complication ill advise by fear and threaten by many yield at last but yield with the intention to restore we to we natural rights as soon as he could be sure that he stand not forsake and alone in acknowledge the right of humanity for a long while no encouragement come and we linger in we prison forsake and without hope you sir move a resolution in the senate of the united state in consequence thereof the great republic of the west by its generous offer cast a ray of consolation into my prison and give encouragement to the sublime porte the english and the french government unwilling to appear less liberal both approve the course of the united state england make even a similar offer as america and the sultan glad to see that he be no longer alone in assert what be right agree to the offer notwithstanding all the machination of my enemy and i and my countryman become free -lrb- footnote \* : i be permit to explain that kossuth have in view not the action of one power only but the total result of all the power while the sultan know what the arm of russium be mean for and could not learn whether the fleet of england be mean for anything but _ a mere show _ -lrb- for sir stratford canning have no order to _ use _ it -rrb- the practical advice of diplomacy be not to do what be just but to make the least disgraceful and least dangerous compromise -rrb- now suppose sir you have not introduce that resolution then and the star-spangled flag have not be cast in protection around I -- suppose that the _ coup d'état _ of loui napoleon have find I in prison still -- that _ coup d'état _ which cause a change of the ministry in england -- what would have be the consequence england would probably have remain indifferent and france would have certainly oppose the proposition of the united state -- or rather support the cause of austrium and the sultan abandon by the constitutional power of europe would have be force to make kutaya what the arrogant despot desire -- a physical or at least a moral grave for I -- and instead of the new hope and fresh resolution which my liberation inspire into nation groan under the weight of a common oppression there would be now a gloom of despondency spread over all who unite with I in spirit in resolution and in sentiment therefore in whatsoever i may yet be _ useful through my regain activity it be due to you sir _ without the intercession of the united state there would have be no field of activity leave I allow I now to speak on another matter connect with this among the calumny perpetually throw out at I be one which i can not pass in silence because it charge I with ingratitude to the united state say that i misuse the generosity of you country which grant I protection and a asylum _ upon my accept the condition not to meddle any more with politics _ but to abandon the cause to which i have devote my life -- to retire from public life and to lay down my head to rest now before god and man this representation be entirely false no such condition be add to the generous offer of the united state and i declare that however much i regard such a offer have this condition be attach i would in no case have accept it life be of no value to I except inasmuch as i can do some service to my country 's cause therefore under the condition of forsake my country i would not accept happiness -- not liberty -- not life this i have say before it be due from I to the honor of the turkish government to declare that the sublime porte not only attach no condition at all to my liberation but explicitly and officially intimate to I that have once decide to set we free it be unwilling to do thing by half -- we have therefore full and unrestricted liberty on leave turkey to go and to stay where we please -- to take such a course as we choose and that to that purpose a american and a english vessel would be ready at the dardanelle and it would depend on we choice on board of which we embark indeed i have a official communication on the part of the english government in my hand by which i be inform that the only reason why the appoint english vessel come not to the dardanelle be that i and my associate have declare that we prefer to embark on board the american ship but again : in respect to that embarkation i must state that in the resolution of the congress one word be contain which might have be subject to different interpretation i consider it my duty to declare frankly to the legation of the united state at constantinople that i neither be nor would be willing to assume the character of a _ emigrant _ but would only be consider a _ exile _ drive away by foreign violence from my native land but not without the hope to get home again to free and independent hungary therefore that i not only would not pledge my word to go directly to the united state or to remove thither permanently but upon regain my liberty intend to devote it to win back for my country its sovereign independence which we have achieve and proclaim and which be wrest from we by the most sacrilegious violation of the law of nation i get a answer fully satisfactory on the part of you legation assure I that the united state would never consent to give I a new prison instead of liberty and that there be and could be no intention on the part of the united state to restrain my freedom or my activity beyond the limit of you common law which be equally obligatory and equally protective to every one so long as he choose to stay in the united state upon this i accept thankfully the generous offer of the united state i write a letter of thanks to he excellency the president and order my diplomatic agent in england to write a similar one to the honorable secretary of state express that i consider the struggle for we national independence not yet finish and that i would devote my regain liberty to the cause of my fatherland _ nearly three month after these declaration _ the mississippus steam-ship arrive and i embark have again previously and on board constantly declare that it be my fervent wish to visit the united state but not without previously visit england on board the same frigate if the favor should be grant to I else on board another ship from a mediterranean port if need must be this be the true history of the case i hope you will excuse I for have answer for once a misrepresentation which charge I with bad faith and ingratitude such as neither have i merit nor can i bear \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* xxxviii -- pronouncement of the south -lrb- _ mobile alabama April 3d _ -rrb- lady and gentleman -- i do not expect to have either the honor of a public welcome or the opportunity of address such a distinguished assembly at mobile -- not as if i have entertain the slightest doubt about the generous sentiment of this enlighten community but because i be call by press duty to hasten back to the east of the united state indeed only the accident of not find a vessel ready to leave when i arrive here have enable I to see the fair flower of you generosity add to the garland of sympathy which the people of you mighty republic have give I and which will shine from the banner of resistance to all-encroaching despotism that banner which the expectation of million call I to raise but however unexpected my arrival the congenial kindness of you warm heart leave I not unnoticed and uncheered and besides the joyful consolation which i feel on this occasion there be also important benefit in the generous reception you honor I with firstly because one of the united state senator of alabama mr clemen be please to pronounce himself not only oppose to my principle but hostile to my own humble self i thank god for have well deserve the hatred of czar and emperor and so may god bless I as i will all my life try to deserve it still more but i can not equally say that i have deserve the inclemency of mr clemen though it be not the least passionate of all well lady and gentleman after the spontaneous sympathy which i here so unexpectedly meet i may be permit to believe that it be not the state of alabama but mr clemen only whom i have to count amongst my persecutor and my enemy secondly i must mention that it be my good fortune not often to meet argument oppose to my argument but only personal attack well that be the best acknowledgment which could have be pay to the justice of my cause for even if i be all that my enemy would like to make I appear would thereby the cause i plead and the principle i advocate be less just less righteous and less true now amongst those personal attack there be one which say that i be so impertinent as to dare appeal from the government to the people : and that _ i try to sow dissension between the people and the government _ i declare in the most solemn manner this imputation to be entirely unfounded and calumniatory who ever hear I say one single word of complaint or dissatisfaction against you national government when have i speak otherwise than in term of gratitude high esteem and profound veneration about the congress and government of the united state and how could i have speak otherwise be as i be indebted to congress and government for my liberation for the most generous protection and for the highest honor a man be ever yet honor with and besides i have full reason to say that _ it be entirely false to insinuate that in political respects i have be disappoint with my visit to washington city _ -- no it be not respect alone but the intensest gratitude that i feel the principle and sentiment of the chief magistrate of you great republic express to the congress in he official message the principle of you government so nobly interpret by the hon secretary of state at the congressional banquet confirm expressly the contents of he immortal letter to mon hulsemann the further private declaration in regard to the practical application of those governmental principle all and everything could but impress my mind with the most consoling satisfaction and the warmest gratitude -- as may be see in the letter of thanks which on the eve of my departure i send to he excellency the president and to both house of congress that be my condition who can charge I with sowing dissension between the people and the government when i accept such opportunity as you also have be pleased kindly to offer to I plead the cause of my down-trodden country -lrb- for which both people and government of the united state have manifest the liveliest sympathy -rrb- and advocate principle entirely harmonize with the official declaration of you government and what be it i say to the people in my public address i say the exigency of circumstance have raise the question of foreign policy to the highest standard of importance -- the question be introduce to the congress it must therefore be bring to a decision it can not be pass in silence any more you representative in congress take it for they noblest glory to follow the sovereign will of the people but to be able to follow it they must know it yet they can not know it without the people manifest its opinion in a constitutional way since they have not be elect upon the question of foreign policy that question be then not yet discuss i therefore humbly entreat the sovereign people of the united state to consider the matter and to pronounce its opinion in such a way as it be consistent with law and with they constitutional duty and rights may i not be tranquillize in my conscience that in speak thus i commit no disloyal act and do in no way offend against the high veneration due from I to you constitute authority if it be so then the generous manifestation of you sympathy i be honor with in mobile be again a highly valuable benefit to my cause because it have such a character of spontaneity that here at least no misrepresentation can charge I with have even endeavor to elicit that high-minded manifestation from the metropolis of the state of alabama so doubly return my thanks for it i beg leave to state what it be i humbly entreat firstly when the struggle which be to decide on the freedom of europe have once break out hungary have resource to carry it on : but she want initial aid because she finances be all grasp by we oppressor you would not refuse to I a houseless exile _ alms _ and commiseration if i begged for myself surely then you can not refuse it for my bleeding fatherland when i beg of you as individual trifling sum such as each can well spare and the gift of which do not entangle you country in any political obligation whatever may be my personal fate million would thank and come generation bless it as a source of happiness to they as once the nineteen million franc 24000 musket and thirty-eight vessel of war which france give to the cause of you own independence have be a source of happiness to you i rely in that respect upon the republican virtue which you immortal washington have bequeath to you in he memorable address to m adet the first french republican minister send to washington _ my anxious recollection and my best wish be irresistibly attract whensoever in any country i see a oppressed nation unfurl the banner of freedom _ so speak washington and so much for _ private _ material aid to which nothing be require but a little sympathy for a unfortunate people which even mr clemen may feel whatever he personal aversion for the man who be plead not he own but he brave people 's cause as to the _ political _ part of my mission i humbly claim that the united state may pronounce what be or should be the law of nation -- such as they can recognize consistently with the basis upon which they own existence be establish and consistently with they own republican principle and what be the principle of such a law of nation which you as republican can recognize you greatest man you first president washington himself have declare in these word : _ every nation have a right to establish that form of government under which it conceive it may live most happy and no government ought to interfere with the internal concern of another _ and accord to this everlasting principle proclaim by you first president you last president have again proclaim in he last message to the congress that _ the united state be forbid to remain indifferent to a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power be invoice to repress the spirit of freedom in any country it be this declaration that i humbly claim to be sanction by the sovereign will of the people of the united state in support of that principle which washington already have proclaim and in that respect i frankly confess i should feel highly astonished if the southern state prove not amongst the first and amongst the most unanimous to join in such a declaration because of all the great principle guarantee by you constitution there be none to which the southern state attach a greater importance -- there be none which they more cherish -- than the principle of self-government the principle that they own affair be to be manage by themselves without any interference from whatever quarter neither from another state though they be all estate of the same galaxy nor from the central government though it be a emanation of all the state and represent the south as well as the north and the east and the west nor from any foreign power though it be the mightiest on earth well gentleman this great principle of self-government be precisely the ground upon which i stand it be for the defense of this principle that my nation rise against a world in arm to maintain this principle in the code of nature and of nature 's god the people of hungary spilt they blood on the battlefield and on the scaffold it be this principle which be trodden down in hungary by the centralization of austrium and the interference of russium it be the principle which if hungary be not restore to she sovereign independence be blot out for ever from the great statute book of the nation from the common law of mankind like a pestilential disease the violation of the principle of self-government will spread over all the earth until it be destroy everywhere in order that despot may sleep in security for they know that this principle be the strongest stronghold of freedom and therefore it be hate by all despot and all ambitious man and by all those who have sell they soul to despotism and ambition gentleman you know well that the principle of self-government have two great enemy -- centralization and foreign interference hungary be a bleeding victim to both you have probably perceive gentleman that the great misfortune of europe be the spirit of centralization encroach upon all municipal institution and destroy self-government not only by open despotism but also under the disguise of liberty fascinate by this dangerous tendency even republican france go on to sweep away all the trace of self-government and this be the reason why all she revolution could not assert liberty for she people and why she lie now prostrate under the foot of a usurper without glory without merit without virtue blind to they interest the nation abandon they real liberty the municipal institution for a nominal responsibility of minister and for parliamentary omnipotence instead of cling to the principle of self-government -- the true breakwater against the encroachment of king of minister of parliament -- they abandon the principle which enforce the real responsibility of minister and raise the parliament to the glorious position of the people 's faithful servant they exchange the real liberty of self-government for the fascinating phantom of parliamentary omnipotence make the elect of the people the master of the people which if it be really to be free can not have any master but god the old anglo-saxon municipal freedom have even in england be weaken by this tendency parliament have not only fight against the prerogative of the crown but have conquer the municipal freedom of the country and of the borough green erin sigh painfully under this pressure and english statesman begin to be alarm hungary my own dear fatherland be the only country in europe which amidst all adversary amidst all attack of foreign encroachment and all inducement of false new doctrine remain faithful to the great principle of self-government at which the perjurious dynasty of austrium have never cease to aim deadly blow to get rid of these incessant attack we avail ourselves of the condition of europe in 1848 and get we old national self-government guaranty in a legal way with the sanction of we then king by substitute _ individual _ for collective responsibility of minister have experience that a board of minister though responsible by law and compose of we own countryman be naturally and necessarily in practice irresponsible when the tyrant of austrium whom we forefather have elect in a ill-fated hour to be we constitutional king see that they design of centralization be obstruct they forsake they honor they break they oath they tear asunder the compact by which they have become king the diadem have lose its brightness for they if it be not to be despotic they stir up robber and rebel against we : and when this fail then with all the force of the empire attack hungary unexpectedly not think to meet with a serious opposition because we have no army no arm no ammunition no money no friend they therefore declare we constitution and we self-government which we have preserve through the adversity of ten century at once and for ever abolish but my heart could not bear this sacrilege i and my political friend we call we people to arm to defend the palladium of we national existence the privilege of self-government and that political civil and religious liberty and those democratic institution which upon the glorious basis of self-government we have succeed to assert for all the people of hungary and the people nobly answer my call we strike down the centralize tyrant to the dust we drive he and he double-faced eagle out from we country we answer to he impious treachery be the declaration of we independence and he forfeiture of the crown be we right to do so or not we be and _ we have accomplish already we lawful enterprise victoriously _ we have take we competent seat amongst the independent nation on earth but the other independent power and alas even the united state linger to acknowledge we dearly but gloriously buy independence and beaten austrium have time to take she refuge under the shelter of the other principle hostile to self-government of the sacrilegious principle of foreign armed interference the czar of russium declare that the example of hungary be dangerous to the interest of absolutism he interfere and aid by treason he succeed to crush freedom and self-government in hungary and to establish a centralized absolutism there where through all the age of the past the rule of despotism never have be establish and the united state let he silently accomplish this violation of the common law of nation gentleman the law of nation upon which you have raise the lofty hall of you independence do not exist any more the despot be unite and league against national self-government they declare it inconsistent with they divine -lrb- rather satanic -rrb- rights and upon this basis all the nation of the european continent be hold in fetter the government of france be become a vanguard to russia st petersburg be transfer to pari and england be force to arm and to prepare for self-defence at home these be the immediate consequence of the downfall of the principle of self-government in hungary by the violence of foreign interference but if this great principle be not restore to its full weight by the restoration of hungary 's sovereign independence then you will see yet other consequence in you own country _ you _ freedom and prosperity be hate as dangerous to the despot of europe if you do not believe I believe at least what the organ of you enemy openly avow themselves pozzo di borgo the great russian diplomatist and hulsemann the little austrian diplomatist repeatedly in 1817 and 1823 publish that despotism be in danger unless yourselve become a king-ridden people if you study the history of the hungarian struggle you can also see the way by which the despot will carry they design the secret power of foreign diplomacy will foster amongst you the principle of centralization and as be always the case many who be absorb in some special aim of you party politics will be catch by this snare and when you gentleman of the south oppose with energy this tendency dangerous to you dear principle of self-government the despot of europe will first foment and embitter the quarrel and kindle the fire of domestic dissension and finally they will declare that you example be dangerous to order then foreign armed interference step in for centralization here as for monarchy in the rest of america indeed gentleman if there be any place on earth where this prospect should be consider with attention with peculiar care it be here in the southern state of this great union because they very existence be base on the great principle of self-government but some say there be no danger for the united state in whatever condition be the rest of the world i be astonish to hear that objection in a country which by a thousand tie be connect with and interested in the condition of the foreign world it be you own government which prophetically foretell in 1827 that _ the absolutism of europe will not be appease until every vestige of human freedom have be obliterate even here _ and be it upon the ruin of hungary that the absolutist power be now about to realize this prophecy you be aware of the fact that every former revolution in europe be accompany by some constitutional concession promise by the king to appease the storm but treacherously nullify when the storm pass out of this false play constantly new revolution arise it be therefore that russian interference in hungary be precede by a proclamation of the czar -- wherein he declare that insurrection have spread in every nation with a audacity which have gain new force in proportion to the concession of the government every concession must be withdraw not the slightest freedom no political rights and no constitutional aspiration must be leave but everything level by the equality of passive obedience and absolute servitude he therefore take the lead of the ally despot to crush the spirit of liberty on earth it be this impious work which be begin by the interference in hungary and go on spread in a frightful degree it be this impious work which my people combine with the other oppressed nation be resolve to oppose it be therefore no partial struggle which we be about to fight it be a struggle of principle the issue of which accord as we triumph or fall must be feel everywhere but nowhere more than here in the united state because no nation on earth have more to lose by the all-overwhelming preponderance of the absolutist principle than the united state if we be triumphant the progress and development of the united state will go on peacefully till you republicanism become the ruling principle on earth -lrb- god grant it may soon become -rrb- but if we fail the absolutist power triumphant over europe will and must fall with all they weight upon you precisely because else you would grow to such a might as would decide the destiny of the world and since the absolutistical power with russium at they head desire themselves to rule the world it be natural for she to consider you as they most dangerous enemy which they must try to crush or else be crushed sooner or later themselves the _ pozzo di borgos _ tell you so : the _ hulsemann _ tell you so : and it be indeed strange if the people of the united state too proudly rely upon they power and they good luck should indifferently regard the gathering of danger over they head and hereby invite it to come home to they force they to the immense sacrifice of war whereas we now afford to they a opportunity to prevent that danger without any entanglement and without claim from you any moral and material aid except such as be not only consistent with but necessary to you interest allow I to make yet some remark about the commercial interest as connect with the cause i plead nothing astonish I more than to see those whose only guide star be commerce consider its interest only from the narrow view of a small momentary profit and disregard the threatening combination of next coming event permit I to quote in this respect one part of the public letter which mr calhoun the son of the late great leader of the south the inheritor of he fame of he principle and of he interest have recently publish i quote it because i hope nobody will charge he with partiality in respect to hungary mr calhoun say : there be a universal consideration that should influence the government of the united state the palpable and practical agricultural manufacturing commercial and navigate interest the pecuniary interest of this country will be promote by the independence of hungary more than by any other event that could occur in europe if hungary become independent it will be she interest to adopt a liberal system of commercial policy there be fifteen million of people inhabit what be or what be hungary and the country between she and the adriatic these people have not now and never have any commerce with the united state hungarian trade and commerce have be stifle by the ` fiscal barrier ' of austrium that encircle she she have use but few of american product you annual shipment of cotton and cotton manufacture to trieste and all other austrian port include the amount send to hungary as well as austrium have never exceed nine hundred thousand dollar per annum all other merchandize and produce send by you to austria and hungary do not exceed one hundred thousand dollar a year hungary obtain all she foreign import through austrian port the import and transit duty levy by austrium be exceedingly onerous and nearly prohibitory as to hungary of you cotton and cotton goods hungary independent and a market be at once open for you cotton rice tobacco and manufacture of immense value that market be now close to you and have always be by austrian restriction and can it be doubt that besides supply the fifteen million of _ industrious and intelligent _ people of hungary -lrb- _ and they be as a people perhaps the most intelligent of any in europe _ -rrb- the adjacent and neighbouring country will not also be tempt to encourage trade with you hungary need you cotton she be rich in resource -- mineral agricultural manufacturing and of every kind she be rich in product for which you can exchange you cotton rice & c will it i ask injuriously affect you if the english should compete with you and send they manufacture of cotton thither not i presume as long as the raw material be purchase from america but in fact you market will be extend through she if therefore those of we statesman -lrb- say mr calhoun -rrb- who can only be influence by the almighty dollar will cypher up the value of this trade -- this new market for we product worth perhaps twenty million of dollar yearly -- they may find a excuse for incur even the tremendous and awful risk of a war with austrium but which there be less danger of than there be with governor brigham young in utah they may find a substantial interest involve that be worth take care of governor kossuth may be assure it be of more consequence than sympathy it be a wonderfully sensitive nerve in this country : it control most of the other -- sympathy in this case can take care of itself it do not require any nurse the interest involve should be attend to it seem to I that this position as to we commerce with hungary can not be attack in front in rear or on either flank it be by far more forcible and powerful than the _ ex post facto _ argument in favor of the mexican war that it get we californium and its gold so far as the general welfare of the country be concerned free trade with independent hungary and its certain ultimate result would be more invaluable than all the cargo of gold that may be bring from the pacific coast if ten time the present amount that be the opinion of a distinguished american citizen identify chiefly with the interest of the south as to I i beg permission to sketch in a few line the reverse of the picture if we fail in we enterprize to check the encroach progress of absolutism if the despot of europe succeed to accomplish they plot the chief part of which for russium be to get hold of constantinople and thus to become the control power of the mediterranean sea what will be the immediate result of it in respect to you commerce no man of sound judgment can entertain the least doubt that the first step of russium will and must be to exclude america from the market of europe by the renewal of what be call the continental system not a single bushel of wheat or corn not a single pound of tobacco not a single bale of cotton will you be permit to sell on the continent of europe the league despot must exclude you because you be republican and commerce be the conveyer of principle they must exclude you because by ruin you commerce they ruin you prosperity and by ruin this they ruin you development which be dangerous to they russia besides must exclude you because you be the most dangerous rival to she in the european market where you have already beat she and it will be the more the interest of russium to exclude you because by take constantinople she will also become the master of asiatic and african region where also cotton be raise well you say perhaps though you be exclude from the european continent england still remain to you cotton commerce -- who could guarantee that the english aristocracy will not join in the absolutist combination if the people of the united state by a timely manifestation of its sentiment do not encourage the public opinion of england itself but suppose england do remain a market to you cotton you must not forget that if english manufacture be exclude from all the coast of europe and of the mediterranean she will not buy so much cotton from you as now because she will lose so large a market for cotton goods well you say neither england nor you will submit to such a ruin of you prosperity of course not but then you will have a war connect with immense sacrifice whereas now you can prevent all that ruin all those sacrifice and all that war be it not more prudent to prevent a fire than to quench it when you own house be already in flame lady and gentleman let I draw to a close i most heartily thank you for the honor of this unlooked-for reception and for you generous sympathy i feel happy that the interest political as well as commercial of the united state be in intimate connexion with the success of the struggle of hungary for independence and republican principle and i bid you a sincere and cordial farewell recall to you memory and humbly recommend to you sympathy that toast which the more clement senator of alabama colonel king as president of the united state senate give I at the congressional banquet on the 7th of January in these word : -- hungary have prove herself worthy to be free by the virtue and valor of she son the law of nation and the dictate of justice alike demand that she shall have fair play in she struggle for independence it be the honorable senator of alabama who give I this toast express he conviction that to this toast every american will cordially respond he colleague have not respond to it but mobile have respond to it and i take with cordial gratitude my leave of mobile \* \* \* \* \* xxxix -- kossuth 's defense against certain mean imputation -lrb- _ jersey city _ -rrb- kossuth be here welcome with a address by the hon d s gregory whose guest he become great effort have be make to prejudice the public against he notwithstanding which he be receive with enthusiasm in the evening in he speech at the presbyterian church he allude to the attack of he opponent as follow : mr mayor and lady and gentleman -- there have be some who to the great satisfaction of despot and they civil and religious confederate have move heaven and hell to lower my sacred mission to the level of a stage-play and to ridicule the enthusiastic outburst of popular sentiment by defame its object and its aim that be a sorrowful sight indeed to meet opposition we must be prepare there be no truth yet but have be oppose : the car which lead truth to triumph must pass over martyr that be the doom of humanity mankind though advance in intellectual skill be pretty much the same in heart as it be thousand of year ago -- if not worse for wealth and prosperity do not always improve the heart it be sorrowful to see that not even such a cause as that which i plead can escape from be drag down insultingly into the mud with the ancient greek the head of a unfortunate be hold sacred even to the god now-a-days with some -- but let we be thankful only with some few degenerate person -- even calamity like ours be but a occasion for a bad joke jesus christ feel thirsty on the cross and receive vinegar and wormwood to quench the thirst of he agony oh ye spirit of my country 's depart martyr sadden not you melancholy look at mean insult the soil which you water by you blood will yet be free and that be enough ye will hear glad tiding about it when i join you rank but now as for myself when i be in private life i despise to become rich and sacrifice thousand to the public and often see my own family embarrass by domestic care i refuse indemnification and live poor when raise to the highest place in my country and provide with a allowance four time as great as you president 's i still live in my old modest way i have million at my disposal yet i go into exile penniless who now be _ ye _ or what like proof have _ ye _ give of not adore the almighty dollar who dare to insult my honor and call I a sturdy beggar and ask in what brewery i will invest the money i get from american and why because i ask a poor alms to prepare the approach struggle of my country because i can not and may not tell the public -lrb- which be to tell my country 's enemy -rrb- how i dispose of the sum which i receive and american pretend to be republican pretend to sympathize with liberty and wield that light artillery of freedom -- the press -- try to put on I mean stigma in order to make it impossible for I to aid the contest of hungary for its own and mankind 's liberty indeed it be too sad the consul of ancient rome spurius postumius be once catch in a snare by the samnite and be order to pass under the yoke with all he legion when he hesitate to submit a captain cry to he : stoop and lead we to disgrace for we country 's sake and so he do the word of the captain be true : we country may claim of we to submit even to degradation for its benefit but i be sorry that it be in america i have to learn there be in a patriot 's life trial still bitterer than even that of exile well : i can bear all this if it be but fruitful of good for my beloved fatherland but i look up to almighty god and ask in humility whether unscrupulous and mean suspicion shall succeed in stop the flow of that public and private aid to I from republican america and from american republican without which i can not organize and combine we force mr mayor and citizen of jersey i indeed apprehend you will have much disappointed those who endeavor by ridicule to drive we cause out of fashion you have show they to-day that the cause of liberty can never be out of fashion with american i thank you most cordially for it the more because i know that long before yesterday sympathy with the cause of liberty have be in fashion with you i be here on the border of a state note for its fidelity and sacrifice in the struggle for you country 's freedom and independence : to which the state of new jersey have in proportion to its population sacrifice a larger amount of patriotic blood and of property than any other of you sister state i myself have read the acknowledgment of this in washington 's own yet unedited hand-writings and i know also that you state have the historical reputation of have be a glorious battle-field in the struggle for the freedom you enjoy there may be some in this assembly with whom the suffering connect with one 's home be a battle-field may be a family tradition yet but be there a country in the world where such tradition be more largely record than my own native land be be there a country on the soil of which more battle have be fight -- and battle not only for ourselves but for all the christian all the civilized world oh home of my father thou art the golgotha of europe i defy all the demoniac skill of tyranny to find out more torture -- moral political and material -- than those which now weigh down my fatherland it will not bear they it can not bear they but will make a revolution though all the world forsake we but i ask be there not private generosity enough in america to give I those fund through which my injured country would have to meet fewer enemy and win its rights with far less bloodshed or shall the venom of calumny cause you to refuse that which without impair you private fortune or risk you public interest would mightily conduce to we success allow I to quote a beautiful but true word which ex-governor vroom speak in trenton last night he say : let we help the man he principle be those engraft into we declaration of independence we can not remain free should all europe become enslave by absolutism the sun of freedom be but one on mankind 's sky and when darkness spread it will spread over all alike the instinct of the people of hungary understand that to yield at all to unjust violence be to yield everything and to my appeal they reply curse be he who yield though unprepared they fight we unnamed hero fight and conquer -- until russium and treachery come and though now i be a exile again they will follow I i need only to get back to they and bring they something sharper than we nail to fight with for fatherland and humanity then in the high face of heaven we will fight out the battle of freedom once more this be my cause and this my plea it be there in you heart write in burn word by god himself who make you generous by bestow on you freedom \* \* \* \* \* xl -- the brotherhood of nation -lrb- _ newark _ -rrb- the rev dr eddy introduce kossuth to the citizen of newark and make a address to he in they name after this kossuth reply : gentleman -- it be a minister of the gospel who address I in you name : let I speak to you as a christian who consider it to be my heartfelt duty to act not only in my private but also in my public capacity in conformity with the principle of christianity as i understand it i have see the people of the united state almost in every climate of you immense territory i have mark the natural influence of geography upon its character i have see the same principle the same institution assume in they application the modify influence of local circumstance i have find the past cast its shadow on the present in one place darker in the other less i have see man everywhere to be man partaking of all aspiration which be the bliss as well as the fragility of nature in man -- but in one place the bliss prevail more and in the other the fragility i saw now and then small interest of the pass hour less or more encroach upon the sacred dominion of universal principle but so much be true that wherever i find a people i find a great and generous heart ready to take that ground which by you very national position be point out to you as a mission you position be to be a great nation therefore you necessity be to act like a great nation or if you do not you will not be great to be numerous be not to be great the chinese be eight time more numerous than you and still china be not great for she have isolate herself from the world nor do the condition of a nation depend on what she like to call herself china call herself celestial and take you and europe for barbarian not what we call ourselves but how we act prove what we be great be that nation which act greatly and give I leave to say what a american minister of the gospel have say to I : _ nation _ by the great god of the universe be individualize as well as man he have give each a mission to fulfil and he expect every one to bear its part in solve the great problem of man 's capacity for self-government which be the problem of human destiny and if any nation fail in this he will treat it as a unprofitable servant a barren fig-tree whose own end be to be root up and burnt jonah sit under the shadow of he gourd rejoice in isolate selfish indifference care nothing for the million of the ninevite at he foot what be the consequence god prepare a worm to smite the gourd that it wither god have privileged you the people of the united state to repose not under a gourd but beneath the shadow of a luxuriant vine and the outspreading branch of a delicious fig-tree give he praise and thanks but be you jonah-like on this account to wrap yourselve up in the mantle of insensibility caring nothing for the nation smart under oppression stretch forth no hand for they deliverance not even so much as to protest against a conspiracy of evil doer and give a alms to aid deliverance from they be you to hide you national talent in a napkin or lend it at usury read the savior 's maxim : _ do unto other as ye would that other do unto you _ this be the savior 's golden rule applicable to nation as well as to individual suppose when the united state be struggle for they independence the spanish government have interfere to prevent its achievement -- send a armament to bombard you city and murder you inhabitant what would you forefather have think -- how feel precisely as hungary thought and feel when the russian bear put down he overslaughter paw upon she they would have invoke high heaven to avenge the interference -- and have there be a people on the face of the earth to protest against it that people would have show out like a eminent star in the hemisphere of nation -- and to this day you would call it bless what you would have other do unto you do so likewise unto they and though you meet no foreign interference yet you meet far more than a protest in you favor you meet substantial aid : thirty-eight vessel of war nineteen million of money 24000 musket 4000 soldier and the whole political weight of france engage in you cause i ask not so much by far not so much for oppressed europe from you it be a gospel maxim _ be not partaker of other man 's sin _ it be alike applicable to individual and nation if you of the united state see the great law of humanity outrage by another nation and see it _ silently _ raise no warning voice against it you virtually become a party to the offence as you do not reprove it you embolden the offender to add iniquity unto iniquity let not one nation be partaker of another nation 's sin when you see the great law of humanity the law upon which you national existence rest the law enact in the declaration of you independence outrage and profane will you sit quietly by if so -lrb- excuse I for say -rrb- part of the guilt be upon you and while individual receive they reward in the eternal world nation be sure to receive it here there be connection of cause and effect in a nation 's destiny a nation should not be a mere _ lake _ a glassy expanse only reflect foreign light around -- but a _ river _ carry its rich treasure from the fountain to distant region of the earth a nation should not be a mere _ light-house _ a stationary beacon erect upon the coast to warn voyager of they danger -- but a move _ life-boat _ carry treasure of freedom to the door of thousand and million in they land i confess gentleman that i share those expectation which the nation of europe have conceive from america be i too sanguine in my wish to hope that in these expectation i shall not fail so much i dare say that i conceive these expectation not without encouragement on you own part with this let I draw to a close one word often tell more than a volume of skilful eloquence when cross the alleghany mountain in a new country scarcely yet settle bearing at every step the mark of a new creation i happen to see a new house in ruin i feel astonished to see a ruin in america there must have be misfortune in that house -- the hand of god may have stricken he think i and inquire from one of the neighbor what have become of the man nothing particular answer he : he go to the west -- he be too comfortable here american pioneer like to be uncomfortable it be but one word yet worth a volume it make I more correctly understand the character of you people and the mystery of you inner prodigious growth than a big volume of treatise upon the spirit of america might have do the instinct of indomitable energy all the boundless power hide in the word _ go ahead _ lay open before my eye i feel by a glance what immense thing might be accomplish by that energy to the honor and lasting welfare of all humanity if only its direction be not mislead -- and i pray to god that he may preserve you people from be absorb in materialism the proud result of egotism vanish in the follow generation like the fancy of a dream but the smallest real benefit bestow upon mankind be last like eternity people of america thy energy be wonderful but for thy own sake for thy future 's sake for all humanity 's sake beware oh beware from measure good and evil by the argument of materialist i have see too many sad and bitter hour in my stormy life not to remember every word of true consolation which happen to brighten my way it be nearly four month ago and still i remember it as if it have happen but yesterday that the delegation which come in December last to new york to tender I a cordial welcome from and to invite I to newark call _ I a brother a brother in the just and righteous appreciation of human rights and human destiny brother in all the sacred and hallowed sentiment of the human heart _ these be you word and yesterday the people of newark prove to I that they be you sentiment sentiment not like the sudden excitement of passion which cool but sentiment of brotherhood and friendship lasting faithful and true you have greet I by the dear name of brother when i come you entitle I to the right to bid you farewell in a brother 's way and between brethren a warm grasp of hand a tender tear in the eye and the word _ remember _ tell more than all the skill of oratory could do and remember oh remember brethren that the grasp of my hand be my whole people 's grasp the tear which glisten in my eye be they tear they be suffer as no other people -- for the world the oppressed world they be the emblem of struggle liberty claim a brother 's love and a brother 's aid from america who be happily the emblem of prosperous liberty let this word _ brother _ with all the dear tie comprize in that word be the impression i leave upon you heart let this word _ brethren remember _ be my farewell \* \* \* \* \* xli -- the history and heart of massachusett -lrb- _ worcester -lrb- \* -rrb- massachusett _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote \* : heart of the commonwealth be the american title of the town of worcester -rrb- gentleman -- just as the holy scripture be the revelation of religious truth teaching man how to attain eternal bliss so history be the revelation of eternal wisdom instruct nation how to be happy and immortal on earth unaccountable change may alter on a sudden the condition of individual but in the life of nation there be always a close concatenation of cause and effect -- therefore history be the book of life wherein the past assume the shape of future event the history of old massachusett be full of instruction to those who know how to read unwritten philosophy in written fact besides to I it be of deep interest because of the striking resemblance between you country 's history and that of mine in fact from the very time that the colonial system be adopt by great britain to secure the monopoly of the american trade down to washington 's final victory -- from jame otis plead with word of flame the rights of america before the supreme court of massachusett breathe into the nation that breath of life out of which american independence be bear down to the declaration of independence first move by a son of massachusett -- i often believe i read of hungary when i read of massachusett but next when the kind cheer of you generous-hearted people rouse I out of my contemplative reverie and look around I i see you prosperity a nameless woe come over my mind because that very prosperity remind I that i be not at home the home of my father -- the home of my heart -- the home of my affection and of my care be in the most striking contrast with the prosperity i see here and whence this striking contrast in the result when there exist such a striking identity in the antecedent whence this afflict departure from logical coherence in history it be because you struggle for independence meet the good luck that monarchical france stipulate to aid with its full force america struggle for independence whereas republican america delay even a recognition of hungary 's independence at the crisis when it have be achieve however the equality of result may yet come history will not prove false to poor hungary while it prove true to all the world i certainly shall never meet the reputation of franklin but i may yet meet he good luck in a patriotic mission it be not yet too late my people like the damsel in the scripture be but sleep and not dead sleep be silent but restore to strength there be apparent silence also in nature before the storm we be downtrodden it be true : but be not washington in a dreary retreat with he few brave man scarcely to be call a army when franklin draw nigh to success in he mission my retreat be somewhat longer to be sure but then we struggle go on from the first on a far greater scale and again the success of franklin be aid by the hatred of france against england so i be tell and it be true but i trust that the love of liberty in republican america will prove as copious a source of generous inspiration as hatred of great britain prove in monarchical france or should it be the doom of humanity that even republic like yours be more mightily move by hatred than by love be there less reason for republican america to hate the overwhelming progress of absolutism than there be reason for france to hate england 's prosperity in fact that prosperity have not be lessen but rather increase by the rend away of the united state from the dominion of england but the absorption of europe into predominant absolutism would cripple you prosperity because you be no china no japan america can not remain unaffected by the condition of europe with which you have a thousand-fold intercourse a pass accident in liverpool a fire in manchester can not fail to be feel in america -- how could then the fire of despotic oppression which threaten to consume all europe 's freedom civilization and property fail to affect in its result america how can it be indifferent to you whether europe be free or enslaved -- whether there exist a law of nation or no such thing any more exist be replace by the caprice of a arrogant mortal who be call czar no either all the instruction of history be vanity and its warning but the pastime of a mocking-bird or this indifference be impossible therefore i may yet meet with franklin 's good luck franklin write to he friend charle thompson after have conclude the treaty of peace -- if we ever become ungrateful to those who have serve and befriend we we reputation and all the strength it be capable of procure will be lose and new danger ensue perhaps i could say poor hungary have well serve christendom have well serve the cause of humanity but indeed we be not so happy as to have serve you country in particular but you be generous enough to permit we unmerited misfortune to recommend we to you affection in place of good service it be beautiful to repay a receive benefit but to bestow a benefit be divine it be you good fortune to be _ able _ to do good to humanity : let it be you glory that you be _ willing _ to do it then what will be the tiding i shall have to bear back to europe in answer to the expectation with which i be charge from turkey italy france portugal and england let I hope the answer will be fit to be reanswer by a mighty hallelujah at the shout of which the throne of tyrant will quake and when they be fall and bury beneath the fall pillar of tyranny all the christian world will unite in the song of praise -- glory to god in heaven and peace to right-willing man on earth and honor to america the first-born son of liberty for no nation have god do so much as for she for she prove to be well deserving of it because she be obedient to he divine law -- she have love she neighbor as herself and do unto other as in the hour of she need she desire other to do unto herself gentleman -- i know what weight be due to massachusett in the council of the nation the history the character the intelligence the consistent energy and the considerate perseverance of you country give I the security that when the people of massachusett raise its voice and pronounce its will -- it will carry its aim i have see this people 's will in the manifestation of he whom the people 's well-deserved confidence have raise to the helm of its executive government i have see it in the sanction of its senator i have see it in the mighty outburst of popular sentiment and in the generous testimonial of its sympathy as i move over this hallowed soil i hope soon to see it in the legislative hall of you representative and in the cradle of american liberty i hope to see it as i see it now here throb with warm sincere generous and powerful pulsation in the very heart of you commonwealth i know that where the heart be sound the whole body be sound -- the blood be sound throughout all the vein never believe those to be right who bear but a piece of metal in they chest could persuade you that to be cold be to be wise warmth be the vivify influence of the universe and the warm heart be the source of noble deed to consider calmly what you have to do be well you have do so but let I hope that the heart of massachusett will continue to throb warmly for the cause of liberty till that which you judge to be right be do with that persistent energy which inherit from the puritan pilgrim of the mayflower be a principle with the people of massachusett remember the afflict -- farewell \* \* \* \*

it be arrange that he should speak in faneuil hall the hall fill long before he arrival and a incident occur which deserve record the crowd amuse itself by call on person present for speech : among other senator myron lawrence be call for who after first refusing stept on the platform and declare that _ he have some sin to confess _ he have be guilty of think kossuth to be what be call a humbug but he have see he now and think differently he have see the modest truthful bearing of the man -- that he have no trick of the orator but speak straightforward mr lawrence now believe he to be sincere and honest and pray almighty god to grant he a glorious success this frank and manly acknowledgment be receive with unanimous and hearty applause at eight o'clock governor boutwell he council and the committee of reception as also the vice-president and secretary receive kossuth in faneuil hall -lrb- \* -rrb- when applause have cease the governor address kossuth as follow : -- -lrb- footnote \* : faneuil hall be entitle by the american the cradle of american liberty -rrb- gentleman -- we have come from the exciting and majestic scene of the reception which the people of massachusett have give to the exile son of a oppressed and distant land that on this holy spot associate in we mind with the eloquence the patriotism the virtue of the revolution we may listen to he sad story of the past and contemplate he plan and hope for the future and shall these association which belong to we and this sad story which belong to humanity fail to inspire we soul and instruct we mind in the cause of freedom europe be not like a distant ocean whose agitation and storm give no impulse to the wave that gently touch we shore the introduction of steam power and the development of commercial energy be blend and assimilate we civility and institution europe be nearer to we in time than the extreme part of this country be to each other as all of we be interested in the prevalence of the principle of justice among we fellow man _ so _ as a nation we be interested in the prevalence of the principle of justice among the nation and state of europe never before be the american mind so intelligently direct to european affair we have not seek nor shall we seek the control of those affair but we may scan and judge they character and prepare ourselves for the exigency of national existence to which we may be call _ i do not hesitate to pronounce the opinion that the policy of europe will have a visible effect upon the character power and destiny of the american republic _ that policy as indicate by russium and austrium be the work of centralization consolidation and absolutism american policy be the antagonist of this we be pledge to liberty and the sovereignty of state shall a contest between we own principle and those of we enemy awaken no emotion in we we believe that government should exist for the advantage of the individual member of the body politic and not for the use of those who by birth fortune or personal energy may have rise to position of power we recognize the right of each nation to establish its own institution and regulate its own affair we revolution rest upon this right and otherwise be entirely indefensible the policy of this nation as well foreign as domestic should be control by american principle that the world may know we have faith in the government we have establish while we can not adopt the cause of any other people or make the quarrel of european nation we own it be we duty to guard the principle peculiar to america as well as those entertain by we in common with the civilized world one principle which should be universal in state as among individual man be that each should use he own in such a way as not to injure that which belong to another _ russium violate this principle when she interfere in the affair of hungary _ and thus weaken the obligation of other state to respect the sovereignty of the russian empire the independent existence of the continental state of europe be of twofold importance to america important politically important commercially as independent state they deprive russia the central and absorb power of europe of the opportunity on the mediterranean to interfere in the politics and civility of this continent russium and the united state be as unlike as any two nation which ever exist if russium obtain control of europe by the power of arm and the united state shall retain this continent by the power of its principle war will be inevitable as inevitable as it be in former day that war should arise between carthage and rome -- carthage which seek to extend she power by commerce and rome which seek to govern the world by the sword the independence of the state of europe be then the best security for the peace of the world if these state exist it must be upon one condition only -- that each state be permit to regulate its own affair if the voice of the united state and great britain be silent will russia allow these state to exist upon this principle -- have she not already partition poland -- menaced turkey -- divide with the sultan the sovereignty of wallachium -- infuse new energy into the despotic council of austrium -- and finally aid she in a unholy crusade against the liberty of hungary have we not then a interest in the affair of europe and if we have a interest ought we not to use the rights of a independent state for its protection the second consideration be commercial centralization absolutism destroy commerce the policy of russium diminish production and limit market whenever she add a new state to she dominion the commerce of the world be diminish great britain and the united state which possess three-fourth of the commercial marine of the globe be interested to prevent it we commerce at this moment with despotic state be of very little importance and its history show that in every age it have flourish in proportion to the freedom of the people these gentleman be poor word and barren thought upon the great european question of the time a question which america in she own name and for herself must meet at some future day if now she shall fail to meet it firmly upon well settle principle of national law for the protection and assistance of other state i have do the exile patriot shall speak for himself not for himself only nor for the land and people of hungary he love so well but for europe and america even he speak before you he plead you own cause it be to a just tribunal i present a noble advocate and to he it shall be a bright spot in the dreary waste of the exile 's life that to-night he plead the cause of hungary and humanity where once oti and adam and hancock and quincy plead the cause of america and liberty i present to you governor kossuth of hungary in reply to governor boutwell when the tumultuous applause have subside kossuth speak in substance as follow : -- he apologize for profane shakespeare 's language in faneuil hall the cradle of american liberty yet he venture to criticize that very phrase for liberty ought not to be _ american _ but _ human _ else it be no longer a right but a privilege and privilege can nowhere be permanent the nature of a privilege -lrb- say he -rrb- be exclusiveness that of a principle be communicative liberty be a principle : its community be its security exclusiveness be its doom what be aristocracy it be exclusive liberty it be privilege and aristocracy be doom because it be contrary to the destiny of man as aristocracy should vanish within each nation so should no nation be a aristocrat among nation until that cease liberty will nowhere be last on earth it be equally fatal to individual as to nation to believe themselves beyond the reach of vicissitude by this proud reliance and the isolation result therefrom more victim have fall than by immediate adversity you have grow prodigiously by you freedom of seventy-five year but what be seventy-five year as a charter of immortality no no my humble tongue tell the record of eternal truth a _ privilege _ never can be lasting liberty restricted to one nation never can be sure you may say we be the prophet of god but you shall not say god be only we god the jews say so and they pride old jerusalem lie in the dust we savior teach all humanity to say we father in heaven and he jerusalem be last to the end of day there be a community in mankind 's destiny -- that be the greet which i read on the arch of welcome on the capitol hill of massachusett i pray to god the republic of america would weigh the eternal truth of those word and act accordingly liberty in america would then be sure to the end of time but if you say american liberty and take that grammar for you policy i dare to say the time will yet come when humanity will have to mourn a new proof of the ancient truth that without community national freedom be never sure however the cradle of american liberty be not only famous from the reputation of have be always on the list of the most powerful eloquence it be still more conspicuous for have see that eloquence attend by practical success to understand the mystery of this rare circumstance one must see the people of new england and especially the people of massachusett in what i have see of new england there be two thing the evidence of which strike the observer at every step -- prosperity and intelligence i have see thousand assemble follow the noble impulse of a generous heart : almost the entire population of every town of every village where i pass gather around I throw flower of consolation on my path i have see not a single man bearing that mark of poverty upon himself which in old europe strike the eye sadly at every step i have see no ragged poor -- have see not a single house bear the appearance of desolated poverty the cheerfulness of a comfortable condition the result of industry spread over the land one see at a glance that the people work assiduously not with the depressing thought just to get through the care of a miserable life from day to day by hard toil but they work with the cheerful consciousness of substantial happiness and the second thing which i could not fail to remark be the stamp of intelligence impressed upon the very eye and outward appearance of the people at large i and my companion have see they in the factory in the workshop in they house and in the street and could not fail a thousand time to think how intelligent this people look it be to such a people that the orator of faneuil hall have to speak and therein be the mystery of success they be not wiser than the public spirit of they audience but they be the eloquent interpreter of the people 's enlighten instinct no man can force the harp of he own individuality into the people 's heart but every man may play upon the chord of he people 's heart who draw he inspiration from the people 's instinct well i thank god for have see the public spirit of the people of massachusett bestow its attention on the cause i plead and pronounce its verdict in respect to the question of national intervention he excellency the high-minded governor of massachusett write a memorable address to the legislature the joint committee of the legislative assembly after a careful and candid consideration of the subject not only concur in the view of the executive government but elucidate they in a report the irrefutable logic and elevated statesmanship of which will for ever endear the name of hazewell to oppressed nation and the senate of massachusett adopt the resolution propose by the legislative committee after such remarkable and unsolicited manifestation of conviction there can not be the slightest doubt that all these executive and legislative proceedings not only meet the full approbation of the people of massachusett but be the solemn interpretation of public opinion a spontaneous outburst of popular sentiment tell often more in a single word than all the skill of elaborate eloquence could as when amidst the thundering cheer of a countless multitude a man in worcester greet I with the shout : _ we worship not the man but we worship the principle _ it be a word like those word of flame speak in faneuil hall out of which liberty in america be bear that word reveal the spirit which apply eternal truth to present exigency move through the people 's heart -- that word be teem with the destiny of america give I leave to mention that have have a opportunity to converse with lead man of the great party which be on the eve of a animated contest for the presidency -- i availed myself of that opportunity to be inform of the principal issue in case the one or the other party carry the prize and have get the information thereof i could not forbear to exclaim -- all these question together can not outweigh the all-overruling importance of _ foreign policy _ it be there in the question of foreign policy that the heart of the immediate future throb security and danger prosperity and stagnation peace and war tranquillity and embarrassment -- yes life and death will be weigh in the scale of foreign policy it be evident thing be come to the point where they be in ancient rome when old cato never speak privately or publicly about whatever topic without close he speech with these word : _ however my opinion be that carthage must be destroy _ -- thus advertise he countryman that there be one question outweigh in importance all other question from which public attention should never for a moment be withdraw such in my opinion be the condition of the world now carthage and rome have no place on earth together republican america and all-overwhelming russian absolutism can not much longer subsist together on earth russium active -- america passive -- there be a immense danger in that fact it be like the avalanche in the alp which the noise of a bird 's wing may move and thrust down with irresistible force grow every moment i can not but believe it be highly time to do as old cato do and finish every speech with these word -- _ however the law of nation should be maintain and absolutism not permit to become omnipotent _ it be however a consolation to I to know that the _ chief _ difficulty with which i have to contend -- viz the overpowering influence of domestic question with you -- be neither lasting nor in any way a argument against the justice of we cause another difficulty which i encounter be rather curious many a man have tell I that if i have only not fall into the hand of _ abolitionist _ and _ free soiler _ they would have support I and have i land somewhere in the south instead of at new york i should have meet quite different thing from that quarter but be support by the free-soiler of course i must be oppose by the south on the other side i receive a letter from which i beg leave to quote a few line : -- you be silent on the subject of slavery surround as you have be by slaveholder ever since you put you foot on english soil if not during you whole voyage from constantinople and ever since you have be in this country surround by they whose threat promise and flattery make the stoutest heart succumb you position have put I in mind of a scene describe by the apostle of jesus christ when the devil take he up into a high mountain & c now gentleman thus be charge from one side with be in the hand of abolitionist and from the other side with be in the hand of slaveholder i indeed be at a loss what course to take if these very contradictory charge be not give I the satisfaction to feel that i stand just where it be my duty to stand -- on a truly american ground and oh have i not enough upon these poor shoulder that i be desire yet to take up additional care if the cause i plead be just if it be worthy of you sympathy and at the same time consistent with the impartial consideration of you own moral and material interest -lrb- which a patriot never should disregard not even out of philanthropy -rrb- then why not weigh that cause in the scale of its own value and not in a foreign one have i not difficulty enough before I here that i be desire to increase they with my own hand -- father mathew go on preach temperance and he may be oppose or support on he own ground but who ever think of oppose he because he take not into he hand to preach fortitude or charity and indeed to oppose or to abandon the cause i plead only because i mix not with the agitation of a interior question be a greater injustice yet because to discuss the question of foreign policy i have a right -- my nation be a object of that policy we be interested in it -- but to mix with interior party movement i have no right not be a citizen of the united state -lrb- after this kossuth proceed to urge as in former speech that the interest of american commerce be not oppose to but be identify with the cause of hungary and of european liberty he also adduce new consideration which be afterwards treat more fully in he speech at buffalo -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xliii -- self-government of hungary -lrb- _ banquet in faneuil hall _ -rrb- on April 30th kossuth be entertain at a grand banquet by the governor and council and the member of the two house eight hundred and seventy ticket besides be issue and be all take up the honorable henry wilson president of the senate be president for the evening it be not possible here to print all the speech but it may be note that governor boutwell in reply to a toast elicit affirmative reply from the guest to many question direct to show the necessity of american armed interference on the side of hungary also the venerable josiah quincy aged eighty in reply to a toast declare that liberty remain only in the united state and great britain and that in great britain herself the spirit of freedom be weaken let great britain fail and be beat down and all the navy of europe will be bristle against the united state finally president wilson introduce the guest of the evening say : -- gentleman allow I to present to you the illustrious guest of massachusett governor kossuth he have win we admiration as a man by the advocacy of the cause of he country and he have win all we heart by the purity of he principle kossuth in reply notice that the toast with which he have be honor be almost entirely personal and while disclaim merit he be nevertheless induce to advert to personal incident -lrb- now generally know -rrb- as -- how he publish in m the hungarian debate -- be unlawfully imprison for it and learn english in prison by means of shakespeare how when he be necessarily release the government impose a unlawful censorship on he journal which journal nevertheless become the basis of the great and extensive reform which receive they completion in the law of march and April 1848 after this he proceed as follow : -- gentleman allow I to say a few word on the ancient institution of hungary i have often hear it say that the people of europe be incapable of self-government let I speak of the people of hungary to show whether they be capable of self-government or not in thirty-six year with god 's help and through you generous aid the free people of hungary will celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the establishment of they home -- the millennium of hungary in europe yes gentleman may i hope that celebration will take place under the blessing of liberty in the year 1889 it be a long period -- one thousand year -- and oh how it have teem with adversity to my countryman and yet through this long time amid all adversity there be no period when the people of hungary do not resist despotism we boast be that through the vicissitude of a thousand year there be not a moment when the popular will and the legal authority have sanction the rule of absolutism and gentleman what other people for 1000 year have not consent to be rule by despotism even in the nineteenth century i be glad to look back to the wisdom of we father through a thousand year -- who lay down for hungarian institution a basis which for all eternity must remain true this basis be upon that latin proverb _ nil de nobis sine nobis _ -- nothing about we without we that be to claim that every man should have a full share in the sovereignty of the people and a full share in the rights belong to he nation in other time a theory be get up to convince the people that they might have a share in _ legislation _ just so far as to control that legislation but deny the right of the people to control the _ executive _ power the hungarian people never adopt that theory they ever claim a full share in the _ executive _ as well as in the legislative and judicial power out of this idea of government rise the municipal system of hungary in respect to hungarian aristocracy you must not consider it in the same light as the aristocracy of england the word _ nobleman _ in hungary originally be equivalent to _ soldier _ every man who defend he country be a nobleman and every man who have a vote be call to defend he country i believe the duty of defend a man 's country and also political right should be common after we people have conquer a home the leader take the lion 's share of course but it should be consider that those who have the largest share of the property be compel to furnish soldier accord to the extent of they possession therefore such man give a part of they land to people to cultivate and desire aid of they whenever the necessity for war come so all who defend they country be consider nobleman hungary be divide into fifty-two county but not county like yours -- some of they be so populous as to be comparable to you state contain perhaps half a million or more of people and those who become the aristocracy in some of these county amount to 35000 in every county be a fortress and whenever defense become necessary the rich man go into these fortress under they own banner and the other go under the king 's color and be command by the sheriff of the county who might be here governor -- at least who be the chief of the executive certain of the city be raise to constitutional rights a smaller city if surround by fortification or if a important post be represent in the diet whilst larger place if not post of importance for national defense be represent only by the county delegate every place that have the element of defense have political rights so it come to pass that the aristocracy be not a few man but half a million i have contend to beat down this barrier of aristocracy before the revolution in municipal government only the nobility have a share -- they only be the man who could vote : but the change be easy the frame of self-government be ready we have only to say _ the people _ instead of _ the nobility _ have the right to vote and so in one day we bury aristocracy never to rise again each county elect its representative to the diet and have the right of intercourse with other county by means of letter on all matter of importance to these county and therefore we fifty-two primary council be normal school of public spirit we elect we judicatory and executive and the government have not a right to send instruction or order to we executive and if a order come which we consider to be inconsistent with we constitutional rights it be not send to the executive but to the council and therefore the arbitrary order of the government could not be execute because they come not into the hand of the executive thus be we council barrier against oppression when the french take saragossa it be not enough to take the city -- they have to take every house so also _ we _ go on and though some county might accept the arbitrary order of the government some resist and by discuss in they letter to the other county the point of right enlighten they and it be see that when the last house in saragossa have be beat down the first stand erect again in consequence of the democratic nature of we institution we council be we grand jury but after have elect we judge we choose several man in every county meeting of no public office but conspicuous for they integrity and knowledge of the law to assist the judge in they administration believe I these institution have a sound basis fit to protect a nation against a arbitrary government which be aim at centralization and oppression now these county have contend against the austrian government it do everything to destroy they the great field be open in the diet of 1847 have be elect by the county of pest i have the honor to lead the party devote to national rights and oppose to centralization and in defense of municipal authority it be my intention to make it impossible that the government should in future encroach upon the liberty of the people we have the misfortune in hungary to be govern by a constitutional king who at the same time be the absolute monarch of another realm -- by birth and interest attach to absolutism and oppose to constitutional government it be difficult to be a absolute monarch and behave as king of hungary there be on record a speech of mine speak in the hungarian diet about the inconsistency of these two attribute in one man -- that either austrium must become constitutional or hungary absolutistical that speech virtually make the revolution of 1848 at vienna after this revolution i be send to vienna to ask that we law be establish release the people from feudal rights and demand a constitutional ministry then it be that a circumstance occur to which i hear a allusion in the toast offer to I i be tell the king would grant we request only there be agitation in vienna and it would look as if the king be yield to pressure if the people would be quiet the king would sanction we law then i say that if the king would give he sanction to we legislative measure peace would be make for the house of austrium in twenty-four hour but when that consent be give in one chamber in another chamber that wicked woman sophia the mother of the present emperor who call himself king of hungary -- no he do _ not _ call himself king of hungary for he think the national existence of hungary be blot out -- plot how to ruin my people and destroy that sanction which be nothing but a necessary means to secure a just cause next come the hungarian ministry -- and strange to say i see myself place close to the throne when in vienna after the sanction be grant step be take to retract it i go to the arch-duke stephen the palatine of hungary the first constitutional authority of hungary -- the elective viceroy and tell he he ought to return to hungary if he wish to preserve he influence he answer that he could not return to hungary for if the king do not sanction we law -- he -lrb- the arch-duke stephen -rrb- might be proclaimed king instead of the emperor of austrium and he would never dethrone he cousin i answer that he speak like a honest man but perhaps the time would come when he would find a empty seat on that throne and he have better take it for i could assure he if he do not no other man ever would with the consent of the people when five month later in hungary we meet for the last time he call I to he house on a stormy night and desire of I to know what would be the issue of matter i answer : i can see no issue for you but the crown or else the scaffold and then for the people a republic but even from this alternative i will relieve you : for you the crown for I the scaffold if the hungarian independence be not achieve -- i make no hesitation here to confess that such be the embarrassed state of hungarian affair that i should have feel satisfied for he to have accept the crown remember that you father do not design at first to sever the tie which bind the colony to england but circumstance force the issue so it be with we we ask at first only democratic institution but when it be possible we be glad to throw away we king the arch-duke do not accept but be rather a traitor to he country such be the connection of tyrant with each other they desire not to prevent other from oppress he be now a exile like myself if he have accept the proposal no doubt the independence of hungary would have be recognize by even russium especially if he have form a family alliance with despotism and then for century the establishment of a republic would have be impossible whereas now as sure as there be a god in heaven no king will ever rule hungary but it must be one of those republic wherein republicanism be not a mere romance but a reality found upon the basis of municipal authority to which the people be attach we could never have such a movement as disgraced france in December excuse I gentleman if i abuse you kindness i be anxious to make known my idea upon the future organization of my country the organization which alone we could propose be one found upon the sovereignty of the people not only in a _ legislative _ capacity -- for it be not enough that we know that sovereignty by cast a vote once in three or four year : we must feel it every day everywhere the sovereignty of the people assert that man have certain rights not depend on any power but natural rights i mean such as religious liberty -- free thought -- a free press and the right of every family to regulate its own affair : but not only every family also every town city and county we sovereignty shall be such that the higher government will have no power to interfere in the domestic concern of any town city or county these be the principle upon which we government will be found -- not only sovereignty in legislation but a particular share in the executive government -- judge whether such a people be worthy to meet the sympathy of republican like you who have show to the world that a nation may be powerful without centralization believe I there be harmony in we _ ancient _ principle and you _ recent _ one judge whether my people be capable of self-government the venerable gentleman -lrb- josiah quincy -rrb- speak a word about england i believe the anglo-saxon race must have a high destiny in the history of mankind it be the only race the younger brother of which be free while the elder brother have also some freedom you gentleman acknowledge that from the mother country you obtain certain of you principle of liberty -- free thought and speech a free press & c -- and i be sure gentleman the english people be proud of liberty call to pronounce against the league of despot if the republican united state and constitutional england be in concord what would be the consequence i answer it would be exactly as when the south american republic be threaten -- as when russium forbid american vessel to approach within a hundred mile of its american shore i have often meet in the united state a objection against a alliance with england but it be chiefly the irish who be oppose to be on good term with england in respect to the irish if i could contribute to the future unity in action of the united state and england i should more aid the irish than by all exclamation against one or other if the united state and england be in union the continent of europe would be republican then though england remain monarchical ireland would be freer than now if i be a irishman i would not have raise the standard of _ repeal _ which offend the people of england but the standard of municipal _ self-government _ against parliamentary omnipotence -- not as a irish question but as a common question to all -- and in this movement the people of england and scotland would have join and now there would have be a parliament in england in ireland and scotland such be the geographical position of great britain that its country should be not one but unite each with its own parliament but still one parliament for all if i could contribute to get england to oppose the encroachment of absolutism i should be do more to aid ireland in aid freedom than if i so act as to induce england to look indifferently at the approach of absolutism i be glad to hear the word of that venerable gentleman -lrb- josiah quincy -rrb- they bring to my mind the word of john adam first minister of the united state to england when he address the king he say : -- _ he would be happy could he restore entire esteem confidence and affection between the united state and england _ and king george iii reply : _ i be the last to conform to the separation and i be the first to meet the friendship of the united state let the community of language religion and blood have they full and natural effect _ ` let this precedent belong to the intelligence not of to-day only -- let those word become now consider of particular interest to both country and it would be of the greatest benefit to mankind there be nothing more necessary to secure the freedom of europe than consent to act together on the part of the united state and england it be not necessary to say how far they will go but only necessary to say they will do as much as they interest allow and what may be necessary that the law of nation should be protect and not abandon when i be in england nothing give I more delight than to hear delegation address I mention you washington and confess themselves sorry that he have to manifest he greatness in contend against england but they be more proud to see the greatness of such a man than not to have be oppose by he they entrust I to bring word to the united state that they wish to be unite to you for the benefit of all humanity i be charge particularly by one hundred man connect with commerce at manchester -- the least wealthy of whom be _ worth _ as they express it in england # 10000 a year -- these gentleman tell I it would be a great result of my mission in the united state if i could convince american that englishmen think all difference have vanish and they desire to go hand in hand with the people of the united state as regard foreign policy now i have observe in new england less objection to the policy of a alliance with england than in many other part of the united state and i take it for a evidence of the intelligence and liberality of the people i know gentleman you have be please to honor I not for myself -lrb- for the people of massachusett be not man-worshippers but reverence principle only -rrb- -- therefore i can not better express my thanks than to pledge my word rely as on another occasion of deep interest i say _ upon the justice of we cause the blessing of god iron will stout arm and good sword _ -- and upon you generous sympathy to do all in my power with my people for my country and for humanity for which indeed in my heart though it be somewhat old there be yet warmth after many other toast president wilson call on judge hoar to speak the reply of the judge have several striking sentence he close by say to kossuth : it be because you sir have learn the truth that _ peace be the first interest of no people -- that there be other thing more sacred than human life -- that without justice and freedom life be only a mockery and peace a delusion and a burden _ -- it be _ because _ when tyranny have terminate every duty of a subject you too -lrb- \* -rrb- have dare to become the most notorious rebel of we time _ therefore _ do massachusett welcome you to the home of hancock and of adam and the majestic spirit of washington shed its benediction upon the scene -lrb- footnote \* : the judge allude to hancock and adam who be except by name as notorious rebel from general gage 's proclamation of amnesty -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* xliv -- russia the antagonist of the we -lrb- _ salem may 6 _ -rrb- lady and gentleman -- when four year ago the tiding of we struggle make the scarcely before know name of hungary familiar to you sympathy for a nobly defend noble cause move you heart to rejoice at we victory to feel anxiety about we danger yet so long as we struggle be but a domestic contest a resistance against oppression by a perjurious king you have no reason to think that the sympathy you feel for we be a generous manifestation of the affection of free man be at the same time a instinctive presentiment of a policy which you in you national capacity will be call upon by circumstance not only to consider but as i firmly believe also to adopt you be far from anticipate that the issue of we struggle would become a opportunity for you country to take that position which divine providence have evidently assign to you i mean the position of a power not restricted in its influence to the western hemisphere but reach across the earth you have not think that it be the struggle of hungary which will call on you to fulfil the prophecy of canning who comprehend that it be the destiny of the new world to redress the balance of power in the old the universal importance of we contest have be but late reveal it have be reveal by the interference of russium by we fall and by its more threatening result now it have become evident to all think man that the balance of power can not be redress unless hungary be restore to national independence consequently if it be you own necessity to weigh in the scale of the power on earth if it be you destiny to redress the balance of power the cause of hungary be the field where this destiny will have to be fulfil and it be indeed you destiny russian diplomacy could never boast of a greater and more fatal victory than it have a right to boast should it succeed to persuade the united state not to care about she -- russium accomplish she aim to become the ruling power in europe the ruling power in asia the ruling power of the mediterranean sea that would be indeed a great triumph to russian diplomacy greater than she triumph over hungary a triumph dreadful to all humanity but to nobody more dreadful than to you own future all sophistry be in vain gentleman there can be no mistake about it russian absolutism and anglo-saxon constitutionalism be not rival but antagonist power they can not long continue to subsist together antagonist can not hold equal position every additional strength of the one be a comparative weakening of the other one or the other must yield one or the other must perish or become dependent on the other 's will you may perhaps believe that that triumph of diplomacy be impossible in america but i be sorry to say that it have a dangerous ally in the propensity to believe that the field of american policy be limited geographically that there be a field for american and there be a field for european policy and that these field be distinct and that it be you interest to keep they distinct there be a time in we struggle when if a man have come from america bring we in official capacity the tiding of you brotherly greet of you approbation and you sympathy he would have be regard like a harbinger of heaven the hungarian nation tire out by the hard task of dearly but gloriously buy victory be longing for a little test when the numerous horde of russium fall upon we in the hour of momentary exhaustion indignation supply the wanted rest and we rise to meet the intrude foe but it be natural that the nation look around with anxiety whether there be no power on earth raise its protest voice against that impious act of trample down the law of nation the common property of all humanity no power on earth to cheer we by a word of approbation of we legitimate defense alas no such word be hear we stand forsake and alone it be upon that ground of forsakenness that treason spread its poison into we rank they tell my nation you case be hopeless kossuth have assure you that if you drive out the austrian from you territory and declare you independence it perhaps will be recognize by the french republic probably by england and certainly by america but look none have recognize you not even the united state though with they it be from the time of washington always a constant principle to recognize every government you be not recognize you be forsake by the whole world kossuth have assure you that it be impossible the constitutional power of the world should permit without a word of protest russium to interfere with the domestic concern of hungary and look russium have interfere the law of nation be break the political balance of power be upset russium have assume the position of a despotic arbiter of the condition of the world and still nobody have raise a single word of protest in favor of hungary 's just and holy cause such be the insinuation which russian diplomacy with its wonted subterraneous skill instil drop by drop into my brave people 's manly heart and alas i could not say that the insinuation be false _ the french republic _ instead of protest against the interference of russium _ follow its example and interfere itself at rome _ _ great britain _ instead of protest _ check turkey in she resolution to oppose that new aggrandizement of russium _ and _ the united state of america _ remain silent instead of protest against the violation of those law of nature and of nature 's god in the maintenance of which nobody can be more interested than the great republic of america in short it be by we feeling forsake that the skill of we enemy spread despondency through we rank and this despondency not the arm of russium cause we to fall self-confidence lose be more than half a defeat have america send a diplomatic agent to hungary greet we amongst the independent power on earth recognize we independence and declare russian interference to be contrary to the law of nation that despondency that loss of self-confidence have never gain ground among we without this treason would have be impossible and without treason all the disposable power of russium would never have succeed to overcome we arm -- never i should rather have bring the well-deserved punishment home to she should have shake she at home poland -- heroic unfortunate poland would now be free turkey deliver from the nightmare now press she chest and i accord to all probability should have see moscow in triumph instead of see salem in exile well there be a just god in heaven and there will yet be justice on earth -- the day of retribution will come such be the sad tale of my fatherland which by a timely token of you brotherly sympathy might have be save and which now have lose everything except its honor its trust in god its hope of resurrection its confidence in my patriotic exertion and its steady resolution to strike once more the inexorable blow of retribution at tyrant and tyranny -- if the cause i plead be a particular cause i would place it upon the ground of well-deserved sympathy and would try to kindle into a flame of excitement the generous affection of you heart : and i should succeed but since a great crisis which be universally feel to be approach enable I to claim for my cause a universality not restrict by the geographical limit of a country or even of europe itself or by the moral limit of nationality but possess a interest common to all the christian world it be calm considerate conviction and _ not _ the pass excitement of generous sentiment which i seek i hope therefore to meet the approbation of this intelligent assembly when instead of please you by a attempt at eloquence for which in my sick condition i indeed have not sufficient freshness of mind -- i enter into some dry but not unimportant consideration which the citizen of salem claim the glory of high commercial reputation will kindly appreciate gentleman i have often hear the remark that if the united state do not care for the policy of the world they will continue to grow internally and will soon become the mightiest realm on earth a republic of a hundred million of energetic freeman strong enough to defy all the rest of the world and to control the destiny of mankind and surely this be you glorious lot but _ only under the condition _ that no hostile combination before you have in peace and in tranquillity grow so strong arrest by craft and violence you giant-course and this again be possible only under the condition that europe become free and the league of despot become not sufficiently powerful to check the peaceful development of you strength but russium too the embodiment of the principle of despotism be work hard for the development of _ she _ power whilst you grow internally she able diplomacy have spread its net all over the continent of europe there be scarcely a prince there but feel honor to be a underling of the great czar the despot be all league against the freedom of the nation : and should the principle of absolutism consolidate its power and lastingly keep down the nation then it must even by the instinct of self-preservation try to check the further development of you republic in vain they would have spill the blood of million in vain they would have doom themselves to eternal curse if they allow the united state to become the ruling power on earth they crush poor hungary because she example be consider dangerous how could they permit you to become so mighty as to be not only dangerous by you example but by you power a certain ruin to despotism they will they must do everything to check you glorious progress be sure as soon as they have crush the spirit of freedom in europe as soon as they command all the force of the continent they will marshal they against you of course they will not lead they fleet and army at once across the ocean they will first damage you prosperity by crippling you commerce they will exclude america from the market of europe not only because they fear the republican propagandism of you commerce but also because russium require those market for she own product -lrb- he proceed to argue that russian policy like that of the magyar in they time of barbarism be essentially encroach and warlike that to be _ fear _ be often more important to russium than to enjoy a particular market that the russian system of commerce be and must be prohibitory to republican traffic that england alone in europe have large commerce with america and that the despot if victorious on the continent would make it they great object to damage cripple and ruin both these kindred constitutional nation he continue : -rrb- the despot be scheming to muzzle the english lion you see already how they be prepare for this blow -- that russium may become mistress of constantinople by constantinople mistress of the mediterranean and by the mediterranean of three-quarter of the globe egypt macedonium asia-minor the country and early home of the cotton plant be then the immediate province of russium a realm with twenty million serf subject to its policy and depend on its arbitrary will here be a circumstance highly interesting to the united state constantinople be the key to russia to be preponderant she know it be necessary for she to be a maritime power the black sea be only a lake like lake leman the baltic be frozen five month in a year these be all the sea she possess constantinople be the key to the palace of the czar russium be already omnipotent on the continent once master of the mediterranean it be not difficult to see that the power which already control three-quarter of the world will soon have the fourth quarter whilst the victory of the nation of europe would open to you the market till now close to you product the consolidation of despotism destroy you commerce unavoidably if you wheat you tobacco you cotton be exclude from europe but for one year there be no farm no plantation no banking-house which would not feel the terrible shock of such a convulsion and hand-in-hand with the commercial restriction you will then see a establishment of monarchy from cape horn to the rio grande del norte cuba become a battery against the mouth of the mississippus the sandwich island a barrier to you commerce on the pacific russian diplomacy will foster you domestic dissension and rouse the south against the north and the north against the south the sea-coast against the inland state and the inland state against the sea-coast the pacific interest against the atlantic interest and when discord paralyze you force then come at last the foreign interference precede by the declaration that the european power have with you silent consent inscribe into the code of international law the principle that every foreign power have the right to interfere in the domestic affair of any nation when these become a dangerous example and you example and you republican principle be dangerous to the absolutist power and you domestic dissension dangerous to the order and tranquillity of europe and therefore they consider it they duty to interfere in america and europe be oppress you will have single-handed to encounter the combined force of the world i say no more about this subject america will remember then the poor exile if it do not in time enter upon that course of policy which the intelligence of massachusett together with the young instinct of ohio be the foremost to understand and to advance a man of you own state a president of the united state john quincy adam with enlarged sagacity accept the panama mission to consider the action of the holy alliance upon the interest of the south american republic now i beg you to reflect gentleman how south america be different from europe as respects you own country look at the thousand tie that bind you to europe in washington a senator from california a generous friend of mine tell I he be _ thirty _ day by steamer from the seat of government well you speak of distance -- just give I a good steamer and good sailor and you will in _ twenty _ day see the flag of freedom raise in hungary i remember that when one of you glorious star -lrb- florida i think it be -rrb- be about to be introduce the question of discussion and objection become that the distance be great it be argue that the limit of the government would be extend so far that its duty could not be properly attend to the president answer that the distance be not too great if the seat of government could be reach in thirty day so far you have extend you territory and i be almost incline to ask my poor hungary to be accept as a star in you glorious galaxy she might become a star in this immortal constellation since she be not so far as thirty day off from you what little english i know i learn from you shakespeare and i learn from he that there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of in we philosophy who know what the future may bring forth i trust in god that all nation will become free and that they will be unite for the internal interest of humanity and in that galaxy of freedom i know what place the united state will have one word more when john quincy adam assume for the united state the place of a power on earth he be object to because it be think possible that that step might give offence to the holy alliance he answer be in these memorable word : the united state must take counsel of they rights and duty and not from they fear the anglo-saxon race represent constitutional government if it be unite for these we shall have what we want fair play and rely upon we god the justness of we cause iron will honest heart and good sword my people will strike once more for freedom independence and for fatherland \* \*

state committee on may 11th to west cambridge lexington and concord he have already visit bunker hill on the 3d of may but we have not in these page find room for he speech there at west cambridge he be address by the rev thoma hill and reply : at lexington also he receive two address and the following be he reply : -- gentleman -- it have be often my lot to stand upon classical ground where the whisper breeze be fraught with wonderful tale of devoted virtue bright glory and heroic deed and i have sit upon ruin of ancient greatness blacken by the age of century and i have see the living ruin of those ancient time call man roam about the sacred ground unconscious that the dust which cling to they boot be the relic of depart demigod -- and i rise with a deep sigh those demigod be but man and the degenerate shape that roam around I on the hallowed ground be also not less than man the decline and fall of nation impress the mark of degradation on nature itself it be sad to think upon -- it lop the soar wing of the mind and chill the fiery arm of energy but however dark be the impression of such ruin of vanish greatness upon the mind of man who themselves have experience the fragility of human fate thanks to god there be bright spot yet on earth where the recollection of the past brighten by present prosperity strengthen the faith in the future of mankind 's destiny such a spot be this gentleman should the reverence which this spot command allow a smile i might feel inclined to smile at the eager controversy whether it be at lexington or concord that the fire of the british be first return by american let it be this way or that way -- it will neither increase nor abate the merit of the martyr who fall here it be with they blood that the preface of you nation 's history be write they death be and always will be the first bloody revelation of america 's destiny and lexington the opening scene of a revolution of which governor boutwell be right to say that it be destine to change the character of human government and the condition of the human race should the republic of america ever lose the consciousness of this destiny that moment would be just so surely the beginning of america 's decline as the 19th of April 1775 be the beginning of the republic of america prosperity be not always gentleman a guarantee of the future if it be not accompany with a constant resolution to obey the call of the genius of the time nay material prosperity be often the mark of real decline when it either result in or be connect with a moral stagnation in the devoted attachment to principle rome be never richer never mightier than under trajan and still it have already the sting of death in its very heart to I whenever i stand upon such sacred ground as this the spirit of the depart appear like the prophet of future event the language they speak to my heart be the revelation of providence the struggle of america for independence be providential it be a necessity those circumstance which superficial consideration take for the motive of the glorious revolution be but accidental opportunity for it have those circumstance not occur other would have occur and might have present perhaps a different opportunity but the revolution would have come it be a necessity because the colony of america have attain that lawful age in the development of all the element of national existence which claim the right to stand by itself and can not any longer be lead by a child 's leading-string be the hand which lead it a mother 's or a step-mother 's circumstance and the connection of event be such that this unavoidable emancipation have to pass the violent concussion of severe trial the immortal glory of you forefather be that they do not shrink to accept the trial and be devoted and heroic to sacrifice themselves to they country 's destiny and the monument you erect to they memory and the religious reverence with which you cherish the memory be indeed well deserve tribute of gratitude but allow I to say there be a tribute which those bless spirit be still more eager to claim from you as the happy inheritance of the fruit they have raise for you it be the tribute of always remain _ true to they principle _ devote to the destiny of you country which destiny be to become the corner-stone of liberty on earth empire can be only maintain by the same virtue by which they have be found oh let I hope that while the recollection connect with this hallowed ground inspire the heart of a wander exile with consolation with hope and with perseverance -lrb- from the very fact that i have stand here bring with the anxious prayer and expectation of the old world 's oppressed million -rrb- you will see the finger of god point out the appropriate opportunity to act you part in america 's destiny by maintain the law of _ nature and of nature 's god _ for which you hero fight and you martyr die and to regenerate the world proclaim freedom in the name of god till -- to continue in the beautiful word of you whittier -- -- its blessing fall common as dew and sunshine over all -lrb- from lexington kossuth proceed to concord and be there address by the well-known author ralph waldo emerson he reply be at greater length and on the same subject as at lexington yet a part of it may here be print -rrb- kossuth say : -- in my opinion there be not a single event in history so distinctly mark to be providential -- and providential with reference to all humanity -- as the colonization revolution and republicanism of the now unite state of america this immense continent be people with element of european civilization could not remain a mere appendix to europe but when it be connect with europe by a thousand social moral and material tie by blood religion language science civilization and commerce to believe that it can rest isolate in politics from europe would be just such a fault as it be that england do not believe in time the necessity of america 's independence yes gentleman this be so sure to I that i would pledge life honor and everything dear to man 's heart and honorable to man 's memory that either america must take she become part in the political regeneration of europe or she herself must yield to the pernicious influence of european politics there be never yet a more fatal mistake than it would be to believe that by not care about the political condition of europe america may remain unaffected by the condition of europe i could perhaps understand such a opinion if you would or could be entirely isolate from europe but as you be not isolate as you can not be as you can not even have the will to be -lrb- for that very will would be a paradox a logical absurdity impossible to be carry out be contrary to the eternal law of god which he for nobody 's sake will change -rrb- therefore to believe that you can go on to be connect with europe in a thousand respects and still remain unaffected by its social and political condition would be indeed a fatal delusion you stretch out you gigantic hand a thousandfold every day over the wave you relation with europe be not only commercial as with asia they be also social moral spiritual intellectual you take europe every day by the hand how then could you believe that if that hand of europe which you grasp every day remain dirty you can escape from soil you own hand the cleaner they be all the more will the filth of old europe stick to they there be no possible means to escape from be soil than to help we european to wash the hand of we old world you have hear of the ostrich that when persecute by a enemy it be wont to hide its head leave its body expose it believe that by not regard it it will not be see by the enemy that curious aberration be worthy of reflection it be _ typical _ yes gentleman either america will _ re_generate the condition of the old world or it will be _ de_generated by the condition of the old world sir i implore you -lrb- mr emerson -rrb- give I the aid of you philosophical _ analysis _ to impress the conviction upon the public mind of you nation that the revolution to which concord be the preface be full of a higher destiny -- of a destiny broad as the world broad as humanity itself let I entreat you to apply the analytic power of you penetrate intellect to disclose the character of the american revolution as you disclose the character of self-reliance of spiritual law of intellect of nature or of politics lend the authority of you judgment to the truth that the destiny of american revolution be not yet fulfil that the task be not yet complete that to stop half way be worse than would have be not to stir : repeat those word of deep meaning which once you write about the monster that look backward and about the walk with revert eye while the voice of the almighty say _ up and onward for ever more _ while moreover the instinct of you people which never fail to be right answer the call of destiny by take for its motto the word _ ahead _ indeed gentleman the monument you raise to the heroic martyr who fertilize with they heart ' blood the soil of liberty -- these monument be a fair tribute of well-deserved gratitude gratify to the spirit who be hover around we and honorable to you woe to the people which neglect to honor its great and good man but believe I gentleman those bless spirit would look down with saddened brow to this free and happy land if ever they be doom to see that the happy inheritor of they martyrdom imagine that the destiny to which that martyr blood be consecrate be accomplish and its price fully pay in the already achieve result because the living generation dwell comfortably and make two dollar out of _ one _ no gentleman the star in the sky have a higher aim than merely to illumine the night-path of some lonely wanderer the course you nation be call to run be not yet half perform mind the fable of atalanta : it be a golden apple throw into she way which make she fall short in she race two thing i have meet here in these free and mighty united state which i be at a loss how to make concord the two thing i can not harmonize be : -- first that all you historian all you statesman all you distinguished orator who write or speak characterize it as a era in mankind 's history destine to change the condition of the world upon which it will rain a everflowing influence and secondly in contradiction to this universally adopt creed i have meet in many quarter a propensity to believe that it be conservative wisdom not to take any active part in the regulation of the outward world these two thing do not agree if that be the destiny of america which you all believe to be then that destiny can never be fulfil by act the part of passive spectator and by this very passivity grant a charter to ambitious czar to dispose of the condition of the world i have meet distinguished man trust so much to the operative power of you institution and of you _ example _ that they really believe they will make they way throughout the world merely by they _ moral influence _ but there be one thing those gentleman have disregard in they philanthropic reliance and that be that the ray of the sun never yet make its way by itself through well-closed shutter and door -- they must be draw open that the bless ray of the sun may get in i have never yet hear of a despot who yield to the moral influence of liberty the ground of concord itself be a evidence of it the door and shutter of oppression must be open by bayonet that the bless ray of you institution may penetrate into the dark dwelling-house of oppressed humanity there be man who believe the position of a power on earth will come to you by itself but oh do not trust to this fallacy a position never come by itself it must be take and take it never will be by passivity the martyr who have hallowed by they blood the ground of concord trust themselves and occupy the place divine providence assign they sir the word be yours which i quote you have tell you people that they be now man and must accept in the highest mind the same destiny that they be not minor and invalid in a protected corner but guide redeemer and benefactor advance on chaos and on the dark i pray god to give to you people the sentiment of the truth you have teach you people fond of its prosperity love peace well who would not love peace but allow I again sir to repeat with all possible emphasis the great word you speak nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principle \* \* \* \* \* xlvi -- condition of europe -lrb- _ last speech in boston _ -rrb- on may 14th kossuth in obedience to a distinct invitation deliver in faneuil hall the follow ample speech or lecture on the present condition of europe lady and gentleman -- the gigantic struggle of the first french revolution associate the name of france so much with the cause of freedom in europe that all the world get accustom to see it take the lead in the struggle for european liberty and to look to it as a power entrust by providence with the initiation of revolution as a power without the impulse of which no liberal movement have any hope on the european continent i from my earliest day never share that opinion i feel always more sympathy with the anglo-saxon character and anglo-saxon institution which raise england notwithstanding its monarchy and its aristocracy to a position prouder than rome ever hold in its most glorious day : and which free from monarchical and aristocratical element here in america lie at the foundation of a political organization upon which the first true democratic republic be consolidated and develop into freedom power and prosperity in such a short time as to make it a live wonder to the contemporary age and a book full of instruction to the come generation however that opinion about the french initiative prevail in europe and it be a great misfortune for you know that france have always as yet forsake the movement which it raise in europe and the other nation act not spontaneously but only follow the impulse which the french have impart to they falter and stop at once as soon as the french fail they with that opinion of the french supremacy no revolution in europe could have a definite happy issue freedom never yet be give to nation as a gift but only as a reward bravely earn by one 's own exertion own sacrifice and own toil and never will never shall it be attain otherwise i speak therefore out of profound conviction when i say that though the heart of the philanthropist must feel pained at the new hard trial to which the french nation be and will yet be expose by the momentary success of loui napoleon bonaparte 's inglorious usurpation still that very fact will prove advantageous to the ultimate success of liberty in europe loui napoleon 's _ coup d'état _ much against he will have emancipate europe from its reliance upon france the combined initiative of nation have succeed to the initiative of france spontaneity and self-reliance have replace the depend on foreign impulse and reliance upon foreign aid france be reduce to the level amongst nation oblige to join general combination instead of regulate they and this i take for a very great advantage many have wonder at the momentary success of loui napoleon and be incline to take it for a evidence that the french nation be either not capable or not worthy to be free but that be a great fallacy the momentary success of loui napoleon be rather a evidence that france be _ thoroughly democratic _ all the revolution in france have result in the preponderance of that class which bear the denomination of _ bourgeoisie _ amongst all possible modification of oppression none be more detest by the people than oppression by a assembly the national assembly of france be the most treacherous the world have ever yet know issue from universal suffrage it go so far as to abolish universal suffrage and every day of its existence be a new blow stricken at democracy for the profit of the bourgeoisie loui napoleon have beat asunder that assembly which the french democracy have so many reason to hate and to despise and the people applaud he as the people of england applaud cromwell when he whip out the rump parliament but by what means be loui napoleon permit to do even what the people like to see do by no other means but by flattering the principle of democracy he restore the universal suffrage it be a execrable trick to be sure -- it be a shadow give for reality but still it prove that the democratic spirit be so consolidated in france that even despotic ambition must flatter it well depend upon it this democracy which the victorious usurper feel himself constrain to flatter in the brightest moment of he triumph -- this democracy will either make out of loui napoleon _ a tool _ which in spite of itself serve the democracy or it will crush he france be the country of sudden change and of unthought of accident i therefore will not presume to tell the event of its next week but one alternative i dare to state : loui napoleon either fall or maintain himself the fall of loui napoleon even if bring about by the old monarchical party can have no other issue than a republic -- a republic more faithful to the community of freedom in europe than all the former revolution have be or if loui napoleon maintain himself he can do so only either by rely upon the army or by flattering the feeling and interest of the mass if he rely upon the army he must give to it glory and profit or in other word he must give to it war well a war of france against whomsoever it be or for whatever purpose be the best possible chance for the success of a european revolution or if loui napoleon rely upon the feeling of the mass -- as indeed he appear willing to do -- in that case in spite of himself he become a tool in the hand of democracy and if by become such he forsake the allegiance of he master -- the league of absolutistical power -- well he will either be force to attack they or be attack by they so much for france now as to italy italy the sunny garden of europe whose blossom be blighted by the icy north wind from st petersburg -- italy that capture nightingale place under a fragrant bush of rose beneath a ever blue sky italy be always the battlefield of the contend principle since hundred of year ago the german emperor the king of spain and the king of france fight they private feud they bloody battle on she much coveted soil and by they destructive influence keep down all progress and foster every jealousy by the recollection of old the spirit of liberty be nowhere so dangerous for european absolutism as in italy and this spirit of republican liberty this warlike genius of ancient rome be never extinguish between the alp and the faro we be teach by the scribe of absolutism to speak of the italian as if they be a nation of coward and we forget that the most renowned master of the science of war the greatest general up to we day be italian -- piccolominus montecucculi farnese eugene of savoy spinolum and bonaparte -- a galaxy of name whose glory be dim only by the reflection that none of they fight for he own country as often as the spirit of liberty awake in italy the servile force of germany of spain and of france pour into the country and extinguish the glowing spark in the blood of the people lest it should once more illumine the dark night of europe frederic barbarossa destroy milan to its foundation when it attempt to resist he imperial encroachment by the league of independent city and lead the plough over the smoking ruin charle the fifth have to gather all he power around he to subdue florence when it declare itself a democratic republic napoleon extinguish the last remnant of republican self-government by crush the republic of venice genoa lucca ragusa and leave only to ridicule republicanism the commonwealth of san marino untouch the holy alliance part the spoil of napoleon rivet afresh the iron fetter which enslave italy and forge new spiritual fetter prevent the extension of education and destroy the press in order that the italian should not remember they past every page glorious in they history for twenty-five century be connect with the independence of italy every stain upon they honor be connect with foreign rule and the burning mind of the italian though all spiritual food be deny to they can not be teach not to remember they past glory and they present degradation every stone speak of the ancient glory every austrian policeman every french soldier of the present degradation the tyrant have no power to unmake history and to silence the feeling of the nation and amongst all the feeling powerful to stir up the activity of mankind there be none more penetrate than unmerited degradation which impel we to redeem we lose honor what be it therefore that keep those petty tyrant of italy who be jealous of one another on they totter throne divide as they be among themselves whilst the revolutionize spirit of liberty unite the people it be only the protection of austrium stud the peninsula with she bayonet and with she spy and austrium herself can dare this only because she rely upon the assistance of russium she can send she army to italy because russium guard she eastern dominion let russium stand off and austrium be unable to keep italy in bondage and the italian unite in the spirit of independence will easily settle they account with they own weak prince keep off the icy blast which blow from the russian snow and the tree of freedom will grow up in the garden of europe though cut down by the despot it will spring anew from the root in the soil which be always genial for the tree remember that no insurrection of italian have be crush by they own domestic tyrant without foreign aid remember that one-third of the austrian army which occupy italy be hungarian who have fight against and triumph over the yellow-black flag of austrium -- under the same tri-colour which have the same color for both country show emblematically that hungary and italy be but two wing of the same army unite against a common enemy remember that even now neither the pope nor the little prince of middle italy can subsist without a austrian and a french garrison and remember that italy be a half isle open from three side to the friendship of all who sympathize with civil and religious liberty on earth but from the sea not open to russium and austrium because they be not maritime power and so long as england be conscious of the basis of its power and so soon as america get conscious of the condition upon which its future depend austrium and russium will never be allow to become maritime power and when you feel instinctively that the heart of the roman must rage with fury when he look back into the mirror of he past -- that the venetian can not help to weep tear of fire and of blood from the rialto -- when you feel all this then look back how the roman have fight in 1849 with a heroism scarcely parallel in the most glorious day of ancient rome and let I tell in addition upon the certainty of my own positive knowledge that the world never yet have see such complete and extensive revolutionary organization as that of italy to-day -- ready to burst out into a irresistible storm at the slightest opportunity and powerful enough to make that opportunity if either foreign interference be check or the interfere foreigner occupy at home the revolution of 1848 have reveal and develop the warlike spirit of italy except a few wealthy proprietor already very uninfluential the most singular unanimity exist both as to aim and to means there be no shade of difference of opinion either to what be to be do or how to do it all be unanimous in they devotion to the union and independence of italy with france or against france by the sword at all sacrifice without compromise they be bent on renew the battle over and over again with the confidence that even without aid they will triumph in the long run the difficulty in italy be not how to make a revolution but how to prevent its untimely outbreak and still even in that respect there be such a complete discipline as the world never yet have see in rome romagna lombardy venice sicily and all the middle italy there exist a invisible government whose influence be everywhere discernible it have eye and hand in all department of public service in all class of society -- it have its tax voluntarily pay -- its organize force its police its newspaper regularly print and circulate though the possession of a single copy would send the holder to the galley the officer of the exist government convey the missive of the invisible government the diligence transport its agent one line from one of these agent open to you the gallery of art on prohibit day -- give you the protection of uniformed official that this be the condition of all italy be show on one side in the fact that there the king of naple hold fetter in dungeon 25000 patriot and radetzky have sacrifice nearly 4000 political martyr on the scaffold still the scaffold continue to be water with blood and still the dungeon receive new victim evidently prove what spirit exist in the people of italy and still american doubt that we be on the eve of a terrible revolution and they ask what use can i make of any material aid when italy be a barrel of powder which the slightest spark may light in respect to foreign rule germany be more fortunate than italy from the time of the treaty of verdun when it separate from france and italy through the long period of more than a thousand year no foreign power ever have succeed to rule over germany such be the resistive power of the german people to guard its national existence the tyrant who sway over they be of they own blood but to subdue german liberty those tyrant be always anxious to introduce foreign institution first they sweep away the ancient germanic right the common law so dear to the english and american a eternal barrier against the encroachment of despotism and substitute for it the iron rule of the imperial roman law the rule of papal rome over the mind of germany cross the mountain together with the roman law and a spiritual dependency be to be establish all over the world the wing of the german eagle be bind that it should not soar up to the sun of truth but when the oppression become too severe the people of germany rise against the power of rome -- not the prince -- though they too be oppress : but the son of the miner of eisenach the poor friar martin luther defy the pope on he throne and at he bidding the people of germany prove that it be strong enough to shake off oppression that it be worthy and that it know how to be free and again when the french under they emperor whose genius comprehend everything except freedom extend they moral sway over germany when the prince of germany throng around the foreign despot beg kingly crown from the son of the corsican lawyer with whom the emperor be happy to form matrimonial alliance -- with the man who have no other ancestor than he genius -- then it be again the people which do not join in the degradation of its ruler but jealous to maintain they national independence turn the foreigner out though he name be napoleon and break the yoke asunder which weigh as heavily upon they prince as upon themselves and still there be man in america who despair of the vitality of the german of they indomitable power to resist oppression of they love of freedom and of they devotion to it prove by a glorious history of two thousand year the german race be a power the vitality and influence of which you can trace through the _ world 's _ history for two thousand year you can trace it through the history of science and heroism of industry and of bold enterprize spirit you own country you own national character bear the mark of german vitality other nation now and then be great by some great man -- the german people be always great by itself but the german prince can not bear independence and liberty they have rather themselves become slave the underling of the czar than allow that they people should enjoy some liberty a alliance be therefore form which they blasphemously call the holy alliance -- with the avowed purpose to keep the people down the great power guarantee to the smaller prince -- whose name be legion for they be many -- the power to fleece and torment they people and promise every aid to they against the insurrection of those who would find that for liberty 's sake it be worth while to risk they life and property it be a alliance for the oppression of the nation not for the maintenance of the princely prerogative when the grand-duke of baden in a fit of liberality grant he people the liberty of the press the emperor of austrium and the king of prussium abolish the law though it have be carry unanimously by the legislature of baden and sanction by the prince -- the holy alliance have guarantee to the prince the power to oppress but not the power to benefit they people but though the great power interfere often in the principality and little kingdom of germany indeed as often as the spirit of liberty awake yet they themselves avoid every occasion which would have force they to request the aid of they ally and especially of russium they know too well that to accept foreign aid against they own people be nothing else than to lose independence and be morally the same as to kneel down before the czar and to take the oath of allegiance a government which need foreign aid against its own people avow that it can not stand without foreign aid take that foreign aid -- interference -- away and it fall the dynasty of austrium and prussium be aware of this they therefore yield as often as they encroachment meet a firm resistance from the people when my nation so resolutely resist in 1823 the attempt to abolish the constitution prince metternich himself advise the emperor franci to yield and even humbly to apologize to the diet of 1825 the king of prussium grant even a kind of constitution rather than claim the assistance of the czar herein you may find the explanation of the fact that the continent of europe be not yet republican the spirit of freedom when rouse by oppression be lull into sleep by constitutional concession the czar of russium be well aware that this system of compromise prevent he intrude into the domestic concern of europe which would lead he to the sovereign mastership over all he therefore do everything to push the sovereign to extremity but this do not succeed until by a palace-revolution in vienna a weak and cruel youth be place on the throne of austrium and a passionate woman get the rein of government in she hand and a unprincipled reckless adventurer be ready to carry out every imperial whim regardless of the honor of he country and the interest of he master russium at last get she aim rather than acknowledge the rights of hungary they bow before the czar and give up the independence of the austrian throne they become the underling of a foreign power rather than allow that one of the people of the european continent should be really free since the fall of hungary russium be the real sovereign of all germany for the first time germany have a foreign master and you believe that germany will bear that in the nineteenth century which it never yet have bear bear that in fulness of age which it never bear in childhood soon after and through the fall of hungary the pride of prussium be humiliate austrian garrison occupy hamburg schleswig-holstein be abandon hessium be chastise and all that be dear to german purposely affront they dream of greatness they longing for unity they aspiration of liberty be trample down into the dust and ridicule be throw upon all elevation of mind upon all manifestation of patriotism hassenburg convict of forgery by the prussian court become minister in hessium the once outlaw schwarzenbeg and bach a renegade republican minister of austrium the peace of the graveyard which tyrant under the name of order be try to enforce upon the world have for its guardian outlaw reprobate forger and renegade could you believe that with such element the spirit of liberty can be crushed tyrant know that to habituate nation to oppression the moral feeling of the people have to be kill but could you really believe that the moral feeling of such a people as the german stamp in the civilization of which it be one of the generate element can be kill or that it can bear for a long while such a outrage do you think that the people which meet the insolent bull of the pope in rome by the reformation and the thirty year ' war and the numberless army of napoleon by a general rising -- that this people will tamely submit to the russian influence more arrogant than the papal pretension more disastrous than the exaction of the french empire they break the power of rome and of paris will they agree to be govern by st petersburg those who be accustom to see in history only the prince will say aye but they forget that since the reformation it be no longer the prince who make the history but the people they see the top of the tree be bent by the powerful northern hurricane and they forget that the stem of the tree be unmoved gentleman the german prince bow before the czar but the german people will never bow before he let I sum up the philosophy of the present condition of germany in these few word : 1848 and 1849 have prove that the little tyrant of germany can not stand by themselves but only by they reliance upon austrium and prussium these again can not stand by themselves but only by they reliance upon russium take this reliance away by maintain the law of nation against the principle of interference -- -lrb- for the joint power of america and england can maintain they -rrb- -- and all the despotic government reduce to stand by they own resource of power must fall before the never yet subdue spirit of the people of germany like rotten fruit touch by a gale let I now speak about the condition of my own dear native land i hope not to meet any contradiction when i say that no condition can and will endure which be so bad so insupportable that by try to change it a people can lose nothing and may gain everything no condition can and will endure the maintenance of which be contrary to every interest of every class a revolution on the contrary be unavoidable when every interest of every class wish and require it i will first speak of the lower and still the most powerful of all of the material interest there be some country where however insupportable the condition of the mass still the government have a ally in the mighty and influential class of banker who lend they money to support despotism and in those who have invest they fortune in the share of these loan negotiate by banker who speculate on and with the fortune of small capitalist that class of man partly tool of oppression partly the fool of the tool exist not in hungary we have no such banker in hungary and but a very small inconsiderable number who have invest they fortune in such loan-share and even the few who have be play in the fatal loan-share game have withdraw from it at any price because they fear to lose all from that quarter therefore the house of austrium have no ally in hungary as to we former aristocracy a class influential by its connection and by its large land property : you remember that when we succeed to abolish the feudal charge and convert million of we countryman of different religion and different language out of leaseholder into free land proprietor we guarantee a indemnification to the landowner for what they lose from a farm of about thirty-five to fifty acre of land the farmer have to work one hundred and two day a year for the landowner to give he the ninth part of all he crop half a dollar in ready money besides particular fee for shopkeep brewery mill & c we free the people from all the encumbrance and thanks to god that benefit never more can be tear from the people 's hand the aristocracy consent to it because we have guarantee full indemnification the very material existence of this class of former landowner be depend on that indemnification to defray they debt -lrb- which they formerly have the habit wantonly to contract -rrb- and to provide for the cultivation of they own large allodial property which they formerly cultivate by the hand of they leaseholder but now have to invest capital into now this indemnification amounting to one hundred million of dollar the house of austrium never can realize you know with its centralized government which be always very expensive with its standing army of 600000 man the only support of its precarious existence with its army of spy and secret police with its system of corruption and robbery with its fourteen hundred million of debt with its eternal deficit in its current expenditure with its new loan to pay the interest of the old and a unavoidable bankruptcy impend -- this indemnification austrium never can pay to the former aristocracy of hungary the only mean to get this indemnification be the restoration of hungary to its independence by a new revolution independent hungary can pay it because it have no debt will want no large standing army and will have a cheap administration because not centralize but municipal the people govern itself in and through municipality the cheapest of all government hungary have already point out the fund out of which that indemnification can and will be pay without any imposition upon the people or any loss to the commonwealth hungary have large state land belong to and administer by the commonwealth i have mathematically prove that the land property of the state sell in small parcel to those who have yet no land connect with a banking operation found upon that property itself to facilitate the payment of the price be more than sufficient for that indemnification besides a small land tax -lrb- which the new owner of that immense property divide into small farm will have to pay as other land proprietor -rrb- will yield more revenue to the commonwealth than all the proceeds of domestic administration this my proposition have be submit to the national assembly be accept and approve and have attach to the revolution the numerous class of farm-labourer who have not yet they own farm but who contemplate with the liveliest joy this benevolent provision which austrium can never execute since financially ruin as she be she can not be contented either with the tax revenue or the banking arrangement to defray the indemnification she sell the stock whenever she can find a man to buy it but here be a remarkable fact prove how little be the future of austrium contemplate as sure even by its votary when any one be willing to sell land property in hungary foreign banker austrian capitalist buy it readily at a enormous price because they know that private transaction will be respect by we revolution but _ from the government _ nobody buy a single acre of land because every man know that such a transaction must be consider void nay more not even as a gift be a estate accept by any one from the present government haynau himself be offer in reward a large land property by the government he do not accept it but prefer a comparatively small sum of money not amount to one-tenth of the value of the offer land and he buy from a private individual a land property for the money because that be a private transaction be sure to stand : whereas in the future of the austrian government in hungary not even its haynaus have confidence the manufacturing interest in hungary anxiously wish and must wish a revolution because manufacture industry be entirely ruin now by austrium all favor encouragement and aid which the national government impart to industry be not only withdraw but replace by the old system -- which be neither to allow hungary free trade so as to buy manufacture article where they can be have in the best quality or at the cheapest price nor to permit manufacturing at home but to preserve hungary in the position of a colonial market -- a condition always regard as insupportable and sufficient motive for a revolution as you yourselve from you own history know the commercial interest anxiously desire a revolution because there exist in fact no active commerce in hungary the hungarian commerce be degrade into a mere broker-ship of vienna all those who have yet in they hand the hungarian bank note issue by my government must wish a revolution because austrium alike foolish as criminal have declare they to be without value -- thus they can not be restore to value but by a revolution the amount of those bank note in the hand of the people be yet about twenty million of dollar no menace no cruelty can induce the people to give it up to the usurper they put it into bottle and bury it in the earth they say : it be good money when kossuth come home but while no menace of austrium can induce the people to give up this treasure of we impending revolution a single line of mine send home be obey and the money be treasured up where i have designate do you now understand gentleman by what motive i say that once at home in command -- if once we struggle be commence i do not want you material aid and neither wish nor would accept all you million -- but that i want you material aid to get home and to get home _ in such a way _ as will inspire confidence in my people by see I bring home the only thing which it have not -- arm but i be ask where will i land that of course i will not say -- perhaps directly at vienna like a montgolfier in a balloon but one thing i may say because that be no secret : -- remember that all italy be a sea-coast and that italy have the same enemy as hungary -- that italy be the left wing of that army of which hungary be the right wing and that in italy 40000 hungarian soldier exist as also in general in the austrian army 140000 hungarian more i can and will not say on the subject but i will say that all the amount of taxation the people of hungary formerly have to pay be but four and a half million dollar and now it have to pay sixty-five million dollar that landowner offer they land to the government to get rid of the land tax which be larger than all the revenue that we have raise 600000 hundredweight of tobacco -- now the monopoly of tobacco be introduce the people no longer smoke and have burn its tobacco seed we have raise 120 million gallon of wine gentleman i come not to interfere with the domestic concern of america i have no opinion about the maine liquor-law for myself i be very fond of water but still may say it be my opinion it will be many year before the maine liquor-law will pass through all europe well gentleman i be about to say one half of the vineyard be cut down -- hundred of thousand live upon horticulture and fruit cultivation yet the tree be cut down to escape the heavy taxation lay upon they the stamp tax be introduce the most insupportable to freemen -- village be divide from village town from town city from city by custom-line -- the poor peasant woman bring a dozen of egg to the market have to pay the consumption-tax before she be permit to enter and when she bring medicine home for she sick child she have again to pay before permit to enter she home and besides this material oppression and the daily and nightly vexation connect with it -- the protestant deprive of the self-government of they church and school for which they have thrice take up arm victoriously in three century -- the roman catholic deprive of the security of they church property -- the people of every race deprive of its nationality because there exist no public life wherein to exert it no national existence no constitution no municipality no native law no native official no security of person and of property but arbitrary power martial law and the hangman and the jail -- and on the other side hungarian patriotism hungarian honor hungarian heroism hungarian vitality stamp in the vicissitude of one thousand year and _ the consciousness that we have beat austrium _ when we have no army no money no friend and the knowledge that now we have a army and for home purpose have money in the safe-guarded bank note and have america for a friend and in addition to all this the confidence of my people in my exertion and the knowledge of these exertion of which my people be quite as well inform as yourselve nay more because it see and know what i do at home whereas you see only what i do here -- well if with all this you still doubt about the struggle in europe be nigh and still despair of its chance of success then god be merciful to my poor brain i know not what to think some here take I for a visionary curious indeed if that man who a poor son of the people take the lead in abolish feudal injustice a thousand year old create a currency of million in a moneyless nation and suddenly organize army out of untrained mass of civilian direct a revolution so as to fix the attention of the whole world upon hungary beat the old well-provided power of austrium and crush its future by he very fall and forsake abandon in he very exile be fear by czar and emperor and trust by foreign nation as well as he own -- if that man be a visionary then for so much pride i may be excuse that i would like to look face to face into the eye of a practical man on earth gentleman i have many thing yet to say the condition change and prospects of europe be not speak of so easily as you have see when only the condition of my own country be touch i do not know that i shall succeed but i will try to say something about turkey turkey which deserve you sympathy because it be the country of municipal institution the country of religious toleration turkey when she extend she sway over transylvanium and half of hungary never interfere with the way in which the inhabitant choose to govern themselves she even allow those who live within she dominion to collect there the tax vote by independent hungary with the aim to make war against the porte whilst in the other part of hungary protestantism be oppress by the austrian policy and the protestant several time compel to take up arm for the defense of religious liberty in transylvanium under the sovereignty of the porte the unitarian get political rights and protestantism grow up under the protect wing of the ottoman power the respect for municipal institution be so deeply root in the mind of the turk that at the time when they become master of the danubian province of moldavium and wallachium they voluntarily exclude themselves from all political rights in the newly acquire province and up to the present day they do not allow that a mosque should be build or that a turk should dwell and own land property across the danube they do not interfere with the taxation or with the internal administration of these province and the last organic law of the empire the tanzimat be nothing but the re-declaration of the rights of municipality guarantee they against the centralize encroachment of the pasha whilst czar nichola be about to convert the protestant population of livonium and estland to the greek church by force and by alluring promise the liberal sultan abdul medjid grant full religious liberty to all sect of protestantism but we be accustom to look upon turkey as upon a third-rate power only because in 1828 it be defeat by russium let we now see how the balance stand at that time and how it stand now in 1828 the turkish population be full of hatred on account of the extermination of the janissary the christian population be ready to rise against the government on account of the event of the greek war albanium be in revolt because it be oppose to the system of conscription for regular military service anatolium be discontent on the same ground mehemet alus possess egypt and paralyzed the action of the government in arabium and syrium servium have just lay down arm but have not yet conclude peace the danubian principality though unfavourable to russium be not hearty in support of the porte and remain apathetic under the occupation of russium the revenue do not exceed 400000000 piastre -lrb- 20000000 dollar -rrb- and be insufficient for a second campaign the new army be not yet organize and amount only to 32000 man without try general the fleet have be destroy at navarino the foreign diplomatist have leave the empire and the capital be expose to a attack of the enemy in such a position no european government could have risk a war russium have just defeat persium and by this victory get access to the asiatic province of the turkish empire it have therefore to defend the frontier on both side russium have not yet enter into circassium and could therefore rally all she force she have not yet abolish the poland of 1815 and could leave it without garrison she have not yet rouse the hatred or the jealousy of europe she have engage all the natural ally of the porte into a combination for rouse the population of she enemy and by she diplomacy she gain the power of bring she fleet into the mediterranean for blockade the port of turkey and navarino open for she the black sea where she have thirteen men-of-war not disturb by the porte by circassium by poland by france or by england she have prepare two year for this war whilst she enemy pass through a terrible crisis be without money without a organize army without a fleet without other resource than the feeble mussulman population on the seat of war twenty-four year have alter the balance -- turkey have now the enthusiastic support of she mussulman population the christian population with the only exception of bulgarium partake of this enthusiasm all the warlike tribe from albanium to kurdistan be now support the authority of the sultan mehemet alus be go arabium and syrium be again under the dominion of the sultan servium have make peace and have become the support of turkey offer she in case of a russian war 80000 man the principality have become the enemy of russium they have too long to suffer from she oppression the public revenue have double turkey have organize a regular army of 200000 man equal to any other and besides the militia she have distinguish general -- omer pasha gruyon she fleet be equal to the russian fleet in the black sea and she steam-fleet superior to the russian she have for ally all the people from the caucasus to the carpathian the circassian the tartar under emir mirza the cossack of the dobroja by whom the electric shock be transmit to poland and hungary form a unbroken chain by which the spark be carry into the heart of europe where all the combustible element wait for the moment of explosion twenty-four year ago turkey be believe to be in a decaying state it be now stronger than it have be for the last hundred year russium during this time have be unable to overcome the resistance of circassium and cut off from she south-eastern province she can not attack turkey in the rear the caucasian line furnish she in 1828 with 30000 man poland with 100000 the two country require now a army of observation and occupation of 200000 man the danubian principality absorb again 50000 the russian fleet remain as it be in 1828 -- thirteen men-of-war then thirteen now : and whilst in 1828 she have scarcely a enemy in europe she have now scarcely one friend except the king all she enemy whom she have defeat one by one have combine against she -- poland hungary the danubian principality turkey circassium where be now the force of russium do she not remind we of the golden image of nebuchadnezzar standing on foot of clay and yet gentleman this russium can make doubtful the struggle in europe -- not because powerful in arm but because it stand ready to support tyrant when nation be tire out in a struggle or before they have time to make preparation for resistance : then only be russium a power to be fear well gentleman shall not america stand up and with powerful voice forbid russium to interfere when nation have shake off they domestic tyrant gentleman remember that peter the czar leave a last will and testament to the people that russia must take constantinople why that russium might be a great power : and that it may be so constantinople be necessary because no nation can be a great power which be not a maritime power now see how turkey have grow in twenty-four year the more russium delay the stronger turkey become and therefore be russium in haste to fulfil the destiny of be a maritime power you can now see why be my fear that this week or this month or this year russium will attack turkey and we shall not be entirely prepare : but though you do not give we material aid still we must rise when turkey be attack because we must not lose its 400000 soldier the time draw nigh when you will see more the reason i have to hasten these preparation that they may be complete whenever through the death of nichola or loui napoleon or a thousand other thing -- most probably a war between russium and turkey -- we want to take time by the forelock but gentleman let I close i be often tell let only the time come when the republican banner be unfurl in the old world then we shall see what america will do well gentleman you aid may come too late to be render beneficial remember 1848 and 1849 have the nation of europe not you sympathy be you heart less generous than now it be not in time -- it come after not before be you government not incline to recognize nation it send mr mann to hungary to _ inquire _ -- would that when he inquire he have be authorize to _ recognize _ we achieve independence gentleman let I end before all let I thank you for you generous patience this be my last meeting whatever may be my fate so much i can say that the name of boston and massachusett will remain a dear word and a dear name not only to I but to my people for all time and whatever my fate i will with the last breath of my life raise the prayer to god that he may bless you and bless you city and bless you country and bless all you land for all the coming time and to the end of time that you freedom and prosperity may still grow and increase from day to day and that one glory should be add to the glory which you already have : the glory that america republican america may unite with she other principle the principle of christian brotherly love among the family of nation and so may she become the corner stone of liberty on earth that be my farewell word to you \* \* \* \* \* xlvii -- pronouncement of all the state -lrb- _ albany may 20th _ -rrb- on may 20th kossuth be receive in albany the chief city of new york state by governor hunt in the name of the citizen in reply to he address kossuth then address the audience substantially as follow : -- gentleman -- more than five month have pass since my landing in new york the novelty have long since subside and emotion have die away the spell be break which distance and misfortune cast around my name the freshness of my very idea be wear out incessant toil spread a languor upon I unpleasant to look upon the skill of intrigue asperse I with calumny wilful misrepresentation pour cold water upon generous sympathy loui napoleon 's momentary success shake the faith of cold politician in the near impendency of a european struggle for liberty and in addition to all this the presidential election absorb public attention and lower every high aspiration into the narrow scope of party spirit busy for party triumph all these circumstance and many besides too numerous to record join to make it _ probable _ that the last day of my wanderings on american soil would be entirely different from those in which the hundred thousand of the empire city -lrb- \* -rrb- thunder up to the high heaven the cheer of they hurrah till they sound like a defiance of a free people to the proud despot of the world and yet notwithstanding all these disadvantageous concurrency no change have take place in the public spirit of america i may have lose in you kind estimation of my humble self but my cause have not lose it be stand higher than ever it stand and the future in you country 's policy be ensure to it -lrb- footnote \* : new york -rrb- gentleman present bounty will never weaken in my mind the thankful appreciation of former benefit the generous manifestation of sympathy i meet on my arrival will always remain record with unfading gratitude in my heart but no just man can feel offend when i say that it be the manner of the _ farewell _ which decide upon the value of the _ welcome _ the result of my endeavor in america will not be measure by how i be receive when i come but by how i be treat when i leave you know all 's well that end well and to be well thing must end well and be about to close my task in america i can not help to say that the generous reception you have honor I with be doubly gratifying to my countryman who have watch with intense interest my progress in america -- and doubly dear to my heart because it be a evidence that the _ farewell _ give to the wander exile 's course confirm the expectation which the _ welcome _ have rouse the warm reception albany have give I be like the point upon the letter _ i _ -- it decide its mean the metropolis of the empire state give abundantly the first flower to the garland of america 's sympathy for the condition of the old world many a flower be add to it from many a place wherever there be a people there be a new garden of sympathy : and wherever be the obligation i owe -- and gladly own -- to many a quarter of the united state it be but a tribute due to justice publicly to avow that _ ohio _ with the bold resolution of its youthful strength and _ massachusett _ with its consistent traditional energy stand pre-eminent in the decide comprehension of america 's destiny -- and now the capitol of the empire state wind up the garland of america _ new york _ achieve what new york have begin and thus in leave america i have a answer to bring to europe 's oppressed million and the answer be satisfactory because i know what position america will take in the approach crisis of the world there be moment in the national life of a people when to adopt a certain course become a natural necessity : and in such moment the people always get instinctively conscious of the necessity and answer it by adopt a direction spontaneously that direction be decisive it must be follow : and it be follow pre-eminent patriot join in the people 's instinct may become either the interpreter or the executor of it but they can neither impart they own direction to the people nor alter that which public opinion have fix there be no other means to become a great man and a great patriot but by become the impersonification of the public sentiment conscious of a surpass public necessity those who would endeavor to measure great thing by a small individual scale would always fall short in they calculation and be leave behind there have be already several such moment in you country 's brief but glorious history i will only mention you glorious revolution of 1775 who make that revolution the people the unarmed hero the public opinion if the question have be leave to the decision of some few though the best and the wisest of all _ they never would have advise a struggle _ but would have arrange matter diplomatically you remember what anxious endeavor be make to prove that it be not the american who fire the first shot and how exculpation be send to england with protestation of allegiance all those little step be vain the people feel that it be time to become a independent nation and feel the necessity of the moment it take a direction by itself and make the revolution by itself now-a-days it be of a equally pregnant necessity to the united state to take the position of a power on earth nobody can hereafter make the people believe that it be possible for america to remain unaffected by the condition of the old world -- to advise that the united state shall still abstain from mix up they concern with those of europe the question to be decide be not whether america shall mix its concern with those of the old world because that be do but the question be whether the united state shall take a seat in the great amphictyonic council of the nation or not and whether it shall be permit to some crown mortal to substitute the whim of they ambition in the place of international law -- to set up and to upset the balance of power as they please and to regulate the common concern of the world and shall the united state accept whatever the czar may be please to decide about those common concern and shall the united state silently look on however the czar may grow upon the ruin of common international law to a all-overwhelming preponderance that be the question and that be the question the people have answer it and have pronounce about it in a manner too positive and too evident to be mistake it be already more than a year ago that a distinguished american diplomatist publicly advertise he fellow-statesman that it be the popular voice which will henceforth decide without appeal the great coming question in you foreign policy before the executive or congress can consider they some have reproach I for unprecedented arrogance in try to change the hereditary policy of the united state but it be not so i do but engage public attention to consider the exigency of time and circumstance the _ finger of the clock _ only show the hour but make not the time and so do i and allow I to say that the come of such a time be already anticipate by many of you own fellow-citizen long before my humble name or even the name of my country be know in america please to read the work of you own distinguished countryman wayland who for more than thirty year be engage at one of you high school in the noble task of instil sound political principle and enlighten patriotism into the heart and mind of you rise generation you will find that already in 1825 after have speak of the effect which this country might produce upon the politics of europe simply by she example he thus proceed : -- it be not impossible however that this country may be call to exert a influence still more direct on the destiny of man should the ruler of europe make war upon the principle of we constitution because its existence ' _ may operate as a example _ ' or should a universal appeal be make to arm on the question of civil and religious liberty it be manifest that we must take no secondary part in the controversy the contest will involve the civilized world and the blow will be strike which must decide the fate of man for century to come then will the hour have arrive when unite with herself the friend of freedom throughout the world this country must breast herself to the shock of congregate nation then will she need the wealth of she merchant the power of she warrior and the sagacity of she statesman then on the altar of we god let each one devote himself to the cause of the human race and in the name of the lord of host go forth unto the battle if need be let we choicest blood flow freely for life itself be valueless when such interest be at stake then when a world in arm be assemble to the conflict may this country be find fight in the vanguard for the liberty of man god himself have summon she to the contest and she may not shrink back for this hour may he by he grace prepare she thus write a learn american patriot as early as 1825 and he stand high even to-day in the estimation of he fellow-citizen and no man ever charge he with be presumptuously arrogant for have show such a perspective of come necessity to america he profound sagacity ponder the logical issue of america 's position have penetrate into the hidden mystery of future event and he have see he country summon by god himself to fight in the vanguard for mankind 's civil and religious liberty \* \* \* \* \* xlviii -- sound and unsound commerce _ speech at buffalo -rrb- _ on the 27th of may thirty thousand person assemble in the park at buffalo where kossuth have a magnificently enthusiastic reception in the evening he be escort to american hall by the mayor and other for a portion only of he speech in reply to the address of the hon thoma love can we here find room the austrian minister -lrb- say he -rrb- have leave the united state proud austrium have no longer a representative here but down-trodden hungary have the chevalier hulsemann have at last take he departure without even a chivalrous farewell the secretary of state let he depart without either alarm or regret all right gentleman two year ago there be much alarm in certain quarter when the idea of such a rupture be first suggest five month ago when in one of my public address i wish a good journey to mr hulsemann some think it rather presumptuous but now that he have leave no man care about it scarcely any man take notice of it the time may yet come when mr hulsemann 's master will be fully aware that what he be pleased to call _ the kossuth episode _ be a serious drama -- a drama in which i trust america will so act its part that in the catastrophe justice and freedom shall triumph violence and oppression shall fall in my many speech i have dwell largely on the necessity that there be for america to act this part i have not conceal that i be inform that many gentleman of commerce be timid concern it and i have venture to warn this young but great republic against _ materialism _ but commerce involve this danger only when it be bent on instant profit at any price and care nothing for the future nothing about that solidity of commercial relation on which permanent prosperity depend adventurous _ money-hunting _ be not commerce commerce republican commerce raise single city to the position of mighty power on earth and maintain they there for century it be merchant whose name shine with immortal lustre from the glorious book of venice and genoa commerce as i understand it do indeed apply its finger to the pulsation of present conjuncture but not the less fix its eye steadily on the future its heart warm with noble patriotism and philanthropy connect individual profit with the development of natural resource and of national welfare so that it spread over the multitude like a dew of heaven upon the earth which blossom through it with the flower of prosperity _ such _ a commercial spirit be a rich source of national happiness -- a guarantee of a country 's future a pillar of its power a vehicle of civilization and convoyer of its principle let I exemplify the difference between that noble beneficent spirit of commerce and the merely material money hunting which falsely usurp the name of commerce since the fatal arithmetical skill of rothschild have find out how to gain million by negotiate out of the pocket of the public loan after loan for the despot to oppress the blind-folded nation a sort of speculation have gain ground in the old world worthy of the execration of humanity -- i mean the speculation in _ loan share _ -- the paper commerce call stock-jobbing it be the shame-brand upon we century 's brow that such a commerce be become a political power on earth and unscrupulous gamester speculate upon the ruin of they neighbor hold the political thermometer of peace and war in they criminal hand but it be not commerce -- it deserve not the name of commerce -- it do not contribute to public welfare -- it do not augment the element of public prosperity -- it be but immoral gambling which transfer a unproductive imaginary wealth from one hand into another without augment the stock of national property : -- that be not commerce : and _ it be a degradation of the character of a nation when the interest of that speculation have the slightest influence or be make of the slightest consideration in the regulation of a country 's policy _ such a example have its full weight with every other kind of mere money-hunting it would be the greatest fault to regulate a country 's policy accord to the momentary interest of worshipper of the almighty dollar who look but for a momentary profit not care for they fatherland and humanity -- nothing for the principle -- nothing about the tear and execration of million if only that condition remain intact which give they individual profit -- though that condition be the misfortune of a world wherever that class of money-hunter be influential there be a disease in the constitution of the community it be vain to complain against the dangerous doctrine of socialism so long as such money-hunter have any influence upon politics the genus of rothschild have do more for the spread of socialism than its most passionate sectarian take on the other side the contrasting fact of the erie canal i remember well that some be terrify when in the council of the empire state first be start the idea of that gigantic enterprise and now when we hear that its nett proceeds amount to about three million of dollar a year -- when we see the almost unbroken line of boat on it -- when we see buffalo become the heart of the west the pulsation of which convey the warm tide of life to the east and by the communication of that artery bring the wonderful combination of the great western lake into immediate connection with the atlantic and through the atlantic with the old world -- when we see buffalo though at four hundred mile distance from the ocean without a navigable river living act and operate like a seaport and new york situate on the shore of the atlantic act as if it be the metropolis of the west -- when we consider how commerce become a magic wand and transform a world of wilderness into a garden of prosperity and spread the blessing of civilization where some year ago only the wild beast and the indian roam -- then indeed we bow with reverential awe before the create power of that commerce we feel that the spirit of it be not a mere money-hunting but a mighty instrumentality of providence for the moral and social benefit of the world and we at once feel that the interest of such a commerce underlie so much the foundation of you country 's future that not only be they entitle to enter into the regulate consideration of you country 's policy but they must enter -- they must have a decisive weight -- and they will have it whatever be the declamation of learn politician who have so much look to the authority of past time that they have find no time to see the imperious necessity of present exigency there be still some who advise you to follow the policy of separation from europe which washington wisely advise in he day -- wisely because it be a necessity of those time i have on many occasion adduce argument against this which to I be quite convincing yet to some mind custom be of so much more power than argument that i could not forbear to feel some uneasiness but to-day gentleman i no longer feel such uneasiness i be entirely tranquillize i want no more argument because i have the knowledge of fact and to those who still advocate the policy of separatism i will say have you see the city of buffalo go and look at it when you have see what buffalo be consider what be the interest which create that city and be personify by that city then trace those interest back to new york and from new york across the atlantic to the old world and again the return interest of intercourse from the old world to new york and hence to buffalo and from buffalo to the west and then speak of the wisdom of separatism -- what exist exist the fact will laugh at you reflection they will tell you that they can not be undo they will tell you that you be like endymion whom diana make sleep until the twig on which he lean he head have become a tree they will tell you that you could as well reduce buffalo to the log-house of middeau and lane the mighty democrat the steam-engine to the horse on the back of which ezra metcalf bring the first public mail to the sixteen dwelling-house which some forty year ago compose all buffalo you could as well reduce the erie canal to where it be when governor morri first mention the idea of tap lake erie or reduce the west to a desert and western new york to the condition in which washington see it when journey towards the far west all this you could as easily do as adhere any longer to the policy of separatism or persuade the people of the united state not to take any part in the great political transaction of the old world in that respect gentleman i be entirely tranquillize and tranquillize also i be in this respect that it be impossible the active sympathy of you people should not side with freedom and right against oppression and violence that will be do i want no assurance about it -- be a imperative corollary of exist fact public opinion be arouse to the appreciation of these fact and of they necessary exigency the only thing which i in that respect have yet to desire be to see the people of the united state persuade that _ it be time _ to prepare _ already _ to meet those exigency and that it be wise not to let themselves be overtake by impend event -lrb- kossuth then proceed to speak of subject elsewhere very fully treat and continue : -rrb- once more i repeat a _ timely _ pronouncement of the united state would avert and prevent a second interference of russium she must sharpen the fang of she bear and get a host of other beast into she menagerie before she will provoke the eagle of america but beware beware of loneliness if you protest be delay too long you will have to fight alone against the world : while now you will only have to watch and other will fight allow I to ask be the united state interested in the law of nation can they permit any interpolation in the code of these law without they consent i be tell by some that america have best not intermeddle with european politics and that you have always avoid to meddle with they but it be not so those who make this assertion forget history -- they forget that the united state have always claim and assert the right to have they competent weight and authority about the maritime law of nation -- it be one of you president who hold this emphatic language to the potentate of europe : _ we can not consent to interpolation in the maritime code of nation at the mere will and pleasure of other government -- we deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nation of the earth without we consent -- we claim to have a voice in all alteration of that code _ thus speak the united state at a time when they be not yet so powerful as they be now and they thus speak not for themselves only but for all the nation on earth and to what purpose do they speak these word so full of dignity and full of effect for the maintenance of the law of nation or one part of they the maritime code dauntless and full of resolution _ they _ alone vindicate natural rights for every nation on earth while europe sacrifice they _ they _ vindicate for every nation the proud motto they have emblazon on they banner -- _ free trade and sailor ' rights _ and _ free ship and free goods _ : now who can any longer charge I that i advance a new policy with that precedent before you eye would you be willing to resign now that you be powerful in respect to other part of the law of nation that which you have boldly take in respect to one part of they when you be yet comparatively weak or would you do less for the end than you have do for the mean the maritime part of the international code be no end but only a means to a end no ship take sail for the purpose merely of sailing on the ocean but for the purpose of arrive somewhere the ocean be but the highway and not the intended terminus russian intervention in hungary have block up you terminus : and the maritime code would be of no avail if the other provision of international law be to be still blot out from the code of nation by russian ambition let the slightest eruption of the political volcano in europe take place and you will see you might have see already during we past struggle that you proud principle of _ free ship free goods _ be a mere mockery unless the other part of the law of nation be also maintain that be what i claim from the young and dauntless nation of america i claim that she shall not abandon that position in the proud day of she power which she so boldly take in the day of she feebleness or be you already decline have you prodigious prosperity weaken instead of strengthen you nation 's nerve so young and a republic and already decline when its oppose principle russium rise so boldly and so high oh no god forbid that would be a sorrowful sight fraught with the grief of century for all humanity \* \* \* \* \* xlix -- russium and the balance of power -lrb- _ syracuse _ -rrb- at syracuse in new york state kossuth be receive with a address of the usual cordiality by the ex-mayor harvey baldwin of he ample reply a portion may here be present to the reader after allude to dionysius and timoleon he come back to the subject of russian interference in hungary and declare that he would not appeal to they passion but to they calm reason although he approve of excitement in a good cause and at any rate trust that truth and hope would never be out of fashion at syracuse he continue : -- gentleman as the destination of law in a well-regulated community be to uphold right justice and security of every individual rich or poor powerful or weak and to protect he life against violence and he property against the encroachment of fraud and crime -- so the destination of the law of _ nation _ be to secure the independence even of the smallest state from the encroachment of the most powerful one force will prevail instead of right so long as _ all _ independent nation do not unite for the maintenance of those law upon which the security of all nation rest i say _ all _ nation because weakness be always comparative not absolute a combination of several leagued power can reduce to the condition of comparative weakness even the strongest power on earth without the law of nation there be therefore no security for nation but the european power have long ago substitute for the rule of justice the so-called _ balancing system _ -- that be to say the political balance of power among nation that system be iniquitous for it be found not upon the national _ right _ even of the smallest nation to be maintain in its independence but upon the natural jealousy of the great power with this system the independence of the smallest state be not sure by right and by law but only depend on the consideration that the absorption of such smaller state might aggrandize one of the great power too much in this system humanity be take for nothing -- the mutual jealousy of the powerful be all and the implicit guarantee for the security of the weaker cease wherever the powerful can devise a plan of spoliation which leave the relative force of the spoliator the same as before it be thus the world have see the partition of poland -- that most iniquitous -- most guilty spoliation ever witness the balancing system would have protect poland from absorption by _ one _ power but it have not protect it from partition between these rival power formerly separate league between several state have be as a protect barrier against the ambition of a single powerful oppressor in the case of poland the world see with consternation a confederacy of great power form to perpetrate those very act of spoliation which hitherto have be prevent by similar means i therefore be certainly no advocate of this false system of political balance of power and i believe the time will come when that idol will be throw down from the place which it usurp and law and right will be restore to they sovereign sway but still i may say it be a imperious necessity for all the world in general as also for the united state that something should be do to prevent the measureless territorial aggrandizement of one single power chiefly when that power be the mighty antagonist of you own republic as indeed russium be i have on many occasion speak of the necessary antagonism between despotic russium and republican america allow I here to recapitulate some fact concern russium no man familiar with the history of the last hundred year be ignorant that the czar of russium take it for they destiny to rule the world it be they hereditary policy in which they be bring up from generation to generation till that infatuation become a point of they character to come to that aim -- russian preponderance step forth alike with protocol with emissary and with war -- in two direction westward and eastward against europe and against asia as to europe after have complete she arrondisement on the baltic -- she earnest aim be partly direct conquest and partly sovereign preponderance direct conquest so far as the sclave race be spread which the czar desire to unite under they despotic sceptre to attain that end the house of romanoff have start the idea of pansclavism the idea of union of the sclavish nationality under russian protectorate -- protectorate be always the first step which russium take when desire to conquer she have style that ambitious design the regeneration of the sclave nationality and to blindfold those deluded nation that they may not see that without independence and freedom no nationality exist she have flatter they ambition with the prospect of dominion over the world the latin race have its turn and the german race have and now it be the sclave race which be call to rule and master the world such be the satanic temptation of pride by which russium advance in that ambitious scheme i will not now speak of the mischief she have succeed to do in that respect : i will only mark the fact that the ambition of russium aim at the direct dominion of europe so far as it be inhabit by the sclave race the slightest knowledge of geography be sufficient to make it understand that this would be such a accession to the power of russium that be they unite under one man 's despotic will the independence of the rest of europe should even russia prudently decline a direct conquest of it would be but a mockery the czar would be omnipotent over it as indeed he be near to be already at least on the continent yet without the conquest of constantinople russium could never carry the idea of pansclavism : for in european turkey a vast stock of the sclavonic race dwell from bulgarium over servium and bosnium down to montenegro and across through rumelium moreover the conquest of constantinople be the hereditary lead idea of russian policy peter call the great the founder of the russian empire in make it from a half-asiatic a european state bequeath this policy as a sacred legacy to all he posterity in he political testament which be the magna charta of russian power and despotism all he successor have energetically follow that inherit direction alexander movingly avow that constantinople _ be the key to he own house _ and he brother do and do more than all he predecessor to get that key when the empress catharine visit the recently conquer krimea potemkin raise to she honor a triumphal arch with the motto -- hereby be the road to constantinople czar nichola have since learn that it be by vienna rather russium therefore decide to get rid of this obstacle and to convert it out of a obstacle into a tool a direct conquest would have be dangerous because it would have meet the opposition of all europe russium therefore try it first by monetary influence and have pretty well advance in it metternich himself be a pensioner to russium but the watchful independent spirit of constitutional hungary still hinder the practical result of that bribery and mark well gentleman in consequence of the geographical situation of she dominion and be also sovereign of hungary it be chiefly the house of austrium which be consider to be and cherish as the great bulwark against russium -- charged especially with a jealous guardianship of turkish rights and indeed have the house of austrium comprehend the condition of she existence attach hungary to herself by respect she independence and she constitutional rights and develop the power of she hereditary dominion and place herself upon a constitutional basis she could have maintain she respectable position of guardianship for century russium be aware of that fact it be the intrigue of russium which by money and emissary for year before infuse the notion of pansclavism among the bohemian pole croat serb under the crown of austrium equally as among the sclave population of turkey which encourage austrium to attack hungary by promise she aid in case of need if austrium succeed the constitutional life of hungary in many way so offensive to russium be overthrow : if austrium fail she become a dependency of russium and by the unwarrantable carelessness of some power the complicity of other the latter alternative be achieve austrium who be to have _ balanced _ russium be throw into she scale : instead of be a barrier she be she vanguard and she tool -- she high road to constantinople she auxiliary army to flank it it would be not without interest to sketch the history of russium step by step advance towards that aim by war and by emissary and by diplomatic corruption and corrupted diplomacy from the time of mahomet baltadjus of cursed memory through all subsequent war -- at the treaty of kutsuk kaynardje balta liman jassy bucharest ackierman adrianople unkhiar iskelessus down to the treaty as to the dardanelle and the bosphorus and to the treaty of commerce which make two-third of constantinople itself in they daily bread dependent upon russian wheat to the amount of thirty-five million of piastre a year while turkish wheat be rot in the store of asia minor by each of these treaty russium advance its frontier and press constantinople more closely within its iron grasp with such perseverant consistency pursue she aim that even in other political transaction apparently unconnected with turkey it be constantly this which she keep in view as for instance at the conference of tilsit when she surrender continental europe to the momentary domain of napoleon provide turkey be consign to she and still she do not succeed -- and still stamboul stand a barrier to she dominion over the world and why do she not succeed because the european power conscious of the fact that the conquest of constantinople involve they own submission to russium have in the last instant always prevent it by unite to treat the eastern question as one of life and death for they own independence the whole anglo-saxon race be bind by every consideration of policy to check the ambitious encroachment of russium it be not in europe only but in asia that you meet she she know that she dominion over the world must be short while the anglo-saxon race bold a mighty empire in indium moreover you yourselve by the extension of you territory to the pacific ocean be draw by a thousand natural tie of activity to asia you expedition to japan have a world of meaning in it great power _ must _ have broad view in they policy : you can not contain you activity nor therefore you policy within a domestic circle of you own you be for the world what germany be for europe as without the freedom of hungary europe can not _ become _ free so without the freedom of germany europe can not _ remain _ free for germany be the heart of europe you by have extend you dominion to the pacific become the heart of the world you be bring into the compass of russian hatred and russian ambition either you or russium must fall the balance of power and thereby the independence of the world have be overthrow by the connivance of the great power at the overthrow of hungary and it can only be restore by the restoration of hungary as for austrium she never more can be restore -- she be not only doomed she be dead no skill no tend can revive she have previously break every tie of affection and of allegiance she can not maintain even a vegetable life but by russian aid let the reliance upon that aid relax and there be no power on earth which could prevent the nation who groan under she oppressive and degrading tyranny from shatter to piece the rotten building of she criminal existence and as to my nation i declare solemnly that should we be leave forsake and alone to fight once more the battle of deliverance for the world and should we in consequence of it fail in that honorable strife we will rather choose to be russian than subject to the house of austrium -- rather submit to open manly force of the czar than to the heart-revolting perjury of the hapsburg -- rather be rule directly by the master than submit to the shame of be rule by he underling the fetter of force may be break once but the affection of a morally offended people to a perjurious dynasty can never be restore russium we hate with inconceivable hatred but the house of hapsburg we hate and we despise i have be often ask what may be amidst the present conjuncture a opportunity to renew we struggle for liberty and i have answer that the very oppression of we country the heroism of my people we resolute will and the intolerable condition of the european continent be a opportunity in itself but if too cautious man have too little faith in the destiny of mankind desire yet another opportunity there be the prospect of a war between turkey and russium this be a fatality point out by the situation of russium and by the press motive heap up since the time of peter the great : and russium will hasten to try the decisive blow since she know that turkey become more powerful every day now gentleman that will be a imperious opportunity to raise once more the standard of freedom in hungary and so may god bless we we be prepare for it we can not allow that we natural ally turkey be flank from the frontier of hungary at the order of the czar turkey by curious change of circumstance have become necessary to european freedom and civilization will find the kindred race of the magyar to aid she and by aid she to save the world the only question be will the united state remain indifferent at the overthrow of the balance of power on earth no they will not they can not remain indifferent they position on the coast of the pacific answer no they republican principle answer no the voice of the people clustering in thunder manifestation around my own humble self answer no you yourself sir in the name of the people of syracuse which be but one tone in the mighty harmony of all the people 's voice have tell I no before these assurance and upon the condition of you destiny i rely and i venture humbly to advise you to strengthen you fleet in the mediterranean sir look for a port of you own not depend upon the smile of petty italian despot but one where the stripe and star of america will be able to protect the principle of free ship free goods determine the character of you country 's future administration from a broad american view and not from any petty consideration of small party folly with these humble suggestion i cordially thank you for you sympathy and bid you a affectionate farewell \* \* \* \* \* l -- retrospect and prospect -lrb- _ utica _ -rrb- at utica in new york state the elegant saloon of the museum be arrange for kossuth 's reception : and the hon w bacon make a powerful address to he kossuth in the course of he reply say : -- lady and gentleman -- the history and the institution of the united state be not only the favorite study of my life from my early youth strengthen my conviction that with centralization and with parliamentary omnipotence which absorb all independence of municipal life there be no practical freedom possible : -- but the history and institution of the united state exert also a real influence upon the resolution of my people to resist oppression and not to shrink before the danger and sacrifice of a terrible conflict never yet be there a people against which all the art of hell have be combine worse than against the people of hungary in 1848 neither dream to attack any nor suspect to be attack never yet be a people less prepared for a war of defense or more surprise by the danger than my country be in those frightful day when many of the stoutest heart prepare mourningly to submit to the imperious necessity i call hungary to arm and while on the one side i pronounce a curse against those who would forsake the fatherland and be willing to bow cowardlike before a sacrilegious violence and accept the degradation of servitude -- on the other side in order to cheer up the manly resolution of my countryman i point to the heart-raising example of you history and that history become the guide star to we from the lustre of which we have draw self-reliance and resolution to bear up against all danger and all adversity but while we on we part readily yield to the heart-ennobling influence of you history we be disappoint in some expectation which we derive from it we see that you be not forsake in the hour of need yet you grievance be by far less heart-stirring than ours and should _ you _ have fail in the noble enterprize of independence such a failure at that time would by no means have teem with such immediate result of positive mischief to the world outside of you as every considerate mind might have foresee from _ we _ fall i therefore confess that i trust to that instruction also of you history and hope that should we prove worthy of the attention of the world that attention would not be restrict to a mere look at we contest with barren sympathy but allow I to mention that it be not from america alone that i hope we struggle would not be regard with indifference : the example of former political transaction in europe entitle I to just expectation from other quarter also in that respect when greece heroically rise to assert its independence great britain france and even russia herself interpose together to pacify the two contend party on the basis of the establishment of a independent greece and so very anxious be those great power to stop the effusion of blood that they solemnly declare they would insist upon the pacification should even the conflict party decline to consent to the propose arrangement and thus greece take its seat among the independent state though that be possible only by reduce the territory of the ottoman empire the integrity of which be consider essential to the equilibrium of political power on earth besides what be those power which interpose they mediation in favor of bleed greece it be russia despotical as she be : it be legitimist france then scarcely to be call constitutional for it be before the revolution of 1830 : and it be the ministry of great britain then if i be not mistake a tory one now be i not entitle with this precedent before my eye to hope that the bloody struggle in hungary would not be regard with indifference we have not rise from any reckless excitement to assert new rights or to experiment on new theory we should have be contented to keep what we lawfully possess it be not we who break the peace we be assail with a perjury more sacrilegious than the world have ever see : -- we merely take up arm to defend ourselves against national extermination against the nameless cruelty inflict upon we people -- man woman child -- by fire murder war and royal perjury and besides when we take up arm in legitimate defense it so happen that in france there be a republic establish which proclaim the principle of universal fraternity and there be in england a ministry claim to be liberal which on a former occasion have solemnly vouch its word to the british parliament that _ constitutional independence of any country great or small would never be a matter of indifference to the english government _ add emphatically that _ whoever might be in office conduct the affair of great britain he would not perform he duty if he be inattentive to the interest of such state _ be i to blame for have think that there be and should be morality in politics and besides there be republican america quite in another shape than she be twenty year before at the time of the war of independence in greece then she have not yet extend she sway to the pacific and be not yet expose to be so much affect by the political issue of europe and asia as she now be : then she have not yet a population of more than twenty million who now be in the necessity to claim the position of a power on earth : then she be indeed a new world teem with the mystery of the future but yet be far from be what she be to-day nay even the erie canal the great artery which now act as a miraculous link between europe and the interior of you republic be only about to be complete at the time and still what mighty sympathy a sympathy warm in expression and not barren in fact thrill through all america much like that which i now meet and pervade even you _ national _ council : -- would i be entitle to say much like as now although the question of greece be of course worthy of all interest -lrb- as the cause of liberty always and everywhere be -rrb- yet it be only a isolate cause and by no means of such surpassing influence upon the condition of the world as the cause of hungary be and be and yet i be disappoint in the expectation which i derive from you own history that a just cause will find supporter and never will be forsake by all oh we be forsake gentleman we be forsake even at the crisis when single-handed we have defeat we cruel enemy and russium that personification of despotism step in with its iron weight tear to piece the law of nation and overthrow upon we ruin the balance of power on earth that russium if invite would snatch at the opportunity to gain preponderance amongst the power on earth -- of this i entertain not the slightest doubt but i must confess i do not believe either that austrium would claim or that the other power of the earth and chiefly great britain and america would permit the intervention of russium i could not believe that austrium would resort to this desperate remedy because -lrb- and it be a remarkable circumstance which i mention now for the first time -rrb- it be austrium which but a few year before when in the transaction with turkey the question of foreign interference for the maintenance of the integrity of the turkish empire be agitate in the council of the world -lrb- and from which you of course be exclude as to the present day you always yet have be as if you be nothing but a patch of earth -rrb- yes it be austrium which object that the guarantee of interference should be even claim pronounced in a solemn diplomatic note these memorable word : -- _ a state ought never to accept and still less request of another state a service for which it be unable to offer in return a strict reciprocity else by accept such favor she lose the flower of she own independence -- a state accept such a favor become a mediatized state : it make a act of submission to the will of the state which take the charge of its defense this state become a protector and to be dependent upon a protector be insupportable _ thus speak austrium how then could i imagine that the same austrium which thus speak would accept the degradation of russian interference and should even the house of austrium rule by a guilty woman under the name of a witless cruel child be willing thus to ruin itself how could i imagine that england that america that the world would allow such a preponderance to russia as make she almost the mistress over the world at least open the way to become such no that indeed i could not imagine and still it be do we fall not unwept unhonoured and unsung but still we fall well : sad though be we fate it be but a trial and no death perhaps it be necessary that the destiny of mankind should be fulfil i have a unbroken faith in he the heavenly father of all the heart of mortal man may break but what he do that be well do the way of providence be mysterious the car of destiny go on unrestrained and the weight of its wheel often crush the happiness of generation flood of tear and of blood often mark its track mankind look up to heaven and while measure eternity with the rule of the pass moment sometimes despair of the future and believe the sun of freedom sink for ever it be a delusion : it be the folly of anxiety night be the darkest before dawn and the misfortune of the moment often lead to the happiness of eternity yes gentleman the way of providence be miraculous let I cast a look backwards into the last struggle for freedom in europe that they history may become the book of future and that when we perceive the salutary action of providence even in we misfortune we may be strengthen in we faith in the future freedom and that you may see that for we down-trodden but not break there be full reason to pursue we way not only with the resoluteness of duty but also with the cheerfulness of a sure success courageous as strength untired as perseverance unshaken as religious faith self-sacrificing as maternal love cautious as wisdom but resolute as desperation itself but where be the action of providence visible in the failure of 1848 be you question gentleman i will tell you the continent of europe be afflict with three disease in 1848 -- monarchical inclination centralization and the antagonism of nationality with such element and in such direction deception be unavoidable lasting liberty be not to be achieve it be the lot of the people to be free from these disease because god have design the people to freedom and not to deception therefore the revolution of 1848 have to fail but it be still not a mere accident in history it be a necessary step in the development of mankind 's destiny and it will shine for ever in history as a glorious preparation for the ultimate triumph of liberty to carry which a positive practical direction be necessary and that now exist france germany and italy be no more to fight for the deception of monarchical principle not for the triumph of dynasty but for republic hungary take this direction already in 1849 by dethrone the hapsburg france germany and italy will not follow in the track of centralization hungary never follow it and the government may ally themselves for the oppression of the world 's liberty -- they have already ally themselves -- but nation will no more rise in arm against one another they will rise not to dominate but to be independent and free instead of the antagonism of nationality it be now the idea of the solidarity and fraternity of nation which be become the character of we time and this be to be the source of we success in future this explain the fear of the tyrant which manifest itself in such blind rage this be the direction which i pursue this be the secret of the sympathy of the people unparalleled yet in history which i meet in both hemisphere and of the coalition of despot aristocrat and ambitious intriguer to persecute I i hope gentleman with these consideration before you eye you will not share in the opinion of those who despair of the cause of freedom in europe because the revolution of 1848 have fail \* \* \* \* \* li -- the triple bond -lrb- _ address before the german citizen of new york _ -rrb- at the broadway tabernacle on Wednesday evening kossuth deliver a farewell address before the german citizen of new york it be speak in the german language and be receive with the hearty plaudit of a immense assemblage a small portion only

likewise learn much whatever be the result of my exertion so much be sure that they have link more closely the heart of the german and hungarian and have mature the instinct of solidarity into self-conscious conviction this result alone be worth a warm utterance of thanks it will heavily weigh in the future of the world and this result dear friend be it not achieve the heart of the german

which fill you soul and mine and what be this aim which thrill through we bosom like a magnetic current the aim be the solidarity and independence of nation -- the freedom of we people -- they liberation from the yoke of tyranny with this aim before my eye and decide resolution in my heart i feel here amidst you as werner stauffacher feel when in the hour of the night on the rüttli god above he and the sword in he hand he make the covenant with he two friend against tyrannical austrium let this meeting here become the symbol of a similar covenant three -lrb- \* -rrb- be the man who make it and switzerland become free let we three nation make a similar covenant and the world become free germany hungary and italy hurrah for the new rüttli-covenant god increase the number of they as he increase the number of those on the rüttli and we triune band strong in itself will readily greet every one and meet he as a brother have the same rights in the great council of the amphictyon where the nation will give they verdict against tyrant and tyranny on the battle-field with the thunder of the cannon and the clashing of sword and will put the independence of every nation under the common guarantee of all in order that every one of they may regulate she own domestic affair without foreign interference and every people may govern itself not acknowledge any master but the almighty they will increase the member of this covenant but germany hungary and italy they be neighbor and have the same enemy hurrah for the new covenant of stauffacher -lrb- footnote \* : werner stauffacher walter fürst and arnold of the melchthal November 11th 1307 -rrb- now by the god who lead my people from the prairie of far asia to the bank of the danube -- of the danube whose wave have bring religion science and civilization from germany to we and in whose wave the tear of germany and hungary be mingle by the god who lead we when on the soil water by we blood we be the bulwark of christendom by the god who give strength to we arm in the struggle for freedom until we oppressor this godless house which weigh so heavily on the liberty of germany for century be humble and sink down to be the underling of the muscovite czar by the tie of common oppression which torture we nation -- by the tie of the same love of liberty and of the same hatred of tyranny which boil in the vein of we people -- by the remembrance of the day -lrb- \* -rrb- when the german of vienna rise to bar the way toward hungary against the hireling of despotism -- and by the blood which flow on the plain of schwechat -lrb- \*\* -rrb- from hungarian heart for the deliverance of vienna by the almighty eye which watch the fate of mankind -- by all these i pledge myself i pledge that the people of hungary will keep this covenant honestly faithfully and truly in life and death -lrb- footnote \* : October 5th 1848 -rrb- -lrb- footnote \*\* : October 30th 1848 -rrb- i tender the brother-hand of hungary to the german people because i be convince that it be essentially necessary for the freedom and independence of my country destine as we be to be the vanguard of freedom i know well that as long as germany remain enslaved even the victory of we liberty would remain insecure as long as germany remain a army whose power be wield by the criminal hand of the house of hapsburg as long as russium have nothing to fear from germany because the two master of germany be but underling of russium -- obey the command of they master because he maintain they on they totter throne against they own people so long russium will always have the arrogance to throw she despotic sword into the scale against the freedom of the world i be not the first who say it that the freedom of germany be the condition of the liberty of the world history tell it with a thousand tongue every statesman acknowledge it and all the despot know it twenty year past when the german prince recover from the stunning blow of the July revolution by find out that loui philippe be not in earnest with he phrase of liberty when in the year 1832 they unite to enslave the german people and to retract the concession which they have give in the fright of they heart when they curtail all the constitutional guarantee then henry lytton bulwer the same who be ambassador in washington during the last year rise in the english parliament and claim that england should not permit the liberty and independence of the german people to be crush he claim the attention of the world to the great truth that _ the peace of europe can not be secure without a strong germany and that germany can not be strong without freedom _ a free germany be a bulwark against the encroachment of france and the arrogance of russium germany enslave be either the prey of the former or the tool of the other he prophecy be fulfil germany be become half the prey and wholly the tool of russium who then can calculate on security and peace and freedom as long as germany be thus enslave you see dear friend that the brotherly union with germany must be of sacred importance to I and that my heart must beat as fervently for germany 's freedom as for that of my own people therefore i necessarily wish to bequeath the care of the seed which i have sow to man urge to this task of love not only by enlighten american patriotism -- not only by the conscience of right and duty and prudence but likewise especially by love for they old german fatherland and do i not express only the sentiment of you own heart when i say the german may wander from he father 's house and may build for himself a new home in a distant country yet he ever love truly and faithfully he own old german fatherland i request you to exert you influence that the idea of the solidarity of the struggle for european liberty may be well understand and that preparation be make to support the revolution whenever it break out there be nothing more dangerous than to say : the hungarian the italian or the german fight let we see whether he succeed if he succeed we too will try the same by the isolation of the nation the combined despot become victorious let everybody support liberty wherever she struggle but on the other side the force of the revolution can not so pledge and tie themselves as to be throw into the abyss by every ill-combined premature outbreak _ not a _ emeute _ but a _ revolution _ be we aim _ and therefore the leader of the movement of the different nation must combine either in a simultaneous outbreak or to mutual support and in this combination there must be absolute freedom and equality there be person in this country who do I the honor to mention that i would lead the german movement no gentleman that would be a presumptuous arrogance even if it be practical which it be not this idea itself be the most antagonistical to my principle no -- no no foreign interference with the domestic affair of a nation i will not bear it in hungary nor obtrude it abroad full independence be my watchword but you will ask who be or who be the leader of germany with whom i still combine the question be easily answer you will acknowledge they from they work whoever come to tender I he hand as a confederate i do not ask who he be where he come from -- but i ask what do you weigh what power do you command what force have you organize or what be you prospects or means of organization and then i inquire into the truth myself i judge the vitality of the intention and accept or decline the proffer brotherly alliance of mutual support this be my way i do not think that germany will ever combine under the leadership of one man but there be many german in the different part of germany who enjoy the confidence of they countryman and have a leading influence every one of these can act in he sphere i my friend will be always ready to combine with every one who do and who have some force to tender to the league i do not care for name for petty party dispute or for those which belong to the domestic question -lrb- kossuth proceed in assent to a special request to give he advice as to the method of proceed suitable to the german voter in america and close by say : -rrb- those be the principle my dear friend which should lead you accord to my humble opinion in the present crisis and if you take into kind consideration my bequest and exert you influence and active aid on behalf of the movement for freedom in europe i can but assure you for my grateful farewell that there be hundred of thousand in europe who take those word for they device which the other day the german singer sing as if from the depth of my heart and never shall rest the shield and the spear till destroy we see and lay in the dust the enemy

the humanity of the sultan back by american generosity second by england i once more be restore to personal freedom and by freedom to activity have succeed to escape the different snare and trap which i unexpectedly meet i consider it my duty publicly to declare that the war between austrian tyranny and the freedom of hungary be not end yet and swear eternal resistance to the oppressor of my

humanity its step be count by century and yet while countless million stand almost at the same point where they stand and some even have decline since america first emerge out of a unexplored darkness which have cover she for thousand of year like the gem in the sea while it be but yesterday a few pilgrim land on the wild coast of plymouth fly from causeless oppression seek but for a place of refuge and of rest and for a free spot in the wilderness to adore the almighty in they own way still in such a brief time shorter than the record genealogy of the noble horse of the wander arab yes almost within the turn of the hand out of the unknown wilderness a mighty empire arise broad as a ocean solid as a mountain-rock and upon the scarcely rot root of the primitive forest proud city stand teem with boundless life grow like the prairie 's grass in spring advance like the steam-engine baffling time and distance like the telegraph and spread the pulsation of they life-tide to the remotest part of the world and in those city and on that broad land a nation free as the mountain air independent as the soar eagle active as nature and powerful as the giant strength of million of freeman how wonderful what a present -- and what a future yet future -- then let I stop at this mysterious word -- the veil of unrevealed eternity the shadow of that dark word pass across my mind and amid the bustle of this gigantic bee-hive there i stand with meditation alone and the spirit of the immovable past rise before my eye unfold the misty picture-roll of vanish greatness and of the fragility of human thing and among they dissolve view there i see the scorched soil of africa and upon that soil thebe with its hundred gate more splendid than the most splendid of all the exist city of the world thebe the pride of old egypt the first metropolis of art and science and the mysterious cradle of so many doctrine which still rule mankind in different shape though it have long forget they source there i see syrium with its hundred city every city a nation and every nation with a empire 's might baalbec with its gigantic temple the very ruin of which baffle the imagination of man as they stand like mountain of carve rock in the desert where for hundred of mile not a stone be to be find and no river flow offer its tolerant back to carry a mountain 's weight upon and yet there they stand those gigantic ruin and as we glance at they with astonishment though we have master the mysterious element of nature and know the combination of lever and how to catch the lightning and to command the power of steam and of compress air and how to write with the burning fluid out of which the thunderbolt be forge and how to drive the current of stream up the mountain 's top and how to make the air shine in the night like the light of the sun and how to dive to the bottom of the deep ocean and how to rise up to the sky -- though we know all this and many thing else still look at the temple of baalbec we can not forbear to ask what people of giant be that which could do what neither the effort of we skill nor the ravage hand of unrelenting time can undo through thousand of year and then i see the dissolve picture of nineveh with its rampart now cover with mountain of sand where layard be digging up colossal winged bull huge as a mountain and yet carve with the nicety of a cameo and then babylon with its wonderful wall and jerusalem with its unequalled temple tyrus with its countless fleet arad with its wharf and sidon with its labyrinth of work-shop and factory and ascalon and gaza and beyrout and farther off persepoli with its world of palace all these pass before my eye as they have be and again they pass as they now be with no trace of they ancient greatness but here and there a ruin and everywhere the desolation of tomb with all they splendor power and might they vanish like a bubble or like the dream of a child leave but for a moment a drop of cold sweat upon the sleeper 's brow or a quiver smile upon he lip then this wipe away dream sweat smile -- all be nothingness so the powerful city of the ancient greatness of a giant age they very memory but a sad monument of the fragility of human thing and yet proud of the pass hour 's bliss man speak of the future and believe themselves insure against its vicissitude and the spirit of history roll on the misty shape of the past before the eye of my soul after those city of old come the nation of old the assyrian the chaldean the war-like philistine the commercial republic of phoenicium and the persian rule from the indus to the mediterranean and egypt become the center of the universe after have be thousand of year ago the cradle of its civilization where be the power the splendor and the glory of all those mighty nation all have vanish without other trace than such as the foot of the wanderer leave upon the dust and still man speak of the future with proud security and yet they know that carthage be no more though it rule spain and rule africa beyond the pillar of hercule down to cerne a immense territory bless with all the blessing of nature which hannon fill with flourish city of which now no trace remain and man speak of the future though they know that such thing as heroic greece once do exist glorious in its very ruin and a source of everlasting inspiration in its immortal memory man speak of the future and still they can rehearse the powerful colony issue from greece and the empire they heroic son have found and they can mark out with a finger on the map the unparalleled conquest of alexander how he cross victoriously that desert whence semirami out of a countless host bring home but twenty man and cyrus out of a still larger number only seven man but he -lrb- alexander -rrb- go on in triumph and conquer indium up to the hydaspe as he conquer before tyrus and egypt and secure with prudence what he have conquer with indomitable energy and man speak of the future though they know that such a thing do exist as rome the mistress of the world -- rome rise from atomic smallness to immortal greatness and to a grandeur absorb the world -- rome now have all she citizen without and now again have all the world within she wall and pass through all the vicissitude of gigantic rise waver decline and mournful fall and man speak of the future still with these awful monument of fragility before they eye but it be the sad fate of humanity that encompass its hope fear contentment and wish within the narrow scope of momentary satisfaction the great lesson of history be teach almost in vain whatever be its warning we rely on we good fortune and we be ingenious in find out some soothing pretext to lull down the dreadful admonition of history man in he private capacity console the instinctive apprehension of he heart with the idea that he condition be different from what warningly strike he mind the patriot feel well that not only the present but also the future of he beloved country have a claim to he care but he lull himself into carelessness by the ingenious consolation that the condition of he country be different -- that it be not obnoxious to those fault which make other country decline and fall that the time be different the character and spirit of the nation be different its power not so precarious and its prosperity more solid and that therefore it will not share the same fate of those which vanish like a dream and the philanthropist also whose heart throb for the lasting welfare of all humanity cheer he mind with the idea that after all mankind at large be happier than it be of yore and that this happiness ensure the future against the reverse of olden time that fallacy natural as it may be be a curse which weigh heavily on we let we see in what respect we age be different from those olden time be mankind more virtuous than it have be of yore why in this enlighten age be we not look for virtuous inspiration to the god-like character of these olden time if we take virtue to be love of the law and of the fatherland dare we say that we age be more virtuous if that man be to be call virtuous who in all he act be but animated by a regard to the common good and who in every case feel ready to subordinate he own selfish interest to public exigency -- if that be virtue -lrb- as indeed it be -rrb- i may well appeal to the conscience of mankind to give a impartial verdict upon the question if we age be more virtuous than the age of codrus or of regulus of decius and of scaevolum look to the school of zeno the stoic of immortal memory and when you see they contemn alike the vanity of riches and the ambition of personal glory impenetrable to the consideration of pleasure and of pain occupy only to promote public welfare and to fulfil they duty toward the community when you see they inspire in all they act by the doctrine that bear in a society it be they duty to live for the benefit of society and when you see they place they own happiness only upon the happiness of they fellow-man -- then say if we too selfish too material age can stand a comparison with that olden period when you remember the politician of ancient greece acknowledge no other basis for the security of the commonwealth than virtue and see the political system of we day turn only upon manufacture commerce and finances will you say that we age be more virtuous when look to you own country -- the best and happiest because the freest of all -- you will not dissimulate in you own mind what consideration influence the platform of you political party and then in contra-position will reflect upon those time when timon of athen choose to take part in he country 's government assemble he friend and renounce they friendship in order that he might not be tempt by party consideration or by affection of amity in he important duty toward the commonwealth then have thus reflect say take you we own age to be more virtuous and therefore more ensure against the reverse of fortune than those older time but perhaps there be a greater amount of private happiness and by the broad diffusion of private welfare the security of the commonwealth be more lasting and more sure caracciolus have be ambassador in england when return to italy say that england be the most detestable country in the world because there be to be find twenty different sort of religion but only two kind of sauce with which to season meat there be a point in that questionable jest materialism curse of we age who can seriously speak about the broad diffusion of happiness in a country where contentment be measure accord to how many kind of sauce we can taste my people be by far not the most material we be not much give to the cupidity of become rich we know the word enough the simplicity of we manners make we easily contented in we material relation we like rather to be free than to be rich we look for a honorable profit that we may have upon what to live but we do not like to live for the sake of profit augmentation of property and of wealth with we be not the aim of we life -- we prefer tranquil independent mediocrity to the incessant excitement and incessant toil of cupidity and gain such be the character of my nation and yet i have know a countryman of mine who blow out he brain because he have no mean more to eat daily _ patés de foi gras _ and drink champagne well that be no hungarian character but though somewhat eccentrically he characterize the lead feature of we century indeed be you richest money-king happier than fabricius be when he prefer he seven acre of land work by he own hand to the treasure of a empire be the lady of to-day adorn with all the gorgeous splendor of wealth of jewel and of art happier than those lady of ancient rome have be to whom it be forbid to wear silk and jewelry or drive in a carriage through the street of rome be the lady of to-day happier in they splendid parlor than the portia and the cornelia have be in the homely retirement of they modest nursery nay all that boundless thirst of wealth which be the ruling spirit of we age and the move power of enterprising energy all this hunting after treasure and all its happiest result have they make man nobler better and happier have they improve they soul or even they body and they health at least so much that the richest of man could eat and digest two dinner instead of one or have the insatiable thirst of material gain originate a purer patriotism have it make mankind more devoted to they country more ready to sacrifice for public interest if that be the case then i would gladly confess the error of my doubt and take the pretended larger amount of happiness for a guarantee of the future of the commonwealth but lady and gentleman a single word -- the manner in which we use it distort its original meaning often characterize a whole century you all know the word _ idiot _ almost every living language have adopt it and all language attach to it the idea that a idiot be a poor ignorant useless wretch nearly insane well idiot be a word of greek extraction and mean with the greek a man who care nothing for the public interest but be all devote to the selfish pursuit of private profit whatever might have be its result to the community oh what a immense what a deplorable change must have occur in the character of humanity till unconsciously we come to the point that by what name the ancient greek would have style those european money-king who for a miserable profit administer to the unrelenting despot they eternal loan to oppress nation with we now apply that very name to the wretched creature incapable to do any thing for themselves we bear compassion for the idiot of to-day but the modern edition of greek idiotism though load with the bloody scar of a hundred thousand orphan and with the curse of million stand high in honor and go on proudly glory in they criminal idiotism heap up the gold of the world but i may be answer after all though we age be not so virtuous and though the large accumulation in wealth have in reality not make mankind happier still it can not be deny you be in a prosperous condition and prosperity be a solid basis of you country 's future industry navigation commerce have so much develop they have form so many tie by which every citizen be link to he country 's fate that you own material interest be a security to you country 's future in loving you own self you love you country and in loving you country you love you own self this community of public and private interest will make you avoid the stumbling-block over which other fall prosperity be of course a great benefit it be one of the aim of human society but when prosperity become too material it do not always guarantee the future paradoxical as it may appear too much prosperity be often dangerous and some national misfortune be now and then a good preservative of prosperity for great prosperity make nation careless of they future see no immediate danger they believe no danger possible and then when a danger come either by sudden chance or by the slow accumulation of noxious element then frighten by the idea that in meet the danger they private property might be injure or lose selfishness often prevail over patriotism and man become ready to submit to arrogant pretension and compromise with exigency at the price of principle and republic flatter despot and freeman covet the friendship and indulgence of tyrant only that thing may go on just as they go though million weep and nation groan but still thing should go on just as they go because every change may claim a sacrifice or affect we thrive private interest such be often the effect of too great of too secure prosperity therefore prosperity alone afford yet no security you remember the tale of polycrate he be the happiest of man good luck attend every one of he step success crown all he undertake and a friend thus speak to he : thou art too happy for thy happiness to last appease the anger of the eumenide by a voluntary sacrifice or deprive thyself of what thou most valuest among all that thou possessest polycrate obey and draw from he finger a precious jewel of immense value dear to he heart and throw it into the sea soon after a fish be bring to he house and he cook find the precious ring in the belly of the fish but the friend who advise he hasten to flee from the house and shake the dust of its threshold from he shoe because he fear a great mischief must fall upon that too prosperous house there be a deep meaning in that tale of polycrate machiavel say that it be now and then necessary to recall the constitute essential principle to the memory of nation and who be charge by providence with this task misfortune it be the battle of cannaê and of thrasymene which recall the roman to the love of they fatherland nation have till now about such thing no other teacher than misfortune they should choose to have a less afflict one they can have it to point this out will be the final object of my remark but so much be certain that prosperity alone be yet no security for the future even of the happiest commonwealth those ancient nation have be also prosperous they be industrious as you nation be they land have be cover with city and village well-cultivated field bless with the richest crop and crowd with countless herd spread over immense territory furrow with artificial road they flourishing city swarm with artist and merchant and workman and pilot and sailor like as new york do they busy labourer build gigantic water-works dig endless canal and carry distant water through the sand of the desert they mighty energetic spirit build large and secure harbor dry the marshy lake cover the sea with vessel the land with live being and spread a creation of life and movement along the earth they commerce be broad as the known world tyre exchange its purple for the silk of serica cashmere 's soft shawl to-day yet a luxury of the wealthiest the diamond of golconda the gorgeous carpet of lydium the gold of ophir and saba the aromatic spice and jewel of ceylon and the pearl and perfume of arabium the myrrh silver gold dust and ivory of africa as well as the amber of the baltic and the tin of thulé appear alike in they commerce raise they in turn to the dominion of the world and undoing they by too careless prosperity the manner and the shape of one or the other art of one or other industry have change the steam-engine have replace the rowing-bench and cannon replace the catapult but as a whole even you country which you be proud to hear style the living wonder of the world -- yes even you country in the new world and england in the old -- england that gigantic workshop of industry surround with a beautiful evergreen garden yes all the dominion of the anglo-saxon race can claim no higher praise of its prosperity than when we say that you have reproduce the grandeur of those ancient nation and nearly equal they prosperity and what have become of they a sad skeleton what remains of they riches of they splendor and of they vast dominion a obscure recollection a vain memory thus fall empire thus vanish nation which have no better guardian than they prosperity but we have will you say we have a better guardian -- we freedom we republican institution we confederation unite so many glorious star into one mighty galaxy -- these be the rampart of we present these we future security well it would ill become I to investigate if there be nothing rotten in the state of denmark and certainly i be not the man who could feel inclined to undervalue the divine power of liberty to underrate the value of you democratic institution and the vitality of you glorious union it be to they i look in the solitary hour of meditation and when overwhelm with the care of the patriot my soul be groan under nameless woe it be you freedom 's sunny light which dispel the gloomy darkness of despondency here be the source whence the inspiration of hope be flow to the mourning world that down-tread million at the bottom of they desolation still retain a melancholy smile upon they lip and still retain a voice in they bleeding chest to thank the almighty god that the golden thread of freedom be not yet lose on earth yes lady and gentleman all this i feel and all this i know reflect upon you freedom you institution and you union but cast back my look into the mirror of the past there i see upon moulder ground write with warn letter the dreadful truth that all this have nothing new all this have be and all this have never yet be prove sufficient security freedom be the fairest gift of heaven but it be not the security of itself democracy be the embodiment of freedom which in itself be but a principle but what be the security of democracy and if you answer the union be then i ask and where be the security of the union yes lady and gentleman freedom be no new word it be as old as the world despotism be new but freedom not and yet it have never yet prove a charter to the security of nation republic be no new word it be as old as the word society before rome itself republic absorb the world there be in all europe africa and asia minor but republic to be find and many among they democratic man have to wander to far persia if they would have desire to know what sort of thing a monarch be and all they have perish the small one by foreign power the large one by domestic vice and union and confederacy the association of society -- a confederate republic of republic be also no new invention greece have know it and flourish by it for a while rome have know it by such association she attack the world the world have know they with they it defend itself against rome the so-called barbarian of europe beyond the danube and the rhine have know it it be by a confederacy of union that they resist the ambitious mistress of the world you own country america have know it the traditionary history of the roman of the west of those six indian nation bear the record of it out of a older time than you ancestor settle in this land the wise man of the onondaga nation have exercise it long before you country 's legislator build upon that basis you independent home and still it prove in itself alone no security to all those nation who have know it before you you own father have see the last of the mohawk bury he bloody tomahawk in the namesake flood and have listen to the majestic word of logan speak with the dignity of a aemilius that there exist no living be on earth in the vein of whom one drop of the blood of he race do flow well have history nothing else to teach we than that all what the wisdom of man do conceive and all that he energy have execute through the innumerable day of the past and all that we take to be glorious in nation and happy to man can not so much do as to ensure a future even to such a flourishing commonwealth as yours then weaker heart may well ask what good be it to warn we of a fatality which we can not escape what good be it to hold up the mournful monument of a national mortality to sadden we heart if all that be human must share that common doom let we do as we can and so far as we can and let the future bring what it may but that would be the speech of one have no faith in the all-watching eye and regard the eternal law of the universe not as a emanation of a bountiful providence but of a blind fatality which play at hazard with the destiny of man i never will share such blasphemy misfortune come over I and come over my house and come over my guiltless nation still i never have lose my trust in the father of all i have live the day when the people of my oppressed country go along weep over the immense misfortune that they can not pray see the downfall of the most just cause and the outrageous triumph of the most criminal of all crime on earth and they go along not able to pray and weep that they be not able to pray i shudder at the terrible tiding in the desolation of my exile but i could pray and send the consolation home that i do not despair that i believe in god and trust to he bountiful providence and ask they who of they dare despair when i do not i be in exile as i be now but arrogant despot be debate about my blood my infant child in prison my wife the faithful companion of my sorrow and my care hunt like a noble deer and my sister in the tyrant 's fang red with the blood of my nation and the heart of my aged mother break about the shatter fortune of she house and all of they at last homeless wanderer cast to the wind like the yellow leaf of a fall tree and my fatherland my dear beloved fatherland half murder half in chain and humanity nearly all oppressed and those who be not yet oppressed look with compassion at we sad fate but take it for wise policy not to help and the sky of freedom dark on we horizon and darken fast over all and nowhere a ray of hope a lustre of consolation nowhere and still i do not despair and my faith to god my trust to providence have spread over my down-trodden land i therefore who do not despair of my own country 's future though it be overwhelm with misfortune i certainly have a unwavering faith in the destiny of humanity and though the mournful example of so many fall nation instruct we that neither the diffusion of knowledge nor the progress of industry neither prosperity nor power nay not even freedom itself can secure a future to nation still i say there be one thing which can secure it there be one law the obedience to which would prove a rock upon which the freedom and happiness of nation may rest sure to the end of they day and that law lady and gentleman be the law proclaim by we savior that rock be the unperverted religion of christ but while the consolation of this sublime truth fall meekly upon my soul like as the moonlight fall upon the smooth sea i humbly claim you forbearance lady and gentleman i claim it in the name of the almighty lord to hear from my lip a mournful truth it may displease you it may offend but still truth be truth offended vanity may blame I power may frown at I and pride may call my boldness arrogant but still truth be truth and i bold in my unpretending humility will proclaim that truth i will proclaim it from land to land and from sea to sea i will proclaim it with the faith of the martyr of old till the seed of my word fall upon the conscience of man let come what come may i say with luther : god help I i can not otherwise yes lady and gentleman the law of we savior the religion of christ can secure a happy future to nation but alas there be yet no christian people on earth -- not a single one among all i have speak the word it be harsh but true nearly two thousand year have pass since christ have proclaim the eternal decree of god to which the happiness of mankind be bind and have sanctify it with he own blood and still there be not one single nation on earth which would have enact into its law-book that eternal decree man believe in the mystery of religion accord to the creed of they church they go to church and they pray and give alms to the poor and drop the balm of consolation into the wound of the afflict and believe they do all that the lord command to do and believe they be christian no some few may be but they nation be not -- they country be not the era of christianity have yet to come and when it come then only then will be the future of nation sure far be it from I to misapprehend the immense benefit which christian religion such as it already be have operate in mankind 's history it have influence the private character of man and the social condition of million it be the nurse of a new civilization and soften the manners and moral of man its influence have be feel even in the worst quarter of history -- in war the continual massacre of the greek and roman king and chief and the extermination of nation by they -- the all-devastating warfare of the timur and gengi khan -- be in general not more to be meet with only my own dear fatherland be doom to experience once more the cruelty of the timur and gengi khan out of the sacrilegious hand of the dynasty of austrium which calumniate christianity by call itself christian but though that beneficial influence of christianity we have cheerfully to acknowledge yet it be still not to be dispute that the law of christ do yet nowhere rule the christian world montesquieu himself whom nobody could charge to be partial for republic avow that despotism be incompatible with the christian religion because the christian religion command meekness and despotism claim arbitrary power to the whim and passion of a frail mortal and still it be more than 1500 year since the christian religion become dominant and through that long period despotism have be pre-eminently dominant you can scarcely show one single truly democratic republic of any power which have subsist but for a hundred year exercise any influence upon the condition of the world constantine raise the christian religion to rome 's imperial throne do not restore the roman to they primitive virtue constantinople become the sewer of vice christian worship do not change the despotic habit of king the titus the trajan the antonine appear seldom on christian throne on the contrary mankind have see in the name of religion light the pile of persecution and the blaze torch of intolerance the earth overspread with corpse of the million victim of fanaticism the field water with blood the city wrap in flame and empire ravage with unrelenting rage why be it christian religion which cause these deplorable fact brand the brow of partly degrade partly outraged humanity no it be precisely the contrary the fact that the religion of christ never yet be practically take for a all-overruling law the obedience to which outweigh every other consideration would have direct the policy of nation -- that fact be the source of evil whence the oppression of million have overflow the earth and which make the future of the proudest of the freest nation to be like a house build upon sand every religion have two part one be the dogmatical the part of worship the other be the moral part the first the dogmatic part belong to those mysterious region which the arm of human understanding can not reach because they belong to the dominion of belief and that begin where the dominion of knowledge end -- that part of religion therefore the dogmatic one should be leave to every man to settle between god and he own conscience it be a sacred field whereon worldly power never should dare to trespass because there it have no power to enforce its will force can murder it can make liar and hypocrite but no violence on earth can force a man to believe what he do not believe yet the other part of religion the moral part be quite different that teach duty toward ourselves and toward we fellow-men it can be therefore not indifferent to the human family : it can be not indifferent to whatever community if those duty be fulfil or not and no nation can with full right claim the title of a christian nation no government the title of a christian government which be not found upon the basis of christian morality and which take it not for a all-overruling law to fulfil the moral duty order by the religion of christ toward man and nation who be but the community of man and toward mankind which be the community of nation now look to those dread page of history stain with the blood of million spill under the blasphemous pretext of religion be it the intent to vindicate the rights and enforce the duty of christian morality which raise the hand of nation against nation of government against government no : it be the fanaticism of creed and the fury of dogmatism nation and government rise to propagate they manner to worship god and they own mode to believe the inscrutable mystery of eternity but nobody have yet raise a finger to punish the sacrilegious violation of the moral law of christ nobody ever stir to claim the fulfilment of the duty of christian morality toward nation there be much speak about the separation of church and state and yet on close examination we shall see that there be and there be scarcely one single government entirely free from the direct or indirect influence of one or other religious denomination scarcely one which would not at least bear a predilection if not countenance with favor one or another creed -- but creed and always creed the mystery of dogmatism and the manner of worship enter into these consideration they enter even into the politics and turn the scale of hatred and affection but certainly there be not one single nation not one single government the policy of which would ever have be regulate by that law of morality which we savior have promulgate as the eternal law of god which shall be obey in all the relation of man to man but you say of the direct or indirect amalgamation of church and state prove to be dangerous to nation in christian and for christian time because it affect the individual rights of man and among they the dearest of all the liberty of conscience and the freedom of think well of this danger at least the future of you country be free because here at least in this you happy land religious liberty exist you institution leave no power to you government to interfere with the religion of you citizen here every man be free to worship god as he choose to do and that be true and it be a great glory of you country that it be true it be a fact which entitle to the hope that you nation will revive the law of christ even on earth however the guarantee which you constitution afford to religious liberty be but a negative part of a christian government there be besides that positive duty to be fulfil he who do no violence to the conscience of man have but the negative merit of a man do no wrong but as he who do not murder do not steal and do not covet what he neighbor 's be but by not steal not murder not covet what we neighbor 's be we do yet no positive good a man who do not murder have not yet occasion to the title of virtuous man and here be precisely the infinite merit of the christian religion while mose in the name of the almighty god order but negative degree toward fellow-men the christian religion command positive virtue its divine injunction be not perform by not do wrong it desire we to do good the doctrine of jesus christ be sublime in its majestic simplicity thou shalt love god above all and love thy neighbor as thou lovest thyself this sublime doctrine be the religion of love it be the religion of charity though i speak with the tongue of angel and have not charity i be become as sound brass and tinkle cymbal though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mystery and all knowledge and have all faith so that i could remove mountain and have not charity i be nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and give my body to be burn and have not charity it profiteth I nothing thus speak the lord and thus speak he give the law do unto other as thou desirest other to do unto thee now in the name of he who give this law to humanity to build up the eternal bliss and temporal happiness of mankind in the name of that eternal legislator i ask be in that _ charity _ in that fundamental law of christianity any limit of distinction draw in man in he personal and man in he national capacity be it but a law for a man where he be alone and can do but little good be it no law more where two be together and can do more good no law more when million be together be i in my personal adversity be my aged mother in she helpless desolation be my homeless sister whom you feed to-day that they may work to-morrow be we you neighbor unto whom you do as you would other in a similar position do unto yourself and be every one of my down-trodden people a neighbor to every one of you but all my people collectively be it _ not _ a neighbor to you and be my nation not a neighbor to you nation be my down-trodden land not a neighbor to you down-trodden land oh my god man speak of the christian religion and style themselves christian and yet make a distinction between virtue in private life and virtue in public life as if the divine law of charity would have be give only for certain small relation and not for all the relation between man and man there he be again with he eternal complaint about he country 's wrong may perhaps somebody remark : this be a assembly of charity assemble to ease he private woe of family and there he be again speak of he country 's wrong and allude to we foreign policy about which he know we view to be divide thus i may be charge my private family woe but all my woe and all the woe of my family be concentrate in the unwarrantable oppression of my fatherland you be a assembly of charity it be true and the almighty may requite you for it but be a charitable assembly can you blame I that the filial and fraternal devotion of my heart in take with gratitude the balm of consolation which you charity pour into the bleeding wound of my family look around to heal those wound the torturing pain of which you ease but which can not be cure but by justice and charity do to my fatherland shall this sad heart of mine be contented by leave to my homeless mother and sister the means to have they bread by honest labor they daily bread salt with the bitter tear of exile and shall i not care to leave they the hope that they misfortune will have a end that they will see again they beloved home that they will see it independent and free and live where they father live and sleep the tranquil sleep of death in that soil with which the ash of they father mingle shall i not care to give the consolation to my aged mother that when she soon depart soul crown with the garland of martyrdom look down from the home of the bless the unite joy of the heaven will thrill through she immortal spirit see she dear dear hungary free you view be divide on the subject it may be but can you view be divide upon the subject that it be the command of god to love you neighbor as you love yourselve that it be the duty of christian that it be the fundamental principle of the christian religion to do unto other as you desire other to do unto you and if there be if there can be no difference of opinion in regard to the principle if no one in this vast assembly -- whatever be the platform of he party -- ever would disclaim this principle will any one blame I that in the name of christ i be bold to claim the application of that principle i should not speak of politics well i have speak of christianity you politics either agree with the law of christ or they do not agree with it if they do not agree then you politics be not christian and if they agree then i cause no division among you and i shall not speak of my people 's wrong oh my people -- thou heart of my heart thou life of my life -- to thee be bent the thought of my mind and they will remain bent to thee though all the world may frown to thee be pledge all the affection of my heart and they will be pledge to thee as long as one drop of blood throb within this heart thine be the care of my waking hour thine be the dream of my restless sleep shall i forget thee but for a moment never never curse be the moment and curse be i in that moment in which thou wouldst be forget by I thou art oppress o my fatherland because the principle of christianity have not be execute in practice because

command it also to government it be in they law toward they own citizen it be in they policy toward other nation that government and nation can fulfil those duty of christianity and what they can that

powerful nation like yours raise christian morality into its public conduct that nation will have a future against which the very gate of hell itself will never prevail the morality of its policy will react upon the morality of its individual and preserve it from domestic vice which without that prop ever yet have attend too much prosperity and ever yet be follow by a dreadful fall the morality of

lord have choose to realize the religion the tenet of which the most beloved disciple of the savior have record from he divine lip who be the man to reform not christian creed but christian morality man no that be no task for a man but for a nation man may teach a doctrine but that doctrine of charity be teach and teach with such sublime simplicity that no sectarist yet have dispute its truth historian have be quarrel about mystery and lose empire through they dispute the greek be controversially dispute whether the holy ghost proceeds from the father alone or from the father and son and mahomet batter the wall of byzantium they hear it not he wrest the cross from santa sophia they see it not till the cimeter of the turk stop the rage of quarrel with the blow of death in other quarter they go on dispute and decide with mutual anathema the question of transfiguration and many other mystery which be mystery constitute the private dominion of belief but the doctrine of charity none of they dispute there they all agree nay in the idle time of scholastical subtility they have be quarrel about the most extravagant fancy of a scorched imagination mighty folio have be write about the problem how many angel could dance upon the top of a needle without touch each other the folly of subtility go so far as to profane the sacred name of god by dispute if he be omnipotent have the power to sin if in the holy wafer he be present dress or undress if the savior would have choose the incarnation in the shape of a gourd instead of a man how would he have preach how act miracle and how have be crucify and when they go to the theme of investigate if it be a whip or a lash with which the angel have whip st jerome for try to imitate in he writings the pagan cicero it be but after century that abbot cartaut dare to write that if st jerome be whip at all he be whip for have _ badly _ imitate cicero still the doctrine of christian charity be so sublime in its simplicity that not even the subtility of scholasticism dare ever to profane it by any controversy and still that sublime doctrine be not execute and the religion of charity not realize yet the task of this glorious progress be only to be do by a free and powerful nation because it be a task of action and not of teaching individual man can but execute it in the narrow compass of the small relation of private life

minister of justice in hungary in answer to _ count casimir bathyanyus so early as the commencement of the serbian insurrection the popular suspicion gain ground that the insurrection have be stir up by the secret intrigue of the court and confidence in the truth and good faith of the king disappear accordingly the nation however still indulge the hope that a weak king though betray into ambiguous proceeding would not permit himself to be carry away into a flagrant breach of the constitution this be the time when the king in the opinion of the people be keep distinct from the camarillum but when the austrian ministry openly attempt to deprive hungary of its ministry of war and finance when the base game of the degradation and restoration of jellachich be play and when the hungarian army fighting in the name of the king against the insurrection of the serbian and croat become aware that the ball of that same king thin they rank from the hostile camp the nation arrive at the universal conviction that the hapsburg dynasty be only pursue they old absolute tendency and that they want to force hungary into self-defence in order under the pretext of rebellion to deprive it of all its constitutional rights and guarantee it need no proof that a loud indignation and even hatred of the dynasty spread far and wide in the country in consequence of these intrigue and proceedings in spite of this natural excitement and of the war itself carry on by the nation with a increase enthusiasm of hatred of the house of austrium no party in the country urge a declaration of _ déchéance _ or forfeiture against the dynasty even all the faithless act record in the letter of count casimir bathyanyus and the cruelty commit in the name of that court in lower hungary and transylvanium do not turn the scale in this direction the pragmatic sanction be still consider as good in law and the many precedent of we history when the nation and its king go to war with each other and ultimately settle they dispute by solemn pact confirm the constitution of the land convey the notion that a reconciliation be even then not impossible without these precedent and reminiscence of history and only guide by the universal feeling of the country against the dynasty the hungarian parliament would have pronounce the forfeiture of the house of austrium so far back as October 1848 when jellachich be appoint absolute plenipotentiary of the king in hungary with discretionary power of life and death or in December 1848 when in olmütz the succession of the hungarian throne be change and determine without the concurrence of the nation through the diet to force the nation and its parliament to the last step in this momentous crisis the court itself break the dynastic tie this be do by the imposition of the constitution of the 4th of march 1849 by which the house of austrium itself annihilate the pragmatic sanction treat free and independent hungary with the arrogance of a conqueror the nation more irritated by this act than by any precede event see that the hour be come beyond which further to defer the dethronement of the dynasty would be alike incompatible with the law and the honor of hungary _ all the channel of public opinion the public press the popular meeting and even the head quarter of the army resound with emphatic declaration of the impossibility of reconciliation with the dynasty the garrison of komorn _ -- the most important fortress of the country -- _ petition the government for the declaration of forfeiture _ most assuredly no party maneuver be want in this universal excitement cause by the constitution of the 4th of march to carry a parliamentary resolution of forfeiture when the proposition of forfeiture be make on the 14th of April 1849 in the house of representative only eight member vote against it in a house never attend by less than from 220 to 240 member the house of magnate adopt this resolution without opposition the press of all shades of opinion though enjoy the most unlimited freedom also declare for the resolution of the diet it be moreover receive throughout the whole country with patriotic assent and determination if there be a party oppose to the forfeiture how come it that it do not hold it to be a duty to declare its opposition in the diet or through the press when the intelligence of the unfortunate battle of temeswar reach the governor kossuth who be then in the fortress of arad he immediately summon a council of the ministry to deliberate on measure of public safety still possible at this council in which all the minister take part it be resolve to invest görgei who stand alone at the head of a unconquered army with full power for negotiate a peace it be moreover resolve to dissolve the government which could not be carry on in any fixed place of safety under the exist circumstance we do not however insert in the instrument invest görgei with full power -lrb- and despatch to he immediately -rrb- the abdication of the government on the same day -- it be the 11th of August 1849 -- görgei declare in the presence of some of the minister who have assemble at csányi 's -lrb- who be one of they -rrb- that he could not accept the commission because the resignation of the government be not contain in it while he be sure that the enemy would enter into no negotiation with he so long as kossuth and he ministry be think to be behind he the minister who be present after a short deliberation consider it to be they duty not to stand in the way of the negotiation which have be resolve on as necessary accordingly send they resignation to the governor _ whom they request to resign as well _ the governor soon after send he abdication for countersignature by these member of the ministry and accordingly the government formally dissolve itself after have do so _ de facto _ in the previous council of minister i must mention the circumstance that _ in the governor 's instrument of abdication condition be proscribe to görgei which be not insert in the original instrument of authorization issue by the full council _ these condition be the preservation of the nationality and the autonomy of hungary four minister take part in this resignation of the governor as above state aulich csányi horvath and i two of the minister szemere and -lrb- casimir -rrb- bathyanyus be absent when the formal declaration of the abdication be discuss at csányi 's residence i have not mention among the minister we late colleague the finance minister dushek because he treachery which be afterwards bring to light exclude he from we rank from all these circumstance it will be manifest how unjust the reproach of count casimir bathyanyus be that no new cabinet council be hold it be notorious that görgei abuse the full power with which he be entrust instead of procure the preservation of hungary by a negotiation for peace by a ignominious treachery to he native country from that very moment the power confer on he by the above-mentioned instrument and the conditional abdication of the government consequently and legally revert to he who have invest he with it to deny this would be to recognize in the foreign rule which crush hungary in consequence of that treachery legitimate right and lawful power i however perfectly agree with the noble count that the nation once more restore to its constitutional existence and free from foreign yoke will have the unlimited right to dispose of all the affair of the country and consequently of the executive power to assert a contrary opinion would be a crime against the nation not over a liberated nation -lrb- which of course would have the right to choose whom it will -rrb- but over a nation crush by a usurp power the claim of kossuth as elect governor of hungary be i submit lawful republican principle have not be proclaim at kossuth 's dictation as the aim of we national exertion they be during we struggle the well-ascertained and deep-rooted sentiment of the country and kossuth could only faithfully represent the proclaimed will and feeling of the nation by inscribe they on he banner immediately after the declaration of independence all the manifestation of the national will be unanimous in the desire for a republic the ministry which be nominate by the governor as a consequence of that legislative act declare in both house of the diet that its effort would be direct to the establishment of a republic both house join in this declaration and in the government no opposition whatever be manifest against it one of the first act of the new government be to remove the crown from all national scutcheon and from the great seal of hungary the press in all its shades develop republican principle the new semi-official paper bear the name of _ the republic _ it be true that the government be only provisional for the war continue and the definite decision of this question depend on unforeseen circumstance we should have prefer almost any settlement to the necessity of a subjection to the austrian dynasty and at the price of emancipation from that detest power the nation would even have be prepare for the sake of aid to choose a king from another race but certainly if it have be the unaided victor in the struggle never monarchical government would have be for we the resort of expediency the government of we wish and principle be the republic i do not feel at all convince as the noble count assert that the institution and habit of hungary be incompatible with a democratic republic i find on the contrary trait in they which lead I to a opposite conclusion the aggregate character of the numerous nobility which resign its privilege in the diet of 1847-48 of its own accord and which be in its nature more a democratic than a aristocratic body because neither territorial wealth nor rank interfere with or disturb the equality of its rights -- the national antipathy to the system of a upper house which be consider as a foreign institution because it have be introduce under the austrian dynasty -- the immemorial custom of periodically elect all official and even the judge -- the detestation in which bureaucracy and all the instrument of centralization be hold in all age while the attachment to the municipal self-government be ineradicable -- the fact that in consequence of the law which have be sanction in April 1848 the county authority formerly only elect from the nobility be democratically reconstitute and exercise they function in this form till the catastrophe of világos without the slightest collision between the different class of society -- the peaceful election of the representative of the last diet conduct almost on the principle of universal suffrage -- all these fact unmistakeably prove that the germ of democracy lay in we institution and that these could receive a democratic development without any concussion those characteristic _ trait _ of we nation which have be so often misrepresent as sign of a aversion to a republic and which may be more properly call civic virtue as for example we respect for law we antipathy to untried political theory we attachment to traditional custom and we pride in the history of we country be no obstacle to but rather guarantee and even condition of a republic which be to be national and endure it would indeed be a unprecedented event in history if staunch royalism could be the characteristic of a country which like hungary have find in its king for three hundred year the inexorable foe of its liberty and which in that time for its defense have to wage six bloody war against the dynasty as to the criticism by the noble count of the personal character of kossuth i take leave to assert that a great majority of the hungarian nation do not share he opinion it be not my task to appear as a personal advocate and i wish therefore to advert only to one point of he attack which may seem to be base on fact the noble count assert that kossuth have attain to power _ by doubtful means _ i be amaze at this assertion know as i do that kossuth be propose by count loui bathyanyus and nominate by the king with the universal applause of the nation to the ministry of finance after the resignation of the first hungarian ministry he be freely and unanimously elect by the diet to the presidency of the committee of defense and after the declare forfeiture of the dynasty to the governorship of the country i know no more honorable means by which a man can be raise to power s vukovic late minister of justice of hungary _ london January 17 1852 _ \* \* \* \* \* appendix ii -- _ extract from a letter to the ` time ' dated December 9th 1851 by _ bartholomew szemere _ late minister of the interior in hungary in answer to _ prince esterhazy i shall now proceed to give a succinct account of what take place from April 14 when the new act receive the royal sanction to December 1848 you may be assure that i shall conceal nothing that tend to change the relation between hungary and austria the prime minister be already nominate when jellachich be raise to the dignity of ban of croatium by a royal decree which the premier be not even ask to countersign the hungarian minister nevertheless for the sake of peace overlook this irregular proceeding by a decree date June 10 1848 the king make know to all whom it might concern that all the troops station within the kingdom of hungary whether hungarian or austrian be place under the order of the hungarian minister of war and that all the hungarian fortress be under the jurisdiction of the say minister yet at this very time officer of the imperial and royal army be take a active part in the rebellion of the serb and valach while general mayerhofer be enlist recruit in the principality of servium and send they to assist the rebel the people thus behold with astonishment civil war break out and see with still greater astonishment that imperial officer be fight on both side jellachich as a functionary of the hungarian crown refuse to obey the hungarian ministry and illegally summon a croatian diet to meet at agram on June 5 in consequence of these proceedings ferdinand v by a decree date June 10 1848 deprive he as a rebel of all he civil and military office and dignity but at the same time send he through he minister of war lator field officer artillery and ammunition the trouble increase daily the hungarian ministry request the archduke john to act we mediator he accept the office but do nothing the diet meet on July 2 the palatine as the representative of the sovereign in the speech from the throne say that as several district be in a state of open rebellion the principal object to which in the name of he majesty he should direct the attention of the diet be the finances and the defence of the country and that bill relate to these object would be bring in by the minister he then proceed as follow : -- he majesty have learn with painful feeling that although he only follow the dictate of he own gracious inclination when at the request of the faithful hungarian people he give he sovereign sanction to the law enact by the last diet -- law which the common weal accord to the exigency of the present age render imperatively necessary -- there be nevertheless a number of seditious agitator especially in the annexed territory and the hungarian district of the lower danube who by false report and terrorism have excite the different religious sect and race speak different language against each other and by mendaciously affirm that the above-mentioned law be not the free expression of he majesty 's royal will have stir up the people to offer a armed opposition to the execution of the law and to the legally constitute authority and moreover that some of these agitator have even proceed so far in they iniquitous course as to spread the report that this armed opposition have be make in the interest of the dynasty and with the knowledge and connivance of he majesty or of the member of he majesty 's royal house i therefore in order that all the inhabitant of the kingdom without distinction as to creed or language may have they mind set at rest hereby declare in conformity with the sovereign behest of he majesty we most gracious king and in he sovereign name and person that it be he majesty 's firm and steadfast determination to defend with all he royal power and authority the unity and integrity of he royal hungarian crown against every attack from without and every attempt at disruption and separation that may be make within the kingdom and at the same time inviolably to maintain the law which have receive the royal sanction and while he majesty will not suffer any one to curtail the liberty assure to all class by the law he majesty as well as all the member of he royal dynasty strongly condemn the audacity of those who venture to affirm that any illegal act whatsoever or any disrespect of the constitute authority can be reconcileable with he majesty 's sovereign will or at all compatible with the interest of the royal dynasty it thus clearly appear that the king acknowledge the validity and the inviolability of the act pass by the diet of 1847-8 three month after they have be sanction rely on the sincerity of the royal asseveration the diet humbly request that he majesty would be graciously pleased to render the country happy by he presence it be in fact the general wish that the king should come to hungary even the most radical journal loudly declare that if he come he would be receive with enthusiasm border on madness meanwhile the rebellion of the croat serb and valach be spread daily and that too _ in the name of the sovereign _ general colonel and other field officer of the imperial army be at the head of it without any one of they be summon by the king to answer for he conduct the eye of the too credulous native be now open and still more when the king refuse to sanction the act for the levying of troops and raise of fund for the suppression of the rebellion although the diet have be convene chiefly for this purpose i must here observe that at this period nothing whatever have occur that could serve as a pretext for the dynasty to support the rebellion the diet it be true would not consent that the troops that be to be levy should be draught into the old regiment but it be obviously impossible for the diet to consent to any such measure at a period when the rebel be everywhere lead by imperial officer when the austrian troops station in hungary although they have be place under the order of the hungarian ministry refuse to fight against those rebel and the commander of fortress to receive order from the hungarian war-office on the 8th of September a deputation from the hungarian diet earnestly entreat he majesty to sanction two act relate to the levying of troops and tax the king refuse but in he answer to the address of the deputation say i trust that no one will hereby suppose that i have the intention to set aside or infringe the exist law this i repeat be far from my intention on the contrary it be my firm and determine will to maintain in conformity with my coronation oath the law the integrity and the rights of the kingdom under my hungarian crown the king make this solemn declaration on the 8th of September and on the 9th of September jellachich cross the drave with 48000 man to wage war in the king 's name on the hungarian diet and ministry the king have moreover on _ the 4th of September _ affix he sign manual to a letter or royal mandate address to jellachich and revoke the decree by which he have be deprive of he civil and military office and dignity he majesty in this letter also express he high approbation of the ban 's conduct by a royal decree date October 3 the constitution be suspend martial law proclaim and jellachich the rebel appoint he majesty 's plenipotentiary commissary for the kingdom of hungary and invest with unlimited authority to act in the name of he majesty within the say kingdom hungary so far from commence the revolution be not even prepare to meet the invasion of the croatian ban he be defeat near stuhlweissenburg by the landsturm the hungarian government only begin to organize regular troops in October that the diet do not recognize a decree that suspend the constitution and invest jellachich with the dictatorship will be find quite natural if not by you at least by every englishman who cherish constitutional freedom the more so as its proceedings on this occasion be found on legal right viz on act 4 sect 6 of 1847-8 which expressly ordain that the annual session of the diet shall not be close nor the diet itself dissolve before the budget for the ensue year have be vote from this short but faithful account of what actually occur it clearly appear that the hungarian nation have not recourse to arm until the ban of croatium enter the hungarian territory with a austrian-croatian army it be also a undeniable fact that until the promulgation of the austrian charter in march 1849 -- by which with a stroke of the pen the independence of hungary be destroy its constitution abolish and its territory dismember -- the hungarian nation never demand anything else than the maintenance of the law and institution which its sovereign have sanction and swear to maintain inviolate it be however precisely for the purpose of destroy these law and institution that the dynasty begin the war this of course they do not venture to avow it be necessary to conceal the real motive of they perfidious conduct from the civilized world hence in they public proclamation they always allege some pretext or other -- all of they equally groundless at the commencement they say that it be only a insignificant faction they have to deal with but when they see that the whole nation be array in arm against they they declare it be for the suppression of demagogueism propagate by foreigner chiefly pole that they army have enter hungary and to give a color to this pretext they industriously spread the report that there be 20000 pole in the rank of the hungarian when however it become notorious that no more than 1000 pole be fight under we national standard the austrian dynasty appear as the _ soi-disant _ champion and judge of the various nationality or race this answer well enough until the system of centralization show too clearly that a attempt would be make to germanize these nationality when the dynasty again veer about and leave nationality in the lurch take up the peasantry we consequently find the austrian government assure the washington cabinet -lrb- in the note of July 4 1851 -rrb- that they have wage war on hungary in order to crush a turbulent aristocracy that preach democracy with they tongue while they whole life consist in the daily exercise over they fellow-man of arbitrary power in the most repugnant form this last pretext so ostentatiously put forth lose however even its plausibility when contrast with the policy of the dynasty in 1848 for it be a undoubted fact that although the reform effect in we _ political _ institution at that period be consent to by the dynasty without much hesitation it require the most energetic remonstrance on the part of the diet to obtain the royal sanction to the act for the liberation of the peasant from feudal bondage it be precisely to the fact of all class without distinction be equally aware of the cabal of the dynasty that may be ascribe the success of the hungarian insurrection it be not _ one _ man nor a party nor a conspiracy nor terrorism that awaken that spontaneous enthusiasm with which the people rush to arm kossuth may have be the rally cry but he be not the cause of the war for several month the people have witness the equivocal conduct of the dynasty have see that its word be belie by its deed have see that the rebel be everywhere lead by imperial officer and finally behold jellachich a high functionary of the hungarian crown invade the country at the head of a austro-croatian army it be then and not till then that the nation cry as with one voice -- _ the king be a traitor _ from that day begin the hungarian revolution on that day the monarchical feeling be extinguish what no one have think it possible to accomplish be accomplish by the dynasty itself \* \* \* \* \* appendix iii -- _ extract from a letter to the ` daily news ' in February 1852 by a _ hungarian exile _ in reply to a letter from _ szemere _ to the ` london examiner _ ' -lrb- i be personally acquaint with the accomplished and intelligent exile but as he be absent from england i can not obtain permission to publish he name -rrb- it be more than two month after the civil war have be rage in the banat and transylvanium that the question of give fresh troops for the suppression of the italian war be bring before the assembly at pesth July 22 1846 now what be the accusation m szemere bring forth against kossuth in reference to the italian question the pith of m szemere 's reasoning be that the ministry agree in the protocol of July 5 upon construe the pragmatic sanction as bind hungary to protect the integrity of austrium yet that kossuth as the organ of the ministry speak in a way as if he do not approve of the policy and seek to make the public believe that the protocol be merely a moral demonstration : further that when the opposition deny the obligation of hungary to defend austria the ministry refuse to enter into any discussion on a acknowledged principle of constitutional law in order to show the utter hollowness of this attack it may be sufficient to look at the date and circumstance m szemere talk of the protocol in question be agree upon on July 5th the day when the parliament meet to provide for the defense of the country the member inexperienced in foreign politics and ignorant of the cabal of court although presume that the civil war be kindle in vienna be at first blind by the royal convocation of the diet to provide for the safety of the country put moreover implicit confidence in the sagacity and goodwill of the ministry when however kossuth open the debate on the italian question July 22 affair look quite different from what they appear to be when the protocol be draw up the treachery of the dynasty break upon the mind of the most careless and its connexion with the leader of the rebellious tribe have become undeniable fact it be during that short time from July 5 to July 22 that we national force meet in the serbian entrenchment of st thoma földvar and turium regular austrian soldier : meyerhofe the austrian consul at belgrade be openly recruit band of servian to reinforce the insurgent nay it become even evident that general bechtold appoint by he majesty to lead the faithful hungarian against the rebellious serb lead they on in order to get they the sooner decimate and break some member of the opposition head by general perczel declaim loudly against the cowardly and fallacious policy of the ministry resolve to compel minister to resign or to induce they to take some more efficacious measure in short during this space of time the government and people find themselves in quite a new position kossuth in concert with the ministry move a levy of 200000 man -lrb- July 11 -rrb- which motion the assembly hail with unparalleled enthusiasm and which the people witness with approval as afford a guarantee of they liberty it be in the midst of these moment of excitement and temporary distress that kossuth as the most popular member of the cabinet be point out as the person most fit to undertake the very difficult task of speak on the italian question allude to by m szemere public opinion aid by the opposition of the house be convince that austrium after have subjugate the lombard-venetian with hungarian troops would then turn to hungary the enslavement of which might more easily be execute by the country 's be bereft of a number of stout arm indispensable to she own defense kossuth therefore as a man of true liberal principle while acknowledge the ground to be right upon which the opposition move profess in the speech allude to that he have agree then with he colleague in respect to the italian question on the ground that the moral power of the protocol would suffice although as a private individual he could not help rejoice at the victory of the italian people now i submit it to every enlighten englishman to decide whether kossuth evince a want of civic virtue in declare that as a man who wish freedom for himself he could not rejoice in the send of troops to subjugate another people struggle against the same tyrant refer to the policy of the ministry m szemere say that count loui bathyanyus declare on the 31st march that the obligation enjoin by the pragmatic sanction be such that hungary be bind thereby to defend the territorial integrity of the austrian monarchy but that they -lrb- the minister -rrb- would carefully avoid interfere in the internal affair of the state that constitute this monarchy irrespective of this -- that count bathyanyus explain the policy in march when hungary enjoy perfect peace whereas the debate on the italian question happen in the midst of most threatening civil war carry on directly by austrium -- it must be remember that if by the 1st article of the pragmatic sanction hungary be bind to afford aid to austria _ etiam contra vim externam _ that same article provide that the state compose the realm of hungary be to be preserve by the monarch _ aeque indivisibiliter _ as he hereditary estate and that by the 3d article of that celebrated law the sovereign promise for himself and he successor to compel he subject of every state and degree to observe the law and rights of hungary it be therefore evident that the infraction of this law by the countenance

revolution happen by he instrumentality he mere appearance as for instance in debreczin January 1849 when the second danger seem to overwhelm the country rouse the frightened people of the thesis who crowd under the national standard and shatter to piece the austrian force the fall of hungary can only be trace to the follow three circumstance : -- 1st that it be not believe that european diplomacy would allow russian intervention 2d that we plan of warfare direct by the council of war and not by kossuth want that concentration which could alone have ensure success 3d that the character of görgei whom we general never accuse of treacherous design be a mystery : nay the patriotic general perczel who proclaim loudly görgei 's treachery from the very begin have the satisfaction to be laugh
