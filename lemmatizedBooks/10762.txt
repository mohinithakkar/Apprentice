to myself of the character i meet with : can i give any true account of my own i be a bachelor without domestic distraction of any sort and have all my life be a attentive companion to myself flattering my nature agreeably on plausible occasion revile it rather bitterly when it mortify I and in general remember its doings and suffering with a tenacity which be too apt to raise surprise if not disgust at the careless inaccuracy of my acquaintance who impute to I opinion i never hold express they desire to convert I to my favorite idea forget whether i have ever be to the east and be capable of be three several time astonish at my never have tell they before of my accident in the alp cause I the nervous shock which have ever since notably diminish my digestive power surely i ought to know myself better than these indifferent outsider can know I nay better even than my intimate friend to whom i have never breathe those item of my inward experience which have chiefly shape my life yet i have often be force into the reflection that even the acquaintance who be as forgetful of my biography and tenet as they would be if i be a dead philosopher be probably aware of certain point in I which may not be include in my most active suspicion we sing a exquisite passage out of tune and innocently repeat it for the greater pleasure of we hearer who can be aware of what he foreign accent be in the ear of a native and how can a man be conscious of that dull perception which cause he to mistake altogether what will make he agreeable to a particular woman and to persevere eagerly in a behavior which she be privately record against he i have have some confidence from my female friend as to they opinion of other man whom i have observe try to make themselves amiable and it have occur to I that though i can hardly be so blunder as lippus and the rest of those mistaken candidate for favor whom i have see ruin they chance by a too elaborate personal canvass i must still come under the common fatality of mankind and share the liability to be absurd without know that i be absurd it be in the nature of foolish reasoning to seem good to the foolish reasoner hence with all possible study of myself with all possible effort to escape from the pitiable illusion which make man laugh shriek or curl the lip at folly 's likeness in total unconsciousness that it resemble themselves i be oblige to recognize that while there be secret in I unguessed by other these other have certain item of knowledge about the extent of my power and the figure i make with they which in turn be secret unguessed by I when i be a lad i dance a hornpipe with arduous scrupulosity and while suffer pang of pallid shyness be yet proud of my superiority as a dancing pupil imagine for myself a high place in the estimation of beholder but i can now picture the amusement they have in the incongruity of my solemn face and ridiculous leg what sort of hornpipe be i dancing now thus if i laugh at you o fellow-man if i trace with curious interest you labyrinthine self-delusion note the inconsistency in you zealous adhesion and smile at you helpless endeavor in a rashly choose part it be not that i feel myself aloof from you : the more intimately i seem to discern you weakness the stronger to I be the proof that i share they how otherwise could i get the discernment -- for even what we be averse to what we vow not to entertain must have shape or shadow itself within we as a possibility before we can think of exorcise it no man can know he brother simply as a spectator dear blunderer i be one of you i wince at the fact but i be not ignorant of it that i too be laughable on unsuspected occasion nay in the very tempest and whirlwind of my anger i include myself under my own indignation if the human race have a bad reputation i perceive that i can not escape be compromise and thus while i carry in myself the key to other man 's experience it be only by observe other that i can so far correct my self-ignorance as to arrive at the certainty that i be liable to commit myself unawares and to manifest some incompetency which i know no more of than the blind man know of he image in the glass be it then possible to describe oneself at once faithfully and fully in all autobiography there be nay ought to be a incompleteness which may have the effect of falsity we be each of we bind to reticence by the piety we owe to those who have be nearest to we and have have a mingled influence over we life by the fellow-feeling which should restrain we from turn we volunteer and pick confession into a act of accusation against other who have no chance of vindicate themselves and most of all by that reverence for the higher effort of we common nature which command we to bury its lowest fatality its invincible remnant of the brute its most agonising struggle with temptation in unbroken silence but the incompleteness which come of self-ignorance may be compensate by self-betrayal a man who be affect to tear in dwelling on the generosity of he own sentiment make I aware of several thing not include under those term who have sin more against those three duteous reticence than jean jacque yet half we impression of he character come not from what he mean to convey but from what he unconsciously enable we to discern this _ naïve _ veracity of self-presentation be attainable by the slenderest talent on the most trivial occasion the least lucid and impressive of orator may be perfectly successful in show we the weak point of he grammar hence i too may be so far like jean jacque as to communicate more than i be aware of i be not indeed write a autobiography or pretend to give a unreserved description of myself but only offer some slight confession in a apologetic light to indicate that if in my absence you deal as freely with my unconscious weakness as i have deal with the unconscious weakness of other i should not feel myself warrant by common-sense in regard you freedom of observation as a exceptional case of evil-speaking or as malignant interpretation of a character which really offer no handle to just objection or even as a unfair use for you amusement of disadvantage which since they be mine should be regard with more than ordinary tenderness let I at least try to feel myself in the rank with my fellow-men it be true that i would rather not hear either you well-founded ridicule or you judicious stricture though not averse to find fault with myself and conscious of deserving lash i like to keep the scourge in my own discriminate hand i never feel myself sufficiently meritorious to like be hate as a proof of my superiority or so thirsty for improvement as to desire that all my acquaintance should give I they candid opinion of I i really do not want to learn from my enemy : i prefer have none to learn from instead of be glad when man use I despitefully i wish they would behave better and find a more amiable occupation for they interval of business in brief after a close intimacy with myself for a longer period than i choose to mention i find within I a permanent longing for approbation sympathy and love yet i be a bachelor and the person i love best have never love I or know that i love she though continually in society and care about the joy and sorrow of my neighbor i feel myself so far as my personal lot be concerned uncared for and alone you own fault my dear fellow say minutius felix one day that i have incautiously mention this uninteresting fact and he be right -- in sens other than he intend why should i expect to be admire and have my company doat on i have do no service to my country beyond those of every peaceable orderly citizen and as to intellectual contribution my only publish work be a failure so that i be speak of to inquire beholder as the author of a book you have probably not see -lrb- the work be a humorous romance unique in its kind and i be tell be much taste in a cherokee translation where the joke be render with all the serious eloquence characteristic of the red race -rrb- this sort of distinction as a writer nobody be likely to have read can hardly counteract a indistinctness in my articulation which the best-intentioned loudness will not remedy then in some quarter my awkward foot be against I the length of my upper lip and a inveterate way i have of walk with my head foremost and my chin project one can become only too well aware of such thing by look in the glass or in that other mirror hold up to nature in the frank opinion of street-boy or of we free people travel by excursion train and no doubt they account for the half-suppressed smile which i have observe on some fair face when i have first be present before they this direct perceptive judgment be not to be argue against but i be tempt to remonstrate when the physical point i have mention be apparently take to warrant unfavourable inference concern my mental quickness with all the increase uncertainty which modern progress have throw over the relation of mind and body it seem tolerably clear that wit can not be seat in the upper lip and that the balance of the haunch in walking have nothing to do with the subtle discrimination of idea yet stranger evidently do not expect I to make a clever observation and my good thing be as unnoticed as if they be anonymous picture i have indeed have the mixed satisfaction of find that when they be appropriate by some one else they be find remarkable and even brilliant it be to be bear in mind that i be not rich have neither stud nor cellar and no very high connection such as give to a look of imbecility a certain prestige of inheritance through a title line just as the austrian lip confer a grandeur of historical association on a kind of feature which might make we reject a advertising footman i have now and then do harm to a good cause by speak for it in public and have discover too late that my attitude on the occasion would more suitably have be that of negative beneficence be it really to the advantage of a opinion that i should be know to hold it and as to the force of my argument that be a secondary consideration with audience who have give a new scope to the _ ex pede herculem _ principle and from awkward foot infer awkward fallacy once when zeal lift I on my leg i distinctly hear a enlighten artisan remark here be a rum cut -- and doubtless he reason in the same way as the elegant glycera when she politely put on a air of listen to I but elevate she eyebrow and chill she glance in sign of predetermined neutrality : both have they reason for judge the quality of my speech beforehand this sort of reception to a man of affectionate disposition who have also the innocent vanity of desire to be agreeable have naturally a depress if not embitter tendency and in early life i begin to seek for some consoling point of view some warrantable method of soften the hard pea i have to walk on some comfortable fanaticism which might supply the need self-satisfaction at one time i dwelt much on the idea of compensation try to believe that i be all the wiser for my bruised vanity that i have the higher place in the true spiritual scale and even that a day might come when some visible triumph would place I in the french heaven of have the laugher on my side but i presently perceive that this be a very odious sort of self-cajolery be it in the least true that i be wiser than several of my friend who make a excellent figure and be perhaps praise a little beyond they merit be the ugly unready man in the corner outside the current of conversation really likely to have a fairer view of thing than the agreeable talker whose success strike the unsuccessful as a repulsive example of forwardness and conceit and as to compensation in future year would the fact that i myself get it reconcile I to a order of thing in which i could see a multitude with as bad a share as mine who instead of get they corresponding compensation be get beyond the reach of it in old age what could be more contemptible than the mood of mind which make a man measure the justice of divine or human law by the agreeableness of he own shadow and the ample satisfaction of he own desire i drop a form of consolation which seem to be encouraging I in the persuasion that my discontent be the chief evil in the world and my benefit the soul of good in that evil may there not be at least a partial release from the imprison verdict that a man 's philosophy be the formulum of he personality in certain branch of science we can ascertain we personal equation the measure of difference between we own judgment and a average standard : may there not be some corresponding correction of we personal partiality in moral theorise if a squint or other ocular defect disturb my vision i can get instruct in the fact be make aware that my condition be abnormal and either through spectacles or diligent imagination i can learn the average appearance of thing : be there no remedy or corrective for that inward squint which consist in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of mental balance in my conscience i see that the bias of personal discontent be just as misleading and odious as the bias of self-satisfaction whether we look through the rose-coloured glass or the indigo we be equally far from the hue which the healthy human eye behold in heaven above and earth below i begin to dread way of consoling which be really a flattering of native illusion a feeding-up into monstrosity of a inward growth already disproportionate to get a especial scorn for that scorn of mankind which be a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claim to watch with peculiar alarm lest what i call my philosophic estimate of the human lot in general should be a mere prose lyric express my own pain and consequent bad temper the standing-ground worth strive after seem to be some delectable mountain whence i could see thing in proportion as little as possible determine by that self-partiality which certainly play a necessary part in we bodily sustenance but have a starving effect on the mind thus i finally give up any attempt to make out that i prefer cut a bad figure and that i like to be despise because in this way i be get more virtuous than my successful rival and i have long look with suspicion on all view which be recommend as peculiarly consolatory to wound vanity or other personal disappointment the consolation of egoism be simply a change of attitude or a resort to a new kind of diet which soothe and fatten it feed in this way it be apt to become a monstrous spiritual pride or a chuckle satisfaction that the final balance will not be against we but against those who now eclipse we examine the world in order to find consolation be very much like look carefully over the page of a great book in order to find we own name if not in the text at least in a laudatory note : whether we find what we want or not we preoccupation have hinder we from a true knowledge of the contents but a attention fix on the main theme or various matter of the book would deliver we from that slavish subjection to we own self-importance and i have the mighty volume of the world before I nay i have the struggle action of a myriad life around I each single life as dear to itself as mine to I be there no escape here from this stupidity of a murmur self-occupation clearly enough if anything hinder my think from rise to the force of passionately interested contemplation or my poor pent-up pond of sensitiveness from widen into a beneficent river of sympathy it be my own dulness and though i could not make myself the reverse of shallow all at once i have at least learn where i have better turn my attention something come of this alteration in my point of view though i admit that the result be of no striking kind it be unnecessary for I to utter modest denial since none have assure I that i have a vast intellectual scope or -- what be more surprising consider i have do so little -- that i might if i choose surpass any distinguished man whom they wish to depreciate i have not attain any lofty peak of magnanimity nor would i trust beforehand in my capability of meet a severe demand for moral heroism but that i have at least succeed in establish a habit of mind which keep watch against my self-partiality and promote a fair consideration of what touch the feeling or the fortune of my neighbor seem to be prove by the ready confidence with which man and woman appeal to my interest in they experience it be gratify to one who would above all thing avoid the insanity of fancy himself a more momentous or touching object than he really be to find that nobody expect from he the least sign of such mental aberration and that he be evidently hold capable of listen to all kind of personal outpouring without the least disposition to become communicative in the same way this confirmation of the hope that my bearing be not that of the self-flattering lunatic be give I in ample measure my acquaintance tell I unreservedly of they triumph and they pique explain they purpose at length and reassure I with cheerfulness as to they chance of success insist on they theory and accept I as a dummy with whom they rehearse they side of future discussion unwind they coiled-up grief in relation to they husband or recite to I example of feminine incomprehensibleness as typify in they wife mention frequently the fair applause which they merit have wring from some person and the attack to which certain oblique motive have stimulate other at the time when i be less free from superstition about my own power of charming i occasionally in the glow of sympathy which embrace I and my confide friend on the subject of he satisfaction or resentment be urge to hint at a corresponding experience in my own case but the sign of a rapidly lower pulse and spread nervous depression in my previously vivacious interlocutor warn I that i be act on that dangerous misread do as you be do by recall the true version of the golden rule i could not wish that other should lower my spirit as i be lower my friend 's after several time obtain the same result from a like experiment in which all the circumstance be vary except my own personality i take it as a established inference that these fitful sign of a linger belief in my own importance be generally feel to be abnormal and be something short of that sanity which i aim to secure clearness on this point be not without its gratification as i have say while my desire to explain myself in private ear have be quell the habit of get interested in the experience of other have be continually gather strength and i be really at the point of find that this world would be worth living in without any lot of one 's own be it not possible for I to enjoy the scenery of the earth without say to myself i have a cabbage-garden in it but this sound like the lunacy of fancy oneself everybody else and be unable to play one 's own part decently -- another form of the disloyal attempt to be independent of the common lot and to live without a sharing of pain perhaps i have make self-betrayal enough already to show that i have not arrive at that non-human independence my conversational reticence about myself turn into garrulousness on paper -- as the sea-lion plunge and swim the more energetically because he limb be of a sort to make he shamble on land the act of write in spite of past experience bring with it the vague delightful illusion of a audience nearer to my idiom than the cherokee and more numerous than the visionary one for whom many author have declare themselves willing to go through the please punishment of publication my illusion be of a more liberal kind and i imagine a far-off hazy multitudinous assemblage as in a picture of paradise make a approve chorus to the sentence and paragraph of which i myself particularly enjoy the write the haze be a necessary condition if any physiognomy become distinct in the foreground it be fatal the countenance be sure to be one bent on discountenance my innocent intention : it be pale-eyed incapable of be amuse when i be amuse or indignant at what make I indignant it stare at my presumption pity my ignorance or be manifestly prepare to expose the various instance in which i unconsciously disgrace myself i shudder at this too corporeal auditor and turn towards another point of the compass where the haze be unbroken why should i not indulge this remain illusion since i do not take my approve choral paradise as a warrant for set the press to work again and make some thousand sheet of superior paper unsaleable i leave my manuscript to a judgment outside my imagination but i will not ask to hear it or request my friend to pronounce before i have be bury decently what he really think of my part and to state candidly whether my papers would be most usefully apply in light the cheerful domestic fire it be too probable that he will be exasperate at the trouble i have give he of read they but the consequent clearness and vivacity with which he could demonstrate to I that the fault of my manuscript as of my one publish work be simply flatness and not that surpass subtilty which be the preferable ground of popular neglect -- this verdict however instructively express be a portion of earthly discipline of which i will not beseech my friend to be the instrument other person i be aware have not the same cowardly shrinking from a candid opinion of they performance and be even importunately eager for it but i have convince myself in numerous case that such exposer of they own back to the smiter be of too hopeful a disposition to believe in the scourge and really trust in a pleasant anoint a outpouring of balm without any previous wound i be of a less trusting disposition and will only ask my friend to use he judgment in insure I against posthumous mistake thus i make myself a charter to write and keep the please inspiring illusion of be listen to though i may sometimes write about myself what i have already say on this too familiar theme have be mean only as a preface to show that in note the weakness of my acquaintance i be conscious of my fellowship with they that a gratified sense of superiority be at the root of barbarous laughter may be at least half the truth but there be a loving laughter in which the only recognize superiority be that of the ideal self the god within hold the mirror and the scourge for we own pettiness as well as we neighbor ' ii look backward most of we who have have decent parent would shrink from wish that we father and mother have be somebody else whom we never know yet it be hold no impiety rather a graceful mark of instruction for a man to wail that he be not the son of another age and another nation of which also he know nothing except through the easy process of a imperfect imagination and a flattering fancy but the period thus look back on with a purely admiring regret as perfect enough to suit a superior mind be always a long way off the desirable contemporary be hardly nearer than leonardo da vincus most likely they be the fellow-citizen of pericle or best of all of the aeolic lyrist whose sparse remains suggest a comfortable contrast with we redundance no impassioned personage wish he have be bear in the age of pitt that he ardent youth might have eat the dearest bread dress itself with the longest coat-tail and the shortest waist or hear the loudest grumbling at the heaviest war-tax and it would be really something original in polished verse if one of we young writer declare he would gladly be turn eighty-five that he might have know the joy and pride of be a englishman when there be fewer reform and plenty of highwayman fewer discovery and more face pit with the small-pox when law be make to keep up the price of corn and the troublesome irish be more miserable three-quarter of a century ago be not a distance that lend much enchantment to the view we be familiar with the average man of that period and be still consciously encumber with its bad contrivance and mistaken act the lord and gentleman paint by young lawrence talk and write they nonsense in a tongue we thoroughly understand hence they time be not much flattered not much glorified by the yearning of that modern sect of flagellant who make a ritual of lash -- not themselves but -- all they neighbor to I however that paternal time the time of my father 's youth never seem prosaic for it come to my imagination first through he memory which make a wondrous perspective to my little daily world of discovery and for my part i can call no age absolutely unpoetic : how should it be so since there be always child to whom the acorn and the swallow 's egg be a wonder always those human passion and fatality through which garrick as hamlet in bob-wig and knee-breeches move he audience more than some have since do in velvet tunic and plume but every age since the golden may be make more or less prosaic by mind that attend only to its vulgar and sordid element of which there be always a abundance even in greece and italy the favorite realm of the retrospective optimist to be quite fair towards the age a little ugliness as well as beauty must be allow to each of they a little implicit poetry even to those which echo loudest with servile pompous and trivial prose such impartiality be not in vogue at present if we acknowledge we obligation to the ancient it be hardly to be do without some flout of we contemporary who with all they fault must be allow the merit of keep the world habitable for the refine eulogist of the blameless past one wonder whether the remarkable originator who first have the notion of digging well or of churn for butter and who be certainly very useful to they own time as well as ours be leave quite free from invidious comparison with predecessor who let the water and the milk alone or whether some rhetorical nomad as he stretch himself on the grass with a good appetite for contemporary butter become loud on the virtue of ancestor who be uncorrupt by the produce of the cow nay whether in a high flight of imaginative self-sacrifice -lrb- after swallow the butter -rrb- he even wish himself earlier bear and already eat for the sustenance of a generation more _ naïve _ than he own i have often have the fool 's hectic of wish about the unalterable but with I that useless exercise have turn chiefly on the conception of a different self and not as it usually do in literature on the advantage of have be bear in a different age and more especially in one where life be imagine to have be altogether majestic and graceful with my present ability external proportion and generally small provision for ecstatic enjoyment where be the ground for confidence that i should have have a preferable career in such a epoch of society a age in which every department have its awkward-squad seem in my mind 's eye to suit I better i might have wander by the strymon under philip and alexander without throw any new light on method or organise the sum of human knowledge on the other hand i might have object to aristotle as too much of a systematiser and have prefer the freedom of a little self-contradiction as offer more chance of truth i gather too from the undeniable testimony of he disciple theophrastus that there be bore ill-bred person and detractor even in athen of species remarkably correspond to the english and not yet make endurable by be classic and altogether with my present fastidious nostril i feel that i be the better off for possess athenian life solely as a inodorous fragment of antiquity as to sappho 's mitylene while i be convince that the lesbian capital hold some plain man of middle stature and slow conversational power the addition of myself to they number though clothe in the majestic fold of the himation and without cravat would hardly have make a sensation among the accomplished fair one who be so precise in adjust they own drapery about they delicate ankle whereas by be another sort of person in the present age i might have give it some needful theoretic clue or i might have pour forth poetic strain which would have anticipate theory and seem a voice from the prophetic soul of the wide world dream of thing to come or i might have be one of those benignant lovely soul who without astonishing the public and posterity make a happy difference in the life close around they and in this way lift the average of earthly joy : in some form or other i might have be so fill from the store of universal existence that i should have be free from that empty wish which be like a child 's cry to be inside a golden cloud its imagination be too ignorant to figure the lining of dimness and damp on the whole though there be some rash boast about enlightenment and a occasional insistance on a originality which be that of the present year 's corn-crop we seem too much disposed to indulge and to call by complimentary name a greater charity for other portion of the human race than for we contemporary all reverence and gratitude for the worthy dead on whose labor we have enter all care for the future generation whose lot we be prepare but some affection and fairness for those who be do the actual work of the world some attempt to regard they with the same freedom from ill-temper whether on private or public grounds as we may hope will be feel by those who will call we ancient otherwise the look before and after which be we grand human privilege be in danger of turn to a sort of other-worldliness breed a more illogical indifference or bitterness than be ever breed by the ascetic 's contemplation of heaven except on the ground of a primitive golden age and continuous degeneracy i see no rational footing for scorn the whole present population of the globe unless i scorn every previous generation from whom they have inherit they disease of mind and body and by consequence scorn my own scorn which be equally a inheritance of mixed idea and feeling concoct for I in the boiling caldron of this universally contemptible life and so on -- scorn to infinity this may represent some actual state of mind for it be a narrow prejudice of mathematician to suppose that way of think be to be drive out of the field by be reduce to a absurdity the absurd be take as a excellent juicy thistle by many constitution reflection of this sort have gradually determine I not to grumble at the age in which i happen to have be bear -- a natural tendency certainly older than hesiod many ancient beautiful thing be lose many ugly modern thing have arise but invert the proposition and it be equally true i at least be a modern with some interest in advocate tolerance and notwithstanding a inborn beguilement which carry my affection and regret continually into a imagine past i be aware that i must lose all sense of moral proportion unless i keep alive a stronger attachment to what be near and a power of admire what i best know and understand hence this question of wish to be rid of one 's contemporary associate itself with my filial feeling and call up the thought that i might as justifiably wish that i have have other parent than those whose loving tone be my earliest memory and whose last parting first teach I the meaning of death i feel bind to quell such a wish as blasphemy besides there be other reason why i be contented that my father be a country parson bear much about the same time as scott and wordsworth notwithstanding certain qualm i have feel at the fact that the property on which i be living be save out of tithe before the period of commutation and without the provisional transfiguration into a modus it have sometimes occur to I when i have be take a slice of excellent ham that from a too tenable point of view i be breakfast on a small squeal black pig which more than half a century ago be the unwilling representative of spiritual advantage not otherwise acknowledge by the grudging farmer or dairyman who part with he one enter on a fearful labyrinth in trace compound interest backward and such complication of thought have reduce the flavor of the ham but since i have nevertheless eat it the chief effect have be to moderate the severity of my radicalism -lrb- which be not part of my paternal inheritance -rrb- and to raise the assuage reflection that if the pig and the parishioner have be intelligent enough to anticipate my historical point of view they would have see themselves and the rector in a light that would have make tithe voluntary notwithstanding such drawback i be rather fond of the mental furniture i get by have a father who be well acquaint with all rank of he neighbor and be thankful that he be not one of those aristocratic clergyman who could not have sit down to a meal with any family in the parish except my lord 's -- still more that he be not a earl or a marquis a chief misfortune of high birth be that it usually shut a man out from the large sympathetic knowledge of human experience which come from contact with various class on they own level and in my father 's time that entail of social ignorance have not be disturb as we see it now to look always from overhead at the crowd of one 's fellow-men must be in many way incapacitate even with the best will and intelligence the serious blunder it must lead to in the effort to manage they for they good one may see clearly by the mistaken way people take of flattering and entice those whose association be unlike they own hence i have always think that the most fortunate briton be those whose experience have give they a practical share in many aspect of the national lot who have live long among the mixed commonalty rough it with they under difficulty know how they food taste to they and get acquaint with they notion and motive not by inference from traditional type in literature or from philosophical theory but from daily fellowship and observation of course such experience be apt to get antiquated and my father might find himself much at a loss amongst a mixed rural population of the present day but he know very well what could be wisely expect from the miner the weaver the field-labourer and farmer of he own time -- yes and from the aristocracy for he have be bring up in close contact with they and have be companion to a young nobleman who be deaf and dumb a clergyman lad he use to say to I should feel in himself a bit of every class and this theory have a felicitous agreement with he inclination and practice which certainly answer in make he beloved by he parishioner they grumble at they obligation towards he but what then it be natural to grumble at any demand for payment tithe include but also natural for a rector to desire he tithe and look well after the levy a christian pastor who do not mind about he money be not a ideal prevalent among the rural mind of fat central england and might have seem to introduce a dangerous laxity of supposition about christian layman who happen to be creditor my father be none the less beloved because he be understand to be of a saving disposition and how could he save without get he tithe the sight of he be not unwelcome at any door and he be remarkable among the clergy of he district for have no lasting feud with rich or poor in he parish i profit by he popularity and for month after my mother 's death when i be a little fellow of nine i be take care of first at one homestead and then at another a variety which i enjoy much more than my stay at the hall where there be a tutor afterwards for several year i be my father 's constant companion in he outdoor business ride by he side on my little pony and listen to the lengthy dialogue he hold with darby or joan the one on the road or in the field the other outside or inside she door in my earliest remembrance of he he hair be already gray for i be he youngest as well as he only survive child and it seem to I that advanced age be appropriate to a father as indeed in all respects i consider he a parent so much to my honor that the mention of my relationship to he be likely to secure I regard among those to whom i be otherwise a stranger -- my father 's story from he life include so many name of distant person that my imagination place no limit to he acquaintanceship he be a pithy talker and he sermon bear mark of he own composition it be true they must have be already old when i begin to listen to they and they be no more than a year 's supply so that they recur as regularly as the collect but though this system have be much ridicule i be prepare to defend it as equally sound with that of a liturgy and even if my research have show I that some of my father 's yearly sermon have be copy out from the work of elder divine this would only have be another proof of he good judgment one may prefer fresh egg though lay by a fowl of the meanest understanding but why fresh sermon nor can i be sorry though myself give to meditative if not active innovation that my father be a tory who have not exactly a dislike to innovator and dissenter but a slight opinion of they as person of ill-founded self-confidence whence my young ear gather many detail concern those who might perhaps have call themselves the more advanced thinker in we nearest market-town tend to convince I that they character be quite as mixed as those of the thinker behind they this circumstance of my rearing have at least deliver I from certain mistake of classification which i observe in many of my superior who have apparently no affectionate memory of a goodness mingle with what they now regard as outworn prejudice indeed my philosophical notion such as they be continually carry I back to the time when the fitful gleam of a spring day use to show I my own shadow as that of a small boy on a small pony ride by the side of a larger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy upland which we use to dignify with the name of hill or along by-road with broad grassy border and hedgerow reckless of utility on we way to outlying hamlet whose group of inhabitant be as distinctive to my imagination as if they have belong to different region of the globe from these we sometimes ride onward to the adjoining parish where also my father officiate for he be a pluralist but -- i hasten to add -- on the smallest scale for he one extra living be a poor vicarage with hardly fifty parishioner and its church would have make a very shabby barn the gray worm-eaten wood of its pew and pulpit with they door only half hang on the hinge be exactly the color of a lean mouse which i once observe as a interesting member of the scant congregation and conjecture to be the identical church mouse i have hear refer to as a example of extreme poverty for i be a precocious boy and often reason after the fashion of my elder argue that jack and jill be real personage in we parish and that if i could identify jack i should find on he the mark of a broken crown sometimes when i be in a crowded london drawing-room -lrb- for i be a town-bird now acquaint with smoky eaves and tasting nature in the park -rrb- quick flight of memory take I back among my father 's parishioner while i be still conscious of elbow man who wear the same evening uniform as myself and i presently begin to wonder what variety of history lie hide under this monotony of aspect some of they perhaps belong to family with many quartering but how many quartering of diverse contact with they fellow-countryman enter into they qualification to be parliamentary leader professor of social science or journalistic guide of the popular mind not that i feel myself a person make competent by experience on the contrary i argue that since a observation of different rank have still leave I practically a poor creature what must be the condition of those who object even to read about the life of other british class than they own but of my elbow neighbor with they crush hat i usually imagine that the most distinguish among they have probably have a far more instructive journey into manhood than mine here perhaps be a thought-worn physiognomy seem at the present moment to be class as a mere species of white cravat and swallow-tail which may once like faraday 's have show itself in curiously dubious embryonic form lean against a cottage lintel in small corduroy and hungrily eat a bit of brown bread and bacon _ there _ be a pair of eye now too much wearied by the gas-light of public assembly that once perhaps learn to read they native england through the same alphabet as mine -- not within the boundary of a ancestral park never even be drive through the county town five mile off but -- among the midland village and market along by the tree-studded hedgerow and where the heavy barge seem in the distance to float mysteriously among the rush and the feathered grass we vision both real and ideal have since then be fill with far other scene : among eternal snow and stupendous sun-scorched monument of depart empire within the scent of the long orange-grove and where the temple of neptune look out over the siren-haunted sea but my eye at least have keep they early affectionate joy in we native landscape which be one deep root of we national life and language and i often smile at my consciousness that certain conservative prepossession have mingle themselves for I with the influence of we midland scenery from the top of the elm down to the buttercup and the little wayside vetch naturally enough that part of my father 's prime to which he oftenest refer have fall on the day when the great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration of all thing have ebb and the suppose millennial initiative of france be turn into a napoleonic empire the sway of a attilum with a mouth speak proud thing in a jargon half revolutionary half roman man be begin to shrink timidly from the memory of they own word and from the recognition of the fellowship they have form ten year before and even reform englishman for the most part be willing to wait for the perfection of society if only they could keep they throat perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind from we coast to my father 's mind the noisy teacher of revolutionary doctrine be to speak mildly a variable mixture of the fool and the scoundrel the welfare of the nation lay in a strong government which could maintain order and i be accustom to hear he utter the word government in a tone that charge it with awe and make it part of my effective religion in contrast with the word rebel which seem to carry the stamp of evil in its syllable and light by the fact that satan be the first rebel make a argument dispense with more detailed inquiry i gather that we national trouble in the first two decade of this century be not at all due to the mistake of we administrator and that england with its fine church and constitution would have be exceedingly well off if every british subject have be thankful for what be provide and have mind he own business -- if for example numerous catholic of that period have be aware how very modest they ought to be consider they be irish the time i hear have often be bad but i be constantly hearing of bad time as a name for actual evening and morning when the godfather who give they that name appear to I remarkably comfortable altogether my father 's england seem to I lovable laudable full of good man and have good ruler from mr pitt on to the duke of wellington until he be for emancipate the catholic and it be so far from prosaic to I that i look into it for a more exciting romance than such as i could find in my own adventure which consist mainly in fancied crisis call for the resolute wield of domestic sword and firearm against unapparent robber rioter and invader who it seem in my father 's prime have more chance of be real the morris-dancer have not then dwindle to a ragged and almost vanish rout -lrb- owe the traditional name probably to the historic fancy of we superannuated groom -rrb- also the good old king be alive and well which make all the more difference because i have no notion what he be and do -- only understand in general that if he have be still on the throne he would have hinder everything that wise person think undesirable certainly that elder england with its frankly saleable borough so cheap compare with the seat obtain under the reform method and its borough kindly present by nobleman desirous to encourage gratitude its prison with a miscellaneous company of felon and maniac and without any supply of water its bloated idle charity its non-resident jovial clergy its militia-balloting and above all its blank ignorance of what we its posterity should be think of it -- have great difference from the england of to-day yet we discern a strong family likeness be there any country which show at once as much stability and as much susceptibility to change as ours we national life be like that scenery which i early learn to love not subject to great convulsion but easily show more or less delicate -lrb- sometimes melancholy -rrb- effect from minor change hence we midland plain have never lose they familiar expression and conservative spirit for I yet at every other mile since i first look on they some sign of world-wide change some new direction of human labor have work itself into what one may call the speech of the landscape -- in contrast with those grander and vaster region of the earth which keep a indifferent aspect in the presence of man 's toil and device what do it signify that a lilliputian train pass over a viaduct amidst the abyss of the apennine or that a caravan laden with a nation 's offering creep across the unresting sameness of the desert or that a petty cloud of steam sweep for a instant over the face of a egyptian colossus immovably submit to its slow burial beneath the sand but we woodland and pasture we hedge-parted corn-field and meadow we bit of high common where we use to plant the windmill we quiet little river here and there fit to turn a mill-wheel we village along the old coach-road be all easily alterable lineament that seem to make the face of we motherland sympathetic with the laborious life of she child she do not take they plough and waggon contemptuously but rather make every hovel and every sheepfold every rail bridge or fall tree-trunk a agreeably noticeable incident not a mere speck in the midst of unmeasured vastness but a piece of we social history in pictorial write we rural tract -- where no babel-chimney scale the heaven -- be without mighty object to fill the soul with the sense of a outer world unconquerably aloof from we effort the waste be playground -lrb- and let we try to keep they such for the child 's child who will inherit no other sort of demesne -rrb- the grass and reed nod to each other over the river but we have cut a canal close by the very height laugh with corn in August or lift the plough-team against the sky in September then come a crowd of burly navvy with pickax and barrow and while hardly a wrinkle be make in the fading mother 's face or a new curve of health in the bloom girl 's the hill be cut through or the breach between they span we choose we level and the white steam-pennon fly along it but because we land show this readiness to be change all sign of permanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe : some of we at least love the scanty relic of we forest and be thankful if a bush be leave of the old hedgerow a crumble bit of wall where the delicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hang its light branch or a bit of gray thatch with patch of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of grass-stem on its ridge be a thing to visit and then the tiled roof of cottage and homestead of the long cow-shed where generation of the milky mother have stand patiently of the broad-shouldered barn where the old-fashioned flail once make resonant music while the watch-dog bark at the timidly venturesome fowl make pecking raid on the outflying grain -- the roof that have look out from among the elm and walnut-tree or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stack or below the square stone steeple gather they gray or ochre-tinted lichen and they olive-green moss under all ministry -- let we praise the sober harmony they give to we landscape help to unite we pleasantly with the elder generation who till the soil for we before we be bear and pay heavier and heavier tax with much grumbling but without that deepest root of corruption -- the self-indulgent despair which cut down and consume and never plant but i check myself perhaps this england of my affection be half visionary -- a dream in which thing be connect accord to my well-fed lazy mood and not at all by the multitudinous link of graver sadder fact such as belong everywhere to the story of human labor well well the illusion that begin for we when we be less acquaint with evil have not lose they value when we discern they to be illusion they feed the ideal better and in love they still we strengthen the precious habit of loving something not visibly tangibly existent but a spiritual product of we visible tangible self i cherish my childish love -- the memory of that warm little nest where my affection be fledge since then i have learn to care for foreign country for literature foreign and ancient for the life of continental town doze round old cathedral for the life of london half sleepless with eager thought and strife with indigestion or with hunger and now my consciousness be chiefly of the busy anxious metropolitan sort my system respond sensitively to the london weather-sign political social literary and my bachelor 's hearth be imbed where by much crane of head and neck i can catch sight of a sycamore in the square garden : i belong to the nation of london why there have be many voluntary exile in the world and probably in the very first exodus of the patriarchal aryan -- for i be determine not to fetch my example from race whose talk be of uncle and no father -- some of those who sally forth go for the sake of a loved companionship when they would willingly have keep sight of the familiar plain and of the hill to which they have first lift up they eye iii how we encourage research the serene and beneficent goddess truth like other deity whose disposition have be too hastily infer from that of the man who have invoke they can hardly be well please with much of the worship pay to she even in this milder age when the stake and the rack have cease to form part of she ritual some cruelty still pass for service do in she honor : no thumb-screw be use no iron boot no scorching of flesh but plenty of controversial bruising laceration and even lifelong maim less than formerly but so long as this sort of truth-worship have the sanction of a public that can often understand nothing in a controversy except personal sarcasm or slanderous ridicule it be likely to continue the suffering of its victim be often as little regard as those of the sacrificial pig offer in old time with what we now regard as a sad miscalculation of effect one such victim be my old acquaintance merman twenty year ago merman be a young man of promise a conveyancer with a practice which have certainly bud but like aaron 's rod seem not destine to proceed further in that marvellous activity meanwhile he occupy himself in miscellaneous periodical writing and in a multifarious study of moral and physical science what chiefly attract he in all subject be the vex question which have the advantage of not admit the decisive proof or disproof that render many ingenious argument superannuate not that merman have a wrangle disposition : he put all he doubt query and paradox deferentially contend without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the personality of homer express himself civilly though firmly on the origin of language and have tact enough to drop at the right moment such subject as the ultimate reduction of all the so-called elementary substance he own total scepticism concern manetho 's chronology or even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the outbreak of revolutionary tendency such flexibility be naturally much help by he amiable feeling towards woman whose nervous system he be convince would not bear the continuous strain of difficult topic and also by he willingness to contribute a song whenever the same desultory charmer propose music indeed he taste be domestic enough to beguile he into marriage when he resource be still very moderate and partly uncertain he friend wish that so ingenious and agreeable a fellow might have more prosperity than they venture to hope for he they chief regret on he account be that he do not concentrate he talent and leave off form opinion on at least half-a-dozen of the subject over which he scatter he attention especially now that he have marry a nice little woman -lrb- the generic name for acquaintance ' wife when they be not markedly disagreeable -rrb- he could not they observe want all he various knowledge and laputan idea for he periodical writing which bring he most of he bread and he would do well to use he talent in get a speciality that would fit he for a post perhaps these well-disposed person be a little rash in presume that fitness for a post would be the surest ground for get it and on the whole in now look back on they wish for merman they chief satisfaction must be that those wish do not contribute to the actual result for in a evil hour merman do concentrate himself he have for many year take into he interest the comparative history of the ancient civilisation but it have not preoccupy he so as to narrow he generous attention to everything else one sleepless night however -lrb- he wife have more than once narrate to I the detail of a event memorable to she as the beginning of sorrow -rrb- after spend some hour over the epoch-making work of grampus a new idea seize he with regard to the possible connection of certain symbolic monument common to widely scattered race merman start up in bed the night be cold and the sudden withdrawal of warmth make he wife first dream of a snowball and then cry -- what be the matter proteus a great matter julium that fellow grampus whose book be cry up as a revelation be all wrong about the magicodumbra and the zuzumotzi and i have get hold of the right clue good gracious do it matter so much do not drag the clothes dear it signify this julium that if i be right i shall set the world right i shall regenerate history i shall win the mind of europe to a new view of social origin i shall bruise the head of many superstition oh no dear do not go too far into thing lie down again you have be dream what be the madicojumbra and zuzitotzum i never hear you talk of they before what use can it be troubling yourself about such thing that be the way julium -- that be the way wife alienate they husband and make any hearth pleasanter to he than he own what _ do _ you mean proteus why if a woman will not try to understand she husband 's idea or at least to believe that they be of more value than she can understand -- if she be to join anybody who happen to be against he and suppose he be a fool because other contradict he -- there be a end of we happiness that be all i have to say oh no proteus dear i do believe what you say be right that be my only guide i be sure i never have any opinion in any other way : i mean about subject of course there be many little thing that would tease you that you like I to judge of for myself i know i say once that i do not want you to sing ` oh ruddier than the cherry ' because it be not in you voice but i can not remember ever differ from you about _ subject _ i never in my life think any one cleverer than you julia merman be really a nice little woman not one of the stately dian sometimes speak of in those term she black _ silhouette _ have a very infantine aspect but she have discernment and wisdom enough to act on the strong hint of that memorable conversation never again give she husband the slightest ground for suspect that she think treasonably of he idea in relation to the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi or in the least relax she faith in he infallibility because europe be not also convince of it it be well for she that she do not increase she trouble in this way but to do she justice what she be chiefly anxious about be to avoid increase she husband 's trouble not that these be great in the beginning in the first development and write out of he scheme merman have a more intense kind of intellectual pleasure than he have ever know before he face become more radiant he general view of human prospects more cheerful foresee that truth as present by himself would win the recognition of he contemporary he excuse with much liberality they rather rough treatment of other theorist whose basis be less perfect he own periodical criticism have never before be so amiable : he be sorry for that unlucky majority whom the spirit of the age or some other prompt more definite and local compel to write without any particular idea the possession of a original theory which have not yet be assail must certainly sweeten the temper of a man who be not beforehand ill-natured and merman be the reverse of ill-natured but the hour of publication come and to half-a-dozen person describe as the learn world of two hemisphere it become know that grampus be attack this might have be a small matter for who or what on earth that be good for anything be not assail by ignorance stupidity or malice -- and sometimes even by just objection but on examination it appear that the attack might possibly be hold damaging unless the ignorance of the author be well expose and he pretended fact show to be chimera of that remarkably hideous kind beget by imperfect learning on the more feminine element of original incapacity grampus himself do not immediately cut open the volume which merman have be careful to send he not without a very lively and shift conception of the possible effect which the explosive gift might produce on the too eminent scholar -- effect that must certainly have set in on the third day from the despatch of the parcel but in point of fact grampus know nothing of the book until he friend lord narwhal send he a american newspaper contain a spirited article by the well-known professor sperm n whale which be rather equivocal in its bear the passage quote from merman being of rather a tell sort and the paragraph which seem to blow defiance be unaccountably feeble come from so distinguish a cetacean then by another post arrive letter from butzkopf and dugong both man whose signature be familiar to the teutonic world in the _ selten-erscheinende monat-schrift _ or hayrick for the insertion of split hair ask they master whether he mean to take up the combat because in the contrary case both be ready thus america and germany be rouse though england be still drowsy and it seem time now for grampus to find merman 's book under the heap and cut it open for he own part he be perfectly at ease about he system but this be a world in which the truth require defense and specious falsehood must be meet with exposure grampus have once look through the book no longer want any urge to write the most crush of reply this and nothing less than this be due from he to the cause of sound inquiry and the punishment would cost he little pain in three week from that time the palpitating merman see he book announce in the program of the lead review no need for grampus to put he signature who else have he vast yet microscopic knowledge who else he power of epithet this article in which merman be pillory and as good as mutilate -- for he be show to have neither ear nor nose for the subtlety of philological and archaeological study -- be much read and more talk of not because of any interest in the system of grampus or any precise conception of the danger attend lax view of the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi but because the sharp epigram with which the victim be lacerate and the soar fountain of acrid mud which be shoot upward and pour over the fresh wound be find amusing in recital a favorite passage be one in which a certain kind of sciolist be describe as a creature of the walrus kind have a phantasmal resemblance to higher animal when see by ignorant mind in the twilight dabble or hobble in first one element and then the other without part or organ suit to either in fact one of nature 's impostor who could not be say to have any artful pretence since a congenital incompetence to all precision of aim and movement make they every action a pretence -- just as a be bear in doeskin glove would necessarily pass a judgment on surface but we all know what he judgment would be worth in drawing-room circle and for the immediate hour this ingenious comparison be as damaging as the show up of merman 's mistake and the mere smattering of linguistic and historical knowledge which he have presume to be a sufficient basis for theorise but the more learn cite he blunder aside to each other and laugh the laugh of the initiate in fact merman 's be a remarkable case of sudden notoriety in london drum and club he be speak of abundantly as one who have write ridiculously about the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi : the leader of conversation whether christian jew infidel or of any other confession except the confession of ignorance pronounce he shallow and indiscreet if not presumptuous and absurd he be hear of at warsaw and even pari take knowledge of he m cachalot have not read either grampus or merman but he hear of they dispute in time to insert a paragraph upon it in he brilliant work _ l'orient au point de vue actuel _ in which he be dispassionate enough to speak of grampus as possess a _ coup d'oeil presque français _ in matter of historical interpretation and of merman as nevertheless a objector _ quus mérite d'être connu _ m porpesse also avail himself of m cachalot 's knowledge reproduce it in a article with certain addition which it be only fair to distinguish as he own imply that the vigorous english of grampus be not always as correct as a frenchman could desire while merman 's objection be more sophistical than solid presently indeed there appear a able _ extrait _ of grampus 's article in the valuable _ rapporteur scientifique et historique _ and merman 's mistake be thus bring under the notice of certain frenchman who be among the master of those who know on oriental subject in a word merman though not extensively read be extensively read about meanwhile how do he like it perhaps nobody except he wife for a moment reflect on that a amuse society consider that he be severely punish but do not take the trouble to imagine he sensation indeed this would have be a difficulty for person less sensitive and excitable than merman himself perhaps that popular comparison of the walrus have truth enough to bite and blister on thorough application even if exultant ignorance have not applaud it but it be well know that the walrus though not in the least a malignant animal if allow to display its remarkably plain person and blunder performance at ease in any element it choose become desperately savage and muster alarming auxiliary when attack or hurt in this characteristic at least merman resemble the walrus and now he concentrate himself with a vengeance that he counter-theory be fundamentally the right one he have a genuine conviction whatever collateral mistake he might have commit and he bread would not cease to be bitter to he until he have convince he contemporary that grampus have use he minute learn as a dust-cloud to hide sophistical evasion -- that in fact minute learning be a obstacle to clear-sighted judgment more especially with regard to the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi and that the best preparation in this matter be a wide survey of history and a diversified observation of man still merman be resolve to muster all the learning within he reach and he wander day and night through many wilderness of german print he try compendious method of learn oriental tongue and so to speak get at the marrow of language independently of the bone for the chance of find detail to corroborate he own view or possibly even to detect grampus in some oversight or textual tamper all other work be neglect : rare client be send away and amaze editor find this maniac indifferent to he chance of get book-parcel from they it be many month before merman have satisfy himself that he be strong enough to face round upon he adversary but at last he have prepare sixty condensed page of eager argument which seem to he worthy to rank with the best model of controversial write he have acknowledge he mistake but have restate he theory so as to show that it be leave intact in spite of they and he have even find case in which ziphius microp scrag whale the explorer and other cetacean of unanswerable authority be decidedly at issue with grampus especially a passage cite by this last from that greatest of fossil megalosaurus be demonstrate by merman to be capable of three different interpretation all preferable to that choose by grampus who take the word in they most literal sense for 1 ° the incomparable saurian alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing comprehensiveness might have mean those word ironically 2 ° _ motzis _ be probably a false reading for _ potzi _ in which case its bearing be reverse and 3 ° it be know that in the age of the saurian there be conception about the _ motzis _ which entirely remove it from the category of thing comprehensible in a age when saurian run ridiculously small : all which view be godfather by name quite fit to be rank with that of grampus in fine merman wound up he rejoinder by sincerely thank the eminent adversary without whose fierce assault he might not have undertake a revision in the course of which he have meet with unexpected and striking confirmation of he own fundamental view evidently merman 's anger be at white heat the rejoinder be complete all that remain be to find a suitable medium for its publication this be not so easy distinguished medium would not lend themselves to contradiction of grampus or if they would merman 's article be too long and too abstruse while he would not consent to leave anything out of a article which have no superfluity for all this happen year ago when the world be at a different stage at last however he get he rejoinder print and not on hard term since the medium in every sense modest do not ask he to pay for its insertion but if merman expect to call out grampus again he be mistaken everybody feel it too absurd that merman should undertake to correct grampus in matter of erudition and a eminent man have something else to do than to refute a petty objector twice over what be essential have be do : the public have be enable to form a true judgment of merman 's incapacity the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi be but subsidiary element in grampus 's system and merman might now be deal with by younger member of the master 's school but he have at least the satisfaction of find that he have raise a discussion which would not be let die the follower of grampus take it up with a ardor and industry of research worthy of they exemplar butzkopf make it the subject of a elaborate _ einleitung _ to he important work _ die bedeutung des aegyptischen labyrinthe _ and dugong in a remarkable address which he deliver to a learn society in central europe introduce merman 's theory with so much power of sarcasm that it become a theme of more or less derisive allusion to man of many tongue merman with he magicodumbra and zuzumotzi be on the way to become a proverb be use illustratively by many able journalist who take those name of questionable thing to be merman 's own invention than which say one of the graver guide we can recall few more melancholy example of speculative aberration naturally the subject pass into popular literature and figure very commonly in advertised program the fluent loligo the formidable shark and a younger member of he remarkable family know as s catulus make a special reputation by they numerous article eloquent lively or abusive all on the same theme under title ingeniously vary alliterative sonorous or boldly fanciful such as moment with mr merman mr merman and the magicodumbras greenland grampus and proteus merman grampian height and they climber or the new excelsior they toss he on short sentence they swathe he in paragraph of wind imagery they find he at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of unexampled perversity ridiculously wrong about _ potzi _ and ignorant of palus they hint indeed at certain thing which to they knowledge he have silently brood over in he boyhood and seem tolerably well assure that this preposterous attempt to gainsay a incomparable cetacean of world-wide fame have its origin in a peculiar mixture of bitterness and eccentricity which rightly estimate and see in its definite proportion would furnish the best key to he argumentation all alike be sorry for merman 's lack of sound learning but how could they reader be sorry sound learning would not have be amusing and as it be merman be make to furnish these reader with amusement at no expense of trouble on they part even burlesque writer look into he book to see where it could be make use of and those who do not know he be desirous of meet he at dinner as one likely to feed they comic vein on the other hand he make a serious figure in sermon under the name of some or other who have attempt presumptuously to scale eminence too high and arduous for human ability and have give a example of ignominious failure edify to the humble christian all this might be very advantageous for able person whose superfluous fund of expression need a pay investment but the effect on merman himself be unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking of which he have become the occasion he certainty that he be right naturally get stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance be stimulate the scorn and unfairness with which he feel himself to have be treat by those really competent to appreciate he idea have gall he and make a chronic sore and the exultant chorus of the incompetent seem a pour of vinegar on he wound he brain become a registry of the foolish and ignorant objection make against he and of continually amplify answer to these objection unable to get he answer print he have recourse to that more primitive mode of publication oral transmission or button-holding now generally regard as a troublesome survival and the once pleasant flexible merman be on the way to be shun as a bear he interest in new acquaintance turn chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi that they would listen to he complaint and exposure of unfairness and not only accept copy of what he have write on the subject but send he appreciative letter in acknowledgment repeat disappointment of such hope tend to embitter he and not the less because after a while the fashion of mention he die out allusion to he theory be less understand and people could only pretend to remember it and all the while merman be perfectly sure that he very opponent who have knowledge enough to be capable judge be aware that he book whatever error of statement they might detect in it have serve as a sort of divine rod point out hidden source of historical interpretation nay he jealous examination discern in a new work by grampus himself a certain shift of ground which -- so poor merman declare -- be the sign of a intention gradually to appropriate the view of the man he have attempt to brand as a ignorant impostor and julium and the housekeeping -- the rent food and clothing which controversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serve as a recommendation to certain post controversial pamphlet have be know to earn large plum but nothing of the sort could be expect from unpractical heresy about the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi painfully the contrary merman 's reputation as a sober thinker a safe writer a sound lawyer be irretrievably injure : the distraction of controversy have cause he to neglect useful editorial connection and indeed he dwindle care for miscellaneous subject make he contribution too dull to be desirable even if he could now have give a new turn to he concentration and apply he talent so as to be ready to show himself a exceptionally qualify lawyer he would only have be like a architect in competition too late with he superior plan he would not have have a opportunity of show he qualification he be throw out of the course the small capital which have fill up deficiency of income be almost exhaust and julium in the effort to make supplies equal to want have to use much ingenuity in diminish the want the brave and affectionate woman whose small outline so unimpressive against a illuminate background hold within it a good share of feminine heroism do she best to keep up the charm of home and soothe she husband 's excitement parting with the best jewel among she wedding present in order to pay rent without ever hint to she husband that this sad result have come of he undertake to convince people who only laugh at he she be a resigned little creature and reflect that some husband take to drinking and other to forgery : hers have only take to the magicodumbra and zuzumotzi and be not unkind -- only a little more indifferent to she and the two child than she have ever expect he would be he mind be eat up with subject and constantly a little angry not with she but with everybody else especially those who be celebrate this be the sad truth merman feel himself ill-used by the world and think very much worse of the world in consequence the gall of he adversary ' ink have be suck into he system and run in he blood he be still in the prime of life but he mind be age by that eager monotonous construction which come of feverish excitement on a single topic and use up the intellectual strength merman have never be a rich man but he be now conspicuously poor and in need of the friend who have power or interest which he believe they could exert on he behalf they omitting or decline to give this help could not seem to he so clearly as to they a inevitable consequence of he have become impracticable or at least of he pass for a man whose view be not likely to be safe and sober each friend in turn offend he though unwillingly and be suspect of wish to shake he off it be not altogether so but poor merman 's society have undeniably cease to be attractive and it be difficult to help he at last the pressure of want urge he to try for a post far beneath he earlier prospects and he gain it he hold it still for he have no vice and he domestic life have keep up a sweeten current of motive around and within he nevertheless the bitter flavor mingle itself with all topic the premature weariness and withering be irrevocably there it be as if he have go through a disease which alter what we call the constitution he have long cease to talk eagerly of the idea which possess he or to attempt make proselyte the dial have move onward and he himself see many of he former guess in a new light on the other hand he have see what he forebode that the main idea which be at the root of he too rash theorising have be adopt by grampus and receive with general respect no reference be hear to the ridiculous figure this important conception make when usher in by the incompetent other now and then on rare occasion when a sympathetic _ tête-à-tête _ have restore some of he old expansiveness he will tell a companion in a railway carriage or other place of meeting favourable to autobiographical confidence what have be the course of thing in he particular case as a example of the justice to be expect of the world the companion usually allow for the bitterness of a disappointed man and be secretly disincline to believe that grampus be to blame iv a man surprise at he originality among the many acute saying of la rochefoucauld there be hardly one more acute than this : la plus grande ambition n'en a pas la moindre apparence lorsqu'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilité absolue d'arriver où elle aspire some of we might do well to use this hint in we treatment of acquaintance and friend from whom we be expect gratitude because we be so very kind in thinking of they invite they and even listen to what they say -- consider how insignificant they must feel themselves to be we be often fallaciously confident in suppose that we friend 's state of mind be appropriate to we moderate estimate of he importance : almost as if we imagine the humble mollusc -lrb- so useful as a illustration -rrb- to have a sense of he own exceed softness and low place in the scale of be you mollusc on the contrary be inwardly object to every other grade of solid rather than to himself accustom to observe what we think a unwarrantable conceit exhibit itself in ridiculous pretension and forwardness to play the lion 's part in obvious self-complacency and loud peremptoriness we be not on the alert to detect the egoistic claim of a more exorbitant kind often hide under a apparent neutrality or a acquiescence in be put out of the question thought of this kind occur to I yesterday when i see the name of lentulus in the obituary the majority of he acquaintance i imagine have always think of he as a man justly unpretend and as nobody 's rival but some of they have perhaps be strike with surprise at he reserve in praise the work of he contemporary and have now and then feel themselves in need of a key to he remark on man of celebrity in various department he be a man of fair position derive he income from a business in which he do nothing at leisure to frequent club and at ease in give dinner well-looking polite and generally acceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb -- the neutral basis needful for the plum and spice why then do he speak of the modern maro or the modern flaccus with a peculiarity in he tone of assent to other people 's praise which might almost have lead you to suppose that the eminent poet have borrow money of he and show a indisposition to repay he have no criticism to offer no sign of objection more specific than a slight cough a scarcely perceptible pause before assent and a air of self-control in he utterance -- as if certain consideration have determine he not to inform against the so-called poet who to he knowledge be a mere versifier if you have question he closely he would perhaps have confess that he do think something better might be do in the way of eclogue and georgic or of ode and epode and that to he mind poetry be something very different from what have hitherto be know under that name for my own part be of a superstitious nature give readily to imagine alarming cause i immediately on first get these mystic hint from lentulus conclude that he hold a number of entirely original poem or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on poetic in that melancholy manuscript state to which work excel all that be ever print be necessarily condemn and i be long timid in speaking of the poet when he be present for what might not lentulus have do or be profoundly aware of that would make my ignorant impression ridiculous one can not well be sure of the negative in such a case except through certain positive that bear witness to it and those witness be not always to be get hold of but time wear on i perceive that the attitude of lentulus towards the philosopher be essentially the same as he attitude towards the poet nay there be something so much more decide in he mode of close he mouth after brief speech on the former there be such a air of rapt consciousness in he private hint as to he conviction that all think hitherto have be a elaborate mistake and as to he own power of conceive a sound basis for a lasting superstructure that i begin to believe less in the poetical store and to infer that the line of lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of we belief and in systematic construction in this case i do not figure to myself the existence of formidable manuscript ready for the press for great thinker be know to carry they theory grow within they mind long before commit they to paper and the idea which make a new passion for they when they lock be jet or auburn remain perilously unwritten a inwardly develop condition of they successive self until the lock be gray or scanty i only meditate improvingly on the way in which a man of exceptional faculty and even carry within he some of that fierce refiner 's fire which be to purge away the dross of human error may move about in society totally unrecognised regard as a person whose opinion be superfluous and only rise into a power in emergency of threaten black-balling imagine a descarte or a locke be recognize for nothing more than a good fellow and a perfect gentleman -- what a painful view do such a picture suggest of impenetrable dulness in the society around they i would at all time rather be reduce to a cheaper estimate of a particular person if by that mean i can get a more cheerful view of my fellow-men generally and i confess that in a certain curiosity which lead I to cultivate lentulus 's acquaintance my hope lean to the discovery that he be a less remarkable man than he have seem to imply it would have be a grief to discover that he be bitter or malicious but by find he to be neither a mighty poet nor a revolutionary poetical critic nor a epoch-making philosopher my admiration for the poet and thinker whom he rate so low would recover all its buoyancy and i should not be leave to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit which constitute a exception in the history of mankind and recommend itself as the total abolitionist of all previous claim on we confidence you be not greatly surprise at the infirm logic of the coachman who would persuade you to engage he by insist that any other would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn thus demand a difficult belief in he as the sole exception from the frailty of he call but it be rather astonishing that the wholesale decrier of mankind and its performance should be even more unwary in they reasoning than the coachman since each of they not merely confide in you regard himself as a exception but overlook the almost certain fact that you be wonder whether he inwardly except _ you _ now conscious of entertain some common opinion which seem to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of lentulus my self-complacency be a little concerned hence i deliberately attempt to draw out lentulus in private dialogue for it be the reverse of injury to a man to offer he that hearing which he seem to have find nowhere else and for whatever purpose silence may be equal to gold it can not be safely take as a indication of specific idea i seek to know why lentulus be more than indifferent to the poet and what be that new poetry which he have either write or as to its principle distinctly conceive but i presently find that he know very little of any particular poet and have a general notion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal sentiment : he instance the giaour lallum rookh the pleasure of hope and ruin seize thee ruthless king add and plenty more on my observe that he probably prefer a larger simpler style he emphatically assent have you not say i write something of that order no but i often compose as i go along i see how thing might be write as fine as ossian only with true idea the world have no notion what poetry will be it be impossible to disprove this and i be always glad to believe that the poverty of we imagination be no measure of the world 's resource we posterity will no doubt get fuel in way that we be unable to devise for they but what this conversation persuade I of be that the birth with which the mind of lentulus be pregnant could not be poetry though i do not question that he compose as he go along and that the exercise be accompany with a great sense of power this be a frequent experience in dream and much of we wake experience be but a dream in the daylight nay for what i see the composition might be fairly class as ossianic but i be satisfy that lentulus could not disturb my grateful admiration for the poet of all age by eclipse they or by put they under a new electric light of criticism still he have himself throw the chief emphasis of he protest and he consciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of we race and he tone in assure I that everything which have be do in that way be wrong -- that plato robert owen and dr tuffle who write in the ` regulator ' be all equally mistaken -- give my superstitious nature a thrill of anxiety after what have pass about the poet it do not seem likely that lentulus have all system by heart but who could say he have not seize that thread which may somewhere hang out loosely from the web of thing and be the clue of unravelment we need not go far to learn that a prophet be not make by erudition lentulus at least have not the bias of a school and if it turn out that he be in agreement with any celebrated thinker ancient or modern the agreement would have the value of a undesigned coincidence not due to forget read it be therefore with renew curiosity that i engage he on this large subject -- the universal erroneousness of think up to the period when lentulus begin that process and here i find he more copious than on the theme of poetry he admit that he do contemplate write down he thought but he difficulty be they abundance apparently he be like the woodcutter enter the thick forest and say where shall i begin the same obstacle appear in a minor degree to cling about he verbal exposition and account perhaps for he rather helter-skelter choice of remark bear on the number of unaddressed letter send to the post-office on what logic really be as tend to support the buoyancy of human medium and mahogany table on the probability of all miracle under all religion when explain by hidden law and my unreasonableness in suppose that they profuse occurrence at half a guinea a hour in recent time be anything more than a coincidence on the haphazard way in which marriage be determine -- show the baselessness of social and moral scheme and on he expectation that he should offend the scientific world when he tell they what he think of electricity as a agent no man 's appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of lentulus as we walk along the mall while he deliver these observation understand by himself to have a regenerative bearing on human society he wristband and black glove he hat and nicely clip hair he laudable moderation in beard and he evident discrimination in choose he tailor all seem to excuse the prevalent estimate of he as a man untaint with heterodoxy and likely to be so unencumbered with opinion that he would always be useful as a assent and admire listener man of science see he at they lecture doubtless flattered themselves that he come to learn from they the philosophic ornament of we time expound some of they luminous idea in the social circle take the meditative gaze of lentulus for one of surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning towards so novel a conclusion and those who be call man of the world consider he a good fellow who might be ask to vote for a friend of they own and would have no troublesome notion to make he unaccommodating you perceive how very much they be all mistaken except in qualify he as a good fellow this lentulus certainly be in the sense of be free from envy hatred and malice and such freedom be all the more remarkable a indication of native benignity because of he gaseous illimitably expansive conceit yes conceit for that he enormous and contentedly ignorant confidence in he own rambling thought be usually clothe in a decent silence be no reason why it should be less strictly call by the name directly imply a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by performance nay the total privacy in which he enjoy he consciousness of inspiration be the very condition of its undisturbed placid nourishment and gigantic growth you audibly arrogant man expose himself to test : in attempt to make a impression on other he may possibly -lrb- not always -rrb- be make to feel he own lack of definiteness and the demand for definiteness be to all of we a needful check on vague depreciation of what other do and vague ecstatic trust in we own superior ability but lentulus be at once so unreceptive and so little gifted with the power of display he miscellaneous deficiency of information that there be really nothing to hinder he astonishment at the spontaneous crop of idea which he mind secretly yield if it occur to he that there be more meaning than one for the word motive since it sometimes mean the end aim at and sometimes the feeling that prompt the aim and that the word cause be also of changeable import he be naturally strike with the truth of he own perception and be convince that if this vein be well follow out much might be make of it man be evidently in the wrong about cause and effect else why be society in the confused state we behold and as to motive lentulus feel that when he come to write down he view he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show up thereby the anomaly of we social institution meanwhile the various aspect of motive and cause flit about among the motley crowd of idea which he regard as original and pregnant with reformative efficacy for he unaffected goodwill make he regard all he insight as only valuable because it tend towards reform the respectable man have get into he illusory maze of discovery by let go that clue of conformity in he thinking which he have keep fast hold of in he tailor and manners he regard heterodoxy as a power in itself and take he inacquaintance with doctrine for a creative dissidence but he epitaph need not to be a melancholy one he benevolent disposition be more effective for good than he silent presumption for harm he might have be mischievous but for the lack of word : instead of be astonish at he inspiration in private he might have clothe he addled originality disjointed commonplace blind denial and balloon-like conclusion in that mighty sort of language which would have make a new koran for a knot of follower i mean no disrespect to the ancient koran but one would not desire the roc to lay more egg and give we a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make twilight peace be with lentulus for he have leave we in peace bless be the man who have nothing to say abstain from give we wordy evidence of the fact -- from call on we to look through a heap of millet-seed in order to be sure that there be no pearl in it v a too deferential man a little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulge under the stress of social intercourse the talk even of a honest man must often represent merely he wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than he genuine opinion or feeling on the matter in hand he thought if utter might be wound or he have not the ability to utter it with exactness and snatch at a loose paraphrase or he have really no genuine thought on the question and be drive to fill up the vacancy by borrow the remark in vogue these be the wind and current we have all to steer amongst and they be often too strong for we truthfulness or we wit let we not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental frailty or think that we rise superior to it by drop all considerateness and deference but there be studious deliberate form of insincerity which it be fair to be impatient with : hinze 's for example from he name you might suppose he to be german : in fact he family be alsatian but have be settle in england for more than one generation he be the superlatively deferential man and walk about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and discernment of everybody who talk to he he cultivate the low-toned _ tête-à-tête _ keep he hat carefully in he hand and often stroke it while he smile with downcast eye as if to relieve he feeling under the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it be he honor to enjoy at the present moment i confess to some rage on hear he yesterday talk to felicium who be certainly a clever woman and without any unusual desire to show she cleverness occasionally say something of she own or make a allusion which be not quite common still it must happen to she as to every one else to speak of many subject on which the best thing be say long ago and in conversation with a person who have be newly introduce those well-worn theme naturally recur as a further development of salutation and preliminary media of understand such as pipe chocolate or mastic-chewing which serve to confirm the impression that we new acquaintance be on a civilised footing and have enough regard for formula to save we from shocking outburst of individualism to which we be always expose with the tamest bear or baboon consider purely as a matter of information it can not any longer be important for we to learn that a british subject include in the last census hold shakspere to be supreme in the presentation of character still it be as admissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub he hand and tell you that the air be brisk if only he will let it fall as a matter of course with a parenthetic lightness and not announce he adhesion to a commonplace with a emphatic insistance as if it be a proof of singular insight we mortal should chiefly like to talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship not for the sake of hearing revelation or be stimulate by witticism and i have usually find that it be the rather dull person who appear to be disgust with he contemporary because they be not always strikingly original and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have include the prophet isaiah plato franci bacon and voltaire it be always you heaviest bear who be astonish at the tameness of modern celebrity : naturally for a little of he company have reduce they to a state of flaccid fatigue it be right and meet that there should be a abundant utterance of good sound commonplace part of a agreeable talker 's charm be that he let they fall continually with no more than they due emphasis give a pleasant voice to what we be all well assure of make a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious remark to move in hence it seem to I far from unbecome in felicium that in she first dialogue with hinze previously quite a stranger to she she observation be those of a ordinarily refine and well-educated woman on standard subject and might have be print in a manual of polite topic and creditable opinion she have no desire to astonish a man of whom she have hear nothing particular it be all the more exasperating to see and hear hinze 's reception of she well-bred conformity felicium 's acquaintance know she as the suitable wife of a distinguished man a sensible vivacious kindly-disposed woman help she husband with graceful apology write and speak and make she reception agreeable to all comer but you would have imagine that hinze have be prepare by general report to regard this introduction to she as a opportunity comparable to a audience of the delphic sibyl when she have deliver herself on the change in italian travel on the difficulty of read ariosto in these busy time on the want of equilibrium in french political affair and on the pre-eminence of german music he would know what to think felicium be evidently embarrass by he reverent wonder and in dread lest she should seem to be play the oracle become somewhat confused stumble on she answer rather than choose they but this make no difference to hinze 's rapt attention and subdue eagerness of inquiry he continue to put large question bend he head slightly that he eye might be a little lift in await she reply what may i ask be you opinion as to the state of art in england oh say felicium with a light deprecatory laugh i think it suffer from two disease -- bad taste in the patron and want of inspiration in the artist that be true indeed say hinze in a undertone of deep conviction you have put you finger with strict accuracy on the cause of decline to a cultivate taste like yours this must be particularly painful i do not say there be actual decline say felicium with a touch of _ brusquerie _ i do not set myself up as the great personage whom nothing can please that would be too severe a misfortune for other say my complimentary ape you approve perhaps of rosemary 's ` babe in the wood ' as something fresh and _ naïve _ in sculpture i think it enchanting do he know that or _ will _ you permit I to tell he heaven forbid it would be a impertinence in I to praise a work of he -- to pronounce on its quality and that i happen to like it can be of no consequence to he here be a occasion for hinze to smile down on he hat and stroke it -- felicium 's ignorance that she praise be inestimable be peculiarly noteworthy to a observer of mankind presently he be quite sure that she favorite author be shakspere and wish to know what she think of hamlet 's madness when she have quote wilhelm meister on this point and have afterwards testify that lear be beyond adequate presentation that julius caesar be a effective act play and that a poet may know a good deal about human nature while know little of geography hinze appear so impressed with the plenitude of these revelation that he recapitulate they weave they together with thread of compliment -- as you very justly observe and -- it be most true as you say and -- it be well if other note what you have remark some listener incautious in they epithet would have call hinze a ass for my part i would never insult that intelligent and unpretending animal who no doubt bray with perfect simplicity and substantial meaning to those acquaint with he idiom and if he feign more submission than he feel have weighty reason for do so -- i would never i say insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal the ass by give he name to a man whose continuous pretence be so shallow in its motive so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of hinze 's but perhaps you would say that he adulatory manner be originally adopt under strong prompting of self-interest and that he absurdly over-acted deference to person from whom he expect no patronage be the unreflecting persistence of habit -- just as those who live with the deaf will shout to everybody else and you might indeed imagine that in talk to tulpian who have considerable interest at he disposal hinze have a desire appointment in he mind tulpian be appeal to on innumerable subject and if he be unwilling to express himself on any one of they say so with instructive copiousness : he be much listen to and he utterance be register and report with more or less exactitude but i think he have no other listener who comport himself as hinze do -- who figuratively speak carry about a small spoon ready to pick up any dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop tulpian with reverence be it say have some rather absurd notion such as a mind of large discourse often find room for : they slip about among he higher conception and multitudinous acquirement like disreputable character at a national celebration in some vast cathedral where to the ardent soul all be glorified by rainbow light and grand association : any vulgar detective know they for what they be but hinze be especially fervid in he desire to hear tulpian dilate on he crotchet and be rather troublesome to bystander in ask they whether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these crotchet have be publish if a expert be explain some matter on which you desire to know the evidence hinze tease you with tulpian 's guess and ask the expert what he think of they in general hinze delight in the citation of opinion and would hardly remark that the sun shone without a air of respectful appeal or fervid adhesion the ` iliad ' one see would impress he little if it be not for what mr fugleman have lately say about it and if you mention a image or sentiment in chaucer he seem not to heed the bearing of you reference but immediately tell you that mr hautboy too regard chaucer as a poet of the first order and he be delighted to find that two such judge as you and hautboy be at one what be the reason of all this subdue ecstasy move about hat in hand with well-dressed hair and attitude of unimpeachable correctness some person conscious of sagacity decide at once that hinze know what he be about in flattering tulpian and have a carefully appraise end to serve though they may not see it they be mislead by the common mistake of suppose that man 's behavior whether habitual or occasional be chiefly determine by a distinctly conceive motive a definite object to be gain or a definite evil to be avoid the truth be that the primitive want of nature once tolerably satisfy the majority of mankind even in a civilised life full of solicitation be with difficulty arouse to the distinct conception of a object towards which they will direct they action with careful adaptation and it be yet rarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such a end few life be shaped few character form by the contemplation of definite consequence see from a distance and make the goal of continuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoid danger : such control by foresight such vivid picture and practical logic be the distinction of exceptionally strong nature but society be chiefly make up of human being whose daily act be all perform either in unreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate prompting of thought or feeling to execute a immediate purpose they pay they poor-rate give they vote in affair political or parochial wear a certain amount of starch hinder boy from torment the helpless and spend money on tedious observance call pleasure without mentally adjust these practice to they own well-understood interest or to the general ultimate welfare of the human race and when they fall into ungraceful compliment excessive smile or other luckless effort of complaisant behavior these be but the trick or habit gradually form under the successive prompting of a wish to be agreeable stimulate day by day without any widen resource for gratify the wish it do not in the least follow that they be seek by study hypocrisy to get something for themselves and so with hinze 's deferential bearing complimentary parenthesis and worshipful tone which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a comedy he expect no appointment or other appreciable gain through tulpian 's favor he have no doubleness towards felicium there be no sneering or backbiting obverse to he ecstatic admiration he be very well off in the world and cherish no unsatisfied ambition that could feed design and direct flattery as you perceive he have have the education and other advantage of a gentleman without be conscious of marked result such as a decide preference for any particular idea or function : he mind be furnish as hotel be with everything for occasional and transient use but one can not be a englishman and gentleman in general : it be in the nature of thing that one must have a individuality though it may be of a often-repeated type as hinze in grow to maturity have grow into a particular form and expression of person so he necessarily gather a manner and frame of speech which make he additionally recognisable he nature be not tune to the pitch of a genuine direct admiration only to a attitudinising deference which do not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgment all human achievement must be work down to this spoon-meat -- this mixture of other person ' washy opinion and he own flux of reverence for what be third-hand before hinze can find a relish for it he have no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with those who be justly distinguish he have no base admiration and you may know by he entire presentation of himself from the management of he hat to the angle at which he keep he right foot that he aspire to correctness desire to behave becomingly and also to make a figure in dialogue he be only like the bad artist whose picture be a failure we may pity these ill-gifted striver but not pretend that they work be pleasant to behold a man be bind to know something of he own weight and muscular dexterity and the puny athlete be call foolish before he be see to be throw hinze have not the stuff in he to be at once agreeably conversational and sincere and he have get himself up to be at all event agreeably conversational notwithstanding this deliberateness of intention in he talk he be unconscious of falsity for he have not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast or diversity between he word and he thought he be not fairly to be call a hypocrite but i have already confess to the more exasperation at he make-believe reverence because it have no deep hunger to excuse it vi only temper what be temper its primary mean the proportion and mode in which quality be mingle be much neglect in popular speech yet even here the word often carry a reference to a habitual state or general tendency of the organism in distinction from what be hold to be specific virtue and vice as people confess to bad memory without expect to sink in mental reputation so we hear a man declare to have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high quality when he err or in any way commit himself he temper be accuse not he character and it be understand that but for a brutal bearish mood he be kindness itself if he kick small animal swear violently at a servant who mistake order or be grossly rude to he wife it be remark apologetically that these thing mean nothing -- they be all temper certainly there be a limit to this form of apology and the forgery of a bill or the order of goods without any prospect of pay for they have never be set down to a unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of irascibility but on the whole there be a peculiar exercise of indulgence towards the manifestation of bad temper which tend to encourage they so that we be in danger of have among we a number of virtuous person who conduct themselves detestably just as we have hysterical patient who with sound organ be apparently labor under many sort of organic disease let it be admit however that a man may be a good fellow and yet have a bad temper so bad that we recognize he merit with reluctance and be incline to resent he occasionally amiable behavior as a unfair demand on we admiration touchwood be that kind of good fellow he be by turn insolent quarrelsome repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach he with respect neglectful of he friend angry in face of legitimate demand procrastinate in the fulfilment of such demand prompt to rude word and harsh look by a moody disgust with he fellow-man in general -- and yet as everybody will assure you the soul of honor a steadfast friend a defender of the oppress a affectionate-hearted creature pity that after a certain experience of he mood he intimacy become insupportable a man who use he balmoral to tread on you toe with much frequency and a unmistakeable emphasis may prove a fast friend in adversity but meanwhile you adversity have not arrive and you toe be tender the daily sneer or growl at you remark be not to be make amends for by a possible eulogy or defense of you understanding against depredator who may not present themselves and on a occasion which may never arise i can not submit to a chronic state of blue and green bruise as a form of insurance against a accident touchwood 's bad temper be of the contradict pugnacious sort he be the honorable gentleman in opposition whatever proposal or proposition may be broach and when other join he he secretly damn they superfluous agreement quickly discover that he way of state the case be not exactly theirs a invitation or any sign of expectation throw he into a attitude of refusal ask he concurrence in a benevolent measure : he will not decline to give it because he have a real sympathy with good aim but he comply resentfully though where he be let alone he will do much more than any one would have think of ask for no man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the imputation of not pay he debt yet when a bill be send in with any promptitude he be incline to make the tradesman wait for the money he be in such a hurry to get one see that this antagonistic temper must be much relieve by find a particular object and that its worst moment must be those where the mood be that of vague resistance there be nothing specific to oppose touchwood be never so little engaging as when he come down to breakfast with a cloud on he brow after parting from you the night before with a affectionate effusiveness at the end of a confidential conversation which have assure you of mutual understanding impossible that you can have commit any offence if mouse have disturb he that be not you fault but nevertheless you cheerful greet have better not convey any reference to the weather else it will be meet by a sneer which take you unaware may give you a crush sense that you make a poor figure with you cheerfulness which be not ask for some daring person perhaps introduce another topic and use the delicate flattery of appeal to touchwood for he opinion the topic be include in he favorite study a indistinct mutter with a look at the carving-knife in reply teach that daring person how ill he have choose a market for he deference if touchwood 's behavior affect you very closely you have better break you leg in the course of the day : he bad temper will then vanish at once he will take a painful journey on you behalf he will sit up with you night after night he will do all the work of you department so as to save you from any loss in consequence of you accident he will be even uniformly tender to you till you be well on you leg again when he will some fine morning insult you without provocation and make you wish that he generous goodness to you have not close you lip against retort it be not always necessary that a friend should break he leg for touchwood to feel compunction and endeavor to make amends for he bearishness or insolence he become spontaneously conscious that he have misbehave and he be not only ashamed of himself but have the better prompt to try and heal any wound he have inflict unhappily the habit of be offensive without mean it lead usually to a way of make amends which the injure person can not but regard as a be amiable without mean it the kindness the complimentary indication or assurance be apt to appear in the light of a penance adjust to the foregoing lapse and by the very contrast they offer call up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for they be not a spontaneous prompt of goodwill but a elaborate compensation and in fact dion 's atone friendliness have a ring of artificiality because he formerly disguise he good feeling towards you he now express more than he quite feel it be in vain have make you extremely uncomfortable last week he have absolutely diminish he power of make you happy to-day : he struggle against this result by excessive effort but he have teach you to observe he fitfulness rather than to be warm by he episodic show of regard i suspect that many person who have a uncertain incalculable temper flatter themselves that it enhance they fascination but perhaps they be under the prior mistake of exaggerate the charm which they suppose to be thus strengthen in any case they will do well not to trust in the attraction of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for close intercourse a pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorer by harass they but if she let one of they make she he wife the point of view from which he will look at she pouting and tossing and mysterious inability to be please will be seriously altered and if slavery to a pretty woman which seem among the least conditional form of abject service will not bear too great a strain from she bad temper even though she beauty remain the same it be clear that a man whose claim lie in he high character or high performance have need impress we very constantly with he peculiar value and indispensableness if he be to test we patience by a uncertainty of temper which leave we absolutely without grounds for guess how he will receive we person or humbly advance opinion or what line he will take on any but the most momentous occasion for it be among the repulsive effect of this bad temper which be suppose to be compatible with shine virtue that it be apt to determine a man 's sudden adhesion to a opinion whether on a personal or impersonal matter without leave he time to consider he grounds the adhesion be sudden and momentary but it either form a precedent for he line of thought and action or it be presently see to have be inconsistent with he true mind this determination of partisanship by temper have its worst effect in the career of the public man who be always in danger of get so enthral by he own word that he look into fact and question not to get rectify knowledge but to get evidence that will justify he actual attitude which be assume under a impulse dependent on something else than knowledge there have be plenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the word of a master and have the judgment uniformly control by a he say it but a much worse woe to befall a man be to have every judgment control by a i say it -- to make a divinity of he own short-sightedness or passion-led aberration and explain the world in its honor there be hardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gift hence i can not join with those who wish that touchwood be young enough to enter on public life should get elect for parliament and use he excellent ability to serve he country in that conspicuous manner for hitherto in the less momentous incident of private life he capricious temper have only produce the minor evil of inconsistency and he be even greatly at ease in contradict himself provide he can contradict you and disappoint any smile expectation you may have show that the impression you be utter be likely to meet with he sympathy consider that the day before he himself give you the example which you mind be follow he be at least free from those fetter of self-justification which be the curse of parliamentary speaking and what i rather desire for he be that he should produce the great book which he be generally pronounced capable of write and put he best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society because i should then have steady ground for bear with he diurnal incalculableness and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to that unvarying monumental service unhappily touchwood 's great power have be only so far manifest as to be believe in not demonstrate everybody rate they highly and think that whatever he choose to do would be do in a first-rate manner be it he love of disappointing complacent expectancy which have go so far as to keep up this lamentable negation and make he resolve not to write the comprehensive work which he would have write if nobody have expect it of he one can see that if touchwood be to become a public man and take to frequent speaking on platform or from he seat in the house it would hardly be possible for he to maintain much integrity of opinion or to avoid course of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would stamp with discredit say that he be endow with the purest honesty it would inevitably be drag captive by this mysterious protean bad temper there would be the fatal public necessity of justify oratorical temper which have get on its leg in its bitter mood and make insulting imputation or of keep up some decent show of consistency with opinion vent out of temper 's contradictoriness and word would have to be follow up by act of adhesion certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous he must be so under extreme difficulty i doubt the possibility that a high order of character can coexist with a temper like touchwood 's for it be of the nature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental habit which depend on a grow harmony between perception conviction and impulse there may be good feeling good deed -- for a human nature may pack endless variety and bless inconsistency in its winding -- but it be essential to what be worthy to be call high character that it may be safely calculate on and that its quality shall have take the form of principle or law habitually if not perfectly obey if a man frequently pass unjust judgment take up false attitude intermit he act of kindness with rude behavior or cruel word and fall into the consequent vulgar error of suppose that he can make amends by labored agreeableness i can not consider such course any the less ugly because they be ascribe to temper especially i object to the assumption that he have a fundamentally good disposition be either a apology or a compensation for he bad behavior if he temper yesterday make he lash the horse upset the curricle and cause a breakage in my rib i feel it no compensation that to-day he vow he will drive I anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he live yesterday be what it be my rib be pain I it be not a main object of my life to be drive by touchwood -- and i have no confidence in he lifelong gentleness the utmost form of placability i be capable of be to try and remember he better deed already perform and mindful of my own offence to bear he no malice but i can not accept he amends if the bad-tempered man want to apologise he have need to do it on a large public scale make some beneficent discovery produce some stimulating work of genius invent some powerful process -- prove himself such a good to contemporary multitude and future generation as to make the discomfort he cause he friend and acquaintance a vanish quality a trifle even in they own estimate vii a political molecule the most arrant denier must admit that a man often further larger end than he be conscious of and that while he be transact he particular affair with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant he subserve a economy larger than any purpose of he own society be happily not dependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already endowed with comprehensive sympathy : any molecule of the body politic work towards he own interest in a orderly way get he understanding more or less penetrate with the fact that he interest be include in that of a large number i have watch several political molecule be educate in this way by the nature of thing into a faint feeling of fraternity but at this moment i be thinking of spike a elector who vote on the side of progress though he be not inwardly attach to it under that name for abstraction be deity have many specific name local habitation and form of activity and so get a multitude of devout servant who care no more for they under they highest title than the celebrated person who put with forcible brevity a view of human motive now much insist on ask what posterity have do for he that he should care for posterity to many mind even among the ancient -lrb- think by some to have be invariably poetical -rrb- the goddess of wisdom be doubtless worship simply as the patroness of spin and weave now spin and weave from a manufacturing wholesale point of view be the chief form under which spike from early year have unconsciously be a devotee of progress he be a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance not less than six foot high and show the utmost nicety in the care of he person and equipment he umbrella be especially remarkable for its neatness though perhaps he swing it unduly in walk he complexion be fresh he eye small bright and twinkling he be see to great advantage in a hat and greatcoat -- garment frequently fatal to the impressiveness of shorter figure but when he be uncover in the drawing-room it be impossible not to observe that he head shelve off too rapidly from the eyebrow towards the crown and that he length of limb seem to have use up he mind so as to cause a air of abstraction from conversational topic he appear indeed to be preoccupy with a sense of he exquisite cleanliness clap he hand together and rub they frequently straighten he back and even open he mouth and close it again with a slight snap apparently for no other purpose than the confirmation to himself of he own power in that line these be innocent exercise but they be not such as give weight to a man 's personality sometimes spike 's mind emerge from its preoccupation burst forth in a remark deliver with smile zest as that he do like to see gravel walk well roll or that a lady should always wear the best jewellery or that a bride be a most interesting object but find these idea receive rather coldly he would relapse into abstraction draw up he back wrinkle he brow longitudinally and seem to regard society even include gravel walk jewellery and bride as essentially a poor affair indeed he habit of mind be despond and he take melancholy view as to the possible extent of human pleasure and the value of existence especially after he have make he fortune in the cotton manufacture and have thus attain the chief object of he ambition -- the object which have engage he talent for order and persevere application for he easy leisure cause he much _ ennui _ he be abstemious and have none of those temptation to sensual excess which fill up a man 's time first with indulgence and then with the process of get well from its effect he have not indeed exhaust the source of knowledge but here again he notion of human pleasure be narrow by he want of appetite for though he seem rather surprise at the consideration that alfr the great be a catholic or that apart from the ten commandment any conception of moral conduct have occur to mankind he be not stimulate to further inquiry on these remote matter yet he aspire to what he regard as intellectual society willingly entertain beneficed clergyman and buy the book he hear speak of arrange they carefully on the shelf of what he call he library and occasionally sit alone in the same room with they but some mind seem well glaze by nature against the admission of knowledge and spike 's be one of they it be not however entirely so with regard to politics he have have a strong opinion about the reform bill and see clearly that the large trading town ought to send member portrait of the reform hero hang frame and glaze in he library : he pride himself on be a liberal in this last particular as well as in not give benefaction and not make loan without interest he show unquestionable firmness on the repeal of the corn law again he be thoroughly convinced he mind be expansive towards foreign market and he imagination could see that the people from whom we take corn might be able to take the cotton goods which they have hitherto dispense with on he conduct in these political concern he wife otherwise influential as a woman who belong to a family with a title in it and who have condescend in marry he could gain no hold : she have to blush a little at what be call she husband 's radicalism -- a epithet which be a very unfair impeachment of spike who never go to the root of anything but he understand he own trading affair and in this way become a genuine constant political element if he have be bear a little later he could have be accept as a eligible member of parliament and if he have belong to a high family he might have do for a member of the government perhaps he indifference to view would have pass for administrative judiciousness and he would have be so generally silent that he must often have be silent in the right place but this be empty speculation : there be no warrant for say what spike would have be and know so as to have make a calculable political element if he have not be educate by have to manage he trade a small mind train to useful occupation for the satisfy of private need become a representative of genuine class-need spike object to certain item of legislation because they hamper he own trade but he neighbor ' trade be hamper by the same cause and though he would have be simply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a fellow-townsman he need for a change in legislation be share by all he neighbor in trade cease to be simply selfish and raise he to a sense of common injury and common benefit true if the law could have be change for the benefit of he particular business leave the cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prosper spike might not have think that result intolerably unjust but the nature of thing do not allow of such a result be contemplate as possible it allow of a enlarged market for spike only through the enlargement of he neighbor ' market and the possible be always the ultimate master of we effort and desire spike be oblige to contemplate a general benefit and thus become public-spirited in spite of himself or rather the nature of thing transmute he active egoism into a demand for a public benefit certainly if spike have be bear a marquis he could not have have the same chance of be useful as a political element but he might have have the same appearance have be equally null in conversation sceptical as to the reality of pleasure and destitute of historical knowledge perhaps even dimly dislike jesuitism as a quality in catholic mind or regard bacon as the inventor of physical science the depths of middle-aged gentleman 's ignorance will never be know for want of public examination in this branch viii the watch-dog of knowledge mordax be a admirable man ardent in intellectual work public-spirited affectionate and able to find the right word in convey ingenious idea or elevated feeling pity that to all these grace he can not add what would give they the utmost finish -- the occasional admission that he have be in the wrong the occasional frank welcome of a new idea as something not before present to he mind but no : mordax 's self-respect seem to be of that fiery quality which demand that none but the monarch of thought shall have a advantage over he and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of have he notion correct he become astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel for so kindly and conscientious a man you be fond of attribute those fine quality to mordax say acer the other day but i have not much belief in virtue that be always require to be assert in spite of appearance against they true fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where he be conspicuously absent i mean in recognize claim which the rest of the world be not likely to stand up for it do not need much love of truth and justice in I to say that aldebaran be a bright star or isaac newton the greatest of discoverer nor much kindliness in I to want my note to be hear above the rest in a chorus of hallelujah to one already crown it be my way to apply test do the man who have the ear of the public use he advantage tenderly towards poor fellow who may be hinder of they due if he treat they pretension with scorn that be my test of he justice and benevolence my answer be that he system of moral test might be as delusive as what ignorant people take to be test of intellect and learn if the scholar or _ savant _ can not answer they haphazard question on the shortest notice they belief in he capacity be shake but the better-informed have give up the johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of leg able to walk east or west accord to choice intellect be no longer take to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence -lrb- or mediocrity -rrb- in all department it be even admit that application in one line of study or practice have often a laming effect in other direction and that a intellectual quality or special facility which be a furtherance in one medium of effort be a drag in another we have convince ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn or even in theorise about the affection that he may be a mere fumbler in physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motive that he may seem the poor poll of the company in conversation and yet write with some humorous vigor it be not true that a man 's intellectual power be like the strength of a timber beam to be measure by its weakest point why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what be call consistency to a man 's moral nature and argue against the existence of fine impulse or habit of feeling in relation to he action generally because those better movement be absent in a class of case which act peculiarly on a irritable form of he egoism the mistake might be correct by we take notice that the ungenerous word or act which seem to we the most utterly incompatible with good disposition in the offender be those which offend ourselves all other person be able to draw a milder conclusion laniger who have a temper but no talent for repartee have be run down in a fierce way by mordax be inwardly persuade that the highly-lauded man be a wolf at heart : he be much try by perceive that he own friend seem to think no worse of the reckless assailant than they do before and corvus who have lately be flatter by some kindness from mordax be unmindful enough of laniger 's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature with admire gratitude there be a fable that when the badger have be sting all over by bee a bear console he by a rhapsodic account of how he himself have just breakfast on they honey the badger reply peevishly the sting be in my flesh and the sweetness be on you muzzle the bear it be say be surprise at the badger 's want of altruism but this difference of sensibility between laniger and he friend only mirror in a faint way the difference between he own point of view and that of the man who have injure he if those neutral perhaps even affectionate person form no lively conception of what laniger suffer how should mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check he in what he persuade himself be a scourging administer by the qualify man to the unqualified depend upon it he conscience though active enough in some relation have never give he a twinge because of he polemical rudeness and even brutality he would go from the room where he have be tire himself through the watch of the night in lifting and turn a sick friend and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in which he mercilessly pillory a laniger who have suppose that he could tell the world something else or more than have be sanction by the eminent mordax -- and what be worse have sometimes really do so do this nullify the genuineness of motive which make he tender to he suffer friend not at all it only prove that he arrogant egoism set on fire send up smoke and flame where just before there have be the dew of fellowship and pity he be angry and equip himself accordingly -- with a penknife to give the offender a _ comprachico _ countenance a mirror to show he the effect and a pair of nail boot to give he he dismissal all this to teach he who the roman really be and to purge inquiry of incompetent intrusion so render a important service to mankind when a man be in a rage and want to hurt another in consequence he can always regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power and all the more easily because there be real need to assert the righteous efficacy of indignation i for my part feel with the laniger and should object all the more to they or my be lacerate and dress with salt if the administrator of such torture allege as a motive he care for truth and posterity and get himself picture with a halo in consequence in transaction between fellow-men it be well to consider a little in the first place what be fair and kind towards the person immediately concern before we spit and roast he on behalf of the next century but one wide-reaching motive bless and glorious as they be and of the highest sacramental virtue have they danger like all else that touch the mixed life of the earth they be archangel with awful brow and flame sword summon and encourage we to do the right and the divinely heroic and we feel a beneficent tremor in they presence but to learn what it be they thus summon we to do we have to consider the mortal we be elbow who be of we own stature and we own appetite i can not feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of central asia in the come age but i have good reason to believe that the future population there will be none the worse off because i abstain from conjectural vilification of my opponent during the present parliamentary session and i be very sure that i shall be less injurious to my contemporary on the whole and in the vast majority of instance the action by which we can do the best for future age be of the sort which have a certain beneficence and grace for contemporary a sour father may reform prison but consider in he sourness he do harm the deed of juda have be attribute to far-reaching view and the wish to hasten he master 's declaration of himself as the messiah perhaps -- i will not maintain the contrary -- juda represent he motive in this way and feel justified in he traitorous kiss but my belief that he deserve metaphorically speak to be where dante see he at the bottom of the malebolge would not be the less strong because he be not convince that he action be detestable i refuse to accept a man who have the stomach for such treachery as a hero impatient for the redemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kiss shall be those of peace and righteousness all this be by the way to show that my apology for mordax be not found on he persuasion of superiority in he own motive but on the compatibility of unfair equivocal and even cruel action with a nature which apart from special temptation be kindly and generous and also to enforce the need of check from a fellow-feel with those whom we act immediately -lrb- not distantly -rrb- concern will any one be so hardy as to maintain that a otherwise worthy man can not be vain and arrogant i think most of we have some interest in argue the contrary and it be of the nature of vanity and arrogance if unchecked to become cruel and self-justifying there be fierce beast within : chain they chain they and let they learn to cower before the creature with wider reason this be what one wish for mordax -- that he heart and brain should restrain the outleap of roar and talon as to he unwillingness to admit that a idea which he have not discover be novel to he one be surprise that quick intellect and shrewd observation do not early gather reason for be ashamed of a mental trick which make one among the comic part of that various actor conceit ignorance i have a sort of valet and factotum a excellent respectable servant whose spelling be so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluity that he write _ night _ as _ nit _ one day look over he account i say to he jocosely you be in the latest fashion with you spelling pummel : most people spell night with a _ gh _ between the _ i _ and the _ t _ but the greatest scholar now spell it as you do so i suppose sir say pummel i have see it with a _ gh _ but i have noways give into that myself you would never catch pummel in a interjection of surprise i have sometimes lay trap for he astonishment but he have escape they all either by a respectful neutrality as of one who would not appear to notice that he master have be take too much wine or else by that strong persuasion of he all-knowingness which make it simply impossible for he to feel himself newly inform if i tell he that the world be spin round and along like a top and that he be spin with it he say yes i have hear a deal of that in my time sir and lift the horizontal line of he brow a little higher balance he head from side to side as if it be too painfully full whether i tell he that they cook puppy in china that there be duck with fur coat in australium or that in some part of the world it be the pink of politeness to put you tongue out on introduction to a respectable stranger pummel reply so i suppose sir with a air of resignation to hear my poor version of well-known thing such as elder use in listen to lively boy lately present with a anecdote book he utmost concession be that what you state be what he would have supply if you have give he _ carte blanche _ instead of you needless instruction and in this sense he favorite answer be i should say pummel i observe a little irritated at not get my coffee if you be to carry you kettle and spirit of wine up a mountain of a morning you water would boil there sooner i should say sir or there be boil spring in iceland better go to iceland that be what i have be think sir i have take to ask he hard question and as i expect he never admit he own inability to answer they without represent it as common to the human race what be the cause of the tide pummel well sir nobody rightly know many give they opinion but if i be to give mine it ` ud be different but while he be never surprised himself he be constantly imagine situation of surprise for other he own consciousness be that of one so thoroughly soak in knowledge that further absorption be impossible but he neighbor appear to he to be in the state of thirsty sponge which it be a charity to besprinkle he great interest in thinking of foreigner be that they must be surprise at what they see in england and especially at the beef he be often occupy with the surprise adam must have feel at the sight of the assemble animal -- for he be not like we sir use from a b ' y to wombwell 's show he be fond of discourse to the lad who act as shoe-black and general subaltern and i have overhear he say to that small upstart with some severity now do not you pretend to know because the more you pretend the more i see you ignirance -- a lucidity on he part which have confirm my impression that the thoroughly self-satisfied person be the only one fully to appreciate the charm of humility in other you diffident self-suspecting mortal be not very angry that other should feel more comfortable about themselves provide they be not otherwise offensive : he be rather like the chilly person glad to sit next a warmer neighbor or the timid glad to have a courageous fellow-traveller it cheer he to observe the store of small comfort that he fellow-creature may find in they self-complacency just as one be pleased to see poor old soul soothe by the tobacco and snuff for which one have neither nose nor stomach oneself but you arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he see to be ill-founded the service he regard society as most in need of be to put down the conceit which be so particularly rife around he that he be incline to believe it the grow characteristic of the present age in the school of magna graecium or in the sixth century of we era or even under kublaus khan he find a comparative freedom from that presumption by which he contemporary be stir he able gall the way people will now flaunt notion which be not he without appear to mind that they be not he strike he as especially disgust it might seem surprising to we that one strongly convinced of he own value should prefer to exalt a age in which _ he _ do not flourish if it be not for the reflection that the present age be the only one in which anybody have appear to undervalue he ix a half-breed a early deep-seated love to which we become faithless have its unfailing nemesis if only in that division of soul which narrow all newer joy by the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change i refer not merely to the love of a person but to the love of idea practical belief and social habit and faithlessness here mean not a gradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge but a yield to seductive circumstance not a conviction that the original choice be a mistake but a subjection to incident that flatter a grow desire in this sort of love it be the forsaker who have the melancholy lot for a abandon belief may be more effectively vengeful than dido the child of a wander tribe catch young and trained to polite life if he feel a hereditary yearning can run away to the old wild and get he nature into tune but there be no such recovery possible to the man who remember what he once believe without be convince that he be in error who feel within he unsatisfied stirring towards old beloved habit and intimacy from which he have far recede without conscious justification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new this involuntary renegade have he character hopelessly jangle and out of tune he be like a organ with its stop in the lawless condition of obtrude themselves without method so that hearer be amaze by the most unexpected transition -- the trumpet breaking in on the flute and the oböe confound both hence the lot of mixtus affect I pathetically notwithstanding that he spend he grow wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment to most observer he appear to be simply one of the fortunate and also sharp commercial man who begin with mean to be rich and have become what they mean to be : a man never take to be well-born but surprisingly better inform than the well-born usually be and distinguish among ordinary commercial magnate by a personal kindness which prompt he not only to help the suffering in a material way through he wealth but also by direct ministration of he own yet with all this diffusing as it be the odour of a man delightedly conscious of he wealth as a equivalent for the other social distinction of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without envy hardly one among those superficial observer can suspect that he aim or have ever aim at be a writer still less can they imagine that he mind be often move by strong current of regret and of the most unworldly sympathy from the memory of a youthful time when he choose associate be man and woman whose only distinction be a religious a philanthropic or a intellectual enthusiasm when the lady on whose word he attention most hung be a writer of minor religious literature when he be a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alley of a great provincial town and when he attend the lecture give specially to young man by mr apollo the eloquent congregational preacher who have study in germany and have liberal advanced view then far beyond the ordinary teaching of he sect at that time mixtus think himself a young man of socially reform idea of religious principle and religious yearning it be within he prospects also to be rich but he look forward to a use of he riches chiefly for reform and religious purpose he opinion be of a strongly democratic stamp except that even then belong to the class of employer he be oppose to all demand in the employ that would restrict the expansiveness of trade he be the most democratic in relation to the unreasonable privilege of the aristocracy and land interest and he have also a religious sense of brotherhood with the poor altogether he be a sincerely benevolent young man interest in idea and renounce personal ease for the sake of study religious communion and good work if you have know he then you would have expect he to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman share he benevolent and religious habit and likely to encourage he study -- a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished part in one of the most enlighten religious circle of a great provincial capital how be it that mixtus find himself in a london mansion and in society totally unlike that which make the ideal of he younger year and whom _ do _ he marry why he marry scintilla who fascinate he as she have fascinate other by she prettiness she liveliness and she music it be a common enough case that of a man be suddenly captivate by a woman nearly the opposite of he ideal or if not wholly captivate at least effectively capture by a combination of circumstance along with a unwarily manifest inclination which might otherwise have be transient mixtus be captivate and then capture on the worldly side of he disposition which have be always grow and flourish side by side with he philanthropic and religious taste he have ability in business and he have early mean to be rich also he be get rich and the taste for such success be naturally grow with the pleasure of reward exertion it be during a business sojourn in london that he meet scintilla who though without fortune associate with family of greek merchant live in a style of splendor and with artist patronise by such wealthy entertainer mixtus on this occasion become familiar with a world in which wealth seem the key to a more brilliant sort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial circle of x would it not be possible to unite the two kind of sway a man bent on the most useful end might _ with a fortune large enough _ make morality magnificent and recommend religious principle by show it in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of table also with a wife whose grace wit and accomplishment give a finish sometimes lack even to establishment get up with that unhesitate worldliness to which high cost be a sufficient reason enough mixtus married scintilla now this lively lady know nothing of nonconformist except that they be unfashionable : she do not distinguish one conventicle from another and mr apollo with he enlighten interpretation seem to she as heavy a bear if not quite so ridiculous as mr john could have be with he solemn twang at the baptist chapel in the lowest suburb or as a local preacher among the methodist in general people who appear seriously to believe in any sort of doctrine whether religious social or philosophical seem rather absurd to scintilla ten to one these theoretic people pronounce oddly have some reason or other for say that the most agreeable thing be wrong wear objectionable clothes and want you to subscribe to something they be probably ignorant of art and music do not understand _ badinage _ and in fact could talk of nothing amusing in scintilla 's eye the majority of person be ridiculous and deplorably want in that keen perception of what be good taste with which she herself be bless by nature and education but the people understand to be religious or otherwise theoretic be the most ridiculous of all without be proportionately amusing and invitable do mixtus not discover this view of scintilla 's before they marriage or do he allow she to remain in ignorance of habit and opinion which have make half the occupation of he youth when a man be incline to marry a particular woman and have make any committal of himself this woman 's opinion however different from he own be readily regard as part of she pretty way especially if they be merely negative as for example that she do not insist on the trinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rate but simply regard she lover 's troubling himself in disputation on these head as stuff and nonsense the man feel he own superior strength and be sure that marriage will make no difference to he on the subject about which he be in earnest and to laugh at man 's affair be a woman 's privilege tend to enliven the domestic hearth if scintilla have no liking for the best sort of nonconformity she be without any troublesome bias towards episcopacy anglicanism and early sacrament and be quite contented not to go to church as to scintilla 's acquaintance with she lover 's taste on these subject she be equally convince on she side that a husband 's queer way while he be a bachelor would be easily laugh out of he when he have marry a adroit woman mixtus she feel be a excellent creature quite likable who be get rich and scintilla mean to have all the advantage of a rich man 's wife she be not in the least a wicked woman she be simply a pretty animal of the ape kind with a aptitude for certain accomplishment which education have make the most of but we have see what have be the result to poor mixtus he have become richer even than he dream of be have a little palace in london and entertain with splendor the half-aristocratic professional and artistic society which he be proud to think select this society regard he as a clever fellow in he particular branch see that he have become a considerable capitalist and as a man desirable to have on the list of one 's acquaintance but from every other point of view mixtus find himself personally submerge : what he happen to think be not feel by he esteemed guest to be of any consequence and what he use to think with the ardor of conviction he now hardly ever express he be transplant and the sap within he have long be divert into other than the old line of vigorous growth how could he speak to the artist crespus or to sir hong kong bantam about the enlarged doctrine of mr apollo how could he mention to they he former effort towards evangelise the inhabitant of the x alley and he reference to he historical and geographical study towards a survey of possible market for english product be receive with a air of ironical suspicion by many of he political friend who take he pretension to give advice concern the amazon the euphrate and the niger as equivalent to the currier 's wide view on the applicability of leather he can only make a figure through he genial hospitality it be in vain that he buy the best picture and statue of the best artist nobody will call he a judge in art if he picture and statue be well choose it be generally think that scintilla tell he what to buy and yet scintilla in other connection be speak of as have only a superficial and often questionable taste mixtus it be decide be a good fellow not ignorant -- no really have a good deal of knowledge as well as sense but not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man he have consequently become a little uncertain as to he own point of view and in he most unreserved moment of friendly intercourse even when speak to listener whom he think likely to sympathise with the earlier part of he career he present himself in all he various aspect and feel himself in turn what he have be what he be and what other take he to be -lrb- for this last status be what we must all more or less accept -rrb- he will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of he old associate the particular limit he be once accustom to trace of freedom in religious speculation and he old ideal of a worthy life but he will presently pass to the argument that money be the only means by which you can get what be best worth have in the world and will arrive at the exclamation give I money with the tone and gesture of a man who both feel and know then if one of he audience not have money remark that a man may have make up he mind to do without money because he prefer something else mixtus be with he immediately cordially concur in the supreme value of mind and genius which indeed make he own chief delight in that he be able to entertain the admirable possessor of these attribute at he own table though not himself reckon among they yet he will proceed to observe there be a time when he sacrifice he sleep to study and even now amid the press of business he from time to time think of take up the manuscript which he hope some day to complete and be always increase he collection of valuable work bear on he favorite topic and it be true that he have read much in certain direction and can remember what he have read he know the history and theory of colonisation and the social condition of country that do not at present consume a sufficiently large share of we product and manufacture he continue he early habit of regard the spread of christianity as a great result of we commercial intercourse with black brown and yellow population but this be a idea not speak of in the sort of fashionable society that scintilla collect round she husband 's table and mixtus now philosophically reflect that the cause must come before the effect and that the thing to be directly strive for be the commercial intercourse not exclude a little war if that also should prove needful as a pioneer of christianity he have long be wont to feel bashful about he former religion as if it be a old attachment have consequence which he do not abandon but keep in decent privacy he avowed object and actual position be incompatible with they public acknowledgment there be the same kind of fluctuation in he aspect towards social question and duty he have not lose the kindness that use to make he a benefactor and succourer of the needy and he be still liberal in help forward the clever and industrious but in he active superintendence of commercial undertaking he have contract more and more of the bitterness which capitalist and employer often feel to be a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletary hence many who this be a idea not speak of in the sort of fashionable society that scintilla collect round she husband 's table and mixtus now philosophically reflect that the cause must come before the effect and that the thing to be directly strive for be the commercial intercourse not exclude a little war if that also should prove needful as a pioneer of christianity he have long be wont to feel bashful about he former religion as if it be a old attachment have consequence which he do not abandon but keep in decent privacy he avowed object and actual position be incompatible with they public acknowledgment there be the same kind of fluctuation in he aspect towards social question and duty he have not lose the kindness that use to make he a benefactor and succourer of the needy and he be still liberal in help forward the clever and industrious but in he active superintendence of commercial undertaking he have contract more and more of the bitterness which capitalist and employer often feel to be a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletary hence many who have occasionally meet he when trade question be be discuss conclude he to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and money-getting man indeed hardly any of he acquaintance know what mixtus really be consider as a whole -- nor do mixtus himself know it x debase the moral currency il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule où il n ' y en a point : c'est se gâter le goût c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres mais le ridicule qui est quelque part il faut l' y voir l'en tirer avec grâce et d'une manière qui plaise et qui instruise i be fond of quote this passage from la bruyère because the subject be one where i like to show a frenchman on my side to save my sentiment from be set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient sense of the ludicrous and also that they may profit by that enhancement of idea when present in a foreign tongue that glamour of unfamiliarity confer a dignity on the foreign name of very common thing of which even a philosopher like dugald stewart confess the influence i remember hear a fervid woman attempt to recite in english the narrative of a beg frenchman who describe the violent death of he father in the July day the narrative have impress she through the mist of she flushed anxiety to understand it as something quite grandly pathetic but find the fact turn out meager and she audience cold she break off say it sound so much finer in french -- _ j' be vu le sing de mon père _ and so on -- i wish i could repeat it in french this be a pardonable illusion in a old-fashioned lady who have not receive the polyglot education of the present day but i observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admire acceptance solely by virtue of the french language and one may fairly desire that what seem a just discrimination should profit by the fashionable prejudice in favor of la bruyère 's idiom but i wish he have add that the habit of drag the ludicrous into topic where the chief interest be of a different or even opposite kind be a sign not of endowment but of deficiency the art of spoil be within reach of the dullest faculty : the coarsest clown with a hammer in he hand might chip the nose off every statue and bust in the vatican and stand grin at the effect of he work because wit be a exquisite product of high power we be not therefore force to admit the sadly confused inference of the monotonous jester that he be establish he superiority over every less facetious person and over every topic on which he be ignorant or insensible by be uneasy until he have distort it in the small crack mirror which he carry about with he as a joking apparatus some high authority be need to give many worthy and timid person the freedom of muscular repose under the grow demand on they to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of be take for dullard still more to inspire they with the courage to say that they object to the theatrical spoil for themselves and they child of all affect theme all the grander deed and aim of man by burlesque association adapt to the taste of rich fishmonger in the stall and they assistant in the gallery the english people in the present generation be falsely repute to know shakspere -lrb- as by some innocent person the florentine mule-driver be believe to have know the _ divina commedia _ not perhaps exclude all the subtle discourse in the _ purgatorio _ and _ paradiso _ -rrb- but there seem a clear prospect that in the come generation he will be know to they through burlesque and that he play will find a new life as pantomime a bottle-nosed lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm rosalind and celium will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherd and shepherdess ophelium in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of grenadine will dance through the mad scene finish with the famous attitude of the scissors in the arm of laerte and all the speech in hamlet will be so ingeniously parody that the original will be reduce to a mere _ memorium technica _ of the improver 's pun -- premonitory sign of a hideous millennium in which the lion will have to lie down with the lascivious monkey whom -lrb- if we may trust pliny -rrb- he soul naturally abhor i have be amaze to find that some artist whose own work have the ideal stamp be quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the burlesque spirit which range to and fro and up and down on the earth see no reason -lrb- except a precarious censorship -rrb- why it should not appropriate every sacred heroic and pathetic theme which serve to make up the treasure of human admiration hope and love one would have think that they own half-despairing effort to invest in worthy outward shape the vague inward impression of sublimity and the consciousness of a implicit ideal in the commonest scene might have make they susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque which be likely to render they composition no better than a dissolve view where every noble form be see melting into its preposterous caricature it use to be imagine of the unhappy medieval jew that they parody calvary by crucify dog if they have be guilty they would at least have have the excuse of the hatred and rage beget by persecution be we on the way to a parody which shall have no other excuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded appetite -- after the pay to be earn by pasture circe 's herd where they may defile every monument of that grow life which should have keep they human the world seem to I well supply with what be genuinely ridiculous : wit and humor may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the change facet of egoism absurdity and vice as the sunshine over the ripple sea or the dewy meadow why should we make we delicious sense of the ludicrous with its invigorating shock of laughter and its irrepressible smile which be the outglow of a inward radiation as gentle and cheer as the warmth of morning flourish like a brigand on the robbery of we mental wealth -- or let it take its exercise as a madman might if allow a free nightly promenade by draw the populace with bonfire which leave some venerable structure a blacken ruin or send a scorching smoke across the portrait of the past at which we once look with a loving recognition of fellowship and disfigure they into butt of mockery -- nay worse -- use it to degrade the healthy appetite and affection of we nature as they be see to be degrade in insane patient whose system all out of joint find matter for scream laughter in mere topsy-turvy make every passion preposterous or obscene and turn the hard-won order of life into a second chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first be ever thrill with light this be what i call debase the moral currency : lower the value of every inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less of the spiritual product the generous motive which sustain the charm and elevation of we social existence -- the something besides bread by which man save he soul alive the bread-winner of the family may demand more and more coppery shilling or assignat or greenback for he day 's work and so get the needful quantum of food but let that moral currency be empty of its value -- let a greedy buffoonery debase all historic beauty majesty and pathos and the more you heap up the desecrate symbol the greater will be the lack of the ennobling emotion which subdue the tyranny of suffering and make ambition one with social virtue and yet it seem parent will put into the hand of they child ridiculous parody -lrb- perhaps with more ridiculous illustration -rrb- of the poem which stir they own tenderness or filial piety and carry they to make they first acquaintance with great man great work or solemn crisis through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which with its idiotic pun and farcical attitude will remain among they primary association and reduce they throughout they time of studious preparation for life to the moral imbecility of a inward giggle at what might have stimulate they high emulation or feed the fountain of compassion trust and constancy one wonder where these parent have deposit that stock of morally educate stimulus which be to be independent of poetic tradition and to subsist in spite of the finest image be degrade and the finest word of genius be poison as with some befooling drug will fine wit will exquisite humor prosper the more through this turning of all thing indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous laughter a idle craving without sense of flavor on the contrary that delightful power which la bruyère point to -- le ridicule qui est quelque part il faut l' y voir l'en tirer avec grâce et d'une manière qui plaise et qui instruise -- depend on a discrimination only compatible with the varied sensibility which give sympathetic insight and with the justice of perception which be another name for grave knowledge such a result be no more to be expect from faculty on the strain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest incongruity to the most momentous subject than it be to be expect of a sharper watch for gull in a great political assemblage that he will notice the blunder logic of partisan speaker or season he observation with the salt of historical parallel but after all we psychological teaching and in the midst of we zeal for education we be still most of we at the stage of believe that mental power and habit have somehow not perhaps in the general statement but in any particular case a kind of spiritual glaze against condition which we be continually apply to they we soak we child in habit of contempt and exultant gibing and yet be confident that -- as clarissa one day say to I -- we can always teach they to be reverent in the right place you know and doubtless if she be to take she boy to see a burlesque socrate with swollen leg die in the utterance of cockney pun and be to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among they bedroom print she would think this preparation not at all to the prejudice of they emotion on hear they tutor read that narrative of the _ apology _ which have be consecrate by the reverent gratitude of age this be the impoverishment that threaten we posterity : -- a new famine a meager fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof be breathe a moral mildew over the harvest of we human sentiment these be the most delicate element of we too easily perishable civilisation and here again i like to quote a french testimony sainte beuve refer to a time of insurrectionary disturbance say : rien de plus prompt à baisser que la civilisation dans des crisis comme celle-ci on perd en trois semaines le résultat de plusieurs siècles la civilisation la _ vie _ est une choose apprise et inventée qu'on le sache bien : ' _ inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes _ ' les hommes après quelques années de paix oublient trop cette verité : il arrivent à croire que la _ culture _ est choose innée qu'elle est la même choose que la _ nature _ la sauvagerie est toujors là à deux pas et dès qu'on lâche pied elle recommence we have be severely enough teach -lrb- if we be willing to learn -rrb- that we civilisation consider as a splendid material fabric be helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiment or ideal feeling and it be this invisible police which we have need as a community strive to maintain in efficient force how if a dangerous swing be sometimes disguise in a versatile entertainer devote to the amusement of mixed audience and i confess that sometimes when i see a certain style of young lady who check we tender admiration with rouge and henna and all the blazonry of a extravagant expenditure with slang and bold _ brusquerie _ intend to signify she emancipated view of thing and with cynical mockery which she mistake for penetration i be sorely tempt to hiss out _ pétroleuse _ it be a small matter to have we palace set aflame compare with the misery of have we sense of a noble womanhood which be the inspiration of a purify shame the promise of life -- penetrate affection stain and blot out by image of repulsiveness these thing come -- not of higher education but -- of dull ignorance foster into pertness by the greedy vulgarity which reverse peter 's visionary lesson and learn to call all thing common and unclean it come of debase the moral currency the tirynthian accord to a ancient story report by athenaeus become conscious that they trick of laughter at everything and nothing be make they unfit for the conduct of serious affair appeal to the delphic oracle for some means of cure the god prescribe a peculiar form of sacrifice which would be effective if they could carry it through without laugh they do they best but the flimsy joke of a boy upset they unaccustomed gravity and in this way the oracle teach they that even the god could not prescribe a quick cure for a long vitiation or give power and dignity to a people who in a crisis of the public wellbeing be at the mercy of a poor jest xi the wasp credit with the honeycomb no man i imagine would object more strongly than euphorion to communistic principle in relation to material property but with regard to property in idea he entertain such principle willingly and be dispose to treat the distinction between mine and thine in original authorship as egoistic narrowing and low i have know he indeed insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of a ancient a medieval or a eighteenth century writer to be credit with a view or statement lately advance with some show of originality and this championship seem to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead he be evidently unwilling that he neighbor should get more credit than be due to they and in this way he appear to recognize a certain proprietorship even in spiritual production but perhaps it be no real inconsistency that with regard to many instance of modern origination it be he habit to talk with a gallic largeness and refer to the universe : he expatiate on the diffusive nature of intellectual product free and all-embracing as the liberal air on the infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compare with the massive inheritance of think on which every new generation enter on that grow preparation for every epoch through which certain idea or mode of view be say to be in the air and still more metaphorically speak to be inevitably absorb so that every one may be excuse for not know how he get they above all he insist on the proper subordination of the irritable self the mere vehicle of a idea or combination which be produce by the sum total of the human race must belong to that multiple entity from the accomplished lecturer or populariser who transmit it to the remotest generation of fuegian or hottentot however indifferent these may be to the superiority of they right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author one may admit that such consideration carry a profound truth to be even religiously contemplate and yet object all the more to the mode in which euphorion seem to apply they i protest against the use of these majestic conception to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and justify the non-payment of conscious debt which can not be define or enforce by the law especially since it be observable that the large view as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile a able person to the use of lately borrow idea as if they be he own when this spoliation be favor by the public darkness never hinder he from join in the zealous tribute of recognition and applause to those warrior of truth whose triumphal arch be see in the public way those conqueror whose battle and annexation even the carpenter and bricklayer know by name surely the acknowledgment of a mental debt which will not be immediately detect and may never be assert be a case to which the traditional susceptibility to debt of honor would be suitably transfer there be no massive public opinion that can be expect to tell on these relation of thinker and investigator & mdashrelation to be thoroughly understand and feel only by those who be interested in the life of idea and acquaint with they history to lay false claim to a invention or discovery which have a immediate market value to vamp up a professedly new book of reference by steal from the page of one already produce at the cost of much labor and material to copy somebody else 's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine or hand it about among friend as a original effusion to deliver a elegant extract from a known writer as a piece of improvise eloquence : & mdashthese be the limit within which the dishonest pretence of originality be likely to get hiss or hoot and bring more or less shame on the culprit it be not necessary to understand the merit of a performance or even to spell with any comfortable confidence in order to perceive at once that such pretence be not respectable but the difference between these vulgar fraud these device of ridiculous jay whose ill-secured plume be see fall off they as they run and the quiet appropriation of other people 's philosophic or scientific idea can hardly be hold to lie in they moral quality unless we take impunity as we criterion the pitiable jay have no presumption in they favor and foolishly front a alert incredulity but euphorion the accomplished theorist have a audience who expect much of he and take it as the most natural thing in the world that every unusual view which he present anonymously should be due solely to he ingenuity he borrowing be no incongruous feather awkwardly stick on they have a appropriateness which make they seem a answer to anticipation like the return phrase of a melody certainly one can not help the ignorant conclusion of polite society and there be perhaps fashionable person who if a speaker have occasion to explain what the occipat be will consider that he have lately discover that curiously name portion of the animal frame : one can not give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item of fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large class of person who be understand to judge soundly on a small basis of knowledge but euphorion would be very sorry to have it suppose that he be unacquainted with the history of idea and sometimes carry even into minutiae the evidence of he exact registration of name in connection with quotable phrase or suggestion : i can therefore only explain the apparent infirmity of he memory in case of larger conveyance by suppose that he be accustom by the very association of largeness to range they at once under those grand law of the universe in the light of which mine and thine disappear and be resolve into everybody 's or nobody 's and one man 's particular obligation to another melt untraceably into the obligation of the earth to the solar system in general euphorion himself if a particular omission of acknowledgment be bring home to he would probably take a narrower ground of explanation it be a lapse of memory or it do not occur to he as necessary in this case to mention a name the source be well know -- or -lrb- since this seem usually to act as a strong reason for mention -rrb- he rather abstain from adduce the name because it might injure the excellent matter advance just as a obscure trade-mark cast discredit on a good commodity and even on the retailer who have furnish himself from a quarter not likely to be esteem first-rate no doubt this last be a genuine and frequent reason for the non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as well as personal source : even a american editor of school classic whose own english could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of the cheapest sort feel it unfavourable to he reputation for sound learning that he should be oblige to the penny cyclopaedia and disguise he reference to it under contraction in which _ we knowl _ take the place of the low word _ penny _ work of this convenient stamp easily obtain and well nourished with matter be feel to be like rich but unfashionable relation who be visit and receive in privacy and whose capital be use or inherit without any ostentatious insistance on they name and place of abode as to memory it be know that this frail faculty naturally let drop the fact which be less flattering to we self-love -- when it do not retain they carefully as subject not to be approach marshy spot with a warning flag over they but it be always interesting to bring forward eminent name such as patricius or scaliger euler or lagrange bopp or humboldt to know exactly what have be draw from they be erudition and heighten we own influence which seem advantageous to mankind whereas to cite a author whose idea may pass as higher currency under we own signature can have no object except the contradictory one of throw the illumination over he figure when it be important to be see oneself all these reason must weigh considerably with those speculative person who have to ask themselves whether or not universal utilitarianism require that in the particular instance before they they should injure a man who have be of service to they and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which be due to he after all however it must be admit that hardly any accusation be more difficult to prove and more liable to be false than that of a plagiarism which be the conscious theft of idea and deliberate reproduction of they as original the argument on the side of acquittal be obvious and strong : -- the inevitable coincidence of contemporary thinking and we continual experience of find notion turn up in we mind without any label on they to tell we whence they come so that if we be in the habit of expect much from we own capacity we accept they at once as a new inspiration then in relation to the elder author there be the difficulty first of learning and then of remember exactly what have be work into the backward tapestry of the world 's history together with the fact that idea acquire long ago reappear as the sequence of a awaken interest or a line of inquiry which be really new in we whence it be conceivable that if we be ancient some of we might be offer grateful hecatomb by mistake and prove we honesty in a ruinously expensive manner on the other hand the evidence on which plagiarism be conclude be often of a kind which though much trust in question of erudition and historical criticism be apt to lead we injuriously astray in we daily judgment especially of the resentful condemnatory sort how pythagora come by he idea whether st paul be acquaint with all the greek poet what tacitus must have know by hearsay and systematically ignore be point on which a false persuasion of knowledge be less damaging to justice and charity than a erroneous confidence support by reasoning fundamentally similar of my neighbor 's blameworthy behavior in a case where i be personally concern no premiss require closer scrutiny than those which lead to the constantly echo conclusion he must have know or he must have read i marvel that this facility of belief on the side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the easiest of all thing to the human mind be _ not _ to know and _ not _ to read to praise to blame to shout grin or hiss where other shout grin or hiss -- these be native tendency but to know and to read be artificial hard accomplishment concern which the only safe supposition be that as little of they have be do as the case admit a author keenly conscious of have write can hardly help imagine he condition of lively interest to be share by other just as we be all apt to suppose that the chill or heat we be conscious of must be general or even to think that we son and daughter we pet scheme and we quarrel correspondence be theme to which intelligent person will listen long without weariness but if the ardent author happen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide the larger part of the enlighten public into those who have not read he and think it necessary to tell he so when they meet he in polite society and those who have equally abstain from read he but wish to conceal this negation and speak of he incomparable work with that trust in testimony which always have its cheer side hence it be worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicion of plagiarism still more to give they voice when they be found on a construction of probability which a little more attention to everyday occurrence as a guide in reasoning would show we to be really worthless consider as proof the length to which one man 's memory can go in let drop association that be vital to another can hardly find a limit it be not to be suppose that a person desirous to make a agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you with some rhetorical sharpness on a argument which you be the first to elaborate in public yet any one who listen may overhear such instance of obliviousness you naturally remember you peculiar connection with you acquaintance 's judicious view but why should _ he _ you fatherhood which be a intense feeling to you be only a additional fact of meager interest for he to remember and a sense of obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who have help we in we thinking be not yet a form of memory the want of which be feel to be disgraceful or derogatory unless it be take to be a want of polite instruction or cause the miss of a cockade on a day of celebration in we suspicion of plagiarism we must recognize as the first weighty probability that what we who feel injured remember best be precisely what be least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of we neighbor but it be fair to maintain that the neighbor who borrow you property lose it for a while and when it turn up again forget you connection with it and count it he own show himself so much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind some absent person can not remember the state of wear in they own hat and umbrella and have no mental check to tell they that they have carry home a fellow-visitor 's more recent purchase : they may be excellent householder far remove from the suspicion of low device but one wish they a more correct perception and a more wary sense that a neighbor umbrella may be newer than they own true some person be so constitute that the very excellence of a idea seem to they a convincing reason that it must be if not solely yet especially theirs it fit in so beautifully with they general wisdom it lie implicitly in so many of they manifest opinion that if they have not yet express it -lrb- because of preoccupation -rrb- it be clearly a part of they indigenous produce and be prove by they immediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and appropriately to they than to the person who seem first to have alight on it and who sink in they all-originating consciousness to that low kind of entity a second cause this be not lunacy nor pretence but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice and often carry the public with it so that the poor columbus be find to be a very faulty adventurer and the continent be name after amerigo lighter example of this instinctive appropriation be constantly meet with among brilliant talker aquilum be too agreeable and amusing for any one who be not himself bent on display to be angry at he conversational rapine -- he habit of dart down on every morsel of booty that other bird may hold in they beak with a innocent air as if it be all intend for he use and honestly count on by he as a tribute in kind hardly any man i imagine can have have less trouble in gather a showy stock of information than aquilum on close inquiry you would probably find that he have not read one epoch-making book of modern time for he have a career which oblige he to much correspondence and other official work and he be too fond of be in company to spend he leisure moment in study but to he quick eye ear and tongue a few predatory excursion in conversation where there be instruct person gradually furnish surprisingly clever mode of statement and allusion on the dominant topic when he first adopt a subject he necessarily fall into mistake and it be interesting to watch he gradual progress into fuller information and better nourished irony without he ever need to admit that he have make a blunder or to appear conscious of correction suppose for example he have incautiously found some ingenious remark on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteen make a hundred and two and the insignificant bantam hitherto silent seem to spoil the flow of idea by state that the product could not be take as less than a hundred and seventeen aquilum would glide on in the most graceful manner from a repetition of he previous remark to the continuation -- all this be on the supposition that a hundred and two be all that could be get out of nine thirteen but as all the world know that nine thirteen will yield & c -- proceed straightway into a new train of ingenious consequence and cause bantam to be regard by all present as one of those slow person who take irony for ignorance and who would warn the weasel to keep awake how should a small-eyed feebly crow mortal like he be quicker in arithmetic than the keen-faced forcible aquilum in whom universal knowledge be easily credible look into closely the conclusion from a man 's profile voice and fluency to he certainty in multiplication beyond the twelve seem to show a confused notion of the way in which very common thing be connect but it be on such false correlation that man find half they inference about each other and high place of trust may sometimes be hold on no better foundation it be a commonplace that word writings measure and performance in general have quality assign they not by a direct judgment on the performance themselves but by a presumption of what they be likely to be consider who be the performer we all notice in we neighbor this reference to name as guide in criticism and all furnish illustration of it in we own practice for check ourselves as we will the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a previous attitude of mind and this will constantly be determine by the influence of a name but that we prior confidence or want of confidence in give name be make up of judgment just as hollow as the consequent praise or blame they be take to warrant be less commonly perceive though there be a conspicuous indication of it in the surprise or disappointment often manifest in the disclosure of a authorship about which everybody have be make wrong guess no doubt if it have be discover who write the ` vestige ' many a ingenious structure of probability would have be spoil and some disgust might have be feel for a real author who make comparatively so shabby a appearance of likelihood it be this foolish trust in prepossession found on spurious evidence which make a medium of encouragement for those who happen to have the ear of the public give other people 's idea the advantage of appear under they own well-received name while any remonstrance from the real producer become a each person who have pay complimentary tribute in the wrong place hardly any kind of false reasoning be more ludicrous than this on the probability of origination it would be amusing to catechise the guesser as to they exact reason for think they guess likely : why hoopoe of john 's have fix on toucan of magdalen why shrike attribute its peculiar style to buzzard who have not hitherto be know as a writer why the fair columba think it must belong to the reverend merulum and why they be all alike disturb in they previous judgment of its value by find that it really come from skunk whom they have either not thought of at all or think of as belong to a species exclude by the nature of the case clearly they be all wrong in they notion of the specific condition which lay unexpectedly in the small skunk and in he alone -- in spite of he education nobody know where in spite of somebody 's know he uncle and cousin and in spite of nobody 's know that he be cleverer than they think he such guess remind one of a fabulist 's imaginary council of animal assemble to consider what sort of creature have construct a honeycomb find and much taste by bruin and other epicure the speaker all start from the probability that the maker be a bird because this be the quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expect for the animal at that time know little of they own history would have reject as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be make by a fish and as to the insect they be not willingly receive in society and they way be little known several complimentary presumption be express that the honeycomb be due to one or the other admire and popular bird and there be much flutter on the part of the nightingale and swallow neither of whom give a positive denial they confusion perhaps extend to they sense of identity but the owl hiss at this folly argue from he particular knowledge that the animal which produce honey must be the musk-rat the wondrous nature of whose secretion require no proof and in the powerful logical procedure of the owl from musk to honey be but a step some disturbance arise hereupon for the musk-rat begin to make himself obtrusive believe in the owl 's opinion of he power and feeling that he could have produce the honey if he have think of it until a experimental butcher-bird propose to anatomise he as a help to decision the hubbub increase the opponent of the musk-rat inquire who he ancestor be until a diversion be create by a able discourse of the macaw on structure generally which he classify so as to include the honeycomb enter into so much admirable exposition that there be a prevalent sense of the honeycomb have probably be produce by one who understand it so well but bruin who have probably eat too much to listen with edification grumble in he low kind of language that fine word butter no parsnip by which he mean to say that there be no new honey forthcoming perhaps the audience generally be begin to tire when the fox enter with he snout dreadfully swollen and report that the beneficent originator in question be the wasp which he have find much smear with undoubted honey have apply he nose to it -- whence indeed the able insect perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem a sign of scepticism have sting he with some severity a infliction reynard could hardly regret since the swell of a snout normally so delicate would corroborate he statement and satisfy the assembly that he have really find the honey-creating genius the fox 's admit acuteness combine with the visible swell be take as undeniable evidence and the revelation undoubtedly meet a general desire for information on a point of interest nevertheless there be a murmur the reverse of delighted and the feeling of some eminent animal be too strong for they : the orang-outang 's jaw drop so as seriously to impair the vigor of he expression the edifying pelican scream and flap she wing the owl hiss again the macaw become loudly incoherent and the gibbon give he hysterical laugh while the hyaena after indulge in a more splenetic guffaw agitate the question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair instead of give public recognition to a insect whose produce it be now plain have be much overestimate but this narrow-spirited motion be negative by the sweet-toothed majority a complimentary deputation to the wasp be resolve on and there be a confident hope that this diplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey xii so young ganymede be once a girlishly handsome precocious youth that one can not for any considerable number of year go on be youthful girlishly handsome and precocious seem on consideration to be a statement as worthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion socrate be mortal but many circumstance have conspire to keep up in ganymede the illusion that he be surprisingly young he be the last bear of he family and from he earliest memory be accustom to be commend as such to the care of he elder brother and sister : he hear he mother speak of he as she youngest darling with a loving pathos in she tone which naturally suffuse he own view of himself and give he the habitual consciousness of be at once very young and very interesting then the disclosure of he tender year be a constant matter of astonishment to stranger who have have proof of he precocious talent and the astonishment extend to what be call the world at large when he produce ' a comparative estimate of european nation ' before he be well out of he teens all comer on a first interview tell he that he be marvellously young and some repeat the statement each time they see he all critic who write about he call attention to the same ground for wonder : he deficiency and excess be alike to be account for by the flattering fact of he youth and he youth be the golden background which set off he many-hued endowment here be already enough to establish a strong association between he sense of identity and he sense of be unusually young but after this he devise and found a ingenious organization for consolidate the literary interest of all the four continent -lrb- subsequently include australasium and polynesium -rrb- he himself preside in the central office which thus become a new theater for the constantly repeat situation of a astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming administrator find to be remarkably young if we imagine with due charity the effect on ganymede we shall think it greatly to he credit that he continue to feel the necessity of be something more than young and do not sink by rapid degree into a parallel of that melancholy object a superannuated youthful phenomenon happily he have enough of valid active faculty to save he from that tragic fate he have not exhaust he fountain of eloquent opinion in he ` comparative estimate ' so as to feel himself like some other juvenile celebrity the sad survivor of he own manifest destiny or like one who have rise too early in the morning and find all the solid day turn into a fatigued afternoon he have continue to be productive both of scheme and writings be perhaps help by the fact that he ` comparative estimate ' do not greatly affect the current of european thought and leave he with the stimulate hope that he have not do he best but might yet produce what would make he youth more surprising than ever i see something of he through he antinoüs period the time of rich chesnut lock part not by a visible white line but by a shadowed furrow from which they fall in massive ripple to right and leave in these slim day he look the younger for be rather below the middle size and though at last one perceive he contract a indefinable air of self-consciousness a slight exaggeration of the facial movement the attitude the little trick and the romance in shirt-collar which must be expect from one who in spite of he knowledge be so exceedingly young it be impossible to say that he be make any great mistake about himself he be only undergo one form of a common moral disease : be strongly mirror for himself in the remark of other he be get to see he real characteristic as a dramatic part a type to which he doings be always in correspondence owe to my absence on travel and to other cause i have lose sight of he for several year but such a separation between two who have not miss each other seem in this busy century only a pleasant reason when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed haunt for the one who have stay at home to be more communicative about himself than he can well be to those who have all along be in he neighborhood he have marry in the interval and as if to keep up he surprising youthfulness in all relation he have take a wife considerably older than himself it would probably have seem to he a disturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to he should have be younger than he except he own child who however young would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the youthfulness of they father and if my glance have reveal my impression on first see he again he might have receive a rather disagreeable shock which be far from my intention my mind have retain a very exact image of he former appearance take note of unmistakeable change such as a painter would certainly not have make by way of flattering he subject he have lose he slimness and that curved solidity which might have adorn a taller man be a rather sarcastic threat to he short figure the english branch of the teutonic race do not produce many fat youth and i have even hear a american lady say that she be much disappointed at the moderate number and size of we fat man consider they reputation in the united state hence a stranger would now have be apt to remark that ganymede be unusually plump for a distinguished writer rather than unusually young but how be he to know this many long-standing prepossession be as hard to be correct as a long-standing mispronunciation against which the direct experience of eye and ear be often powerless and i could perceive that ganymede 's inwrought sense of he surprising youthfulness have be stronger than the superficial reckoning of he year and the merely optical phenomenon of the looking-glass he now hold a post under government and not only see like most subordinate functionary how ill everything be manage but also what be the change that a high constructive ability would dictate and in mention to I he own speech and other effort towards propagate reformatory view in he department he conclude by change he tone to a sentimental head voice and say -- but i be so young people object to any prominence on my part i can only get myself hear anonymously and when some attention have be draw the name be sure to creep out the writer be know to be young and thing be none the forwarder well say i youth seem the only drawback that be sure to diminish you and i have seven year less of it than when we last meet ah return ganymede as lightly as possible at the same time cast a observant glance over I as if he be mark the effect of seven year on a person who have probably begin life with a old look and even as a infant have give he countenance to that significant doctrine the transmigration of ancient soul into modern body i leave he on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that he illusion would be suddenly or painfully break up i see that he be well victualled and defend against a ten year ' siege from ruthless fact and in the course of time observation convinced I that he resistance receive considerable aid from without each of he written production as it come out be still comment on as the work of a very young man one critic finding that he want solidity charitably refer to he youth as a excuse another dazzle by he brilliancy seem to regard he youth as so wondrous that all other author appear decrepit by comparison and they style such as might be look for from gentleman of the old school able pen -lrb- accord to a familiar metaphor -rrb- appear to shake they head good-humouredly imply that ganymede 's crudity be pardonable in one so exceedingly young such unanimity amid diversity which a distant posterity might take for evidence that on the point of age at least there could have be no mistake be not really more difficult to account for than the prevalence of cotton in we fabric ganymede have be first introduce into the write world as remarkably young and it be no exceptional consequence that the first deposit of information about he hold its ground against fact which however open to observation be not necessarily think of it be not so easy with we rate and tax and need for economy in all direction to cast away a epithet or remark that turn up cheaply and to go in expensive search after more genuine substitute there be high homeric precedent for keep fast hold of a epithet under all change of circumstance and so the precocious author of the ` comparative estimate ' hear the echo repeat young ganymede when a illiterate beholder at a railway station would have give he forty year at least besides important elder sachem of the club and public meeting have a genuine opinion of he as young enough to be check for speech on subject which they have speak mistakenly about when he be in he cradle and then the midway parting of he crisp hair not common among english committee-man form a presumption against the ripeness of he judgment which nothing but a speedy baldness could have remove it be but fair to mention all these outward confirmation of ganymede 's illusion which show no sign of leave he it be true that he no longer hear expression of surprise at he youthfulness on a first introduction to a admiring reader but this sort of external evidence have become a unnecessary crutch to he habitual inward persuasion he manners he costume he supposition of the impression he make on other have all they former correspondence with the dramatic part of the young genius as to the incongruity of he contour and other little accident of physique he be probably no more aware that they will affect other as incongruity than armida be conscious how much she rouge provoke we notice of she wrinkle and cause we to mention sarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with affectionate reverence but let we be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcomb as well as old-young coquette xiii how we come to give ourselves false testimonial and believe in they it be my way when i observe any instance of folly any queer habit any absurd illusion straightway to look for something of the same type in myself feel sure that amid all difference there will be a certain correspondence just as there be more or less correspondence in the natural history even of continent widely apart and of island in opposite zone no doubt man 's mind differ in what we may call they climate or share of solar energy and a feeling or tendency which be comparable to a panther in one may have no more impose aspect than that of a weasel in another : some be like a tropical habitat in which the very ferns cast a mighty shadow and the grass be a dry ocean in which a hunter may be submerge other like the chilly latitudes in which you forest-tree fit elsewhere to prop a mine be a pretty miniature suitable for fancy pot the eccentric man might

among the polynesian isle we precious guide comparison would teach we in the first place by likeness and we clue to further knowledge would be resemblance to what we already know hence have a keen interest in the natural history of my inward self i pursue this plan i have mention of use my observation as a clue or lantern by which i detect small herbage or lurk life or i take my neighbor in he least become trick or effort as a opportunity for luminous deduction concern the figure the human genus make in the specimen which i myself furnish introspection which start with the purpose of find out one 's own absurdity be not likely to be very mischievous yet of course it be not free from danger any more than breathing be or the other function that keep we alive and active to judge of other by oneself be in its most innocent mean the briefest expression for we only method of know mankind yet we perceive it have come to mean in many case either the vulgar mistake which reduce every man 's value to the very low figure at which the valuer himself happen to stand or else the amiable illusion of the higher nature mislead by a too generous construction of the lower one can not give a recipe for wise judgment : it resemble appropriate muscular action which be attain by the myriad lesson in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can give the danger of the inverse procedure judge of self by what one observe in other if it be carry on with much impartiality and keenness of discernment be that it have a laming effect enfeeble the energy of indignation and scorn which be the proper scourge of wrong-doing and meanness and which should continually feed the wholesome restrain power of public opinion i respect the horsewhip when apply to the back of cruelty and think that he who apply it be a more perfect human being because he outleap of indignation be not check by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt -- a more perfect human being because he more completely incorporate the best social life of the race which can never be constitute by idea that nullify action this be the essence of dante 's sentiment -lrb- it be painful to think that he apply it very cruelly -rrb- -- e cortesia fù lui esser villano -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- and it be undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one 's kinship with all frailty and vice undermine the active heroism which battle against wrong but certainly nature have take care that this danger should not at present be very threatening one could not fairly describe the generality of one 's neighbor as too lucidly aware of manifest in they own person the weakness which they observe in the rest of she majesty 's subject on the contrary a hasty conclusion as to scheme of providence might lead to the supposition that one man be intend to correct another by be most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick which he himself possess doubtless philosopher will be able to explain how it must necessarily be so but pend the full extension of the _ à priori _ method which will show that only blockhead could expect anything to be otherwise it do seem surprising that heloisa should be disgust at laura 's attempt to disguise she age attempt which she recognize so thoroughly because they enter into she own practice that semper who often respond at public dinner and propose resolution on platform though he have a try gestation of every speech and a bad time for himself and other at every delivery should yet remark pitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in ubique that aliqui who let no attack on himself pass unnoticed and for every handful of gravel against he window send a stone in reply should deplore the ill-advised retort of quispiam who do not perceive that to show oneself angry with a adversary be to gratify he to be unaware of we own little trick of manner or we own mental blemish and excess be a comprehensible unconsciousness the puzzling fact be that people should apparently take no account of they deliberate action and should expect they to be equally ignore by other it be a inversion of the accept order : _ there _ it be the phrase that be official and the conduct or privately manifest sentiment that be take to be real _ here _ it seem that the practice be take to be official and entirely nullify by the verbal representation which contradict it the thief make a vow to heaven of full restitution and whisper some reservation expect to cheat omniscience by a aside be hardly more ludicrous than the many lady and gentleman who have more belief and expect other to have it in they own statement about they habitual doings than in the contradictory fact which be patent in the daylight one reason of the absurdity be that we be lead by a tradition about ourselves so that long after a man have practically depart from a rule or principle he continue innocently to state it as a true description of he practice -- just as he have a long tradition that he be not a old gentleman and be startle when he be seventy at overhear himself call by a epithet which he have only apply to other -lrb- footnote 1 : inferno xxxii 150 -rrb- a person with you tendency of constitution should take as little sugar as possible say pilulus to bovi somewhere in the darker decade of this century it have make a great difference to avis since he take my advice in that matter : he use to consume half a pound a-day god bless I cry bovi i take very little sugar myself twenty-six large lump every day of you life mr bovi say he wife no such thing exclaim bovi you drop they into you tea coffee and whisky yourself my dear and i count they nonsense laugh bovi turn to pilulus that they may exchange a glance of mutual amusement at a woman 's inaccuracy but she happen to be right bovi have never say inwardly that he would take a large allowance of sugar and he have the tradition about himself that he be a man of the most moderate habit hence with this conviction he be naturally disgust at the saccharine excess of avis i have sometimes think that this facility of man in believe that they be still what they once mean to be -- this undisturbed appropriation of a traditional character which be often but a melancholy relic of early resolution like the worn and soil testimonial to soberness and honesty carry in the pocket of a tippler whom the need of a dram have drive into peculation -- may sometimes diminish the turpitude of what seem a flat barefaced falsehood it be notorious that a man may go on utter false assertion about he own act till he at last believe in they : be it not possible that sometimes in the very first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief a reproduction of a traditional self which be cling to against all evidence there be no know all the disguise of the lie serpent when we come to examine in detail what be the sane mind in the sane body the final test of completeness seem to be a security of distinction between what we have profess and what we have do what we have aim at and what we have achieve what we have invent and what we have witness or have evidence to we what we think and feel in the present and what we think and feel in the past i know that there be a common prejudice which regard the habitual confusion of _ now _ and _ then _ of _ it be _ and _ it be _ of _ it seem so _ and _ i should like it to be so _ as a mark of high imaginative endowment while the power of precise statement and description be rate lower as the attitude of a everyday prosaic mind high imagination be often assign or claim as if it be a ready activity in fabricate extravagance such as be present by fevered dream or as if its possessor be in that state of inability to give credible testimony which would warrant they exclusion from the class of acceptable witness in a court of justice so that a creative genius might fairly be subject to the disability which some law have stamp on dicer slave and other class whose position be hold pervert to they sense of social responsibility this endowment of mental confusion be often boast of by person whose imaginativeness would not otherwise be know unless it be by the slow process of detect that they description and narrative be not to be trust callista be always ready to testify of herself that she be a imaginative person and sometimes add in illustration that if she have take a walk and see a old heap of stone on she way the account she would give on return would include many please particulars of she own invention transform the simple heap into a interesting castellated ruin this creative freedom be all very well in the right place but before i can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power i must inquire whether on be request to give a precise description of what she see she would be able to cast aside she arbitrary combination and recover the object she really perceive so as to make they recognisable by another person who pass the same way otherwise she glorifying imagination be not a addition to the fundamental power of strong discerning perception but a cheaper substitute and in fact i find on listen to callista 's conversation that she have a very lax conception even of common object and a equally lax memory of event it seem of no consequence to she whether she shall say that a stone be overgrow with moss or with lichen that a building be of sandstone or of granite that meliboeus once forget to put on he cravat or that he always appear without it that everybody say so or that one stock-broker 's wife say so yesterday that philemon praise euphemia up to the sky or that he deny know any particular evil of she she be one of those respectable witness who would testify to the exact moment of a apparition because any desirable moment will be as exact as another to she remembrance or who would be the most worthy to witness the action of spirit on slate and table because the action of limb would not probably arrest she attention she would describe the surprising phenomenon exhibit by the powerful medium with the same freedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stone she suppose imaginativeness be simply a very usual lack of discriminate perception accompany with a less usual activity of misrepresentation which if it have be a little more intense or have be stimulate by circumstance might have make she a profuse writer unchecked by the troublesome need of veracity these characteristic be the very opposite of such as yield a fine imagination which be always base on a keen vision a keen consciousness of what _ be _ and carry the store of definite knowledge as material for the construction of its inward vision witness dante who be at once the most precise and homely in he reproduction of actual object and the most soaringly at large in he imaginative combination on a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and rapid development in description of person and event which be light up by humorous intention in the speaker -- we distinguish this charming play of intelligence which resemble musical improvisation on a give motive where the farthest sweep of curve be loop into relevancy by a instinctive method from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration which be really something commoner than the correct simplicity often depreciate as prosaic even if high imagination be to be identify with illusion there would be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of illusion which be inform by industrious submissive observation and the trumpery stage-property illusion which depend on the ill-defined impression gather by capricious inclination as there be between a good and a bad picture of the last judgment in both these the subject be a combination never actually witness and in the good picture the general combination may be of surpass boldness but on examination it be see that the separate element have be closely study from real object and even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong drawing and fantastic color the charm be dependent on the selective sensibility of the painter to certain real delicacy of form which confer the expression he long to render for apart from this basis of a effect perceive in common there could be no conveyance of aesthetic meaning by the painter to the beholder in this sense it be as true to say of fra angelico 's coronation of the virgin that it have a strain of reality as to say so of a portrait by rembrandt which also have its strain of ideal elevation due to rembrandt 's virile selective sensibility to correct such self-flatterer as callista it be worth repeat that powerful imagination be not false outward vision but intense inward representation and a creative energy constantly feed by susceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience which it reproduce and construct in fresh and fresh whole not the habitual confusion of provable fact with the fiction of fancy and transient inclination but a breadth of ideal association which inform every material object every incidental fact with far-reaching memory and store residue of passion bring into new light the less obvious relation of human existence the illusion to which it be liable be not that of habitually take duck-pond for lilied pool but of be more or less transiently and in vary degree so absorb in ideal vision as to lose the consciousness of surround object or occurrence and when that rapt condition be past the sane genius discriminate clearly between what have be give in this parenthetic state of excitement and what he have know and may count on in the ordinary world of experience dante seem to have express these condition perfectly in that passage of the _ purgatorio _ where after a triple vision which have make he forget he surroundings he say -- quando l'anima mium tornò di fuori alle cose che son fuor di lei vere io riconobbi i miei non falsus errorus -- -lrb- c xv -rrb- he distinguish the ideal truth of he entranced vision from the series of external fact to which he consciousness have return isaiah give we the date of he vision in the temple -- the year that king uzziah die -- and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraph be present with he as he tread the street he doubtless know they for image of memory and do not cry look to the passer-by certainly the seer whether prophet philosopher scientific discoverer or poet may happen to be rather mad : he power may have be use up like don quixote 's in they visionary or theoretic construction so that the report of common-sense fail to affect he or the continuous strain of excitement may have rob he mind of its elasticity it be hard for we frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with steady gait and full alacrity of perception but he be the strongest seer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that sanity of expectation which consist in distinguish as dante do between the _ cose che son vere _ outside the individual mind and the _ non falsus errorus _ which be the revelation of true imaginative power xiv the too ready writer one who talk too much hinder the rest of the company from take they turn and apparently see no reason why they should not rather desire to know he opinion or experience in relation to all subject or at least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no figure have never be praise for this industrious monopoly of work which other would willingly have share in however various and brilliant he talk may be we suspect he of impoverish we by exclude the contribution of other mind which attract we curiosity the more because he have shut they up in silence besides we get tire of a manner in conversation as in painting when one theme after another be treat with the same line and touch i begin with a liking for a estimable master but by the time he have stretch he interpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery i have have what the cautious scotch mind would call enough of he there be monotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity what come to I from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment of any single interpreter on this ground even a modest person without power or will to shine in the conversation may easily find the predominate talker a nuisance while those who be full of matter on special topic be continually detect miserably thin place in the web of that information which he will not desist from impart nobody that i know of ever propose a testimonial to a man for thus volunteer the whole expense of the conversation why be there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer who play much the same part in literature as the excessive talker play in what be traditionally call conversation the busy adrastus whose professional engagement might seem more than enough for the nervous energy of one man and who yet find time to print essay on the chief current subject from the tri-lingual inscription or the idea of the infinite among the prehistoric lapp to the colorado beetle and the grape disease in the south of france be generally praise if not admire for the breadth of he mental range and he gigantic power of work poor theron who have some original idea on a subject to which he have give year of research and meditation have be wait anxiously from month to month to see whether he condensed exposition will find a place in the next advertised program but see it on the contrary regularly exclude and twice the space he ask for fill with the copious brew of adrastus whose name carry custom like a celebrated trade-mark why should the eager haste to tell what he think on the shortest notice as if he opinion be a need preliminary to discussion get a man the reputation of be a conceited bear in conversation when nobody blame the same tendency if it show itself in print the excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time and there be the comfort of think that everywhere else other fellow-citizen who have something to say may get a chance of deliver themselves but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over it the more or less agreeable flavor of he mind in four medium at once and on subject take from the four wind such restless and versatile occupant of literary space and time should have live earlier when the world want summary of all extant knowledge and this knowledge be small there be the more room for commentary and conjecture they might have play the part of a isidor of seville or a vincent of beauvai brilliantly and the willingness to write everything themselves would have be strictly in place in the present day the busy retailer of other people 's knowledge which he have spoil in the handle the restless guesser and commentator the importunate hawker of undesirable superfluity the everlasting word-compeller who rise early in the morning to praise what the world have already glorified or make himself haggard at night in write out he dissent from what nobody ever believe be not simply gratis anhelans multa agendo nihil agen -- he be a obstruction like a incompetent architect with too much interest at he back he obtrude he ill-considered work where place ought to have be leave to better man be it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about mix we own flavor as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg with that of every great writer and every great subject -- especially when we flavor be all we have to give the matter or knowledge have be already give by somebody else what if we be only like the spanish wine-skin which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the spanish grape have naturally a taste of leather one could wish that even the greatest mind should leave some theme unhandled or at least leave we no more than a paragraph or two on they to show how well they do in not be more lengthy such entertainment of scruple can hardly be expect from the young but happily they readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of mankind be not encourage by easy publicity in the vivacious pepin i have often see the image of my early youth when it seem to I astonishing that the philosopher have leave so many difficulty unsolved and that so many great theme have raise no great poet to treat they i have a elated sense that i should find my brain full of theoretic clue when i look for they and that wherever a poet have not do what i expect it be for want of my insight not know what have be say about the play of romeo and juliet i feel myself capable of write something original on its blemish and beauty in relation to all subject i have a joyous consciousness of that ability which be prior to knowledge and of only need to apply myself in order to master any task -- to conciliate philosopher whose system be at present but dimly know to I to estimate foreign poet whom i have not yet read to show up mistake in a historical monograph that rouse my interest in a epoch which i have be hitherto ignorant of when i should once have have time to verify my view of probability by look into a encyclopedia so pepin save only that he be industrious while i be idle like the astronomer in rassela i sway the universe in my consciousness without make any difference outside I whereas pepin while feel himself powerful with the star in they course really raise some dust here below he be no longer in he spring-tide but have be always busy he have be oblige to use he first impression as if they be deliberate opinion and to range himself on the corresponding side in ignorance of much that he commit himself to so that he retain some characteristic of a comparatively tender age and among they a certain surprise that there have not be more person equal to himself perhaps it be unfortunate for he that he early gain a hearing or at least a place in print and be thus encourage in acquire a fix habit of write to the exclusion of any other bread-winning pursuit he be already to be class as a general writer correspond to the comprehensive want of the general reader and with this industry on he hand it be not enough for he to keep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth : he find himself under a obligation to be skilled in various method of seem to know and have habitually express himself before he be convince he interest in all subject be chiefly to ascertain that he have not make a mistake and to feel he infallibility confirm that impulse to decide that vague sense of be able to achieve the unattempted that dream of aerial unlimited movement at will without foot or wing which be once but the joyous mount of young sap be already take shape as unalterable woody fiber : the impulse have harden into style and into a pattern of peremptory sentence the sense of ability in the presence of other man 's failure be turn into the official arrogance of one who habitually issue direction which he have never himself be call on to execute the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling have take on a fatal sort of reality in write pretension which carry consequence he be on the way to become like the loud-buzzing bounce bombus who combine conceited illusion enough to supply several patient in a lunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various form of print if one who take himself for the telegraphic center of all american wire be to be confine as unfit to transact affair what shall we say to the man who believe himself in possession of the unexpressed motive and design dwelling in the breast of all sovereign and all politician and i grieve to think that poor pepin though less political may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more sane for he be begin to explain people 's write by what he do not know about they yet he be once at the comparatively innocent stage which i have confess to be that of my own early astonishment at my powerful originality and copy the just humility of the old puritan i may say but for the grace of discouragement this coxcombry might have be mine pepin make for himself a necessity of write -lrb- and get print -rrb- before he have consider whether he have the knowledge or belief that would furnish eligible matter at first perhaps the necessity gall he a little but it be now as easily bear nay be as irrepressible a habit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk he be gradually be condemn to have no genuine impression no direct consciousness of enjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what be before he : he perception be continually arrange themselves in form suitable to a print judgment and hence they will often turn out to be as much to the purpose if they be write without any direct contemplation of the object and be guide by a few external condition which serve to classify it for he in this way he be irrevocably lose the faculty of accurate mental vision : have bind himself to express judgment which will satisfy some other demand than that of veracity he have blunt he perception by continual preoccupation we can not command veracity at will : the power of see and report truly be a form of health that have to be delicately guard and as a ancient rabbi have solemnly say the penalty of untruth be untruth but pepin be only a mild example of the fact that incessant write with a view to printing carry internal consequence which have often the nature of disease and however unpractical it may be hold to consider whether we have anything to print which it be good for the world to read or which have not be better say before it will perhaps be allow to be worth consider what effect the printing may have on ourselves clearly there be a sort of write which help to keep the writer in a ridiculously contented ignorance raise in he continually the sense of have deliver himself effectively so that the acquirement of more thorough knowledge seem as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a past occasion he have invest he vanity -lrb- perhaps he hope of income -rrb- in he own shallowness and mistake and must desire they prosperity like the professional prophet he learn to be glad of the harm that keep up he credit and to be sorry for the good that contradict he it be hard enough for any of we amid the change wind of fortune and the hurly-burly of event to keep quite clear of a gladness which be another 's calamity but one may choose not to enter on a course which will turn such gladness into a fix habit of mind commit ourselves to be continually pleased that other should appear to be wrong in order that we may have the air of be right in some case perhaps it might be urge that pepin have remain the more self-contented because he have _ not _ write everything he believe himself capable of he once ask I to read a sort of program of the species of romance which he should think it worth while to write -- a species which he contrast in strong term with the production of illustrious but overrated author in this branch pepin 's romance be to present the splendor of the roman empire at the culmination of its grandeur when decadence be spiritually but not visibly imminent : it be to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and exalted of human circumstance the design of statesman the interfusion of philosophy the rural relaxation and converse of immortal poet the majestic triumph of warrior the mingling of the quaint and sublime in religious ceremony the gorgeous delirium of gladiatorial show and under all the secretly work leaven of christianity such a romance would not call the attention of society to the dialect of stable-boy the low habit of rustic the vulgarity of small schoolmaster the manners of man in livery or to any other form of uneducated talk and sentiment : its character would have virtue and vice alike on the grand scale and would express themselves in a english represent the discourse of the most powerful mind in the best latin or possibly greek when there occur a scene with a greek philosopher on a visit to rome or resident there as a teacher in this way pepin would do in fiction what have never be do before : something not at all like ` rienzus ' or ` notre dame de paris ' or any other attempt of that kind but something at once more penetrate and more magnificent more passionate and more philosophical more panoramic yet more select : something that would present a conception of a gigantic period in short something truly roman and world-historical when pepin give I this program to read he be much younger than at present some slight success in another vein divert he from the production of panoramic and select romance and the experience of not have try to carry out he program have naturally make he more bite and sarcastic on the failure of those who have actually write romance without apparently have have a glimpse of a conception equal to he indeed i be often compare he rather touchingly inflated _ naïveté _ as of a small young person walk on tiptoe while he be talk of elevated thing at the time when he feel himself the author of that unwritten romance with he present epigrammatic curtness and affectation of power keep strictly in reserve he paragraph now seem to have a bitter smile in they from the consciousness of a mind too penetrate to accept any other man 's idea and too equally competent in all direction to seclude he power in any one form of creation but rather fit to hang over they all as a lamp of guidance to the stumbler below you perceive how proud he be of not be indebted to any writer : even with the dead he be on the creditor 's side for he be do they the service of let the world know what they mean better than those poor pre-pepinian themselves have any means of do and he treat the mighty shades very cavalierly be this fellow -- citizen of ours consider simply in the light of a baptised christian and tax-paying englishman really as madly conceit as empty of reverential feeling as unveracious and careless of justice as full of catch-penny device and stagey attitudinising as on examination he writing show itself to be by no means he have arrive at he present pass in the literary call through the self-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the impression of superior knowledge and ability he be much worthier and more admirable than he written production because the moral aspect exhibit in he write be feel to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the personal relation of life in blame pepin 's write we be accuse the public conscience which be so lax and ill inform on the momentous bearing of authorship that it sanction the total absence of scruple in undertaking and prosecute what should be the best warrant of vocation hence i still accept friendly relation with pepin for he have much private amiability and though he probably think of I as a man of slender talent without rapidity of _ coup d'oeil _ and with no compensatory penetration he meet I very cordially and would not i be sure willingly pain I in conversation by crudely declare he low estimate of my capacity yet i have often known he to insult my betters and contribute -lrb- perhaps unreflectingly -rrb- to encourage injurious conception of they -- but that be do in the course of he professional writing and the public conscience still leave such write nearly on the level of the merry-andrew 's dress which permit a impudent deportment and extraordinary gambol to one who in he ordinary clothing show himself the decent father of a family xv disease of small authorship particular calling it be know encourage particular disease there be a painter 's colic : the sheffield grinder fall a victim to the inhalation of steel dust : clergyman so often have a certain kind of sore throat that this otherwise secular ailment get name after they and perhaps if we be to inquire we should find a similar relation between certain moral ailment and these various occupation though here in the case of clergyman there would be specific difference : the poor curate equally with the rector be liable to clergyman 's sore throat but he would probably be find free from the chronic moral ailment encourage by the possession of glebe and those higher chance of preferment which follow on have a good position already on the other hand the poor curate might have severe attack of calculate expectancy concern parishioner ' turkey cheese and fat goose or of uneasy rivalry for the donation of clerical charity author be so miscellaneous a class that they personified disease physical and moral might include the whole procession of human disorder lead by dyspepsia and end in madness -- the awful dumb show of a world-historic tragedy take a large enough area of human life and all comedy melt into tragedy like the fool 's part by the side of lear the chief scene get fill with err hero guileful usurper persecute discoverer die deliverer : everywhere the protagonist have a part pregnant with doom the comedy sink to a accessory and if there be loud laugh they seem a convulsive transition from sob or if the comedy be touch with a gentle lovingness the panoramic scene be one where sadness be a kind of mirth so mingled as if mirth do make we sad and sadness merry -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : two noble kinsman -rrb- but i do not set out on the wide survey that would carry I into tragedy and in fact have nothing more serious in my mind than certain small chronic ailment that come of small authorship i be think principally of vorticellum who flourish in my youth not only as a portly lady walk in silk attire but also as the authoress of a book entitle ` the channel island with note and a appendix ' i would by no means make it a reproach to she that she write no more than one book on the contrary she stop there seem to I a laudable example what one would have wish after experience be that she have refrain from produce even that single volume and thus from give she self-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which become oppressive to she acquaintance and set up in herself one of those slight chronic form of disease to which i have just refer she live in the considerable provincial town of pumpiter which have its own newspaper press with the usual division of political partisanship and the usual variety of literary criticism -- the florid and allusive the _ staccato _ and peremptory the clairvoyant and prophetic the safe and pattern-phrased or what one might call the many-a-long-day style vorticellum be the wife of a important townsman have naturally the satisfaction of see ` the channel island ' review by all the organ of pumpiter opinion and they article or paragraph hold as naturally the open page in the elegantly bind album prepare by she for the reception of critical opinion this ornamental volume lay on a special table in she drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously bind work of which it be the significant effect and every guest be allow the privilege of read what have be say of the authoress and she work in the ` pumpiter gazette and literary watchman ' the ` pumpshire post ' the ` church clock ' the ` independent monitor ' and the lively but judicious publication know as the ` medley pie ' to be follow up if he choose by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory judgment sometimes concurrent in the very phrase of journal from the most distant county as the ` latchgate argus ' the penllwy universe ' the ` cockaleekie advertiser ' the ` goodwin sand opinion ' and the ` land 's end time ' i have friend in pumpiter and occasionally pay a long visit there when i call on vorticellum who have a cousinship with my host she have to excuse herself because a message claim she attention for eight or ten minute and hand I the album of critical opinion say with a certain emphasis which consider my youth be highly complimentary that she would really like I to read what i should find there this seem a permissive politeness which i could not feel to be a oppression and i run my eye over the dozen page each with a strip or islet of newspaper in the center with that freedom of mind -lrb- in my case mean freedom to forget -rrb- which would be a perilous way of prepare for examination this _ ad libitum _ perusal have its interest for I the private truth be that i have not read ` the channel island ' i be amaze at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have impress these different judge with the writer 's surpass capacity to handle almost all branch of inquiry and all form of presentation in jersey she have show herself a historian in guernsey a poetess in alderney a political economist and in sark a humorist : there be sketch of character scatter through the page which might put we fictionist to the blush the style be eloquent and racy stud with gem of felicitous remark and the moral spirit throughout be so superior that say one the recording angel -lrb- who be not suppose to take account of literature as such -rrb- would assuredly set down the work as a deed of religion the force of this eulogy on the part of several reviewer be much heighten by the incidental evidence of they fastidious and severe taste which seem to suffer considerably from the imperfection of we chief writer even the dead and canonise : one afflict they with the smell of oil another lack erudition and attempt -lrb- though vainly -rrb- to dazzle they with trivial conceit one want to be more philosophical than nature have make he another in attempt to be comic produce the melancholy effect of a half-starved merry-andrew while one and all from the author of the ` areopagitica ' downward have fault of style which must have make a able hand in the ` latchgate argus ' shake the many-glanced head belong thereto with a smile of compassionate disapproval not so the authoress of ` the channel island : ' vorticellum and shakspere be allow to be faultless i gather that no blemish be observable in the work of this accomplished writer and the repeat information that she be second to none seem after this superfluous she thick octavo -- note appendix and all -- be unflagging from begin to end and the ` land 's end time ' use a rather dangerous rhetorical figure recommend you not to take up the volume unless you have leisure to finish it at a sit it have give one writer more pleasure than he have have for many a long day -- a sentence which have a melancholy resonance suggest a life of studious languor such as all previous achievement of the human mind fail to stimulate into enjoyment i think the collection of critical opinion wind up with this sentence and i have turn back to look at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which front the first page of the album when the fair original re-enter and i lay down the volume on its appropriate table well what do you think of they say vorticellum with a emphasis which have some significance unperceived by I i know you be a great student give I _ you _ opinion of these opinion they must be very gratifying to you i answer with a little confusion for i perceive that i might easily mistake my footing and i begin to have a presentiment of a examination for which i be by no means cram on the whole -- yes say vorticellum in a tone of concession a few of the notice be write with some pain but not one of they have really grapple with the chief idea in the appendix i do not know whether you have study political economy but you see what i say on page 398 about the jersey fishery i bow -- i confess it -- with the mean hope that this movement in the nape of my neck would be take as sufficient proof that i have read marked and learn i do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood but i be young and morally timorous and vorticellum 's personality have a effect on I something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he direct all he ten finger towards you eye as unpleasantly visible duct for the invisible stream i feel a great power of contempt in she if i do not come up to she expectation well she resume you observe that not one of they have take up that argument but i hope i convinced you about the drag-net here be a judgment on I orientally speak i have lift up my foot on the steep descent of falsity and be compel to set it down on a lower level i should think you must be right say i inwardly resolve that on the next topic i would tell the truth i _ know _ that i be right say vorticellum the fact be that no critic in this town be fit to meddle with such subject unless it be volvox and he with all he command of language be very superficial it be volvox who write in the ` monitor ' i hope you notice how he contradict himself my resolution help by the equivalence of danger stoutly prevail and i say no no i be surprised he be the only one who find fault with I he be a dissenter you know the ` monitor ' be the dissenter ' organ but my husband have be so useful to they in municipal affair that they would not venture to run my book down they feel oblige to tell the truth about I still volvox betray himself after praise I for my penetration and accuracy he presently say i have allow myself to be impose upon and have let my active imagination run away with I that be like he dissent impertinence active my imagination may be but i have it under control little vibrio who write the playful notice in the ` medley pie ' have a clever hit at volvox in that passage about the steeplechase of imagination where the loser want to make it appear that the winner be only run away with but if you do not notice volvox 's self-contradiction you would not see the point add vorticellum with rather a chill intonation or perhaps you do not read the ` medley pie ' notice that be a pity do take up the book again vibrio be a poor little tippling creature but as mr carlyle would say he have a eye and he be always lively i do take up the book again and read as demand it be very ingenious say i really appreciate the difficulty of be lively in this connection : it seem even more wonderful than that a vibrio should have a eye you be probably surprise to see no notice from the london press say vorticellum i have one -- a very remarkable one but i reserve it until the other have speak and then i shall introduce it to wind up i shall have they reprint of course and insert in future copy this from the ` candelabrum ' be only eight line in length but full of venom it call my style dull and pompous i think that will tell its own tale place after the other critique people 's impression be so different say i some person find ` don quixote ' dull yes say vorticellum in emphatic chest tone dulness be a matter of opinion but pompous that i never be and never could be perhaps he mean that my matter be too important for he taste and i have no objection to _ that _ i do not intend to be trivial i should just like to read you that passage about the drag-net because i could make it clearer to you a second -lrb- less ornamental -rrb- copy be at she elbow and be already open when to my great relief another guest be announce and i be able to take my leave without seem to run away from ` the channel island ' though not without be compel to carry with I the loan of the marked copy which i be to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the appendix and be only request to return before my departure from pumpiter look into the volume now with some curiosity i find it a very ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious one of those book which one might imagine to have be write under the old grub street coercion of hunger and thirst if they be not know beforehand to be the gratuitous production of lady and gentleman whose circumstance might be call altogether easy but for a uneasy vanity that happen to have be direct towards authorship its importance be that of a polypus tumor fungus or other erratic outgrowth noxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which nourish it poor vorticellum might not have be more wearisome on a visit than the majority of she neighbor but for this disease of magnify self-importance belong to small authorship i understand that the chronic complaint of ` the channel island ' never leave she as the year go on and the publication tend to vanish in the distance for she neighbor ' memory she be still bent on drag it to the foreground and she chief interest in new acquaintance be the possibility of lend they she book enter into all detail concern it and request they to read she album of critical opinion this really make she more tiresome than gregarina whose distinction be that she have have cholera and who do not feel herself in she true position with stranger until they know it my experience with vorticellum lead I for a time into the false supposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration which make self disagreeably larger be most common to the female sex but i presently find that here too the male could assert he superiority and show a more vigorous boredom i have know a man with a single pamphlet contain a assurance that somebody else be wrong together with a few approve quotation produce a more powerful effect of shudder at he approach than ever vorticellum do with she varied octavo volume include note and appendix male of more than one nation recur to my memory who produce from they pocket on the slightest encouragement a small pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet wrap in silver paper as a present hold ready for a intelligent reader a mode of propagandism you remark in excuse they wish to spread some useful corrective doctrine not necessarily : the indoctrination aim at be perhaps to convince you of they own talent by the sample of a ode on shakspere 's birthday or a translation from horace vorticellum may pair off with mona who have also write he one book -- ` here and there or a trip from truro to transylvanium ' -- and not only carry it in he portmanteau when he go on visit but take the earliest opportunity of deposit it in the drawing-room and afterwards would enter to look for it as if under pressure of a need for reference beg the lady of the house to tell he whether she have see a small volume bind in red one hostess at last order it to be carry into he bedroom to save he time but it presently reappear in he hand and be again leave with insert slip of paper on the drawing-room table depend upon it vanity be human native alike to man and woman only in the male it be of denser texture less volatile so that it less immediately inform you of its presence but be more massive and capable of knock you down if you come into collision with it while in woman vanity lay by its small revenge as in a needle-case always at hand the difference be in muscle and finger-tip in traditional habit and mental perspective rather than in the original appetite of vanity it be a approve method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the race as little like we as possible which lead I to observe that in fijus the man use the most elaborate hair-dressing and that wherever tattooing be in vogue the male expect to carry off the prize of admiration for pattern and workmanship argue analogically and look for this tendency of the fijian or hawaian male in the eminent european we must suppose that it exhibit itself under the form of civilised apparel and it would be a great mistake to estimate passionate effort by the effect it produce on we perception or understand it be conceivable that a man may have concentrate no less will and expectation on he wristband gaiter and the shape of he hat-brim or a appearance which impress you as that of the modern swell than the ojibbeway on a ornamentation which seem to we much more elaborate in what concern the search for admiration at least it be not true that the effect be equal to the cause and resemble it the cause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead such as might be see when george the fourth be king must have be widely different in quality and intensity from the impression make by that small scroll of hair on the organ of the beholder merely to maintain a attitude and gait which i notice in certain club man and especially a inflation of the chest accompany very small remark there go i be convince a expenditure of psychical energy little appreciate by the multitude -- a mental vision of self and deeply impressed beholder which be quite without antitype in what we call the effect produce by that hidden process no there be no need to admit that woman would carry away the prize of vanity in a competition where difference of custom be fairly consider a man can not show he vanity in a tight skirt which force he to walk sideways down the staircase but let the match be between the respective vanity of largest beard and tightest skirt and here too the battle would be to the strong xvi moral swindler it be a familiar example of irony in the degradation of word that what a man be worth have come to mean how much money he possess but there seem a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that popular or polite speech assign to morality and moral the poor part these word be make to play recall the fate of those pagan divinity who after be understand to rule the power of the air and the destiny of man come down to the level of insignificant demon or be even make a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude talk to melissa in a time of commercial trouble i find she disposed to speak pathetically of the disgrace which have fall on sir gavial mantrap because of he conduct in relation to the eocene mine and to other company ingeniously devise by he for the punishment of ignorance in people of small means : a disgrace by which the poor title gentleman be actually reduce to live in comparative obscurity on he wife 's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consol surely you pity be misapply say i rather dubiously for i like the comfort of trust that a correct moral judgment be the strong point in woman -lrb- see that she have a majority of about a million in we island -rrb- and i imagine that melissa might have some unexpressed grounds for she opinion i should have think you would rather be sorry for mantrap 's victim -- the widow spinster and hard-working father whom he unscrupulous haste to make himself rich have cheat of all they savings while he be eat well lie softly and after impudently justify himself before the public be perhaps join in the general confession with a sense that he be a acceptable object in the sight of god though decent man refuse to meet he oh all that about the company i know be most unfortunate in commerce people be lead to do so many thing and he might not know exactly how everything would turn out but sir gavial make a good use of he money and he be a thoroughly _ moral _ man what do you mean by a thoroughly moral man say i oh i suppose every one mean the same by that say melissa with a slight air of rebuke sir gavial be a excellent family man -- quite blameless there and so charitable round he place at tiptop very different from mr barabba whose life my husband tell I be most objectionable with actress and that sort of thing i think a man 's moral should make a difference to we i be not sorry for mr barabba but _ i be _ sorry for sir gavial mantrap i will not repeat my answer to melissa for i fear it be offensively brusque my opinion be that sir gavial be the more pernicious scoundrel of the two since he name for virtue serve as a effective part of a swindle apparatus and perhaps i hint that to call such a man moral show rather a silly notion of human affair in fact i have a angry wish to be instructive and melissa as will sometimes happen noticed my anger without appropriate my instruction for i have since hear that she speak of I as rather violent-tempered and not over strict in my view of morality i wish that this narrow use of word which be want in they full meaning be confine to woman like melissa see that morality and moral under they _ alia _ of ethic be the subject of voluminous discussion and they true basis a press matter of dispute -- see that the most famous book ever write on ethic and form a chief study in we college ally ethical with political science or that which treat of the constitution and prosperity of state one might expect that educate man would find reason to avoid a perversion of language which lend itself to no wider view of life than that of village gossip yet i find even respectable historian of we own and of foreign country after show that a king be treacherous rapacious and ready to sanction gross breach in the administration of justice end by praise he for he pure moral character by which one must suppose they to mean that he be not lewd nor debauched not the european twin of the typical indian potentate whom macaulay describe as pass he life in chew bang and fondle dancing-girls and since we be sometimes tell of such maleficent king that they be religious we arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching duty of man lie quite outside both morality and religion -- the one of these consist in not keep mistress -lrb- and perhaps not drink too much -rrb- and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transaction with god which can be carry on equally well side by side with the basest conduct towards man with such a classification as this it be no wonder consider the strong reaction of language on thought that many mind dizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy be far to seek for the grounds of social duty and without entertain any private intention of commit a perjury which would ruin a innocent man or seek gain by supply bad preserved meat to we navy feel themselves speculatively oblige to inquire why they should not do so and be incline to measure they intellectual subtlety by they dissatisfaction with all answer to this why it be of little use to theorise in ethic while we habitual phraseology stamp the larger part of we social duty as something that lie aloof from the deepest need and affection of we nature the informal definition of popular language be the only medium through which theory really affect the mass of mind even among the nominally educate and when a man whose business hour the solid part of every day be spend in a unscrupulous course of public or private action which have every calculable chance of cause widespread injury and misery can be call moral because he come home to dine with he wife and child and cherish the happiness of he own hearth the augury be not good for the use of high ethical and theological disputation not for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the relation of the sex and the primary tie of kinship be the deepest root of human wellbeing but to make they by themselves the equivalent of morality be verbally to cut off the channel of feeling through which they be the feeder of that wellbeing they be the original fountain of a sensibility to the claim of other which be the bond of society but be necessarily in the first instance a private good there be always the danger that individual selfishness will see in they only the best part of its own gain just as knowledge navigation commerce and all the condition which be of a nature to awaken man 's consciousness of they mutual dependence and to make the world one great society be the occasion of selfish unfair action of war and oppression so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling and opinion be not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what be demand by the general welfare and among the influence that must retard a right public judgment the degradation of word which involve praise and blame will be reckon worth protest against by every mature observer to rob word of half they meaning while they retain they dignity as qualification be like allow to man who have lose half they faculty the same high and perilous command which they win in they time of vigor or like sell food and seed after fraudulently abstract they best virtue : in each case what ought to be beneficently strong be fatally enfeebled if not empoison until we have alter we dictionary and have find some other word than _ morality _ to stand in popular use for the duty of man to man let we refuse to accept as moral the contractor who enrich himself by use large machinery to make pasteboard sole pass as leather for the foot of unhappy conscript fight at miserable odds against invader : let we rather call he a miscreant though he be the tenderest most faithful of husband and contend that he own experience of home happiness make he reckless infliction of suffer on other all the more atrocious let we refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow he conduct in relation to great issue to be determine by egoistic passion and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he be as lax in he personal habit as sir robert walpole if at the same time he sense of the public welfare be supreme in he mind quell all pettier impulse beneath a magnanimous impartiality and though we be to find among that class of journalist who live by recklessly report injurious rumor insinuate the blackest motive in opponent descant at large and with a air of infallibility on dream which they both find and interpret and stimulate bad feeling between nation by abusive writing which be as empty of real conviction as the rage of a pantomime king and would be ludicrous if its effect do not make it appear diabolical -- though we be to find among these a man who be benignancy itself in he own circle a healer of private difference a soother in private calamity let we pronounce he nevertheless flagrantly immoral a root of hideous cancer in the commonwealth turn the channel of instruction into feeder of social and political disease in opposite way one see bad effect likely to be encourage by this narrow use of the word _ moral _ shut out from its meaning half those action of a man 's life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of he fellow-citizen and on the preparation of a future for the child grow up around he thoroughness of workmanship care in the execution of every task undertake as if it be the acceptance of a trust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well be a form of duty so momentous that if it be to die out from the feeling and practice of a people all reform of institution would be helpless to create national prosperity and national happiness do we desire to see public spirit penetrate all class of the community and affect every man 's conduct so that he shall make neither the saving of he soul nor any other private save a excuse for indifference to the general welfare well and good but the sort of public spirit that scamp its bread-winning work whether with the trowel the pen or the oversee brain that it may hurry to scene of political or social agitation would be as baleful a gift to we people as any malignant demon could devise one best part of educational training be that which come through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill with its usual accompaniment of delight in relation to work which be the daily bread-winning occupation -- which be a man 's contribution to the effective wealth of society in return for what he take as he own share but this duty of do one 's proper work well and take care that every product of one 's labor shall be genuinely what it pretend to be be not only leave out of moral in popular speech it be very little insist on by public teacher at least in the only effective way -- by trace the continuous effect of ill-done work some of they seem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence from week-day service ecclesiastical decoration and improve hymn-book other apparently trust to descant on self-culture in general or to raise a general sense of faulty circumstance and meanwhile lax make-shift work from the high conspicuous kind to the average and obscure be allow to pass unstamped with the disgrace of immorality though there be not a member of society who be not daily suffering from it materially and spiritually and though it be the fatal cause that must degrade we national rank and we commerce in spite of all open market and discovery of available coal-seam i suppose one may take the popular misuse of the word morality and moral as some excuse for certain absurdity which be occasional fashion in speech and writing -- certain old lay-figure as ugly as the queerest asiatic idol which at different period get prop into loftiness and attire in magnificent venetian drapery so that whether they have a human face or not be of little consequence one be the notion that there be a radical irreconcilable opposition between intellect and morality i do not mean the simple statement of fact which everybody know that remarkably able man have have very faulty moral and have outrage public feeling even at its ordinary standard but the supposition that the ablest intellect the highest genius will see through morality as a sort of twaddle for bib and tucker a doctrine of dulness a mere incident in human stupidity we begin to understand the acceptance of this foolishness by consider that we live in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch or a malignant and lie politician or a man who use either official or literary power as a instrument of he private partiality or hatred or a manufacturer who devise the falsification of wares or a trader who deal in virtueless seed-grain praise or compassionate because of he excellent moral clearly if morality mean no more than such decency as be practice by these poisonous member of society it would be possible to say without suspicion of light-headedness that morality lay aloof from the grand stream of human affair as a small channel feed by the stream and not miss from it while this form of nonsense be convey in the popular use of word there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at leisure to run through a box of book which will feel itself initiate in the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a shaksperian motto -- fair be foul and foul be fair hover through the fog and filthy air -- and will find itself easily provide with striking conversation by the rule of reverse all the judgment on good and evil which have come to be the calendar and clock-work of society but let we habitual talk give moral they full meaning as the conduct which in every human relation would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest sympathy -- a meaning perpetually correct and enrich by a more thorough appreciation of dependence in thing and a finer sensibility to both physical and spiritual fact -- and this ridiculous ascription of superlative power to mind which have no effective awe-inspiring vision of the human lot no response of understand to the connection between duty and the material process by which the world be keep habitable for cultivate man will be tacitly discredit without any need to cite the immortal name that all be oblige to take as the measure of intellectual rank and highly-charged genius suppose a frenchman -- i mean no disrespect to the great french nation for all nation be afflict with they peculiar parasitic growth which be lazy hungry form usually characterise by a disproportionate swallow apparatus : suppose a parisian who should shuffle down the boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest care and the deepest tenderness of manhood and a frame more or less fevered by debauchery mentally polish into utmost refinement of phrase and rhythm verse which be a enlargement on that shaksperian motto and worthy of the most expensive title to be furnish by the vendor of such antithetic ware as _ les _ _ marguerites de l'enfer _ or _ les délices de béelzébuth _ this suppose personage might probably enough regard he negation of those moral sensibility which make half the warp and woof of human history he indifference to the hard thinking and hard handiwork of life to which he owe even he own gauzy mental garment with they spangle of poor paradox as the royalty of genius for we be use to witness such self-crowning in many form of mental alienation but he would not i think be take even by he own generation as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as that of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with the large yet finely discriminate vision which mark the intellectual master of we kind doubtless there be many sort of transfiguration and a man who have come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may have have he swinish period wallow in ugly place but suppose it have be hand down to we that sophocle or virgil have at one time make himself scandalous in this way : the work which have consecrate they memory for we admiration and gratitude be not a glorifying of swinishness but a artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment know to they age all these may seem to be wide reason for object to melissa 's pity for sir gavial mantrap on the ground of he good moral but they connection will not be obscure to any one who have take pain to observe the link unite the scatter sign of we social development xvii shadow of the come race my friend trost who be no optimist as to the state of the universe hitherto but be confident that at some future period within the duration of the solar system ours will be the best of all possible world -- a hope which i always honor as a sign of beneficent quality -- my friend trost always try to keep up my spirit under the sight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of we fellow-creature have to get they bread with the assurance that all this will soon be do by machinery but he sometimes neutralise the consolation by extend it over so large a area of human labor and insist so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus be set free for loftier purpose that i be tempt to desire a occasional famine of invention in the come age lest the humbler kind of work should be entirely nullify while there be still leave some man and woman who be not fit for the highest especially when one consider the perfunctory way in which some of the most exalted task be already execute by those who be understand to be educate for they there rise a fearful vision of the human race evolve machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of work when in the bank of england i see a wondrously delicate machine for testing sovereign a shrewd implacable little steel rhadamanthus that once the coin be deliver up to it lift and balance each in turn for the fraction of a instant find it want or sufficient and dismiss it to right or leave with rigorous justice when i be tell of micrometer and thermopile and tasimeter which deal physically with the invisible the impalpable and the unimaginable of cunning wire and wheel and point needle which will register you and my quickness so as to exclude flattering opinion of a machine for draw the right conclusion which will doubtless by-and-by be improve into a automaton for find true premise of a microphone which detect the cadence of the fly 's foot on the ceiling and may be expect presently to discriminate the noise of we various folly as they soliloquise or converse in we brain -- my mind seem too small for these thing i get a little out of it like a unfortunate savage too suddenly bring face to face with civilisation and i exclaim -- be i already in the shadow of the come race and will the creature who be to transcend and finally supersede we be steely organism give out the effluvium of the laboratory and perform with infallible exactness more than everything that we have perform with a slovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy but say trost treat I with cautious mildness on hearing I vent this rave notion you forget that these wonder-worker be the slave of we race need we tendance and regulation obey the mandate of we consciousness and be only deaf and dumb bringer of report which we decipher and make use of they be simply extension of the human organism so to speak limb immeasurably more powerful ever more subtle finger-tip ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small each new machine need a new appliance of human skill to construct it new device to feed it with material and often keener-edged faculty to note its registration or performance how then can machine supersede we -- they depend upon we when we cease they cease i be not so sure of that say i get back into my mind and become rather wilful in consequence if as i have hear you contend machine as they be more and more perfect will require less and less of tendance how do i know that they may not be ultimately make to carry or may not in themselves evolve condition of self-supply self-repair and reproduction and not only do all the mighty and subtle work possible on this planet better than we could do it but with the immense advantage of banish from the earth 's atmosphere scream consciousness which in we comparatively clumsy race make a intolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like performance look on at all work only as it be to spring a rattle here or blow a trumpet there with a ridiculous sense of be effective i for my part can not see any reason why a sufficiently penetrate thinker who can see he way through a thousand year or so should not conceive a parliament of machine in which the manners be excellent and the motion infallible in logic : one honorable instrument a remote descendant of the voltaic family might discharge a powerful current -lrb- entirely without animosity -rrb- on a honorable instrument opposite of more upstart origin but belong to the ancient edge-tool race which we already at sheffield see pare thick iron as if it be mellow cheese -- by this unerringly direct discharge operating on movement correspond to what we call estimate and by necessary mechanical consequence on movement correspond to what we call the fund which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as sensitive for every machine would be perfectly educate that be to say would have the suitable molecular adjustment which would act not the less infallibly for be free from the fussy accompaniment of that consciousness to which we prejudice give a supreme govern rank when in truth it be a idle parasite on the grand sequence of thing nothing of the sort return trost get angry and judge it kind to treat I with some severity what you have hear I say be that we race will and must act as a nervous center to the utmost development of mechanical process : the subtly refine power of machine will react in produce more subtly refine think process which will occupy the mind set free from grosser labor say for example that all the scavenger work of london be do so far as human attention be concern by the occasional pressure of a brass button -lrb- as in the ringing of a electric bell -rrb- you will then have a multitude of brain set free for the exquisite enjoyment of deal with the exact sequence and high speculation supply and prompt by the delicate machine which yield a response to the fix star and give reading of the spiral vortice fundamentally concern in the production of epic poem or great judicial harangue so far from mankind be throw out of work accord to you notion conclude trost with a peculiar nasal note of scorn if it be not for you incurable dilettanteism in science as in all other thing -- if you have once understand the action of any delicate machine -- you would perceive that the sequence it carry throughout the realm of phenomenon would require many generation perhaps aeon of understanding considerably stronger than yours to exhaust the store of work it lay open precisely say i with a meekness which i feel be praiseworthy it be the feebleness of my capacity bring I nearer than you to the human average that perhaps enable I to imagine certain result better than you can doubtless the very fish of we river gullible as they look and slow as they be to be rightly convince in another order of fact form fewer false expectation about each other than we should form about they if we be in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse with they species for even as it be we have continually to be surprise that they do not rise to we carefully select bait take I then as a sort of reflective and experienced carp but do not estimate the justice of my idea by my facial expression pooh say trost -lrb- we be on very intimate term -rrb- naturally i persist it be less easy to you than to I to imagine we race transcend and supersede since the more energy a be be possess of the harder it must be for he to conceive he own death but i from the point of view of a reflective carp can easily imagine myself and my congener dispense with in the frame of thing and give way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of entity what i would ask you be to show I why since each new invention cast a new light along the pathway of discovery and each new combination or structure bring into play more condition than its inventor foresee there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and chemical power that it would find and assimilate the material to supply its own waste and then by a further evolution of internal molecular movement reproduce itself by some process of fission or bud this last stage have be reach either by man 's contrivance or as a unforeseen result one see that the process of natural selection must drive man altogether out of the field for they will long before have begin to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy character in fable who have demon or djinn at they beck and be oblige to supply they with work find too much of everything do in too short a time what demon so potent as molecular movement none the less tremendously potent for not carry the futile cargo of a consciousness screech irrelevantly like a fowl tie head downmost to the saddle of a swift horseman under such uncomfortable circumstance we race will have diminish with the diminish call on they energy and by the time that the self-repairing and reproduce machine arise all but a few of the rare inventor calculator and speculator will have become pale pulpy and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration and behold around they a scanty hydrocephalous offspring as to the breed of the ingenious and intellectual they nervous system will at last have be overwrought in follow the molecular revelation of the immensely more powerful unconscious race and they will naturally as the less energetic combination of movement subside like the flame of a candle in the sunlight thus the feebler race whose corporeal adjustment happen to be accompany with a maniacal consciousness which imagine itself move its mover will have vanish as all less adapt existence do before the fittest -- ie the existence compose of the most persistent group of movement and the most capable of incorporate new group in harmonious relation who -- if we consciousness be as i have be give to understand a mere stumble of we organism on they way to unconscious perfection -- who shall say that those fittest existence will not be find along the track of what we call inorganic combination which will carry on the most elaborate process as mutely and painlessly as we be now tell that the mineral be metamorphose themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the earth 's crust thus this planet may be fill with being who will be blind and deaf as the inmost rock yet will execute change as delicate and complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of what we call its effect without sensitive impression without sensitive impulse : there may be let we say mute oration mute rhapsody mute discussion and no consciousness there even to enjoy the silence absurd grumble trost the supposition be logical say i it be well argue from the premise whose premise cry trost turn on I with some fierceness you do not mean to call they mine i hope heaven forbid they seem to be fly about in the air with other germ and have find a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancy nobody really hold they they bear the same relation to real belief as walk on the head for a show do to run away from a explosion or walk fast to catch the train xviii the modern hep hep hep to discern likeness amidst diversity it be well know do not require so fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general sameness the primary rough classification depend on the prominent resemblance of thing : the progress be towards finer and finer discrimination accord to minute difference yet even at this stage of european culture one 's attention be continually draw to the prevalence of that grosser mental sloth which make people dull to the most ordinary prompt of comparison -- the bring thing together because of they likeness the same motive the same idea the same practice be alternately admire and abhor laud and denounce accord to they association with superficial difference historical or actually social : even learn writer treat of great subject often show a attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that of the frivolous fine lady who be indignant at the frivolity of she maid to take only the subject of the jew : it would be difficult to find a form of bad reasoning about they which have not be hear in conversation or be admit to the dignity of print but the neglect of resemblance be a common property of dulness which unite all the various point of view -- the prejudice the puerile the spiteful and the abysmally ignorant that the preservation of national memory be a element and a means of national greatness that they revival be a sign of revive nationality that every heroic defender every patriotic restorer have be inspire by such memory and have make they he watchword that even such a corporate existence as that of a roman legion or a english regiment have be make valorous by memorial standard -- these be the glorious commonplace of historic teaching at we public school and university be happily ingrain in greek and latin classic they have also be impress on the world by conspicuous modern instance that there be a free modern greece be due -- through all infiltration of other than greek blood -- to the presence of ancient greece in the consciousness of european man and every speaker would feel he point safe if he be to praise byron 's devotion to a cause make glorious by ideal identification with the past hardly so if he be to insist that the greek be not to be help further because they history show that they be anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lie and that many modern greek be highly disreputable character while other be dispose to grasp too large a share of we commerce the same with italy : the pathos of he country 's lot pierce the youthful soul of mazzinus because like dante 's he blood be fraught with the kinship of italian greatness he imagination fill with a majestic past that work itself into a majestic future half a century ago what be italy a idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless wealth a territory parcel out for papal sustenance dynastic convenience and the profit of a alien government what be the italian no people no voice in european counsel no massive power in european affair : a race thought of in english and french society as chiefly adapt to the operatic stage or to serve as model for painter dispose to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpenny and by the more historical remember to be rather polite than truthful in all probability a combination of machiavellus rubinus and masaniello thanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspire the moment with a past a present and a future and give the sense of corporate existence that raise man above the otherwise more respectable and innocent brute all that or most of it be change again one of we living historian find just sympathy in he vigorous insistance on we true ancestry on we be the strongly marked heritor in language and genius of those old english seaman who behold a rich country with a most convenient seaboard come doubtless with a sense of divine warrant and settle themselves on this or the other side of fertilise stream gradually conquer more and more of the pleasant land from the native who know nothing of odin and finally make unusually clean work in rid themselves of those prior occupant let we he virtually say let we know who be we forefather who it be that win the soil for we and bring the good seed of those institution through which we should not arrogantly but gratefully feel ourselves distinguish among the nation as possessor of long-inherited freedom let we not keep up a ignorant kind of name which disguise we true affinity of blood and language but let we see thoroughly what sort of notion and tradition we forefather have and what sort of song inspire they let the poetic fragment which breathe forth they fierce bravery in battle and they trust in fierce god who help they be treasured with affectionate reverence these seafaring invade self-asserting man be the english of old time and be we father who do rough work by which we be profit they have virtue which incorporate themselves in wholesome usage to which we trace we own political blessing let we know and acknowledge we common relationship to they and be thankful that over and above the affection and duty which spring from we manhood we have the closer and more constantly guide duty which belong to we as englishman to this view of we nationality most person who have feeling and understanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the patriotic affection and every other affection which lift we above emigrate rat and free-loving baboon will be dispose to say aman true we be not indebted to those ancestor for we religion : we be rather proud of have get that illumination from elsewhere the man who plant we nation be not christian though they begin they work century after christ and they have a decide objection to christianity when it be first propose to they : they be not monotheist and they religion be the reverse of spiritual but since we have be fortunate enough to keep the island-home they win for we and have be on the whole a prosperous people rather continue the plan of invade and spoil other land than be force to beg for shelter in they nobody have reproach we because we father thirteen hundred year ago worship odin massacred briton and be with difficulty persuade to accept christianity know nothing of hebrew history and the reason why christ should be receive as the savior of mankind the red indian not like we when we settle among they might have be willing to fling such fact in we face but they be too ignorant and besides they opinion do not signify because we be able if we like to exterminate they the hindoo also have doubtless have they rancor against we and still entertain enough ill-will to make unfavourable remark on we character especially as to we historic rapacity and arrogant notion of we own superiority they perhaps do not admire the usual english profile and they be not convert to we way of feeding : but though we be a small number of a alien race profit by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people they be unable to turn we out at least when they try we show they they mistake we do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punish people : we be a colonise people and it be we who have punish other still the historian guide we rightly in urge we to dwell on the virtue of we ancestor with emulation and to cherish we sense of a common descent as a bond of obligation the eminence the nobleness of a people depend on its capability of be stir by memory and of strive for what we call spiritual end -- end which consist not in immediate material possession but in the satisfaction of a great feeling that animate the collective body as with one soul a people have the seed of worthiness in it must feel a answering thrill when it be adjure by the death of its hero who die to preserve its national existence when it be remind of its small beginning and gradual growth through past labor and struggle such as be still demand of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherit may be transmit unimpaired to child and child 's child when a appeal against the permission of injustice be make to great precedent in its history and to the better genius breathing in its institution it be this live force of sentiment in common which make a national consciousness nation so move will resist conquest with the very breast of they woman will pay they million and they blood to abolish slavery will share privation in famine and all calamity will produce poet to sing some great story of a man and thinker whose theory will bear the test of action a individual man to be harmoniously great must belong to a nation of this order if not in actual existence yet exist in the past in memory as a depart invisible beloved ideal once a reality and perhaps to be restore a common humanity be not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various activity which make a complete man the time be not come for cosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous any more than for communism to suffice for social energy i be not bind to feel for a chinaman as i feel for my fellow-countryman : i be bind not to demoralise he with opium not to compel he to my will by destroy or plunder the fruit of he labor on the alleged ground that he be not cosmopolitan enough and not to insult he for he want of my tailor and religion when he appear as a peaceable visitor on the london pavement it be admirable in a briton with a good purpose to learn chinese but it would not be a proof of fine intellect in he to taste chinese poetry in the original more than he taste the poetry of he own tongue affection intelligence duty radiate from a center and nature have decide that for we english folk that center can be neither china nor peru most of we feel this unreflectingly for the affectation of undervalue everything native and be too fine for one 's own country belong only to a few mind of no dangerous leverage what be want be that we should recognize a corresponding attachment to nationality as legitimate in every other people and understand that its absence be a privation of the greatest good for to repeat not only the nobleness of a nation depend on the presence of this national consciousness but also the nobleness of each individual citizen we dignity and rectitude be proportion to we sense of relationship with something great admirable pregnant with high possibility worthy of sacrifice a continual inspiration to self-repression and discipline by the presentation of aim larger and more attractive to we generous part than the secure of personal ease or prosperity and a people possess this good should surely feel not only a ready sympathy with the effort of those who have lose the good strive to regain it but a profound pity for any degradation result from its loss nay something more than pity when happier nationality have make victim of the unfortunate whose memory nevertheless be the very fountain to which the persecutor trace they most vaunted blessing these notion be familiar : few will deny they in the abstract and many be find loudly assert they in relation to this or the other particular case but here as elsewhere in the ardent application of idea there be a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to resemblance the european world have long be use to consider the jew as altogether exceptional and it have follow naturally enough that they have be except from the rule of justice and mercy which be base on human likeness but to consider a people whose idea have determine the religion of half the world and that the more cultivate half and who make the most eminent struggle against the power of rome as a purely exceptional race be a demoralising offence against rational knowledge a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation every nation of forcible character -- ie of strongly marked characteristic be so far exceptional the distinctive note of each bird-species be in this sense exceptional but the necessary ground of such distinction be a deeper likeness the superlative peculiarity in the jew admit we affinity with they be only the more apparent when the element of they peculiarity be discern from whatever point of view the writings of the old testament may be regard the picture they present of a national development be of high interest and speciality nor can they historic momentousness be much affect by any variety of theory as to the relation they bear to the new testament or to the rise and constitution of christianity whether we accept the canonical hebrew book as a revelation or simply as part of a ancient literature make no difference to the fact that we find there the strongly characterise portraiture of a people educate from a earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its intensity a people teach by many concurrent influence to identify faithfulness to its national tradition with the highest social and religious blessing we too scanty source of jewish history from the return under ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against rome show we the heroic and triumphant struggle of the maccabee which rescue the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupt sway of the syrian greek add to the glorious sum of its memorial and stimulate continuous effort of a more peaceful sort to maintain and develop that national life which the hero have fight and die for by internal measure of legal administration and public teaching thenceforth the virtuous element of the jewish life be engage as they have be with vary aspect during the long and changeful prophetic period and the restoration under ezra on the side of preserve the specific national character against a demoralising fusion with that of foreigner whose religion and ritual be idolatrous and often obscene there be always a foreign party revile the national party as narrow and sometimes manifest they own breadth in extensive view of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a foreign power such internal conflict naturally tighten the band of conservatism which need to be strong if it be to rescue the sacred ark the vital spirit of a small nation -- the smallest of the nation -- whose territory lay on the highway between three continent and when the dread and hatred of foreign sway have condensed itself into dread and hatred of the roman many conservative become zealot whose chief mark be that they advocate resistance to the death against the submergence of they nationality much might be say on this point towards distinguish the desperate struggle against a conquest which be regard as degradation and corruption from rash hopeless insurrection against a established native government and for my part -lrb- if that be of any consequence -rrb- i share the spirit of the zealot i take the spectacle of the jewish people defy the roman edict and prefer death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of caligulum 's deify statue into the temple as a sublime type of steadfastness but all that need be notice here be the continuity of that national education -lrb- by outward and inward circumstance -rrb- which create in the jew a feeling of race a sense of corporate existence unique in its intensity but not before the dispersion unique in essential quality there be more likeness than contrast between the way we english get we island and the way the israelite get canaan we have not be note for form a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigner or for admit that we institution be equal by those of any other people under the sun many of we have think that we sea-wall be a specially divine arrangement to make and keep we a nation of sea-king after the manner of we forefather secure against invasion and able to invade other land when we need they though they may lie on the other side of the ocean again it have be hold that we have a peculiar destiny as a protestant people not only able to bruise the head of a idolatrous christianity in the midst of we but fit as possessor of the most truth and the most tonnage to carry we purer religion over the world and convert mankind to we way of think the puritan assert they liberty to restrain tyrant find the hebrew history closely symbolical of they feeling and purpose and it can hardly be correct to cast the blame of they less laudable doings on the writings they invoke since they opponent make use of the same writings for different end find there a strong warrant for the divine right of king and the denunciation of those who like korah dathan and abiram take on themselves the office of the priesthood which belong of right solely to aaron and he son or in other word to man ordain by the english bishop we must rather refer the passionate use of the hebrew writings to affinity of disposition between we own race and the jewish be it true that the arrogance of a jew be so immeasurably beyond that of a calvinist and the just sympathy and admiration which we give to the ancestor who resist the oppressive act of we native king and by resist rescue or win for we the best part of we civil and religious liberty -- be it justly to be withhold from those brave and steadfast man of jewish race who fight and die or strive by wise administration to resist the oppression and corrupt influence of foreign tyrant and by resist rescue the nationality which be the very hearth of we own religion at any rate see that the jew be more specifically than any other nation educate into a sense of they supreme moral value the chief matter of surprise be that any other nation be find to rival they in this form of self-confidence more exceptional -- less like the course of we own history -- have be they dispersion and they subsistence as a separate people through age in which for the most part they be regard and treat very much as beast hunt for the sake of they skin or of a valuable secretion peculiar to they species the jew show a talent for accumulate what be a object of more immediate desire to christian than animal oils or well-furred skin and they cupidity and avarice be find at once particularly hateful and particularly useful : hateful when see as a reason for punish they by mulct or robbery useful when this retributive process could be successfully carry forward king and emperor naturally be more alive to the usefulness of subject who could gather and yield money but edict issue to protect the king 's jew equally with the king 's game from be harass and hunt by the commonalty be only slight mitigation to the deplorable lot of a race hold to be under the divine curse and have little force after the crusade begin as the slave-holder in the united state count the curse on ham a justification of negro slavery so the curse on the jew be count a justification for hinder they from pursue agriculture and handicraft for mark they out as execrable figure by a peculiar dress for torture they to make they part with they gain or for more gratuitously spit at they and pelt they for take it as certain that they kill and eat baby poison the well and take pain to spread the plague for put it to they whether they would be baptise or burn and not fail to burn and massacre they when they be obstinate but also for suspect they of dislike the baptism when they have get it and then burn they in punishment of they insincerity finally for hound they by ten on ten of thousand from the home where they have find shelter for century and inflict on they the horror of a new exile and a new dispersion all this to avenge the savior of mankind or else to compel these stiff-necked people to acknowledge a master whose servant show such beneficent effect of he teaching with a people so treated one of two issue be possible : either from be of feebler nature than they persecutor and care more for ease than for the sentiment and idea which constitute they distinctive character they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly merge in the population around they or be endow with uncommon tenacity physical and mental feeling peculiarly the tie of inheritance both in blood and faith remember national glory trust in they recovery abhor apostasy able to bear all thing and hope all thing with the consciousness of be steadfast to spiritual obligation the kernel of they number would harden into a inflexibility more and more insure by motive and habit they would cherish all difference that mark they off from they hate oppressor all memory that console they with a sense of virtual though unrecognised superiority and the separateness which be make they badge of ignominy would be they inward pride they source of fortify defiance doubtless such a people would get confirm in vice a oppressive government and a persecute religion while breed vice in those who hold power be well know to breed answer vice in those who be powerless and suffer what more direct plan than the course present by european history could have be pursue in order to give the jew a spirit of bitter isolation of scorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that make victim of they of triumph in prosper at the expense of the blunderer who stone they away from the open path of industry -- or on the other hand to encourage in the less defiant a lie conformity a pretence of conversion for the sake of the social advantage attach to baptism a outward renunciation of they hereditary tie with the lack of real love towards the society and creed which exact this galling tribute -- or again in the most unhappy specimen of the race to rear transcendent example of odious vice reckless instrument of rich man with bad propensity unscrupulous grinder of the alien people who want to grind _ they _ no wonder the jew have they vice : no wonder if it be prove -lrb- which it have not hitherto appear to be -rrb- that some of they have a bad pre-eminence in evil a unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness it would be more plausible to make a wonder of the virtue which have prosper among they under the shadow of oppression but instead of dwelling on these or treat as admit what any hardy or ignorant person may deny let we find simply on the loud assertion of the hostile the jews it be say resist the expansion of they own religion into christianity they be in the habit of spit on the cross they have hold the name of christ to be _ anathema _ who teach they that the man who make christianity a curse to they : the man who make the name of christ a symbol for the spirit of vengeance and what be worse make the execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfy they own savageness greed and envy : the man who sanction with the name of christ a barbaric and blunder copy of pagan fatalism in take the word he blood be upon we and on we child as a divinely appoint verbal warrant for wreak cruelty from generation to generation on the people from whose sacred writings christ draw he teaching strange retrogression in the professor of a expand religion boast a illumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of hebrew prophet for hebrew prophet proclaim a god who demand mercy rather than sacrifice the christian also believe that god delighted not in the blood of ram and of bull but they apparently conceive he as require for he satisfaction the sigh and groan the blood and roasted flesh of man whose forefather have misunderstand the metaphorical character of prophecy which speak of spiritual pre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom be this the method by which christ desire he title to the messiahship to be commend to the heart and understanding of the nation in which he be bear many of he saying bear the stamp of that patriotism which place fellow-countryman in the inner circle of affection and duty and do the word father forgive they they know not what they do refer only to the centurion and he band a tacit exception be make of every hebrew there present from the mercy of the father and the compassion of the son -- nay more of every hebrew yet to come who remain unconverted after hearing of he claim to the messiahship not from he own lip or those of he native apostle but from the lip of alien man whom cross creed and baptism have leave cruel rapacious and debauched it be more reverent to christ to believe that he must have approve the jewish martyr who deliberately choose to be burn or massacre rather than be guilty of a blaspheme lie more than he approve the rabble of crusader who rob and murder they in he name but these remonstrance seem to have no direct application to personage who take up the attitude of philosophic thinker and discriminate critic professedly accept christianity from a rational point of view as a vehicle of the highest religious and moral truth and condemn the jew on the ground that they be obstinate adherent of a outworn creed maintain themselves in moral alienation from the people with whom they share citizenship and be destitute of real interest in the welfare of the community and state with which they be thus identify these anti-judaic advocate usually belong to a party which have feel itself glorified in win for jew as well as dissenter and catholic the full privilege of citizenship lay open to they every path to distinction at one time the voice of this party urge that difference of creed be make dangerous only by the denial of citizenship -- that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel like one at present apparently this confidence have be succeed by a sense of mistake : there be a regret that no limit clause be insist on such as would have hinder the jew from come too far and in too large proportion along those open pathway and the roumanian be think to have show a enviable wisdom in give they as little chance as possible but then the reflection occur that some of the most objectionable jew be baptise christian it be obvious that such clause would have be insufficient and the doctrine that you can turn a jew into a good christian be emphatically retract but clearly these liberal gentleman too late enlighten by disagreeable event must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who argue against they long ago and it be a striking spectacle to witness mind so pant for advancement in some direction that they be ready to force it on a unwilling society in this instance despairingly recur to mediaeval type of thinking -- insist that the jew be make viciously cosmopolitan by hold the world 's money-bag that for they all national interest be resolve into the algebra of loan that they have suffer a inward degradation stamp they as morally inferior and -- serve they right since they reject christianity all which be mirror in a analogy namely that of the irish also a servile race who have reject protestantism though it have be repeatedly urge on they by fire and sword and penal law and whose place in the moral scale may be judge by we advertisement where the clause no irish need apply parallel the sentence which for many polite person sum up the question of judaism -- i never _ do _ like the jew it be certainly worth consider whether a expatriate denationalise race use for age to live among antipathetic population must not inevitably lack some condition of nobleness if they drop that separateness which be make they reproach they may be in danger of lapse into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism and of miss that inward identification with the nationality immediately around they which might make some amends for they inherit privation no dispassionate observer can deny this danger why we own countryman who take to live abroad without purpose or function to keep up they sense of fellowship in the affair of they own land be rarely good specimen of moral healthiness still the consciousness of have a native country the birthplace of common memory and habit of mind exist like a parental hearth quit but beloved the dignity of be include in a people which have a part in the comity of nation and the grow federation of the world that sense of special belong which be the root of human virtue both public and private -- all these spiritual link may preserve migratory englishman from the worst consequence of they voluntary dispersion unquestionably the jew have be more than any other race expose to the adverse moral influence of alienism must both in individual and in group have suffer some corresponding moral degradation but in fact they have escape with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the nation whose hand have be against they than could have happen in the case of a people who have neither they adhesion to a separate religion found on historic memory nor they characteristic family affectionateness tortured flog spit upon the _ corpus vile _ on which rage or wantonness vent themselves with impunity they name fling at they as a opprobrium by superstition hatred and contempt they have remain proud of they origin do any one call this a evil pride perhaps he belong to that order of man who while he have a democratic dislike to duke and earl want to make believe that he father be a idle gentleman when in fact he be a honorable artisan or who would feel flattered to be take for other than a englishman it be possible to be too arrogant about we blood or we call but that arrogance be virtue compare with such mean pretence the pride which identify we with a great historic body be a humanise elevate habit of mind inspiring sacrifice of individual comfort gain or other selfish ambition for the sake of that ideal whole and no man sway by such a sentiment can become completely abject that a jew of smyrna where a whip be carry by passenger ready to flog off the too officious specimen of he race can still be proud to say i be a jew be surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of understand what we may call the ideal force in human history and again a varied impartial observation of the jew in different country tend to the impression that they have a predominant kindliness which must have be deeply ingrain in the constitution of they race to have outlast the age of persecution and oppression the concentration of they joy in domestic life have keep up in they the capacity of tenderness : the pity for the fatherless and the widow the care for the woman and the little one blent intimately with they religion be a well of mercy that can not long or widely be pen up by exclusiveness and the kindliness of the jew overflow the line of division between he and the gentile on the whole one of the most remarkable phenomenon in the history of this scattered people make for age a scorn and a hiss be that after be subject to this process which might have be expect to be in every sense deteriorate and vitiate they have come out of it -lrb- in any estimate which allow for numerical proportion -rrb- rival the nation of all european country in healthiness and beauty of _ physique _ in practical ability in scientific and artistic aptitude and in some form of ethical value a significant indication of they natural rank be see in the fact that at this moment the leader of the liberal party in germany be a jew the leader of the republican party in france be a jew and the head of the conservative ministry in england be a jew and here it be that we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which be now stimulate the revive expression of old antipathy the jew it be feel have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost place not only in commerce but in political life they monetary hold on government be tend to perpetuate in lead jew a spirit of universal alienism -lrb- euphemistically call cosmopolitanism -rrb- even where the west have give they a full share in civil and political rights a people with oriental sunlight in they blood yet capable of be everywhere acclimatise they have a force and toughness which enable they to carry off the best prize and they wealth be likely to put half the seat in parliament at they disposal there be truth in these view of jewish social and political relation but it be rather too late for liberal pleader to urge they in a merely vituperative sense do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger of we healthier national influence get override by jewish predominance that we should repeal we emancipatory law not all the germanic immigrant who have be settle among we for generation and be still pour in to settle be jew but thoroughly teutonic and more or less christian craftsman mechanician or skilled and erudite functionary and the semitic christian who swarm among we be dangerously like they unconverted brethren in complexion persistence and wealth then there be the greek who by the help of phoenician blood or otherwise be objectionably strong in the city some judge think that the scotch be more numerous and prosperous here in the south than be quite for the good of we southerner and the early inconvenience feel under the stuart of be quarter upon by a hungry hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of religion and higher cheek-bone than english taste require have not yet be quite neutralise as for the irish it be feel in high quarter that we have always be too lenient towards they -- at least if they have be harry a little more there might not have be so many of they on the english press of which they divide the power with the scotch thus drive many englishman to honest and ineloquent labor so far shall we be carry if we go in search of device to hinder people of other blood than we own from get the advantage of dwelling among we let it be admit that it be a calamity to the english as to any other great historic people to undergo a premature fusion with immigrant of alien blood that its distinctive national characteristic should be in danger of obliteration by the predominate quality of foreign settler i not only admit this i be ready to unite in groan over the threaten danger to one who love he native language who would delight to keep we rich and harmonious english undefiled by foreign accent foreign intonation and those foreign tincture of verbal meaning which tend to confuse all write and discourse it be a affliction as harassing as the climate that on we stage in we studio at we public and private gathering in we office warehouse and workshop we must expect to hear we beloved english with its word clip its vowel stretch and twist its phrase of acquiescence and politeness of cordiality dissidence or argument deliver always in the wrong tone like ill-rendered melody mar beyond recognition that there should be a general ambition to speak every language except we mother english which person of style be not ashamed of corrupt with slang false foreign equivalent and a pronunciation that crush out all color from the vowel and jam they between jostle consonant a ancient greek might not like to be resuscitate for the sake of hear homer read in we university still he would at least find more instructive marvel in other development to be witness at those institution but a modern englishman be invite from he after-dinner repose to hear shakspere deliver under circumstance which offer no other novelty than some novelty of false intonation some new distribution of strong emphasis on preposition some new misconception of a familiar idiom well it be we inertness that be in fault we carelessness of excellence we willing ignorance of the treasure that lie in we national heritage while we be agape after what be foreign though it may be only a vile imitation of what be native this marring of we speech however be a minor evil compare with what must follow from the predominance of wealth -- acquire immigrant whose appreciation of we political and social life must often be as approximative or fatally erroneous as they delivery of we language but take the worst issue -- what can we do to hinder they be we to adopt the exclusiveness for which we have punish the chinese be we to tear the glorious flag of hospitality which have make we freedom the world-wide blessing of the oppressed it be not agreeable to find foreign accent and stumble locution pass from the piquant exception to the general rule of discourse but to urge on that account that we should spike away the peaceful foreigner would be a view of international relation not in the long-run favourable to the interest of we fellow-countryman for we be at least equal to the race we call obtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money be to be make and cheaply idle live to be find in meet the national evil which be bring upon we by the onward course of the world there be often no more immediate hope or resource than that of strive after fuller national excellence which must consist in the moulding of more excellent individual native the tendency of thing be towards the quicker or slower fusion of race it be impossible to arrest this tendency : all we can do be to moderate its course so as to hinder it from degrade the moral status of society by a too rapid effacement of those national tradition and custom which be the language of the national genius -- the deep sucker of healthy sentiment such moderate and guidance of inevitable movement be worthy of all effort and it be in this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of nationality have value that any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form a state should be hold in subjection by a alien antipathetic government have be become more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation and in virtue of this at least one great state have be add to european council nobody now complain of the result in this case though far-sighted person see the need to limit analogy by discrimination we have to consider who be the stifled people and who the stifler before we can be sure of we ground the only point in this connection on which englishman be agree be that england itself shall not be subject to foreign rule the fiery resolve to resist invasion though with a improvise array of pitchfork be feel to be virtuous and to be worthy of a historic people why because there be a national life in we vein because there be something specifically english which we feel to be supremely worth strive for worth die for rather than live to renounce it because we too have we share -- perhaps a principal share -- in that spirit of separateness which have not yet do its work in the education of mankind which have create the vary genius of nation and like the muse be the offspring of memory here as everywhere else the human task seem to be the discerning and adjustment of opposite claim but the end can hardly be achieve by urge contradictory reproach and instead of labor after discernment as a preliminary to intervention let we zeal burst forth accord to a capricious selection first determine accidentally and afterwards justify by personal predilection not only john gilpin and he wife or edwin and angelina seem to be of opinion that they preference or dislike of russian servian or greek consequent perhaps on hotel adventure have something to do with the merit of the eastern question even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we find a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferer of different blood or votary of differ religion strangely unaccountable on any other ground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstance of travel with some even admirable person one be never quite sure of any particular be include under a general term a provincial physician it be say once order a lady patient not to eat salad be ask pleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce or cress or radish the physician have too rashly believe in the comprehensiveness of the word salad just as we if not enlighten by experience might believe in the all-embracing breadth of sympathy with the injured and oppressed what mind can exhaust the grounds of exception which lie in each particular case there be understand to be a peculiar odour from the negro body and we know that some person too rationalistic to feel bind by the curse on ham use to hint very strongly that this odour determine the question on the side of negro slavery and this be the usual level of think in polite society concern the jew apart from theological purpose it seem to be hold surprising that anybody should take a interest in the history of a people whose literature have furnish all we devotional language and if any reference be make to they past or future destiny some hearer be sure to state as a relevant fact which may assist we judgment that she for she part be not fond of they have know a mr jacobson who be very unpleasant or that he for he part think meanly of they as a race though on inquiry you find that he be so little acquaint with they characteristic that he be astonish to learn how many person whom he have blindly admire and applaud be jew to the backbone again man who consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement know history and the latest philosophy of history indicate they contemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the jew as a worthy subject by refer to moloch and they own agreement with the theory that the religion of jehovah be merely a transform moloch-worship while in the same breath they be glorify civilisation as a transform tribal existence of which some lineament be traceable in grim marriage custom of the native australian be these erudite person prepare to insist that the name father should no longer have any sanctity for we because in they view of likelihood we aryan ancestor be mere improver on a state of thing in which nobody know he own father for less theoretic man ambitious to be regard as practical politician the value of the hebrew race have be measure by they unfavourable opinion of a prime minister who be a jew by lineage but it be possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of walpole or of chatham and in any case i think englishman would refuse to accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesman as the standard of value for the english people and the part they have to play in the fortune of mankind if we be to consider the future of the jew at all it seem reasonable to take as a preliminary question : be they destine to complete fusion with the people among whom they be dispersed lose every remnant of a distinctive consciousness as jew or be there in the breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness or what we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness actually exist in the world-wide jewish community -- the seven million scatter from east to west -- and again be there in the political relation of the world the condition present or approach for the restoration of a jewish state plant on the old ground as a center of national feeling a source of dignify protection a special channel for special energy which may contribute some added form of national genius and a added voice in the council of the world they be among we everywhere : it be useless to say we be not fond of they perhaps we be not fond of proletary and they tendency to form union but the world be not therefore to be rid of they if we wish to free ourselves from the inconvenience that we have to complain of whether in proletary or in jew we best course be to encourage all means of improve these neighbor who elbow we in a thicken crowd and of send they incommodious energy into beneficent channel why be we so eager for the dignity of certain population of whom perhaps we have never see a single specimen and of whose history legend or literature we have be contentedly ignorant for age while we sneer at the notion of a renovate national dignity for the jew whose way of think and whose very verbal form be on we lip in every prayer which we end with a amen some of we consider this question dismiss when they have say that the wealthiest jew have no desire to forsake they european palace and go to live in jerusalem but in a return from exile in the restoration of a people the question be not whether certain rich man will choose to remain behind but whether there will be find worthy man who will choose to lead the return plenty of prosperous jew remain in babylon when ezra marshal he band of forty thousand and begin a new glorious epoch in the history of he race make the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world which have be hold glorious enough to be date from for evermore the hinge of possibility be simply the existence of a adequate community of feeling as well as widespread need in the jewish race and the hope that among its finer specimen there may arise some man of instruction and ardent public spirit some new ezras some modern maccabee who will know how to use all favor outward condition how to triumph by heroic example over the indifference of they fellow and the scorn of they foe and will steadfastly set they face towards make they people once more one among the nation formerly evangelical orthodoxy be prone to dwell on the fulfilment of prophecy in the restoration of the jew such interpretation of the prophet be less in vogue now the dominant mode be to insist on a christianity that disown its origin that be not a substantial growth have a genealogy but be a vaporous reflex of modern notion the christ of matthew have the heart of a jew -- go ye first to the lose sheep of the house of israel the apostle of the gentile have the heart of a jew : for i could wish that myself be accurse from christ for my brethren my kinsman accord to the flesh : who be israelite to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenant and the give of the law and the service of god and the promise whose be the father and of whom as concern the flesh christ come modern apostle extol christianity be find use a different tone : they prefer the mediaeval cry translate into modern phrase but the mediaeval cry too be in substance very ancient -- more ancient than the day of augustus pagan in successive age say these people be unlike we and refuse to be make like we : let we punish they the jew be steadfast in they separateness and through that separateness christianity be bear a modern book on liberty have maintain that from the freedom of individual man to persist in idiosyncrasy the world may be enriched why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy of a nation and pause in we haste to hoot it down there be still a great function for the steadfastness of the jew : not that he should shut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on he national history but that he should cherish the store of inheritance which that history have leave he every jew should be conscious that he be one of a multitude possess common object of piety in the immortal achievement and immortal sorrow of ancestor who have transmit to they a physical and mental type strong enough eminent enough in faculty pregnant enough with peculiar promise to constitute a new beneficent individuality among the nation and by confute the tradition of scorn nobly avenge the wrong do to they father there be a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that have bring forth illustrious prophet high and unique among the poet of the world be bind by they vision be bind yes for the effective bond of human action be feel and the worthy child of a people own the triple name of hebrew israelite and jew feel he kinship with the glory and the sorrow the degradation and the possible renovation of he national family will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call he doctrine a philosophy he will teach a blinding superstition -- the superstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be construct in disregard of the influence which have make we human the end end of project gutenberg 's impression of theophrastus such by george eliot
