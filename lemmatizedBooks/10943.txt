and the cable just as it be one man 's business to manufacture watch and another man 's business to peddle shoe-string so it be mr campbell 's business to know thing he be a human card index a governmental ready reference post to the minute and back by all the tremendous resource of a nation from the little office in the secret service bureau where he sit day after day radiate thread connect with the huge outer world and enable he to keep a firm hand on the diplomatic and departmental pulse of washington perhaps he come nearer know everything that happen there than any other man living and no man realize more perfectly than he just how little of all of it he do know in person mr campbell be not unlike a retired grocer who have shake the butter and egg from he soul and settle back to enjoy a life of placid idleness he be a little beyond middle age pleasant of face white of hair and bless with guileless blue eye he genius have no sparkle to it it consist solely of detail and system and indefatigability couple with a memory that be well nigh infallible he brain be as serene and orderly as a cash register one almost expect to hear it click he sit at he desk intently study a cable despatch which lay before he it be in the secret service code lean over he shoulder be mr grimm -- _ the _ mr grimm of the bureau mr grimm be a utterly different type from he chief he be younger perhaps thirty-one or two physically well proportion a little above the average height with regular feature and listless purposeless eye -- a replica of a hundred other young man who dawdle idly in the window of they club and watch the world hurry by he manner be languid he dress show fastidious care sentence by sentence the bewildering intricacy of the code give way before the placid understanding of chief campbell and word by word from the chaos of it a translation take intelligible form upon a sheet of paper under he right hand mr grimm look on exhibit only a most perfunctory interest in the extraordinary message he be read the listless eye narrow a little that be all it be a special despatch from lisbon date that morning and sign simply gault completely translate it run thus : secret offensive and defensive alliance of the latin against the english-speaking nation of the world be plan italy france spain and two south american republic will soon sign compact in washington proposition just make to portugal and may be accept special envoy now work in mexico and central and south america germany invite to join but refuse as yet give however tacit support attitude of russium and japan unknown to I prince benedetto d'abruzzus believe to be in washington at present have absolute power to sign for italy france and spain profound secrecy enjoin and preserve i learn of it by underground shall i inform we minister cable instruction so much comment mr campbell he clasp he hand behind he head lay back in he chair and sit for a long time stare with steadfast thoughtful eye into the impassive face of he subordinate mr grimm perch himself on the edge of the desk and with he leg dangle read the despatch a second time and a third if he observe slowly if any other man than gault have send that i should have say he be crazy the peace of the world be in peril mr grimm say campbell impressively at last it have to come of course the united state and england against a large part of europe and all of central and south america it have to come and yet -- he break off abruptly and pick up the receiver of he desk telephone the white house please he request curtly and then after a moment : hello please ask the president if he will receive mr campbell immediately yes mr campbell of the secret service there be a pause mr grimm remove he immaculate person from the desk and take a chair hello in half a hour so much the page of the almanac de gotha flutter through he finger and finally he lean forward and study a paragraph of it closely when he raise he eye again there be that in they which mr grimm have never see before -- a settle darkening shadow the world-war have long be a chimera mr grimm he remark at last but now -- now think of it of course the central and south american country take separately be inconsequential and that be true too of the latin country of europe except france but take in combination under one direct mind the ally navy would be -- would be formidable at least back by the moral support of germany and perhaps japan -- do not you see do not you see he lapse into silence mr grimm open he lip to ask a question : mr campbell anticipate it unerringly : the purpose of such a alliance it be not too much to construe it into the first step toward a world-war -- a war of reprisal and conquest beside which the other great war of the world would seem trivial for the fact have at last come home to the nation of the world that ultimately the english-speaking people will dominate it -- dominate it because they be the practical people they have give to the world all its great practical invention -- the railroad the steamship electricity the telegraph and cable -- all of they they be the great civilizing force round the world up to new moral understanding for what england have do in africa and indium we have do in a smaller way in the philippine and cuba and porto rico they be the great commercial people slowly but surely win the market-place of the earth wherever the english or the american flag be plant there the english tongue be be speak and there the people be be teach the sanity of right living and square deal it require no great effort of the imagination mr grimm to foresee that day when the traditional power of pari and berlin and st petersburg and madrid will be honey-combed by the steady encroachment of we method this alliance would indicate that already that day have be foresee that there be now a resentment which be about to find expression in one great desperate struggle for world supremacy a few hundred year ago italy -- or rome -- be strip of she power only recently the united state dispel the illusion that spain be anything but a shell and france -- one can not help but wonder if the power she boast be not principally on paper but if they force be combine do you see it would be a enormous power to reckon with with a hundred basis of supplies right at we door he rise suddenly and walk over to the window where he stand for a moment stare out with unseeing eye give a yard of canvas mr grimm he go on finally a spanish boy will waste it a french boy will paint a picture on it a english boy will build a sail-boat and a american boy will erect a tent that fully illustrate the difference in the race he abandon the didactic tone and return to the material matter in hand mr grimm pass he the despatch and he sit down again ` will soon sign compact in washington ' he read musingly now i do not know that the signing of that compact can be prevent but the signing of it on unite state soil can be prevent you will see to that mr grimm very well the young man agree carelessly the magnitude of such a task make apparently not the slightest impression on he he languidly draw on he glove and meanwhile i shall take step to ascertain the attitude of russian and japanese representative in this city mr grimm nod and now for prince benedetto d'abruzzus mr campbell go on slowly officially he be not in washington nor the united state for that matter naturally on such a mission he would not come as a publicly accredited agent therefore i imagine he be to be seek under another name of course mr grimm acquiesce and he would avoid the big hotel certainly mr campbell permit he guileless blue eye to linger inquiringly upon those of the young man for half a minute he catch himself wonder sometimes at the perfection of the deliberate indifference with which mr grimm mask he emotion in he admiration of this quality he quite overlook the remarkable mask of benevolence behind which he himself hide and the name d'abruzzus he remark after a time what do it mean to you mr grimm it mean that i be to deal with a prince of the royal blood of italy be the unhesitating response mr grimm pick up the almanac de gotha and glance at the open page of course the first thing to do be to find he the rest will be simple enough he peruse the page carelessly i will begin work at once iii the language of the fan mr grimm be chat idly with señorita rodriguez daughter of the minister from venezuela the while he permit he listless eye to wander aimlessly about the spacious ball-room of the german embassy ablaze with festoon light and brilliant with a multi-colored chaos of uniform gleam pearl-white translucent in the mass be the bare shoulder of woman and from far off come the plaintive whine of a orchestra a pulsing sense rather than a living sound of music point here and there by the staccato cry of a flute a zephyr perfumed with the clean fresh odor of lilac stir the drapery of the archway which lead into the conservatory and rustle the bend branch of palm and fern for a scant instant mr grimm 's eye rest on a young woman who sit a dozen foot away talk in playful animation with a undersecretary of the british embassy -- a young woman severely gown in some glistening stuff which fall away sheerly from she splendid bare shoulder she glance up as if in acknowledgment of he look and she eye meet he frank blue-gray eye they be stir to they depths now by amusement she smile at señorita rodriguez in token of recognition be not they wonderful ask señorita rodriguez with the quick bubble enthusiasm of she race what ask mr grimm she eye be the reply every person have one dominant feature -- with miss thorne it be she eye miss thorne mr grimm repeat have not you meet she the señorita go on miss isabel thorne she only arrive a few day ago -- the night of the state ball she be my guest at the legation when a opportunity come i shall present you to she she run on about other thing with only a occasional remark from mr grimm who be thoughtfully nurse he knee somewhere through the chatter and effervescent gaiety mingle with the sound of the pulsing music he have a singular impression of a rhythmical beat a indistinct tattoo noticeable perhaps only because of its monotony after a moment he shoot a quick glance at miss thorne and understand it be the tap of a exquisitely work ivory fan against one of she taper gloved finger she be talk and smile dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot say the fan mr grimm twist around in he seat and regale he listless eye with a long stare into the señorita 's pretty face behind the careless ease of repose he be mechanically isolate the faint clatter of the fan dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot do any one ever accuse you of stare mr grimm demand the señorita banteringly for a instant mr grimm continue to stare and then he listless eye sweep the ball-room pause involuntarily at the scarlet splendor of the minister from turkey i beg you pardon he apologize contritely there be a pause the minister from turkey look like a barn on fire do not he señorita rodriguez laugh and mr grimm glance idly toward miss thorne she be still talk she face alive with interest and the fan be still tap rhythmically steadily now on the arm of she chair dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot pretty woman who do not want to be stare at should go with they face swathe mr grimm suggest indolently haroun el raschid there would agree with I on that point i have no doubt what a shock he would get if he should happen up at atlantic city for a week-end in August dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot dot-dash-dot mr grimm read it with perfect understanding it be f -- f -- f in the morse code the call of one operator to another be it accident mr grimm wonder and wonder he go on talk lazily : curious be not it the smaller the nation the more color it crowd into the uniform of its diplomatist the british ambassador you will observe be clothe sanely and modestly as befit the representative of a great nation but come on down by way of spain and italy they get more gorgeous however i dare say as stout a heart beat beneath a sky-blue sash as behind the unembellished black of evening dress f -- f -- f the fan be call insistently and then the answer come it take the unexpectedly prosaic form of a violent sneeze a vociferous outburst on a bench directly behind mr grimm señorita rodriguez jump then laugh nervously it startle I she explain i think there must be a draft from the conservatory say a man 's voice apologetically do you lady feel it no well if you 'll excuse I -- mr grimm glance back languidly the speaker be charle winthrop rankin a brilliant young american lawyer who be attach to the german embassy in a advisory capacity among other thing he be a heidelberg man have spend some dozen year of he life in germany where he establish influential connection mr grimm know he only by sight and now the rhythmical tap of miss thorne 's fan undergo a change there be a flutter of gaiety in she voice the while the ivory fan tap steadily dot-dot-dot dash dash-dash-dash dot-dot-dash dash s -- t -- 5 -- u -- t mr grimm read in morse he laugh pleasantly at some remark of he companion dash-dash dot-dash dash-dot say the fan m -- a -- n mr grimm spell it out the while he listless eye rove aimlessly over the throng s -- t -- 5 -- u -- t m -- a -- n be it mean for stout man mr grimm wonder dot-dash-dot dot dash-dot-dot f -- e -- d that be dot-dot-dash-dot dot-dash dash-dot-dash-dot dot q -- a -- j -- e mr grimm be puzzle a little now but there be not a wrinkle nor the tiniest indication of perplexity in he face instead he begin talk of raphael 's cherub the remark be call into life by the high complexion of a young man who be pass miss thorne glance at he once keenly she splendid eye fairly aglow and the fan rattle on in the code dash-dot dot dot-dash dot-dash-dot n -- e -- a -- f mr grimm be still spell it out then come a perfect jumble mr grimm follow it with difficulty a difficulty utterly belie by the quizzical line about he mouth as he catch it it be like this : j -- 5 -- n -- s -- e -- f -- v -- a -- t -- 5 -- f follow by a arbitrary signal which be not in the morse code : dash-dot-dash-dash mr grimm carefully store that jumble away in some recess of he brain along with the unknown signal d -- 5 -- 5 -- f he read and then on to the end : b -- f -- i -- n -- g 5 -- v -- e -- f w -- h -- e -- n g g -- 5 -- e -- s that be all apparently the soft clatter of the fan against the arm of the chair run on meaninglessly after that may i bring you a ice mr grimm ask at last if you will please respond the señorita and when you come back i 'll reward you by present you to miss thorne you 'll find she charming and mr cadwallader have monopolize she long enough mr grimm bow and leave she he have barely disappear when mr rankin lounge along in front of miss thorne he glance at she pause and greet she effusively why miss thorne he exclaim i be delighted to see you here i understand you would not be present and -- they hand meet in a friendly clasp as she rise and move away with a nod of excuse to mr cadwallader a thin slip of paper thrice fold pass from mr rankin to she she tug at she glove and thrust the little paper still fold inside the palm be it yes or no miss thorne ask in a low tone frankly i can not say be the reply he read the message she explain hastily and now he have go to decipher it she gather up she trail skirt over one arm and together they glide away through the crowd to the strain of a strauss waltz i be go to faint in a moment she say quite calmly to mr rankin please have I send to the lady ' dressing-room i understand he reply quietly iv the flee woman mr grimm go straight to a quiet nook of the smoking-room and there after a moment mr campbell join he the bland benevolence

message that seem to be unintelligible mr grimm explain i have reason to believe it be in the continental code you know the continental -- i do not mr campbell read this : st5ut man feed qaje neaf j5nsefvat5f and then come the unknown dash-dot-dash-dash that he explain be y in the continental code it go on : d55f bfing 5vef when g g5e the chief read it off glibly : stout man red face near

impulsively start toward the little group but already a cordon be be draw there -- a cordon of quiet-faced keen-eyed man unobstrusively force they way through the crowd there be johnson and hasting and blair and half a dozen other the room have be strike dumb the dancer stop with tense inquire look and the plaintive whine of the orchestra far away falter then cease there be one brief instant of utter silence in which white-faced woman cling to the arm of they escort and the brilliant galaxy of color halt then after a moment there come clearly through the stillness the excited guttural command of the german ambassador keep on blay you tam fool keep on blay the orchestra start again tremulously mr grimm nod a silent approval of the ambassador 's command then turn away toward he left in the direction of the shot after the first dismay there be a general movement of the crowd in that direction a movement which be check by mr campbell 's appearance upon a chair with a smile on he bland face no harm do he call one of the officer present drop he revolver and it be accidently discharge no harm do there be a moment 's excited chatter deep-drawn breath of relief the orchestra swing

be evidently for the moment transfer to other post he pass on through the kitchen and out the back door into the street a little distance away lean against a lamp-post a man be stand he might have be wait for a car mr grimm approach he beg pardon he say do you see a woman come out of the back door there yes just a moment or so ago reply the stranger she get into a automobile at the corner i imagine this be hers and he extend a handkerchief a dainty perfumed trifle of lace i pick it up immediately after she pass mr grimm take the handkerchief and examine it under the light for a time he be thoughtful with lowered eye which finally raise meet those of the stranger with a scrutinize stare why ask mr grimm slowly and distinctly why do you slam the door in the girl 's face why do i -- what come the answer question why do you slam the door in the girl 's face mr grimm repeat slowly the stranger stare in utter amazement -- a amazement so frank so unacted so genuine that mr grimm be satisfied do you see a man come out the door mr grimm pursue no say young fellow i guess you have have a little too much to drink have not you but by that time mr grimm be turn the corner v a visit to the count the bland serenity of mr campbell 's face be disturb by thin spidery line of perplexity and the guileless blue eye be vacant as he stare at the top of he desk mr grimm be talk from the moment miss thorne turn the corner i lose all trace of she he say either she have a automobile in wait or else she be lucky enough to find one immediately she come out she do not return to the embassy

night for two reason mr grimm continue first she can have no possible knowledge of the fact that she be suspect unless perhaps the man who slam the door -- he pause anyway she will not attempt to leave washington i be confident of that again it do not seem wise to I to employ the ordinary crude police method in the case -- that be go to the venezuelan legation and kick up a row for a long time campbell be silent the perplexed line still furrow he benevolent forehead the president be very anxious that we get to fact in this report latin alliance as soon as possible he say at last irrelevantly he mention the matter last night and he have be keep in constant communication with gault in lisbon who however have not be able to add materially to the original despatch under all the circumstance do not you think it would be best for I to relieve you of the investigation of this shooting affair so that you can concentrate on this greater and more important thing will señor alvarez die ask mr grimm in turn he condition be serious although the wound be not necessarily fatal be the reply mr grimm arise stretch he long leg and stand for a little while gaze out the window finally he turn to he chief : what do we know here in the bureau about miss thorne thus far the report on she are of the usual perfunctory nature mr campbell explain he draw a card from a pigeonhole of he desk and glance at it she arrive in washington two week and two day ago from new york off the _ lusitanium _ from liverpool she bring some sort of a introduction to count di rosini the italian ambassador and he obtain for she a special invitation to the state ball which be hold that night until four day ago she be a guest at the italian embassy but now as you know be a guest at the venezuelan legation since she arrival here she have be prominently push forward into society she have go everywhere and be receive everywhere in the diplomatic set we have no knowledge of she beyond this there be a question in mr grimm 's listless eye as they meet those of he chief the same line of thought be run in both they mind bear perhaps of the association of idea -- italy as one of three great nation know to be in the latin compact prince benedetto d'abruzzus of italy the secret envoy of three country the sudden appearance of miss thorne at the italian embassy and in the mind of the younger man there be more than this -- a definite knowledge of a message cunningly transmit to mr rankin of the german embassy by miss thorne there in the ball-room can you imagine -- he ask slowly can you imagine a person who would be of more value to the latin government in washington right at this stage of the negotiation than a brilliant woman agent i most certainly can not be the chief 's unhesitating response in that case i _ do not _ think it would be wise to transfer the investigation of the shooting affair to another man say mr grimm emphatically revert to he chief 's question i think on the contrary we should find out more about miss thorne precisely campbell agree ask all the great capital about she -- madrid pari and rome particularly then perhaps london and berlin and st petersburg mr campbell thoughtfully scribble the name of the city on a slip of paper do you intend to arrest miss thorne for the shooting he query i do not know reply mr grimm frankly i do not know he repeat musingly if i _ do _ arrest she immediately i may cut off a clue which will lead to the other affair i do not know he conclude use you own judgment and bear in mind that a man -- _ a man _ slam the door in the maid 's face i shall not forget he mr grimm answer now i be go over to talk to count di rosini for a while the young man go out thoughtfully tug at he glove the italian ambassador receive he with a inquire uplift of he dark brow i come to make some inquiry in regard to miss thorne -- miss isabel thorne mr grimm inform he frankly the count be surprised but it do not appear in he face as i understand it the young man pursue you be sponsor for she in washington the count evasively diplomatic bear and breed in a school of caution consider the question from every standpoint it may be that i be so regard he admit at last may i inquire if the sponsorship be official personal social or all three mr grimm continue there be silence for a long time i do not see the trend of you question say the ambassador finally miss thorne be worthy of my protection in every way let 's suppose a case suggest mr grimm blandly suppose miss thorne have -- have let we say shoot a man and he be about to die would you feel justified in withdraw that -- that protection as you call it such a thing be preposterous exclaim the ambassador the utter absurdity of such a charge would impel I to offer she every assistance mr grimm nod and if it be prove to you satisfaction that she _ do _ shoot he he go on evenly the count 's lip be draw together in a straight line whom may i ask he inquire frigidly be we suppose that miss thorne shot no one particularly mr grimm assure he easily just suppose that she _ have _ shot anybody -- I say or señor alvarez i can not answer a question so ridiculous as that and suppose we go a little further mr grimm insist pleasantly and assume that you _ know _ she _ have _ shoot some one say señor alvarez and you _ could _ protect she from the consequence _ would _ you i decline to suppose anything so utterly absurd be the rejoinder mr grimm sit with he elbow on he knee idly twist a seal ring on he little finger the search eye of the ambassador find he face blankly inscrutable diplomatic representative in washington have certain obligation to this government the young man remind he we -- that be the government of the united state -- undertake to guarantee the personal safety of every accredit representative in return for that protection we must insist upon the name and identity of a dangerous person who may be know to any foreign representative understand please i be not assert that miss thorne be a dangerous person you be sponsor for she here be she in every way worthy of you protection yes say the ambassador flatly i can take it then that the introduction she bring to you be from a person whose position be high enough to insure miss thorne 's position that be correct very well and mr grimm go away vi revelation some vague indefinable shadow darken miss thorne 's clear blue-gray eye in sharp contrast to the glow of radiant health in she cheek as she step from a automobile in front of the venezuelan legation and run lightly up the step a liveried servant open the door a gentleman be wait for you madam he announce he card be here on the -- i be expect he she interrupt which room please the blue room madam miss thorne pass along the hallway which lead to a suite of small drawing-room open on a garden in the rear push aside the portières and enter i be sorry i have keep you -- she begin and then in a tone of surprise : i beg you pardon a gentleman rise and bow gravely i be mr grimm of the secret service he inform she with frank courtesy i be afraid you be expect some one else i hand my card to the footman for a instant the blue-gray eye open wide in astonishment and then some quick subtle change sweep over miss thorne 's face she smile graciously and motion he to a seat this be quite a different meeting from the one señorita rodriguez have plan be not it she ask there be a taunt curve on she scarlet lip the shadow pass from she eye she slim white hand lay idle in she lap mr grimm regard she reflectively there be a determination of steel back of this charming exterior there be a indomitable will a keen brain and all of a woman 's intuition to reckon with she be silent with a question upward slant of she arched brow i be not mistake in assume that you be a secret agent of the italian government be i he query finally no she respond readily in that event i may speak with perfect frankness he go on it would be as useless as it would be absurd to approach the matter in any other manner it be a question miss thorne be still smile but again the vague indefinable shadow momentarily lift darken she eye you may be frank of course she say pleasantly please go on señor alvarez be shoot at the german embassy ball last night mr grimm tell she miss thorne nod as if in wonder do you or do you not shoot he it be quite casual she receive the question without change of countenance but involuntarily she catch she breath it might have be a sigh of relief why do you come to I with such a query she ask in turn i beg you pardon interpose mr grimm steadily do you or do you not shoot he no of course i do not shoot he be the reply if there be any emotion in the tone it be merely impatience why do you come to I she repeat why do i come to you mr grimm echo the question while he listless eye rest on she face i will be absolutely frank as i feel sure you would be under the same circumstance he pause a moment she nod well immediately after the shooting you run along the hallway with a revolver in you hand you run down the step into the kitchen and out through the back door where you enter a automobile that be not conjecture it be susceptible of proof by eye witness miss thorne rise suddenly with a queer helpless little gesture of she arm and walk to the window she stand there for a long time with she hand clasp behind she back that bring we to another question mr grimm continue mercilessly if you do not shoot señor alvarez do you know who do there be another long pause i want to believe you miss thorne he supplement she turn quickly with something of defiance in she attitude yes i know she say slowly it be useless to deny it who be it i will not tell you mr grimm lean forward in he chair and speak earnestly understand please that by that answer you assume equal guilt with the person who actually do the shooting he explain if you adhere to it you compel I to regard you as a accomplice he question take a different line will you explain how the revolver come into you possession oh i -- i pick it up in the hallway there she reply vaguely i want to believe you miss thorne mr grimm say again you may i pick it up in the hallway she repeat i see it lie there and pick it up why that instead of give a alarm no alarm be necessary the shot itself be a alarm then why mr grimm persist coldly do you run along the hallway and escape by way of the kitchen if you do not do the shooting why the necessity of escape carry the revolver there be that in the blue-gray eye which bring mr grimm to he foot he hand grip each other cruelly he tone be calm as always why do you take the revolver he ask miss thorne 's head droop forward a little and she be silent there be only two possibility of course he go on first that you in spite of you denial do the shooting i do not the word fairly burst from she tightly close lip or that you know the revolver and take it to save the person man or woman who fire the shot i will assume for the moment that this be correct where be the revolver from the adjoining room there come a slight noise a faint breath of sound or it might have be only a echo of silence they eye be fix each upon the other unwaveringly with not a flicker to indicate that either have hear after a moment miss thorne return to she chair and sit down it be rather a singular situation be not it mr grimm she inquire irrelevantly you mr grimm of the secret service of the united state i isabel thorne a secret agent of italy together here one accuse the other of a crime and perhaps with good reason where be the revolver mr grimm insist if you be any one else _ but _ you i could not afford to be frank with you and -- if you have be any one else but _ you _ i should have place you under arrest when i enter the room she smile and incline she head i understand she say pleasantly for the reason that you be mr grimm of the secret service i shall tell you the truth i _ do _ take the revolver because i know who have fire the shot believe I when i tell you that that person do not act with my knowledge or consent you do believe that you do she be plead eager to convince he after a while mr grimm nod the revolver be beyond you reach and shall remain so she resume accord to you law i suppose i be a accomplice that be my misfortune it will in no way alter my determination to keep silent if i be arrest i can not help it she study he face with hopeful eye be i to be arrest where be the paper that be take from señor alvarez immediately after he be shoot mr grimm query i do not know she reply frankly as i understand it then the motive for the shooting be to obtain possession of that paper for you government the individual who shoot señor alvarez _ do _ obtain the paper yes and now please be i to be arrest and just what be the purpose may i inquire of the message you telegraph with you fan in the ball-room you read that exclaimed miss thorne in mock astonishment you read that and the man who read that message perhaps he shoot the señor perhaps she taunt for a long time mr grimm stand stare at she stare stare she too rise and face he quietly be i to be arrest she ask again why do you make I do it he demand that be my affair mr grimm lay a hand upon she arm a hand that have never know nervousness a moment longer he stare and then : madam you be my prisoner for the attempt murder of señor alvarez the ring on the portières behind he click sharply and the drapery part mr grimm stand motionless with he hand on miss thorne 's arm you be inquire a moment ago for a revolver come in a man 's voice here it be mr grimm find himself inspect the weapon from the barrel end after a moment he glance shift to the blaze eye of the man who hold it -- a young man rather slight with clean-cut aristocratic feature and of the pronounced italian type -lrb- illustration : he find himself inspect the weapon from the barrel end -rrb- my god the word come from miss thorne 's lip almost in a scream do not -- i do make some inquiry about a revolver yes mr grimm interrupted quietly be this the one he raise he hand quite casually and he finger close like steel around the weapon behind he back miss thorne make some quick emphatic gesture and the new-comer release the revolver i shall ask you please to free miss thorne he request courteously i shoot señor alvarez i too be a secret agent of the italian government willing and able to defend myself miss thorne have tell you the truth she have nothing whatever to do with it she take the weapon and escape because it be mine here be the paper that be take from señor alvarez and he offer a seal envelope i have read it it be not what i expect you may return it to señor alvarez with my compliment after a moment mr grimm 's hand fall away from miss thorne 's arm and he regard the new-comer with a interest in which admiration even play a part you name he ask finally pietro petrozinni be the ready reply as i say i accept all responsibility a few minute later mr grimm and he prisoner pass out of the legation side by side and stroll down the street together in amicable conversation half a hour later señor alvarez identify pietro petrozinnus as the man who shoot he and the maid servant express a belief that he be the man who slam the door in she face vii the signal and the original question remain unanswered remark mr campbell the original question repeat mr grimm _ where _ be prince benedetto d'abruzzi the secret envoy he chief remind he i wonder muse the young man if the latin compact be sign in the united state -- the latin compact will _ not _ be sign in the united state mr grimm interrupted and then after a moment : have we receive any further report on miss thorne i mean report from we foreign agent the chief shake he head inevitably by some act or word she will lead we to the prince declare mr grimm and the moment he be know to we everything become plain sailing we know she _ be _ a secret agent -- i expect a denial but she be quite frank about it and i have no intention whatever of place she under arrest i know some one be in the adjoining room because of a slight noise in there and i know she know it she raise she voice a little obviously for the benefit of whoever be there from that point everything i say and do be to compel that person whoever it be to show himself he chief nod understandingly mr grimm be silent for a little then go on : the last possibility in my mind at that moment he confess be that the person in there be the man who shoot señor alvarez frankly i have half a idea that -- that it might be the prince in person suddenly he mood change : and now we lady of mystery may come and go as she like because i know even if a dozen of we man have ransack washington in vain for the prince she will inevitably lead we to he and that remind I : i should like to borrow blair and hasting and johnson please plant they so they may keep constant watch on miss thorne let they report to you and wherever i be i will reach you over the ` phone by the way what be in that seal packet that be take from señor alvarez campbell inquire curiously it have something to do with some railroad franchise respond mr grimm as he rise i seal it again and return it to the señor evidently it be not what signor petrozinnus expect to find -- in fact he admit it be not what he be look for for a little while the two man gaze thoughtfully each into the eye of the other then mr grimm enter he private office where he sit for a hour with he immaculate boot on he desk think a world-war -- he have be thrust forward by he government to prevent it -- subtle blue-gray eye -- he highness prince benedetto d'abruzzus -- a haunt smile and scarlet lip at about the moment he rise to go out miss thorne closely veil leave the venezuelan legation and walk rapidly down the street to a corner where without a word she enter a wait automobile the wheel spin and the car leap forward for a mile or more it wind aimlessly in and out occasionally bisect its own path finally miss thorne lean forward and touch the chauffeur on the arm now she say the car straighten out into a street of stately residence and scuttle along until the placid bosom of the potomac come into view beside that for a few minute then over the bridge to the virginia side in the dilapidated little city of alexandrium the car do not slacken its speed but wound in and out through dingy street past tumble-down negro hut for half a hour before it come to a standstill in front of a old brick mansion this be number ninety-seven the chauffeur announce miss thorne enter the house with a key and be go for ten minute perhaps she be readjust she veil when she come out and step into the car silently again it move forward on to the end of the dingy street and finally into the open country three four five mile perhaps out the old baltimore road and again the car stop this time in front of a ancient colonial farm-house outwardly the place seem to be desert the blind batter and strip of paint by wind and rain be all close and one corner of the small veranda have crumble away from age and neglect a narrow path strew with pine needle lead tortuously up to the door in the rear of the house rise from a old barn a thin pole with a cup-like attachment at the apex thrust its point into the open above the dense odorous pine it appear to be a wireless mast miss thorne pass around the house and enter the barn a man come forward and kiss she -- a thin little man of indeterminate age -- dry he hand on a piece of cotton waste he face be pale with the pallor of one who know little outdoor life he eye deep-set and a-glitter with some feverish inward fire and the thin lip be press together in a sharp line behind he be a long bench on which be scatter tool of various sort fantastically shaped chemical apparatus two or three electric battery of odd size and range along one end of it in a row be a score or more metal spheroid a shade larger than a one-pound shell from somewhere in the rear come the clatter of a small gasoline engine and still farther away be a electric dynamo be the test arrange rosa the little man query eagerly in italian the date be not fix yet she reply in the same language it will be i hope within the next two week and then -- fame and fortune for both of we he interrupt with quick enthusiasm ah rosa i have work and wait so long for this and now it will come and with it the dominion of the world again by we country how will i know when the date be fix it would not be well to write I here my lady of mystery stroke the slender nervous hand caressingly and a great affection shone in the blue-gray eye at eight o'clock on the night of the test she explain still speak italian a single light will appear at the apex of the capitol dome in washington that be the signal agree upon it can be see by all in the city and be visible here from the window of you bedroom yes yes he exclaim the feverish glitter in he eye deepen if there be a fog of course you will not attempt the test she go on no not in a fog he put in quickly it must be clear and if it be clear you can see the light in the dome without difficulty and all you plan be work out well yes and yours i do not think there be any question but that both england and the united state will buy do you know what it mean do you know what it mean he be silent a moment he hand work nervously then with a effort : and he highness he highness be safe the subtle eye grow misty thoughtful for a moment then clear again he be safe she repeat mexico and venezuelum be -- he begin we do not know yet what they will do the venezuelan answer be lock in the safe at the legation i will know what it be within forty-eight hour she be silent a little we difficulty now we greatest difficulty be the hostility of the french ambassador to the compact he government have not yet notify he of the presence of prince d'abruzzus he do not believe in the feasibility of the plan and we have to -- to proceed to extreme to prevent he work against we but they _ must _ see the incalculable advantage to follow upon such a compact with the vast power that will be give to they over the whole earth by this he indicate the long litter work-table they _ must _ see it they will see it luigus say miss thorne gently and now how be you be you well be you comfortable it be such a dreary old place here i suppose so he reply and he meet the solicitous blue-gray eye for a instant yes i be quite comfortable he add i have no time to be otherwise with all the work i must do it will mean so much they be both silent for a time finally miss thorne walk over to the long table and curiously lift one of the spheroid it be a sinister look thing nickel glitter at one end of it be a delicate vibratory apparatus not unlike the transmitter of a telephone and the other end be thread as if the spheroid be make as a attachment to some other device with that we control the world exclaim the man triumphantly and it be mine rosa mine it be wonderful she muse softly wonderful and now i must go i may not see you again until after the test because i shall be watch and follow wherever i go if i get a opportunity i shall reach you by telephone but not even that unless it be necessary there be always danger always danger she repeat thoughtfully she be think of mr grimm i understand say the man simply and look out for the signal -- the light in the apex of the capitol dome she go on i understand the night must be perfectly clear and _ you _ understand that the test be to be make promptly at three o'clock by you chronometer at three o'clock he repeat for a moment they stand with they arm around each other then tenderly he visitor kiss he and go out he remain look after she vacantly until the chug-chug of she automobile as it move off down the road be lose in the distance then turn again to the long work-table viii miss thorne and not miss thorne from a pleasant wide-open bay-window of she apartment on the second floor miss thorne look out upon the avenue with inscrutable eye behind the closely draw shutter of another bay-window farther down the avenue on the corner she know a man name hasting be hide she know that for a hour or more he have be watch she as she write

last she rise and standing in the window read the note over fold it place it in a envelope and seal it a maid come in answer to she ring and there at the window under the watchful eye of blair and hasting -- and perhaps johnson -- she hand the note to the maid with instruction to mail it immediately two minute later she see the maid go out along the avenue to a post-box on the corner then she draw back into the shadow of the room slip on a dark-colored wrap and stand away from the window safe beyond the reach of prying eye wait patiently for the postman he appear about five o'clock and simultaneously another man turn the corner near the post-box and speak to he then together they disappear from view around the corner so that be johnson be it muse miss thorne and she smile a little mr grimm certainly pay I the compliment of have I carefully watch a few minute later she drop into the seat at the desk again the dark wrap have be throw aside and hasting and blair from they

the negotiation throughout have be in strict secrecy and mr campbell smile benignly so much now señor rodriguez have just telephone ask that i send a man to the legation at once the gold be keep there over night or perhaps i should say that the señor intend to keep it there over night mr campbell stare at mr grimm for a moment then : miss thorne you know be a guest at the legation that be why i be refer the matter to you i understand say mr grimm and ten minute later mr grimm present himself to señor rodriguez the minister from venezuelum bubble with excitement be pacing forth and back across he office ruffle he gray-black hair with nervous twine finger mr grimm sit down señor he inquire placidly fifty thousand dollar in gold would weigh nearly two hundred pound would not it señor rodriguez stare at he blankly _ si señor _ he agree absently and then in english : yes i should imagine so well be all of it steal or only a part of it mr grimm go on the minister gaze into the listless eye for a time then apparently bewildered walk forth and back across the room again finally he sit down all of it he admit i can not understand it no one not a soul in this house except myself know it be here in addition to this weight of say two hundred pound fifty thousand dollar would make considerable bulk muse mr grimm very well therefore it would appear that the person or person who get it must have go away from here heavily laden señor rodriguez nod and now señor mr grimm continue if you will kindly state the circumstance immediately precede and follow the theft a slight frown which have be grow upon the smooth brow of the diplomatist be instantly dissipate the money -- fifty thousand dollar in gold coin -- be pay to I yesterday afternoon about four o'clock he begin slowly in explanation by mr cressy of the international investment company supplement mr grimm yes go on the diplomatist favor the young man with one sharp inquire glance and continue : the gentleman who pay the money remain here from four until nine o'clock while i personally count it as i count it i place it in canvas bag and when he have go i take these bag from this room into that he indicate a closed door to he right and personally stow they away in the safe i close and lock the door of the safe myself i _ know _ that it _ be _ lock and that be all except this morning the money be go -- every dollar of it safe blow inquire mr grimm no señor exclaim the diplomatist with sudden violence no the safe be not blow it be _ close and lock _ exactly as i have leave it mr grimm be idly twist the seal ring on he little finger just as i leave it señor rodriguez repeat excitedly last night after i lock the safe door i try it to make certain that it _ be _ lock i happen to notice then that the pointer on the dial have stop precisely at number forty-five this morning when i unlock the safe -- and of course i do not know then that the money have be take -- the pointer be still at number forty-five he pause with one hand in the air mr grimm continue to twist the seal ring it be all like -- like some trick on the stage the minister go on like the magician 's disappear lady or -- or -- it be as though i have not put the money into the safe at all do you inquire mr grimm amiably do i blazed señor rodriguez why señor -- i do he conclude meekly mr grimm believe he who else know the combination of the safe he query no one señor -- not a living soul you secretary for instance not even my secretary some servant -- some member of you family i tell you señor not one person in all the world know that combination except myself señor rodriguez insist you secretary -- a servant -- some member of you family might have see you unlock the safe some time and thus learn the combination señor rodriguez do not quite know whether to be annoy at mr grimm 's persistence or to admire the tenacity with which he hold to this one point you must understand señor grimm that many state document be keep in the safe he say finally therefore it be not advisable that any one should know the combination i have make it a absolute rule as do my predecessor here never to unlock the safe in the presence of another person state document mr grimm 's lip silently repeat the word then aloud : perhaps there be a record of the combination somewhere if you have die suddenly for instance how would the safe have be open there would have be only one way señor -- blow it open there be no record well if we accept all that as true observe mr grimm musingly it would seem that you either do not put the money into the safe at all or -- please sit down there be nothing personal in this -- or else the money be take out of the safe without it be unlock this last would have be a miracle and this be not the day of miracle therefore -- mr grimm 's well modulate voice trail off into silence señor rodriguez come to he foot with a blaze of anger in he eye mr grimm be watch he curiously i understand then señor say the minister deliberately that you believe that i -- i believe that you have tell the truth interrupted mr grimm placidly that be the truth so far as you know it but you have state one thing in error somebody besides yourself _ do _ know the combination whether they know it or not at this time yesterday i can not say but somebody know it now señor rodriguez draw a deep breath of relief the imply accusation have be withdraw as pleasantly and frankly as it have be put forward i run across a chap in new york once for instance mr grimm take the trouble to explain who could unlock any safe -- that be any safe of the kind use at that time -- twelve or fourteen year ago so you see i doubt if he would be so successful with the new model with all they improvement but then -- you know he would have make a ideal burglar that chap now señor who live here in the legation with you my secretary señor diaz my daughter inez and just at the moment a miss thorne -- miss isabel thorne the señor inform he also four servant -- two man and two woman i have have the pleasure of meet you daughter and miss thorne mr grimm inform he now suppose we take a look at the safe

miss thorne xi the lace handkerchief still wear the graceful filmy morning gown with a add touch of scarlet in she hair -- a single red rise -- miss thorne come into the drawing-room where mr grimm sit wait there be curiosity in she manner thinly veil but the haunt smile still linger about she lip mr grimm bow low and place a chair for she after which he stand for a time stare down at one slim white hand at rest on the arm of the seat at last he too sit down i believe he say slowly without preliminary this be you handkerchief he offer the lacy trifle odd in design unique in workmanship obviously of foreign texture and she accept it yes she agree readily i must have drop it again that be the one handed to you by señor rodriguez mr grimm tell she i think you say you lose it in he office yesterday afternoon yes she nod inquiringly it may interest you to know that señor rodriguez 's butler positively identify it as one he restore to you twice at dinner last evening between seven and nine o'clock mr grimm go on dispassionately indeed exclaimed miss thorne the señor identify it as one he find this morning in he office mr grimm explain obligingly during the night fifty thousand dollar in gold be steal from he safe there be not the slightest change of expression in she face the blue-gray eye be still inquire in they gaze the white hand still at rest the scarlet lip still curl slightly a echo of a smile no force be use in open the safe mr grimm resume it be unlock it be a old model and i have demonstrate how it could have be open either with the assistance of a stethoscope which catch the sound of the tumbler in the lock or by a person of acute hearing miss thorne sit motionless wait all this mean -- what she inquire at length i 'll trouble you please to return the money request mr grimm courteously no reason appear why you should have take it but i be not seek reason nor be i seek disagreeable publicity -- only the money it seem to I you attach undue importance to the handkerchief she object that be a matter of opinion mr grimm remark it would be useless even tedious to attempt to disprove a burglar theory but against it be the difficulty of entrance the weight of the gold the ingenious method of open the safe and the assumption that not more than six person know the money be in the safe while a person in the house _ might _ have learn it in any of a dozen way and in addition be the fact that the handkerchief be odd therefore noticeable a lace expert assure I there be probably not another like it in the world he stop miss thorne 's eye sparkle and a smile seem to be tug at the corner of she mouth she spread out the handkerchief on she knee you could identify this again of course she query yes she thoughtfully crumple up the bit of lace in both hand then open they there be two handkerchief now -- they be identical which be it please she ask if mr grimm be disappoint there be not a trace of it on he face she laugh outright gleefully mockingly then demurely : pardon I you see it be absurd the handkerchief the butler restore to I at dinner after i lose one in the señor 's office might have be either of these or one of ten other duplicate in my room all give to I by she maj -- i mean she correct quickly by a friend in europe she be silent for a moment be that all no reply mr grimm gravely decisively i be not satisfied i shall insist upon the return of the money and if it be not forthcoming i dare say count di rosini the italian ambassador would be please to give he personal check rather than have the matter become public she start to interrupt he go on in any event you will be request to leave the country then and not until then a decide change come over miss thorne 's face a deeper color leap to she cheek the smile fade from she lip and there be a flash of uneasiness in she eye but if i be innocent she protest you must prove it continue mr grimm mercilessly personally i be convinced and count di rosini have practically assure I that -- it be unjust she interrupt passionately it be -- it be -- you have prove nothing it be unheard of it be beyond -- suddenly she become silent a minute two minute three minute pass mr grimm wait patiently will you give I time and opportunity to prove my innocence she demand finally and if i _ do _ convince you -- i should be delighted to believe that i have make a mistake mr grimm assure she how much time one day two day i will let you know within a hour at you office she tell he mr grimm rise and meanwhile in case of accident i shall look to count di rosini for adjustment he add pointedly good morning one hour and ten minute later he receive this note unsigned : close carriage will stop for you at southeast corner of pennsylvanium avenue and fourteenth street to-night at one he be there the carriage be on time and my lady of mystery be inside he step in and they swing out into pennsylvanium avenue noiselessly over the asphalt should the gold be place in you hand now within the hour she query solicitously would it be necessary for you to know who be the -- the thief it would mr grimm respond without hesitation even if it destroy a reputation she plead the secret service rarely destroy a reputation miss thorne although it hold itself in readiness to do so i dare say in this case there would be no arrest or prosecution because of -- of reason which appear to be good there would not and there be a note of eagerness in she voice the identity of the guilty person would never appear it would become a matter of record in we office but beyond that i think not -- at least in this one instance miss thorne sit silent for a block or more you 'll admit mr grimm that you have force I into a most remarkable position you seem convinced of my guilt and if you 'll pardon I without reason then you make it compulsory upon I to establish my innocence the only way for I to do that be to find the guilty one i have do it and i be sorry because it be a little tragedy mr grimm wait it be a girl high in diplomatic society she father 's position be a honorable rather than a lucrative one he have no fortune this girl move in a certain set devote to bridge and stake be high she play and win and play and win and on and on until she winnings be about eight thousand dollar then luck turn she begin to lose she money go but she continue to play desperately finally some old family jewel be pawn without she father 's knowledge and ultimately they be lose one day she awake to the fact that she owe some nine or ten thousand dollar in bridge debt they be press and there be no way to meet they this mean exposure and utter ruin and woman do strange thing mr grimm to postpone such a end to social aspiration i know this much be true for she relate it all to I herself at last in some way -- a misplace letter perhaps or a word overheard -- she learn that fifty thousand dollar would be in the legation safe overnight and evidently she learn the precise night she pause a moment here be the address of a man in baltimore thoma q griswold and she pass a card to mr grimm who sit motionless listen about four year ago the combination on the legation safe be change this man be send here to make the change therefore some one besides señor rodriguez _ do _ know the combination i have communicate with this man to-day for i see the possibility of just such a thing as this instead of you stethoscope by a trick and a forge letter this girl obtain the combination from this man mr grimm draw a long breath she intend to take perhaps only what she desperately need -- but at sight of it all -- do you see what must have be the temptation then we get out here there be many unanswered question in mr grimm 's mind he repress they for the time step out and assist miss thorne to alight the carriage have turn out of pennsylvanium avenue and at the moment he do not quite place himself a narrow passageway open before they -- evidently the rear entrance to a house possibly in the next street miss thorne lead the way unhesitatingly cautiously unlock the door and together they enter a hall then there be a short flight of stair and they step into a room one of a suite she close the door and turn on the light the bag of gold be in the next room she say with the utmost composure mr grimm drag they out of a dark closet open one -- there be ten -- and allow the coin to dribble through he finger finally he turn and stare at miss thorne who pallid and weary stand look on where be we he ask what house be this the venezuelan legation she answer we be stand less than forty foot from the safe that be rob you see how easy -- and whose room inquire mr grimm slowly must i answer she ask appealingly you must señorita rodriguez -- my hostess do not you see what you have make I do she and mr cadwallader make the trip to baltimore in he automobile and -- and -- she stop he know nothing of it she add yes i know say mr grimm he stand look at she in silence for a moment stare deeply into the plead eye and a certain tense expression about he lip pass for a instant she hand tremble on he arm and he catch the fragrance of she hair where be she now he ask play bridge reply miss thorne with a sad little smile it be always so -- at least twice a week and she rarely return before two or half-past she extend both hand impetuously entreatingly please be generous mr grimm you have the gold do not destroy she señor rodriguez the minister from venezuelum find the gold in he safe on the follow morning with a brief note from mr grimm in which there be no explanation of how or where it have be find and two hour later monsieur boisségur ambassador from france to the united state disappear from the embassy vanish xii the vanish diplomatist it be three day after the ambassador 's disappearance that monsieur rigolot secretary of the french embassy and temporary _ chargé-d'affaire _ report the matter to chief campbell in the secret service bureau add thereto a detailed statement of several singular incident follow close upon it he tell it in order concisely and to the point while grimm and he chief listen monsieur boisségur the ambassador you understand be a man whose habit be remarkably regular he begin he have make it a rule to be at he desk every morning at ten o'clock and between that time and one o'clock he dictate he correspondence and clear up whatever routine work there be before he i have know he for many year and have be secretary of the embassy under he in germany and japan and this country i have never know he to vary this general order of work unless because of illness or necessary absence well monsieur last Tuesday -- this be Friday -- the ambassador be at he desk as usual he dictate a dozen or more letter and have begin another -- a private letter to he sister in paris he be well along in this letter when without any apparent reason he rise from he desk and leave the room close the door behind he he stenographer 's impression be that some detail of business have occur to he and he have go into the general office farther down the hall to attend to it i may say monsieur that this impression seem strengthen by the fact that he leave a fresh cigarette burning in he ash tray and he pen be behind he ear it be all as if he have merely step out intend to return immediately -- the sort of thing monsieur that any man might have do it so happen that when he go out he leave a sentence of he letter incomplete i tell you this to show that the impulse to go must have be a sudden one yet there be nothing in he manner so he stenographer say to indicate excitement or any other than he usual frame of mind it be about five minute of twelve o'clock -- high noon -- when he go out when he do not return immediately the stenographer begin transcribe the letter at one o'clock monsieur boisségur still have not return and he stenographer go to luncheon as he talk some inbred excitement seem to be grow upon he due perhaps to he recital of the fact and he pause at last to regain control of himself incidentally he wonder if mr grimm be take the slightest interest in what he be say certainly there be nothing in he impassive face to indicate it understand monsieur the secretary continue after a moment that i know nothing whatever of all this until late that afternoon -- that be Tuesday afternoon about five o'clock i be engage all day upon some important work in my own office and have have no occasion to see monsieur boisségur since a word or so when he come in at ten o'clock my attention be call to the affair finally by he stenographer monsieur netterville who come to I for instruction he have finish the letter and the ambassador have not return to sign they at this point i begin a investigation monsieur and the further i go the more uneasy i grow now monsieur there be only two entrance to the embassy -- the front door where a servant be in constant attendance from nine in the morning until ten at night and the rear door which can only be reach through the kitchen neither of the two man who have be station at the front door have see the ambassador since breakfast therefore he could not have go out that way _ comprenez _ it seem ridiculous monsieur but then i go to the kitchen the _ chef _ have be there all day and he have not see the ambassador at all i inquire further no one in the embassy not a clerk nor a servant nor a member of the ambassador 's family have see he since he leave he office again he pause and run one hand across he troubled brow monsieur he go on and there be a tense note in he voice the ambassador of france have disappear go vanish we search the house from the cellar to the servant ' quarter even the roof but there be no trace of he the hat he usually wear be in the hall and all he other hat be account for you may remember monsieur that Tuesday be cold but all he top-coat be find in they proper place so it seem monsieur and repression end in a burst of excitement if he leave the embassy he do not go out by either door and he go without hat or coat he stop helplessly and he gaze alternate inquiringly between the benevolent face of the chief and the expressionless countenance of mr grimm _ if _ he leave the embassy mr grimm repeat if you search of the house prove conclusively that he be not there he _ do _ leave it do not he monsieur rigolot stare at he blankly for a moment then nod and there be window you know mr grimm go on then : as i understand it monsieur no one except you and the stenographer see the ambassador after ten o'clock in the morning _ ouus monsieur c'est -- _ monsieur rigolot begin excitedly i beg pardon i believe that be correct you see he about ten you say therefore no one except the stenographer see he after ten o'clock that be also true as far as i know any caller letter telegram telephone message i make inquiry in that direction monsieur be the reply i have the word of the servant at the door and of the stenographer that there be no caller and the statement of the stenographer that there be no telephone call or telegram there be only four letter for he personally he leave they all on he desk -- here they be mr grimm look they over leisurely they be commonplace enough contain nothing that might be construe into a reason for the disappearance the letter monsieur boisségur have dictate be lay on he desk by the stenographer monsieur rigolot rush on volubly excitedly in the anxiety and uneasiness follow the disappearance they be allow to remain there overnight on Wednesday morning monsieur -- and he hesitate impressively -- _ those letter bear he signature in he own handwriting _ mr grimm turn he listless eye full upon monsieur rigolot 's perturb face for one scant instant no doubt of it be he signature he query _ non monsieur non _ the secretary exclaim emphatically _ vous avez _ -- that be i have know he signature for year there be no doubt the letter be not of a private nature if you would care to look at copy of they he offer the duplicate tentatively mr grimm read they over slowly the while monsieur rigolot sit nervously stare at he they too seem meaningless as bear on the matter in hand finally mr grimm nod and monsieur rigolot resume : and Wednesday night monsieur another strange thing happen monsieur boisségur smoke many cigarette of a kind make especially for he in france and ship to he here he keep they in a case on he dressing-table on Thursday morning he valet report to I that _ this case of cigarette have disappear _ of course observe mr grimm monsieur boisségur have a latch-key to the embassy of course anything unusual happen last night -- that be Thursday night nothing monsieur -- that be nothing we can find mr grimm be silent for a time and fall to twist the seal ring on he finger mr campbell turn around and move a paper weight one inch to the leave where it belong while monsieur rigolot disappoint at they amazing apathy squirm uneasily in he chair it would appear then mr grimm remark musingly that after he mysterious disappearance the ambassador have either twice return to he house at night or else send some one there first to bring the letter to he for signature and later to get he cigarette _ certainement monsieur _ -- i mean that seem to be true but where be he why should he not come back what do it mean madame boisségur be frantic prostrated she want I to go to the police but i do not think it wise that it should become public so i come here very well comment mr grimm let it rest as it be meanwhile you may reassure madame point out to she that if monsieur boisségur sign the letter Tuesday night he be at least alive and if he come or send for the cigarette Wednesday night he be still alive i shall call at the embassy this afternoon no it be not advisable to go with you now give I you latch-key please monsieur rigolot produce the key and pass it over without a word and one other thing mr grimm continue please collect all the revolver that may be in the house and take charge of they yourself if any one by chance hear a burglar prowl around there to-night he might shoot and in that event either kill monsieur boisségur or -- or I when the secretary have go mr campbell idly drum on he desk as he study the face of he subordinate so much he comment finally it be miss thorne again say the young man as if answer a question perhaps these report i have receive to-day from the latin capital may aid you in dispel that mystery campbell suggest and mr grimm turn to they eagerly meanwhile we royal visitor prince benedetto d'abruzzus remain unknown the young man 's tooth close with a snap it be only a question of time chief he say abruptly i 'll find he -- i 'll find he and he sit down to read the report xiii a conference in the dark the white ray of a distant arc light filter through the half-drawn velvet hanging and lay a faintly illumined path across the ambassador 's desk the heavy leather chair be mere impalpable splotch in the shadow the cut-glass knob of a mahogany cabinet catch the glint of light and reflect it dimly outside be the vague indefinable night drone of a city asleep unbroken by any sound that be distinguishable until finally there come the distant boom of a clock it strike twice seat on a couch in one corner of the ambassador 's office be mr grimm he be lean against the high arm of leather with he foot on the seat thoughtfully nurse he knee if he attitude indicate anything except sheer comfort it be that he be listen he have be there for two hour wide-awake and absolutely motionless five ten fifteen minute more pass and then mr grimm hear the grind and whir of a automobile a block or so away come toward the embassy now it be in front honk hon-on-onk it call plaintively hon-on-onk honk the signal at last the automobile go rush on full tilt while mr grimm remove he foot from the seat and drop they noiselessly to the floor thus with he hand on he knee and listen listen with every faculty strain he sit motionless peer toward the open door that lead into the hall the car be go now the sound of it be swallow up in the distance still he sit there it be obviously some noise in the house for which he be wait minute after minute pass and still nothing there be not even the whisper of a wind-stirred drapery he be about to rise when suddenly with no other noise than that of the sharp click of the switch the electric light in the room blaze up brilliantly the glare dazzle mr grimm with its blinding flood but he do not move then softly almost in a whisper : good evening mr grimm it be a woman 's voice pleasant unsurprised perfectly modulate mr grimm certainly do not expect it now but he know it instantly -- there be not another quite like it in the wide wide world -- and though he be still blinking a little he come to he foot courteously good morning miss thorne he correct gravely now he vision be clear and he see she a graceful figure silhouette against the rich green of the wall drapery she lip be curl the least bit as if she might have be smile and she wonderful eye reflect a glint of -- of -- be it amusement the fold of she evening dress fall away from she and one bare white arm be extend as she hand still rest on the switch and you do not hear I still in the half whisper i do not think you would now i be go to put out the light for a instant while you pull the shades down and then -- then we must have a -- a conference the switch snap the light die as suddenly as they have be bear and mr grimm move noiselessly visit each of the four window in turn then the light blaze brilliantly again just for a moment miss thorne explain to he quietly and she hand he a sheet of paper i want you to read this -- read it carefully -- then i shall turn out the light again they be dangerous after that we may discuss the matter at we leisure mr grimm read the paper while miss thorne 's eye question he impassive face at length he look up indolently listlessly and the switch snap she cross the room and sit down mr grimm sit beside she i think miss thorne suggest tentatively that that account perfectly for monsieur boisségur 's disappearance it give one explanation at least mr grimm assent musingly kidnap -- hold prisoner -- fifty thousand dollar demand for he safety and release a pause and to whom may i ask be this demand address to madame boisségur reply miss thorne i have the envelope in which it come it be mail at the general post-office at half-past one o'clock this afternoon so the cancel stamp show and the envelope be address as the letter be write on a typewriter and how inquire mr grimm after a long pause how do it come into you possession he wait a little why do not monsieur rigolot report this development to I this afternoon when i be here monsieur rigolot do not inform you of it because he do not know of it himself she reply answer the last question first it come into my possession directly from the hand of madame boisségur -- she give it to I why mr grimm be peer through the inscrutable darkness straight into she face -- a white daub in the gloom shapeless indistinct i have know madame boisségur for half a dozen year miss thorne continue in explanation we have be friend that long i meet she first in tokio later in berlin and within a few week here in washington you see i have travel in the time i have be a agent for my government well madame boisségur receive this letter about half-past four o'clock this afternoon and about half-past five she send for I and place it in my hand together with all the singular detail follow upon the ambassador 's disappearance so it would seem that you and i be ally for this once and the problem be already solve there merely remain the task of finding and release the ambassador mr grimm sit perfectly still and why he ask slowly be you here now for the same reason that you be here she reply readily to see for myself if the -- the person who twice come here at night -- once for the ambassador 's letter and once for he cigarette -- would by any chance make another trip i know you be here of course you know i be here repeat mr grimm musingly and may i -- just as you know that i or some one at least have enter this house a few minute ago she interrupt the automobile horn outside be a signal be not it hasting be in the car or be it blair or johnson mr grimm do not say do not you anticipate any personal danger when you enter he query instead be not you afraid i might shoot no there be a long silence mr grimm still sit with he elbow on he knee stare stare at the vague white splotch which be miss thorne 's face and bare neck one of she white arm hang at she side like a pallid serpent and she hand be at rest on the seat of the couch it seem miss thorne he say at length casually quite casually that we path of duty be inextricably tangled twice previously we have meet under circumstance that be more than strange and now -- this whatever injustice i may have do you in the past by my suspicion have i hope be forgive and in each instance we be able to work side by side toward a conclusion i be wonder now if this singular affair will take a similar course he pause miss thorne start to speak but he silence she with a slight gesture of he hand it be only fair to you to say that we -- that be the secret service -- have learn many thing about you he resume in the same casual tone we have through we foreign agent trace you step by step from rome to washington we know that you be in a way a representative of a sovereign of europe we know that you be on a secret mission to the spanish court perhaps for this sovereign and remain in madrid for a month we know that from there you go to paris also on a secret mission -- perhaps the same -- and remain there for three week we know that you meet diplomatic agent of those government later in london we know all this we know the manner of you come to this country of you come to washington but we do not know _ why _ you be here again she start to speak and again he stop she we do not know you name but that be of no consequence we _ do _ know that in spain you be señora cassavant in paris mademoiselle d'aubinon in london miss jane kellog and here miss isabel thorne we realize that exigency arise in you call and mine which make change of name desirable necessary even and there be no criticism of that now as the representative of you government -- rather _ a _ government -- you have a right to be here although unaccredited you have a right to remain here as long as you act be consistent with we law you have a right to you secret as long as they do not directly or indirectly threaten the welfare of this country now why be you here he receive no answer he expect none after a moment he go on : admit that you be a secret agent of italy admit everything that you claim to be you have not convince I that you be not the person who come here for the letter and cigarette you have say nothing to prove to my satisfaction that you be not the individual i be wait for to-night you do not mean that you suspect -- she begin in a tone of amazement i do not mean that i suspect anything he interpose i mean merely that you have not convince I there be nothing inconsistent in the fact that you be what you say you be and that in spite of that you come to-night for -- he be interrupt by a laugh a throaty silvery note that he remember well he idle hand close spasmodically only to be instantly relax suppose mr grimm i should tell you that immediately after madame boisségur place the matter in my hand this afternoon i go straight to you office to show this letter to you and to ask you assistance she inquire suppose that i leave my card for you with a clerk there on be inform that you be out -- remember i know you be on the case from madame boisségur -- would that indicate anything except that i want to put the matter squarely before you and work with you we will suppose that much mr grimm agree that be a statement of fact miss thorne add my card which you will find at you office will show that and when i leave you office i go to the hotel where you live with the same purpose you be not there and i leave a card for you and _ that _ be a statement of fact it be not difficult owe to the extraordinary circumstance to imagine that you would be here to-night -- just as you be -- and i come here my purpose still be to inform you of what i know and work with you do that convince you and how do you enter the embassy mr grimm persist not with a latch-key as you do she reply madame boisségur at my suggestion leave the french window in the hall there unfastened and i come in that way -- the way i may add that _ monsieur l'ambassadeur _ go out when he disappear very well comment mr grimm and finally : i think perhaps i owe you a apology miss thorne -- another one the circumstance now as they be at we previous meeting be so unusual that -- be it necessary to go on there be a certain grow deference in he tone i wonder if you account for monsieur boisségur 's disappearance as i do he inquire i dare say and miss thorne lean toward he with sudden eagerness in she manner and voice you theory be -- she question if we believe the servant we know that monsieur boisségur do not go out either by the front door or rear mr grimm explain that be true the french window by which you enter seem to have be the way yes yes miss thorne interpolate and the circumstance attend the disappearance how do you account for the fact that he go evidently of he own will precisely as you must account for it if you have study the situation here as i have respond mr grimm for instance sit at he desk there -- and he turn to indicate it -- he could readily see out the window overlook the street there be only a narrow strip of lawn between the house and the sidewalk now if some one on the sidewalk or -- or -- in a carriage promptly suggest miss thorne or in a carriage mr grimm supplement have attract he attention -- some one he know -- it be not at all unlikely that he rise for no

grimm 's sleeve and she stare into he eye understandingly with a little of melancholy in she own they leave mr grimm there xvi letter from jail for two week signor pietro petrozinnus know to the secret service as a unaccredited agent of the italian government and the self-confessed assailant of señor alvarez of the mexican legation have be take he ease in a cell he have be formally arraign and commit without bail to await the result of the bullet wound which have be inflict upon the diplomatist from mexico at the german embassy ball and since then undisturbed and apparently careless of the outcome he have spend he time in reading and smoking he have answer question with only a curt yes or no when he deign to answer they at all and there have be no caller or inquiry for he he have abruptly decline a suggestion of counsel twice each day morning and night he have ask a question of the jailer who bring he simple meal how be señor alvarez he be still in a critical condition the answer be always the same whereupon the secret agent would return to he reading with not a shadow of uneasiness or concern on he face occasionally there come a courteous little note from miss thorne which he read without emotion afterward cast they aside or tear they up he never answer they and then one day there come another note which for no apparent reason seem to stir he from he lethargy outwardly it be like all the other but when signor petrozinnus scan the sheet he eye light strangely and he stand stare down at it as though to hide a sudden change of expression in he face he gaze be concentrate on two small splotch of ink where it seem the pen have scratch as miss thorne sign she name the guard stand at the bar door for a moment then start to turn away the prisoner stop he with a quick gesture oh guard may i have a glass of milk please he ask no ice i prefer it tepid he thrust a small coin between the bar the guard accept it and pass on then still stand at the door the prisoner read the note again : my dear friend : i understand from a indirect source that there have be a marked improvement in señor alvarez 's condition and i be hasten to send you the good news there be every hope that within a short while if he continue to improve we can arrange a bail bond and you will be free until the time of trial anyway might it not be well for you to consult a attorney at once drop I a line to let I know you receive this sincerely isabel thorne finally the prisoner toss the note on a tiny table in a corner of he cell and resume he reading after a time the guard return with the milk would it be against the rule for I to write a answer to this query signor petrozinnus and he indicate the note certainly not be the reply if i might trouble you then for pen and ink and paper suggest the signor and he smile a little believe I i would prefer to get they for myself i guess that be right the guard grin good-naturedly again he go away and the prisoner sit thoughtfully sip the milk he take half of it then light a cigarette puff it once or twice and permit the light to die after a little there come again the clatter of the guard 's foot on the cement pavement and the write material be thrust through the bar thank you say the prisoner the guard go on with a nod and a moment later the signor hear the clangor of a steel door down the corridor as it be close and lock he lean forward in he chair with half-closed eye listen for a long time then rise and noiselessly approach the cell door again he listen intently after which he resume he seat he toss away the cigarette he have and light a fresh one afterward hold the note over the flame of the match here and there where the paper char in the heat a letter or word stand out from the bare whiteness of the paper and finally a message complete appear between the innocuous ink-written line the prisoner read it greedily : be privately inform there be little chance of alvarez 's recovery shall i arrange escape for you or have ambassador intercede would advise former as the other might take month and meet to sign treaty alliance would be dangerously delay signor petrozinnus permit the sputter flame to ignite the paper and thoughtfully watch the blaze destroy it the last tiny scrap drop on the floor burn out and he crush the ash under he heel then he begin to write : my dear miss thorne : many thanks for you courteous little note i be delighted to know of the improvement in señor alvarez 's condition i have hope that my impulsive act in shoot he would not end in a tragedy please keep I inform of any further change in he condition as yet i do not see the necessity of consult a attorney but later i may be compel to do so respectfully pietro petrozinni this do the secret agent carefully clean the ink from the pen wipe it dry with he handkerchief then thrust it into the half empty glass of milk the fluid cling to the steel nib thinly he go on write with it between the line of ink : i be in no danger i hold credentials to united state which when present will make I responsible only to the italian government as special envoy accord to international law arrange escape for one week from to-night use any money necessary make careful arrangement for the test and signing of compact for two night after again the prisoner clean the steel nib after which he put it back in the bottle of ink leave it there he wave the sheet of paper back and forth to dry it and at last scrutinize it minutely stand under the light from the high-up window of he cell letter by letter the milk evaporate leave the sheet perfectly clean and white except for the ink-written message this sheet he fold place in a envelope and address later the guard pass along the corridor and signor petrozinnus thrust the letter out to he be good enough to post that please he request it be not seal i do not know if you prison rule require you to read the letter that go out if so read it or have it read then seal it for answer the guard dampen the flap of the envelope seal it thrust it into he pocket and pass on the secret agent sit down again and sip he milk meditatively one hour later mr grimm accompany by johnson come out of a photographer 's dark room in pennsylvanium avenue with a developed negative which he set on a rack to dry at the end of another hour he be sit at he desk study under a magnifying glass a finish print of the negative word by word he be write on a slip of paper what he magnifying glass give he and so curiously enough it come to pass that miss thorne and chief campbell of the secret service be read the hidden milk-written message at almost the identical moment johnson get petrozinnus 's letter from the postman mr grimm be explain i open it photograph it seal it again and remail it there be not more than half a hour 's delay and miss thorne can not possibly know of it he pause a moment it be a odd thing that write such as that be absolutely invisible to the naked eye and yet when photograph become decipherable in the negative what do you make of it mr campbell ask the guileless blue eye be alive with eagerness well he be right of course about not be in danger say mr grimm if he come with credentials as special envoy this government must respect they even if señor alvarez die and leave it to he own government to punish he if we be officially aware that he have such credentials i doubt if we would have the right to keep he confine we would merely have to hand he over to the italian embassy and demand he punishment and of course all that make he more dangerous than ever yes i know that say the chief a little impatiently but who be this man who be this man mr grimm repeat as if surprise at the question i be look for prince benedetto d'abruzzus of italy i have find he mr campbell 's clock-like brain tick over the situation in detail it be like this mr grimm elucidate he have credentials which he know will free he if he be force to present they but i imagine they be give to he more for protection in a emergency like this than for introduce he to we government as the matter stand he can not afford to discover himself by use those credentials and yet if the latin compact be sign he must be free remember too that he be accredit from three country -- italy france and spain he be silent for a moment naturally he escape from prison would preserve he incognito and at the same time permit he to sign the compact there be silence for a long time i believe the situation be without precedent say mr campbell slowly the special envoy of three great power hold for attempt -- officially we be not aware of he purpose or he identity mr grimm remind he if he escape it would clarify the situation tremendously if he escape repeat mr campbell musingly but of course the compact would not be sign at least in this country mr grimm go on tentatively mr campbell gaze straight into the listless eye of the young man for a minute or more and gradually full understanding come home to he finally he nod he head use you own judgment mr grimm he direct xvii a call on the warden the restful silence of night lay over the great prison here and there in the grim corridor a guard doze in the glare of a electric light and in the office too a desk light glimmer where the warden sit at he desk pore over a report once he glance up at the clock -- it be five minute of eleven -- and then he go on with he reading after a little the silence be break by the whir of the clock and the first sharp stroke of the hour and at just that moment the door from the street open and a man enter he be rather tall and slender and a sinister black mask hide he face from the quickly raise eye of the warden for a bare fraction of a second the two man stare at each other then instinctively the warden 's right hand move toward the open drawer of he desk where a revolver lay and he left toward several electrically connect lever the intruder note both gesture and unarmed himself stand silent the warden be first to speak well what be it you have a prisoner here pietro petrozinni be the reply in a pleasant voice i have come to demand he release the warden 's right hand be raise above the desk top and the revolver in it click warningly you have come to demand he release eh he query he still sit motionless with he eye fix on the black mask how do you pass the outside guard he be bribe be the ready response now warden the mask intruder continue pacifically it would be much more pleasant all around and there would be less personal danger in it for both of we if you would release signor petrozinnus without question i may add that no bribe be offer to you because you integrity be beyond question thank you say the warden grimly and it shall remain so as long as i have this he tap on the desk with the revolver oh that be not load say the mask man quietly one quick glance at the weapon show the warden that the cartridge have be draw he tooth close with a snap at the treachery of it and with he left hand he pull back one of the lever -- that which should arouse the jailer turnkey and guard instead of the insistent clangor which he expect there be silence that wire have be cut the stranger volunteer with clenched tooth the warden pull the police alarm and that wire be cut too the stranger explain the warden come to he foot with white face and nail bite into the palm of he hand he still hold the revolver as he advance upon the mask man threateningly not too close now warn the intruder with a sudden hardening of he voice believe I it would be best for you to release this man because it must be do pleasantly or otherwise i have no desire to injure you still less do i intend that you shall injure I and it would be needless for either of we to make a personal matter of it i want you prisoner signor petrozinnus -- you will release he at once that be all the warden pause dazed incredulous before the audacity of it while he study two calm eye which peer at he through the slit of the mask and if i _ do not _ release he he demand at last fiercely then i shall take he be the reply it have be make impossible for you to give a alarm the stranger go on the very man on whom you most depend have be buy and even if they be within sound of you voice now they would not respond one of you assistant who have be here for year unloaded the revolver in the desk there and less than a hour ago cut the prison alarm wire i personally cut the police alarm outside the building so you see as yet there be no weapon in sight save the unloaded revolver in the warden 's hand at no time have the stranger 's voice be raise he tone be a perfectly normal one besides yourself there be only five other man employ here who be now awake the mask man continue these be four inner guard and the outer guard they have all be buy -- the turnkey at five thousand dollar each and the outer guard at seven thousand the receipt of all of this money be conditional upon the release of signor petrozinnus therefore it be to they interest to aid I as against you i be tell you all this frankly and fully to make you see how futile any resistance would be but who -- who be this signor petrozinnus that such powerful influence should be bring to bear in he behalf demand the bewildered warden he be a man who can command a vast fortune -- and señor alvarez be at the point of death that i think make it clear now if you 'll sit down please sit down bellow the warden suddenly he be seize by a violent maddening rage he take one step forward and raise the empty revolver to strike the mask man move slightly to one side and he clenched fist catch the warden on the point of the chin the official go down without a sound and lay still inert a moment later the door lead into the corridor of the prison open and signor petrozinnus accompany by one of the guard enter the warden 's office the mask man glance around at they and with a motion of he head indicate the door lead to the street they pass through close the door behind they for a little time the intruder stand stare down at the still body then he go to the telephone and call police headquarters there have be a jail delivery at the prison he say in answer to the hello of the desk-sergeant at the other end of the wire better send some of you man up to investigate who be that come the answer question the stranger replace the receiver on the hook strip off he black mask drop it on the floor beside the motionless warden and go out it be mr grimm xviii notice to leave

courteously at sight of he miss thorne 's face go deathly white and the escape prisoner turn toward the door again i would advise that you stay you highness say mr grimm coldly signor petrozinnus pause amaze you will merely subject yourself to the humiliation of arrest if you attempt to leave the house be guard by a dozen man you highness miss thorne repeat blankly you be assume a great deal be not you mr grimm i do not believe and mr grimm 's listless eye be fix on those of the escape prisoner i do not believe that prince benedetto d'abruzzus will deny he identity there be one of those long tense silence when eye challenge eye when wit be pit against wit and mind be haul around to a new and sometimes unattractive view of a situation miss thorne stand silent with rigid feature

and she turn to face he it may be that you and i shall never meet again mr grimm go on we _ will _ meet again she say gravely when and where i do not know but it will come and perhaps then we may be friend he be plead now why we be friend now be not we she ask and again the smile curl she scarlet lip surely we be friend be not we we be he declare positively as they start forward a revenue cutter which have be hover about sandy hook put toward they fly some signal at she masthead slowly the great boat on which they stand creep along then the clang of a bell in the engine-room bring she to a standstill and the revenue cutter come alongside i leave you here mr grimm say again it be good-by good-by she say softly good-by till we meet once more she extend both hand impulsively and he stand for a instant stare into the limpid gray eye then turn go below from the revenue cutter he wave a hand at she as the great _ lusitanium _ move again speed on she way the prince join miss thorne at the rail the scowl be still on he face and now what he demand abruptly this man have treat we as if we be a pair of child he be a wonderful man she reply that may be -- but we have be fool to allow he to

secret service what do _ that _ mean ask the prince bewilder it mean that the compact will be sign in washington in spite of mr grimm and there be the glitter of triumph in she eye with the aid of one of the maid in the depot at jersey city i manage to get a telegram of explanation and instruction to de foe in new york and this be the result he sign mr campbell 's name i suppose to give weight to the message a hour later a tug-boat come alongside and they go aboard xx the light in the dome from where he sit in a tiny alcove which jut out and encroach upon the line of the sidewalk mr grimm look down on pennsylvanium avenue the central thread of washington ever change always brilliant splash at regular interval with light from high-flung electric arc the early theater crowd be in the street well dress well feed careless for the moment of all thing save physical comfort and amusement automobile carriage cab car flow past endlessly and yet mr grimm see naught of it in the distance at one end of the avenue the dome of the capitol cleft the shadow of night and a single light sparkle at its apex in the other direction at the left of the treasury building which abruptly block the wide thoroughfare be the shimmering window of the white house motionless moody thoughtful mr grimm sit stare stare straight ahead comprehend none of these thing which lay before he as in a panorama instead he memory be conjure up a pair of subtle blue-gray eye now plead now coquettish now frankly defiant two slim white wonderful hand the echo of a pleasant throaty laugh a splendid elusive radiant-haired phantom truly a woman of mystery who be this isabel thorne who for month past have be the storm-center and direct mind of a vast international intrigue which threaten the world with war who this remarkable young woman who with ease and assurance command ambassador and play nation as pawn now that she be safely out of the country mr grimm have leisure to speculate upon he have devolve the duty of block she plan and he have do so -- merciless alike of he own feeling and of hers hesitation or evasion have never occur to he it be a thing to be do and he do it he wonder if she have understand there at the last beside the rail he wonder if she know the struggle it have cost he deliberately to send she out of he life or have even surmise that she expulsion from the country by he direct act be wholly lack in the exaltation of triumph to he that it strike deeper than that below the listless official exterior into he personal happiness and wonder he know that she _ do _ understand a silent shod waiter come and place the coffee thing at he elbow he do not heed the waiter pour a demi-tasse and inquiringly lift a lump of sugar in the silver tong still mr grimm do not heed at last the waiter deposit the sugar on the edge of the fragile saucer and move away as silently as he have come a newspaper which mr grimm have place on the end of the table when he sit down rattle a little as a breeze from the open window catch it then the top sheet slide off and fall to the floor mr grimm be still stare out the window slowly the room behind he be thin of its crowd as the theater-bound diner go out in two and three the last of these disappear finally and save for mr grimm there be not more than a dozen person leave in the place thus for a few minute and then the swing door lead from the street click and a gentleman enter he glance around as if seek a seat near a window then move along in mr grimm 's direction between the row of table he gaze linger on mr grimm for a instant and when he come opposite he stoop and pick up the fall newspaper sheet you paper he inquire courteously mr grimm be still gaze dreamily out of the window i beg pardon insist the new-comer pleasantly he fold the paper once and replace it on the table one hand linger for just the fraction of a moment above mr grimm 's coffee-cup arouse by the remark mr grimm glance around oh thank you he apologize hastily i do not hear you at first thank you the new-comer nod smile and pass on take a seat two or three table down apparently this trifling courtesy have break the spell of reverie for mr grimm square around to the table again draw he coffee-cup toward he and drop in the single lump of sugar he idly stir it for a moment as he eye turn again toward the open window then he lift the tiny cup and empty it again he sit motionless for a long time and thrice the new-comer only a few foot away glance at he narrowly and now it seem a peculiar drowsiness be overtake mr grimm once he catch himself nod and raise he head with a jerk then he notice that the arc light in the street be wobble curiously and he fall to wonder why that single flame sparkle at the apex of the capitol dome thing around he grow hazy vague unreal and then as if realize that something be the matter with he he come to he foot he take one step forward into the space between the table reel attempt to steady himself by hold on to a chair then everything grow black about he and he pitch forward on the floor he face be dead white he finger move a little nervously weakly then they be still several people rise at the sound of the fall body and the new-comer hurry forward he coat sleeve catch the empty demi-tasse as he stoop and sweep it to the floor where it be shatter the head waiter and another come pell-mell and those diner who have rise come more slowly what be the matter ask the head waiter anxiously already the new-comer be support mr grimm on he knee and flicking water in he face nothing serious i fancy he answer shortly he be subject to these little attack what be they who be he the stranger tear at mr grimm 's collar until it come loose then he fall to chafe the still hand he be a mr grimm a government employee -- i know he he answer again i imagine it be nothing more serious than indigestion a little knot have gather about they with offer of assistance waiter have not you better send for a physician some one suggest i be a physician the stranger put in impatiently have some one call a cab and i 'll see that he be take home it happen that we live in the same apartment house just a few block from here obedient to the crisply-spoken direction a cab be call and five minute later mr grimm still insensible be lift into it the stranger take a seat beside he the cabby touch he horse with a whip and the vehicle fall into the endless move line xxi a slip of paper when the light of return consciousness finally pierce the black lethargy that enshroud he mr grimm 's mind be a chaos of vagrant absurd fantasy then slowly slowly realization struggle back to its own and he come to know thing first be the knowledge that he be lie flat on he back on a couch it seem then that he be in the dark -- a utter abject darkness and finally come a overwhelming sense of silence for a while he lay motionless with not even the movement of a eye-lash to indicate consciousness wrap in a delicious languor gradually this pass and the feeble flutter of he heart grow into a steady rhythmic beat the keen brain be awaken he be begin to remember what have happen he know only that in some manner a drug have be administer to he a bitter dose tasting of opium that speechlessly he have fight against it that he have rise from the table in the restaurant and that he have fall all the rest be blank with eye still close and nerveless hand inert at he side he listen the while he turn the situation over in speculative mood the waiter have administer the drug of course unless -- unless it have be the courteous stranger who have replace the newspaper on the table that think open new field of conjecture mr grimm have no recollection of ever have see he before and he have pay only the enforced attention of politeness to he and why have the drug be administer vaguely incoherently mr grimm imagine that in some way it have to do with the great international plot of war in which miss thorne be so delicate and vital a instrument where be he conjecture stop there evidently he be where the courteous gentleman in the restaurant want he to be a prisoner probably in danger long careful attention to detail work in the secret service have convince mr grimm that he be always in danger that be one reason -- and the best -- why he have lie motionless without so much as lift a finger since that first glimmer of consciousness have enter he brain he be probably under scrutiny even in the darkness and for the present it be desirable to accommodate any chance watcher by remain apparently unconscious and so for a long time he lay listen be there another person in the room mr grimm 's ear be keenly alive for the inadvertent shuffling of a foot or the sound of breathing nothing even the night roar of the city be miss the silence be oppressive at last he open he eye a pall of gloom encompass he -- a pall without one rift of light he finger move slowly explore the limit of the couch whereon he lay confident at last that wherever he be he be unwatched mr grimm be on the point of conclude that further inaction be useless when he strain ear catch the faint grating of metal against metal -- perhaps the insertion of a key in the lock he hand grow still he eye close and after a moment a door creak slightly on its hinge and a breath of cool air inform mr grimm that that open door wherever it be lead to the outside and freedom there be another faint creaking as the door be shut mr grimm 's nerveless hand close involuntarily and he lip be set together tightly be it to be a knife thrust in the dark if not -- then what he expect the flare of a match instead there be a soft tread and the rustle of skirt a woman mr grimm 's caution be all but forget in he surprise as the step draw nearer he clenched finger loosen he wait two hand stretch forward in the dark touch he simultaneously -- one on the face one on the breast a singular thrill shoot through he but there be not the flicker of a eye or the twitching of a finger the woman -- it _ be _ a woman -- seem now to be bend over he then he hear she drop on she knee beside he and she press a inquire ear to he left side it be the heart test thank god she breathe softly it be only by a masterful effort that mr grimm hold himself limp and inert for a strange fragrance be envelop he -- a fragrance he well know the hand be fumble at he breast again and there be the sharp crackle of paper at first he do not understand then he know that the woman have pin a paper to the lapel of he coat finally she straighten up and take two step away from he after which come a pause he keenly attuned ear catch she faint breathing then the rustle of she skirt as she turn back she be lean over he again -- she lip touch he forehead barely again there be a quick rustling of skirt the door creak and -- silence deep oppressive overwhelming silence isabel be he dream and then he cease wonder and fall to remember she kiss -- light as air -- and the softly speak thank god she do care then she _ have _ understand that day the kiss of a woman beloved be a splendid heart tonic mr grimm straighten up suddenly on the couch himself again he touch the slip of paper which she have pin to he coat to make sure it be not all a dream after which he recall the fact that while he have hear the door creak before she go out he have not hear it creak afterward therefore the door be open she have leave it open purposely that be beside the question at the moment and why -- how -- be she in washington ponder that question mr grimm 's excellent tooth click sharply together and he rise he know the answer the compact be to be sign -- the alliance which would array the civilized world in arm he have fail to block that as he think if miss thorne have return then prince benedetto d'abruzzus who hold absolute power to sign the compact for italy france and spain have also return stealthily feel he way as he go mr grimm move toward the door lead to freedom guide by the fresh draft of air he reach the door -- it be stand open -- and a moment later step out into the star-lit night it be open country here with a thread of white road just ahead and farther along a fringe of shrubbery mr grimm reach the road far down it a pin point in the night a light flicker through interlace branch the tail lamp of a automobile of course mr grimm leave the road and skirt a sparse hedge in the direction of the light after a moment he hear the engine of a automobile and see a woman -- barely discernible -- step into the car as it start forward he stake everything on one bold move and win he reward be a narrow sit space in the rear of the car hide from its occupant by the tonneau one mile two mile three mile they charge through the night and still he cling on at last there come relief that be the place where the light be -- just ahead there be no mistaking that voice raise above the clamor of the engine the car slacken speed and mr grimm drop off and dart behind some convenient bush and the first thing he do there be to light a match and read what be write on the slip of paper pin to he coat it be simply : my dear mr grimm : by the time you read this the compact will have be sign and you effort to prevent it splendid as they be futile it be a tribute to you that it be unanimously agree that you must be account for at the time of the signing hence the drugging in the restaurant it be only a act of kindness that i should come here to see that all be well with you and leave the door open behind I believe I when i say that you be one man in whom i have never be disappointed accept this as my farewell for now i assume again the name and position rightfully mine and know too that i shall always cherish the belief that you will remember I as you friend isabel thorne p s the prince and i leave the steamer at montauk point on a tug-boat mr grimm kiss the note twice then burn it xxii the compact a room low-ceilinged dim gloomy sinister as a inquisition chamber a single large table in the center hold a kerosene lamp write material and a metal spheroid a shade larger than a one-pound shell and around it a semicircle of silent mask and cowl figure there be twelve of they eleven man and a woman in the shadow which grow denser at the far end of the room be a squat globular object a massive smooth-sided black threatening thing of iron one of the man glance at he watch -- it be just two o'clock -- then rise and take a position beside the table face the semicircle he place the timepiece on the table in front of he gentleman he say and there be the faintest trace of a foreign accent i shall speak english because i know that whatever you nationality all of you be familiar with that tongue and now a apology for the theatric aspect of all this -- the mask the time and place of meeting and the rest of it he pause a moment there be only one person living who know the name and position of all of you and by a sweep of he hand he indicate the motionless figure of the woman it be by she decision that mask be wear for while we all know the detail of the latin compact there be a bare chance that some one will not sign and it be not desirable that the identity of that person be know to all of we the reason for the selection of this time and place be obvious for a inkling of the propose signing have reach the secret service i will add the united state be choose as the birthplace of this new epoch in history for several reason one be the proximity to central and south america and another the inadequate police system which enable greater freedom of action he stop and draw from he pocket a fold parchment he tap the tip of he finger with it from time to time as he talk the latin compact gentleman be not the dream of a night nor of a decade as long as fifty year ago it be suggest and whatever difference the latin country of the world have have among themselves they have always realize that ultimately they must stand together against -- against the other nation of the world this idea germinate into action three year ago and since that time agent have cover the world in its interest this meeting be the fruition of all that work and this he hold the parchment aloft be the instrument that will unite we never have a diplomatic secret be keep as this have be keep never have a greater reprisal be plan it mean gentleman the domination of the world -- socially spiritually commercially and artistically it mean that england and the united state whose sphere of influence have extend around the globe will be beat back that the flag of the latin country will wave again over lose possession it mean all of that and more he voice have rise as he talk until it have grow vibrant with enthusiasm and he hand point he remark with quick sharp gesture all this he go on be never possible until three year ago when the navy of the world be give over into the hand of one nation -- my country five year ago a fellow-countryman of mine happen to be present at a electrical exhibition in new york city and there he witness a interesting experiment -- practical demonstration of the fact that a submarine mine may be explode by the use of the marconus wireless system he be a practical electrician himself and the idea linger in he mind for two year he experiment and finally this result he pick up the metal spheroid and hold it out for they inspection as it stand it be absolutely perfect and give a world 's supremacy to the latin country because it place all the navy of the world at we mercy it be a variation of the well-known percussion cap or fuse by which mine and torpedo be explode the theory of it be simple as be the theory of all great invention the secret of its construction be know only to its inventor -- a man of whom you never hear it be merely that the mechanism of the cap be so delicate that the marconus wireless wave -- and _ only _ those -- will fire the cap in other word this cap be tune if i may use the word to a certain number of vibration and half-vibration a wireless instrument of high power with a modify addition which the inventor have add have only to be set in motion to discharge it at any distance up to twenty-five mile high power wireless wave recognize no obstacle so the explosion of a submarine mine be as easily bring about as would be the explosion of a mine on dry land you will readily see its value as a protective agency for we seaport he replace the spheroid on the table but its chief value be not in that he resume its chief value to the latin compact gentleman be that the united state and england be now conclude negotiation unknown to each other by which _ they _ will protect _ they _ seaport by means of mine prime with this cap the tuning of the cap which we will use be know only to we _ the tuning of the cap which they will use be also know to we _ the addition to the wireless apparatus which they will use be such that they _ can not _ even by accident explode a mine guard we seaport but on the other hand the addition to the wireless apparatus which _ we _ will use permit of the extreme high charge which will explode they mine to make it clearer we could send a navy against such a city as new york or liverpool and explode every mine in front of we as we go and meanwhile we mine be impervious another word and i have finish five gentleman whom i imagine be present now have witness a test of this cap by direct command of they home government for the benefit of the other of you a simple test have be arrange for to-night this cap on the table be charge its inventor be at he wireless instrument fifteen mile away at three o'clock he will turn on the current that will explode it four of the eleven man look at they watch it be now seventeen minute past two i be instruct for the purpose of the test to place this cap anywhere you may select -- in this house or outside of it in a box seal or under water the purpose be merely to demonstrate its efficacy to prove to you complete satisfaction that it can be explode under practically any condition he entire manner undergo a change he draw a chair up to the table and stand for a instant with he hand rest on the back the compact be write in three language -- english french and italian i shall ask you to sign after read either or all precisely as the direction you have receive from you home government instruct on behalf of the three greatest latin country as special envoy of each i will sign first he drop into the chair sign each of the three parchment page three time then rise and offer the pen to the cowled figure at one end of the semicircle the man come forward read the english transcript study the three signature already there with a certain air of surprise then sign the second man sign the third man and the fourth the fifth have just rise to go forward when the door open silently and mr grimm enter without a glance either to right or leave he go straight toward the table and extend a hand to take the compact for a instant there have come amazement a dumb astonishment at the intrusion it pass and the hand of the man who have do the talk dart out seize the compact and hold it behind he if you will be good enough to give that to I you highness suggest mr grimm quietly for half a minute the mask man stare straight into the listless eye of the intruder and then : mr grimm you be in very grave danger that be beside the question be the reply be good enough to give I that document he back away as he speak kick the door close with one heel then lean against it face they or better yet he go on after a moment burn it there be a lamp in front of you he pause for a answer it would be absurd of I to attempt to take it by force he add xxiii the percussion cap there be a long tense silence the cowled figure have rise ominously miss thorne pale behind she mask and she finger grip she palm fiercely still she sit motionless prince d'abruzzus break the silence he seem perfectly calm and self-possessed how do you get in he demand throttle you guard at the front door take he down cellar and lock he in the coal-bin reply mr grimm tersely i be wait for you to burn it and how do you escape from -- from the other place mr grimm shrug he shoulder the lamp be in front of you he say and find you way here the prince pursue again mr grimm shrug he shoulder for a instant longer the prince gaze straight into he inscrutable face then turn accuse eye on the mask figure about he be there a traitor he demand suddenly he gaze settle on miss thorne and linger there i can relieve you mind on that point -- there be not mr grimm assure he just a final word you highness if you will permit I i have hear everything that have be say here for the last fifteen minute the detail of you percussion cap be interesting i shall lay they before my government and my government may take it upon itself to lay they before the british government you yourself say a few minute ago that this compact be not possible before this cap be invent and perfect it be not possible the minute my government be warn against its use that will be my first duty you be give some very excellent reason mr grimm be the deliberate reply why you should not be permit to leave this room alive further mr grimm resume in the same tone i have be order to prevent the signing of that compact at least in this country it seem that i be barely in time if it be sign -- and it will be useless now on you own statement unless you murder I -- every man who sign it will have to reckon with the highest power of this country will you destroy it i do not want to know what country already stand commit by the signature there i will not be the steady response and then after a little : mr grimm the inventor of this little cap insignificant as it seem will receive million for it you silence would be worth -- just how much mr grimm 's face turn red then white again which would you prefer a independence by virtue of a great fortune or -- or the other thing suddenly miss thorne tear the mask from she face and come forward she cheek be scarlet and anger flame in the blue-gray eye mr grimm have no price -- i happen to know that she declare hotly neither money nor a consideration for he own personal safety will make he turn traitor she stare coldly into the prince 's eye and we be not assassin here she add miss thorne have state the matter fairly i believe you highness and mr grimm permit he eye to linger a moment on the flush face of this woman who in a way be defend he but there be only one thing to do miss thorne he be talk to she now there be no middle course it be a problem that have only one possible answer -- the destruction of that document and the departure of you and you you highness for italy under my personal care all the way i imagine this matter have end that day on the steamer it _ will _ end here now to-night the prince glance again at he watch then thoughtfully weigh the percussion cap in he hand after which with a curious laugh he walk over to the squat iron globe in a opposite corner of the room he bent over it half a minute then straighten up that cap mr grimm have one disadvantage he remark casually when it be attach to a mine or torpedo it can not be disconnect without firing it it be attach he turn to the other it be needless to discuss the matter further just now if you will follow I we will leave mr grimm here with a strange little cry neither anger nor anguish yet oddly partaking of the quality of each isabel go quickly to the prince how dare you do such a thing she demand fiercely it be murder this be not a time miss thorne for you interference reply the prince coldly it have all pass beyond the point where the feeling of any one person even the feeling of the woman who have engineer the compact can be consider a single life can not be permit to stand in the way of the consummation of this world project mr grimm alive mean the compact would be useless if not impossible mr grimm dead mean the fruition of all we plan and hope you have do you duty and you have do it well but now you authority end and i the special envoy of -- just a moment please mr grimm interrupted courteously as i understand it you highness the mine there in the corner be charge yes it just happen to be here for purpose of experiment the cap be attach quite right the prince laugh and at three o'clock by you watch the mine will be fire by a wireless operator fifteen mile from here something like that yes very much like that assent the prince thank you i merely want to understand it mr grimm pull a chair up against the door and sit down cross he leg on he knee rest the barrel of a revolver glitter fascinating in the semi-darkness now gentleman and he glance at he watch it be twenty-one minute of three o'clock at three that mine will explode we will all be in the room when it happen unless he highness see fit to destroy the compact eye seek eye and the prince remove he mask with a sudden gesture he face be bloodless if any man and mr grimm give miss thorne a quick glance i should say _ any person _ attempt to leave this room i _ know _ he will die and there be a bare chance that the percussion cap will fail to work i can account for six of you if there be a rush but man if that mine explode we shall all be kill -- blow to piece burst from one of the cowled figure if the percussion cap work supplement mr grimm mingled emotion struggle in the flush face of isabel as she study mr grimm 's impassive countenance i have never disappoint you yet miss thorne he remark as if it be a explanation i shall not now she turn to the prince you highness i think it needless to argue further she say we have no choice in the matter there be only one course -- destroy the compact no be the curt answer i believe i know mr grimm better than you do she argue you think he will weaken i know he will not i be not argue for he nor for myself i be argue against the frightful loss that will come here in this room if the compact be not destroy -lrb- illustration : you think he will weaken i know he will not -rrb- it be absurd to let one man stand in the way declare the prince angrily it might not be a impertinent question you highness comment mr grimm for I to ask how you be go to _ prevent _ one man standing in the way a quick change come over miss thorne 's face the eye harden the lip be set and line mr grimm have never see appear about the mouth here in a flash the cloak of dissimulation be cast aside and the woman stand forth this keen brilliant determine woman who do thing the compact will be destroy she say no declare the prince it _ must _ be destroy _ must must _ do you say _ must to I _ yes _ must _ she repeat steadily and by what authority please do -- by that authority she draw a tiny filigreed gold box from she bosom and cast it upon the table the prince stare at it in the name of you sovereign -- _ must _ she say again the prince turn away and begin pacing back and forth across the room with the parchment crumple in he hand for a minute or more isabel stand watch he thirteen minute mr grimm announce coldly and now break out a excited chatter a babel of french english italian spanish those mask and cowl one who have hold silence for so long all begin talk at once one of they snatch at the crumpled compact in the prince 's hand while all crowd around he argue mr grimm sit perfectly still with the revolver barrel rest on he knee eleven minute he announce again suddenly the prince turn violently on miss thorne with rage-distorted face do you know what it mean to you if i do as you say he demand savagely it mean you will be brand as traitor that you name you property -- if you will pardon I you highness she interrupt the power that i have use be give to I to use i have use it it be a matter to be settle between I and my government and as far as it affect my person be of no consequence now you will destroy the compact nine minute say mr grimm monotonously again the babel break out do we understand that you want to see the compact one of the cowled man ask suddenly of mr grimm as he turn no i do not want to see it i would prefer not to see it with hatred blaze in he eye the prince make he way toward the lamp hold a parchment toward the blaze there be nothing else to be do he exclaim savagely just a moment please mr grimm interpose quickly miss thorne be that the compact she glance at it nod she head and then the flame catch the fringed edge of paper it crackle flash flame and at last a thing of ash be scatter on the floor mr grimm rise that be all gentleman he announce courteously you be free to go you you highness and miss thorne will accompany I he hold open the door and there be almost a scramble to get out the prince and miss thorne wait until the last and miss thorne if you will give we a lift in you car mr grimm suggest it be now four minute of three the automobile come in answer to a signal and the three in silence enter it the car tremble and have just begin to move when mr grimm remember something and leap out wait for I he call there be a man lock in the coal-bin he disappear into the house and miss thorne with a gasp of horror sink back in she seat with face like chalk the prince glance uneasily at he watch then speak curtly to the chauffeur run the car up out of danger there 'll be a explosion there in a moment they have go perhaps a hundred foot when the building they have just leave seem to be lift bodily from the ground by a great spurt of flame which tear through its center then collapse like a thing of card the prince unmoved glance around at miss thorne she lay in a dead faint beside he go ahead he command baltimore xxiv the personal equation mr campbell cease talk and the deep earnestness that have settle on he face pass leave instead the blank inscrutable mask of benevolence behind which he clock-like genius be habitually hide the choleric blue eye of the president of the united state shift inquiringly to the thoughtful countenance of the secretary of state at he right thence along the table around which the official family be gather it be a special meeting of the cabinet call at the suggestion of chief campbell and for more than a hour he have do the talk there have be no interruption so much he conclude at last if there be any point i have not make clear mr grimm be here to explain it in person mr grimm rise at the mention of he name and stand with he hand clasp behind he back he eye meet those of the chief executive listlessly we understand mr grimm the president begin and he pause for a instant to regard the tall clean-cut young man with a certain admiration we understand that there do not actually exist such a thing as a latin compact against the english-speaking people on paper no be the reply you personally prevent the signing of the compact i personally cause the destruction of the compact after several signature have be attach mr grimm amend throughout i have act under the direction of mr campbell of course you be in very grave personal danger the president go on it be of no consequence say mr grimm simply the president glance at mr campbell and the chief shrug he shoulder you be certain mr grimm and the president speak with great deliberation you be certain that the representative of the latin country have not meet since and sign the compact i be not certain -- no reply mr grimm promptly i be certain however that the backbone of the alliance be break -- its only excuse for existence destroy -- when they permit I to learn of the wireless percussion cap which would have place the navy of the world at they mercy believe I gentleman if they have keep they secret it would have give they dominion of the earth they make one mistake he add in a most matter-of-fact tone they should have kill I it be they only chance the president seem a little startled at the suggestion that would have be murder he remark true mr grimm acquiesce but it seem a absurd thing that they should have permit the life of one man to stand between they and the world power for which they have so long plan and scheme he highness prince benedetto d'abruzzus believe as i do and so express himself he pause a moment there be a hint of surprise in he manner i expect to be kill of course it seem to I the only thing that could happen they must have know of the far-reaching consequence which would follow upon you escape mr grimm why _ do not _ they kill you mr grimm make a little gesture with both hand and be silent may they not yet attempt it the president insist it be too late now mr grimm explain they have everything to gain by kill I there as i stand in the room where i have interrupt the signing of the compact because that would have be before i have place the fact in the hand of my government i be the only person outside of they circle who know all of they only the basest motive could inspire they to attempt my life now there be a pause the secretary of state glance from mr grimm to mr campbell with a question in he deep-set eye do i understand that you place a miss thorne and the prince under -- that be you detain they he query if so where be they now i do not know be the reply just before the explosion the three of we enter a automobile together and then as we be start away i remember something which make it necessary for I to reenter the house when i come out again just a few seconds before the explosion the prince and miss thorne have go the secretary 's lip curl down in disapproval be not it rather unusual to put it mildly to leave you prisoner to they own device that way he ask well yes mr grimm admit but the circumstance be unusual when i enter the house i have lock a man in the cellar i have to go back to save he life otherwise -- oh the guard at the door you mean come the interruption who be it mr grimm glance at he chief who nod it be mr charle winthrop rankin of the german embassy say the young man mr rankin of the german embassy be on guard at the door demand the president quickly yes we get out safely and that mean that germany be -- the president pause and startle glance pass around the table after a moment of deep abstraction the secretary go on : so miss thorne and the prince escape be they still in this country that i do not know reply mr grimm he stand silent a moment stare at the president some subtle change creep into the listless eye and he lip be set perhaps i have better explain here that the personal equation enter largely into a affair of this kind he say at last slowly it happen that it enter into this unless i be order to pursue the matter further i think it would be best for all concern to accept the fact of miss thorne 's escape and -- he stop there be a long thoughtful silence every man in the room be study mr grimm 's impassive face personal equation muse the president just how mr grimm do the personal equation enter into the affair the young man 's lip close tightly and then : there be some people mr president whom we meet frankly as enemy and we deal with they accordingly and there be other who oppose we and yet be not enemy it be merely that we path of duty cross we may have the greatest respect for they and they for we but purpose be unalterably different in other word there be a personal enmity and a political enmity you for instance might be a close personal friend of the man whom you defeat for president there might -- he stop suddenly go on urge the president i think every man meet once in he life a individual with whom he would like to reckon personally the young man continue that reckoning may not be a severe one it may be less severe than the law would provide but it would be a personal reckoning there be one individual in this affair with whom i should like to reckon hence the personal equation enter very largely into the case for a little while the silence of the room be unbroken save for the steady tick-tock of a great clock in one corner mr grimm 's eye be fix unwaveringly upon those of the chief executive at last the secretary of war crumple a sheet of paper impatiently and hitch he chair up to the table come down to the fact it be like this be not it he demand briskly the latin country by a invention of they own which the united state and england be to be dupe into purchase would have have power to explode every submarine mine before attack a port very well this thing of course would have give they the freedom of the sea as long as we be unable to explode they submarine as they be able to explode ours and this be the condition which make the latin compact possible be not it he look straight at mr grimm who nod therefore he go on if the latin compact be not a reality on paper if the united state and england do not purchase this -- this wireless percussion cap we be right back where we be before it all happen be not we every possible danger from that direction have pass have not it the world-war of which we have be talk be render impossible be not it that be a question answer mr grimm if you will pardon I for suggest it i would venture to say that as long as there be a invention of that importance in the hand of nation whom we now know have be conspire against we for fifty year there be always danger it seem to I if you will pardon I again that for the sake of peace we must either get complete control of that invention or else understand it so well that there can be no further danger and again please let I call you attention to the fact that the brain which bring this thing into existence be still to be reckon with there may some day come a time when we submarine may be explode at will regardless of this percussion cap the secretary of war turn flatly upon chief campbell this woman who be mix up in this affair he demand this miss thorne who be she who be she repeat the chief she be a secret agent of italy one of the most brilliant perhaps that have ever operate in this or any other country she be the pivot around which the intrigue move we know she by a dozen name any one of they may be correct the brow of the secretary of war be draw down in think as he turn to the president mr grimm be speak of the personal equation he remark pointedly i think perhaps he meaning be clear when we know there be a woman in the case we know that mr grimm have do he duty to the last inch in this matter we know that alone and unaided practically he have do a thing that no living man of he relative position have ever do before -- prevent a world-war but there be further danger -- he himself have call we attention to it -- therefore i would suggest that mr grimm be relieve of further duty in this particular case this be not a moment when the peace of the world may be imperil by personal feeling of -- of kindliness for a individual mr grimm receive the blow without a tremor he hand be still idly clasp behind he back the eye fasten upon the president 's face be still listless the mouth absolutely without expression as mr grimm have point out the secretary go on we have be negotiate for this wireless percussion cap i have somewhere in my office the name and address of the individual with whom these negotiation have be conduct through that it be possible to reach the inventor and then -- i suggest that we vote we thanks to mr grimm and relieve he of this particular case the choleric eye of the president soften a little and grow grave as they study the impassive face of the young man it be a strange situation mr grimm he say evenly what do you say to withdraw i be at you order mr president be the reply no one know better what you have do than the gentleman here at this table the president go on slowly no one question that you have do more than any other man could have do under the circumstance we understand i think that indirectly you be ask immunity for a individual i do not happen to know the liability of that individual under we law but we can not make any mistake now mr grimm and so -- and so -- he stop and be silent i have hope mr president that what i have do so far -- and i do not underestimate it -- would have at least earn for I the privilege of remain in this case until its conclusion say mr grimm steadily if it be to be otherwise of course i be at -- history tell we mr grimm interrupt the president irrelevantly that the frou-frou of a woman 's skirt have change the map of the world do you believe he go on suddenly that a man can mete out justice fairly severely if necessary to one for whom he have a personal regard i do sir perhaps even to one -- to a woman whom he might love i do sir the president rise please wait in the anteroom for a few minute he direct mr grimm bow himself out at the end of half a hour he be again summon into the cabinet chamber the president meet he with outstretched hand there be more than mere perfunctory thanks in this -- there be the understanding of man and man you will proceed with the case to the end mr grimm he instruct abruptly if you need assistance ask for it if not proceed alone you will rely upon you own judgment entirely if there be circumstance which make it inadvisable to move against a individual by legal process even if that individual be amenable to we law you be not constrain so to do if you judgment be against it there be one stipulation : you will either secure the complete rights of the wireless percussion cap to this government or learn the secret of the invention so that at no future time can we be endanger by it thank you say mr grimm quietly i understand i may add that it be a matter of deep regret to I and the president bring one vigorous hand down on the young man 's shoulder that we government have so few man of you type in its service good day xxv we two mr grimm turn from pennsylvanium avenue into a cross street walk along half a block or so climb a short flight of stair and enter a office be mr howard in he query of a boy in attendance name please mr grimm hand over a seal envelope which bear the official imprint of the department of war in the upper left hand corner and the boy disappear into a room beyond a moment later he emerge and hold open the door for mr grimm a gentleman -- mr howard -- rise from he seat and stare at he as he enter this note mr grimm be surprising he remark it be only a request from the secretary of war that i be permit to meet the inventor of the wireless percussion cap mr grimm explain carelessly the negotiation have reach a point where the war department must have one or two question answer directly by the inventor simple enough you see but it have be understand and i have personally impressed it upon the secretary of war that such a meeting be impossible object mr howard all negotiation have be conduct through I and i have as attorney for the inventor the right to answer any question that may properly be answer this now be a request for a personal interview with the inventor the necessity for such a interview have rise unexpectedly because of a press need of either close the deal or allow it to drop mr grimm state i may add that the success of the deal depend entirely on this interview mr howard be lean forward in he chair with wrinkled brow intently study the calm face of the young man innocent himself of all the intrigue and international chicanery back of the affair represent only a individual in these secret negotiation he see in the statement as mr grimm intend that he should the possible climax of a great business contract he greed be arouse it might mean hundred of thousand of dollar to he do you think the deal can be make he ask at last i have no doubt there will be some sort of a deal reply mr grimm as i say however it be absolutely dependent on a interview between the inventor and myself at once -- this afternoon mr howard thoughtfully drum on he desk for a little while from the first save in so far as the patent rights be concern he have see no reason for the obligation of utter secrecy which have be enforce upon he perhaps if he lay it before the inventor in this new light with the deal practically close the interview would be possible i have no choice in the matter mr grimm he say at last i shall have to put it to my client of course can you give I say half a hour to communicate with he certainly and mr grimm rise obligingly shall i wait outside here or call again you may wait if you do not mind say mr howard i 'll be able to let you know in a few minute i hope mr grimm bow and pass out at the end of twenty-five minute the door of mr howard 's private office open and he appear he face be violently red evidently from anger and perspiration stand on he forehead i can not do anything with he he declare savagely he say simply that negotiation must be conduct through I or not at all mr grimm have rise he bow courteously very well he say placidly you understand of course as the note say that this refusal of he terminate the negotiation so -- but just a moment -- interpose mr howard quickly good day say mr grimm the door open and close he be go three minute later he step into a telephone booth at a near-by corner and take down the receiver hello central he call and then : this be mr grimm of the secret service what number be mr howard talk to eleven double-nought six alexandrium be the reply where be the connection in whose name the connection be five mile out from alexandrium in a farm-house on the old baltimore road come the crisp business-like answer the name be murdock william thank you say mr grimm good-by a moment later he be stand by the curb wait for a car when howard still angry and with a expression of deep chagrin on he face come bustling up if you can give I until to-morrow afternoon then -- he begin mr grimm glance around at he and with a slight motion of he head summon two man who have be chat near-by one of they be blair and the other hasting take this man in charge he direct hold he in solitary confinement until you hear from I do not talk to he do not let any one else talk to he and do not let he talk if any person speak to he before he be lock up take that person in charge also he be guilty of no crime but a single word from he now will endanger my life that be all it be say and do so quickly that howard daze confused and utterly unable to account for anything be lead away without a protest mr grimm muse gently on the stupidity of mankind in general and the ease with which it be possible to lead even a clever individual into a trap if the bait appeal to greed take a car and go up town some three hour later he walk briskly along a narrow path strew with pine needle which lead tortuously up to a old colonial farmhouse outwardly the place seem to be desert the blind batter and strip of paint by wind and rain be all close and one corner of the small veranda have crumble away from age and neglect in the rear of the house rise from a old barn a thin pole with a cup-like attachment at the apex thrust its point into the open above the dense odorous pine mr grimm note these thing as he come along he step up quietly on the veranda and have just extend one hand to rap on the door when it be open from within and miss thorne stand before he he be not surprised intuition have tell he he would meet she again perhaps here in hide a sudden quick tenderness light the listless eye for a instant she stand stare she face pallid against the gloom of the hallway beyond and she draw a long breath of relief as she press one hand to she breast the blue-gray eye be veil by droop lid then she recover herself and they open into he in they he see anxiety apprehension fear even miss thorne he greet and he bow low over the white hand which she impulsively thrust toward he i -- i know some one be come she stammer in a half whisper i do not know it be you i have not know definitely until this instant that you be safe from the explosion i be glad -- glad you understand glad that you be not -- she stop and fight back she emotion then go on : but you must not come in you must go away at once you -- you life be in danger here _ how _ do you know i be come inquire mr grimm from the moment mr howard telephone she reply still hastily still in the mysterious half whisper i know that it could only be some one from you bureau and i hope that it be you i see how you force he to call we up here and that be all you need it be simple of course to trace the telephone call both of she hand close over one of he desperately now go please the latin compact be at a end you merely invite death here now go she eye be search the listless face with entreaty in they the slender finger be fiercely grip one of mr grimm 's nerveless hand for a instant some strange softening light flicker in the young man 's eye then it pass i have no choice miss thorne he say gravely at last i be honor bind by my government to do one of two thing if i fail in the first of those -- the greater -- it can only be because -- he stop hope flame up in she eye and she lean forward eagerly study the impassive face because -- she repeat it can only be because i be kill he add quietly suddenly he whole manner change i should like to see the -- the inventor but do not you see -- do not you see you _ will _ be kill if -- she begin tensely may i see the inventor please mr grimm interrupted for a little time she stand white and rigid stare at he then she lid flutter down wearily as if to veil some crush agony within she and she step aside mr grimm enter and the door close noiselessly behind he after a moment she hand rest lightly on he arm and he be lead into a room to he left this door too she close immediately turn to face he we may talk here a few minute without interruption she say in a low tone she voice be quite calm now if you will be -- please understand miss thorne he interpose mercilessly that i must see the inventor whoever he be what assurance have i that this be not some ruse to permit he to escape you have my word of honor she say quite simply please go on he sit down you will see he too soon i fear she continue slowly if you have not come to he he would have go to you she sway a little and press one hand to she eye i would to god it be in my power to prevent that meeting she exclaim desperately then with a effort : there be some thing i want to explain to you it may be that you will be willing to go then of you own free will if i lay bare to you every step i have take since i have be in washington if i make clear to you every obscure point in this hideous intrigue if i confess to you that the latin compact have be give up for all time will not that be enough will not you go then mr grimm 's tooth close with a snap i do not want that -- from you he declare but if i should tell it all to you she plead i will not listen miss thorne you once pay I the compliment of say that i be one man you know in whom you have never be disappoint the listless eye be blaze into she own now _ i _ have never be disappoint in you i will not permit you to disappoint I now the secret of you government be mine if i can get they -- but i will not allow you to tell they to I my government miss thorne repeat and she lip curl sadly i -- i have no government i have be cast off by that government strip of my rank and brand as a traitor traitor mr grimm 's lip form the word silently i fail do not you see she rush on ignominy be the reward of failure prince d'abruzzus go on to new york that night cable a full account of the destruction of the compact to my government and sail home on the follow day i be the responsible one and now it all come back on I for a moment she be silent it be so singular mr grimm the fight from the first be between we -- we two and you win xxvi in which they both win mr grimm drop into a chair with he tooth clench and he face like chalk for a minute or more he sit there turn it all over in he mind truly the triumph have be rob of its splendor when the blow fall here -- here upon a woman he love there be no shame in the confession of one who be fairly beaten isabel go on softly after a little there be many thing that you do not understand i come to washington with a authority from my sovereign higher even than that vest in the ambassador i come _ as _ i do and compel count di rosini to obtain a invitation to the state ball for I in order that i might meet a representative of russium there that night and receive a answer as to whether or not they would join the compact i receive that answer its substance be of no consequence now and you remember where i first meet you it be while you be investigate the shooting of señor alvarez in the german embassy that shooting as you know be do by prince d'abruzzus so almost from the begin my plan go wrong because of the assumption of authority by the prince the paper he take from señor alvarez after the shooting be suppose to bear vitally upon mexico 's attitude toward we plan but as it develop it be about another matter entirely yes i know say mr grimm the event of that night which you do _ not _ learn be that germany agree to join the compact upon condition mr rankin who be attach to the german embassy in a advisory capacity deliver the answer to I and i pretend to faint in order that i might reasonably avoid you i surmise that much remark mr grimm the telegraphing i do with my fan be as much to distract you attention as anything else and at the same time to identify myself to mr rankin whom i have never meet you know he of course i do not she be silent a while as she eye steadily meet those of mr grimm finally she go on : when next i meet you it be in the venezuelan legation you be investigate the theft of the fifty thousand dollar in gold from the safe i thrust myself into that case because i be afraid of you and mercilessly destroy a woman 's name in you eye to further my plan i make you believe that señorita rodriguez steal that fifty thousand dollar and i return it to you presumably while we stand in she room that night only it be not she room -- it be _ mine _ _ i _ steal the fifty thousand dollar all the detail even to she trip to see mr griswold in baltimore in company with mr cadwallader have be carefully work out and she _ do _ bring I the combination of the safe from mr griswold on the strength of a forge letter but she do not know it there be no theft of course i have no intention of keep the money it be necessary to take it to distract attention from the thing i _ do _ do -- break a lock inside the safe to get a sealed packet that contain venezuelum 's answer to we plan i seal that packet again and there be never a suspicion that it have be open only a suspicion mr grimm correct then come the abduction of monsieur boisségur the french ambassador i plunge into that case as i do in the other because i be afraid of you and have to know just how much you know it be explain to you as a attempt at extortion with detail which i carefully supply as a matter of fact monsieur boisségur oppose we plan even endanger they and it be not advisable to have he recall or even permit he to resign at the moment so we abducted he intend to hold he until direct order could reach he from paris understand please that all these thing be make possible by the aid and cooperation of dozen score of agent who be under my order every person who appear in that abduction be work at my direction the ambassador 's unexpected escape disarrange we plan but he be take out of the embassy by force the second time under you very eye the darkness which make this possible be due to the fact that while you be look for the switch and i be apparently aid i be hold my hand over it all the time to keep you from turn on the light you remember that mr grimm nod all the rest of it you know she conclude wearily you compel I to leave the venezuelan legation by you espionage but in the crowded hotel to which i move i have little difficulty avoid you mr hasting you mr blair and you mr johnson so i come and go freely without you knowledge the escape of the prince from prison you arrange so you understand all of that as well as the meeting and attempt signing of the compact and the rapid recovery of señor alvarez and after all it be my fault that we plan fail because if i have not be -- be uneasy as to you condition and have not make the mistake of go to the desert little house where you be a prisoner the plan would have succeed the compact be sign i be begin to understand say mr grimm gravely and a wistful tender look creep into he eye if it have not be for that act of -- consideration and kindness to I -- we would have succeed in spite of you explain isabel we be afraid of you mr grimm it be a compliment to you that we consider it necessary to account for you whereabouts at the time of the signing of the compact and if you have succeed remark mr grimm the whole civilized world would have come to war i never permit myself to think of it that way she reply frankly there be something splendid to I in a battle of brain there be exaltation stimulation excitement in it it have always possess the greatest fascination for I i have always win you know until now i fail and my reward be ` traitor ' just a word of assurance now she go on after a moment the latin compact have be definitely give up the plan
