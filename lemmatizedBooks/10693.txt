man not like a boy lord tenterden be not powerful lord gray speak better than he have do since 1827 he make a speech too long and indeed the last half-hour be of no use he beat the brain out of the coronation oath as a obstacle to catholic concession and read a curious letter of lord yestor to lord tweddale date April 1689 before william iii take the coronation oath in which lord tester mention that it be understand that the king have in council declare he understanding of the sense of the coronation oath -- that it bind he in he executive capacity not in he legislative lord westmoreland

weak inefficient powerless speech he seem beat and in some respects he memory have fail he lord plunket draw with great power a picture of the state of society in ireland as affect by the law the whole of he speech be powerful he speech and lord gray 's be excellent after a few sentence from lord farnham we divide present for 149 against 79 -- majority 68 proxy for 70 against 33 -- total

chando by way of conciliate the tory she think lord rosslyn ought to have the privy seal and that consider they late conduct the whig should be prefer to the tory whom we should have at any rate that it be enough not to punish they by deprive they of they office in all this i agree i think if the duke should go to the tory and turn he back upon the whig after what have take place he will make opposition very acrimonious and we debate very disagreeable i tell she if the privy seal be to be a tory i think the duke of richmond the best he be the most popular man in the house of lord and a

fact he be beat the duke of norfolk be in the house as happy as man could be _ April 11 _ dr clarke and h fane both speak of the chancellor 's speech in attack upon eldon as in bad taste and offensive i shall endeavor to ascertain whether this be the general opinion not have hear eldon they can not know how very mischievous and disingenuous he be _ April 12 _ meet the lieven lyndhurst sir j murray and other at dinner at the esterhazy 's the king have not yet send back the commission to pass the catholic bill the lieven be more shy of I than ever lord bathurst seem to be much pleased with my idea of carry on the government of indium in the king 's name he say it should be under a secretary of state for indium the chancellor approve highly of my notion of suggest herry for the government of bombay if the director will not have courtney he be useless to we and a discredit besides we want he place have some talk with vernon at lady jersey 's he have the canning venom about he still and say we should still regret have lose huskisson & c i say never he be a able man but he would never do as a member of a cabinet in which he be not chief the government would not have live if he have continue in i tell he i have become satisfied from my short experience that a coalition government could not conduct the affair of the country with advantage -- especially where the difference be -lrb- blank -rrb- the duke of cumberland be go to windsor if the commission should not arrive to-night i dare say the duke of wellington will go to windsor early to-morrow lady jersey be very loud in she dispraise of the duke of richmond every one who know he say he be very cunning there be a mixture of good and bad taste about he he be popular and he would make a good man of business _ April 13 1829 Monday _ chair at 11 inform they of sir sidney beckwith 's appointment to the command at bombay tell they my general idea be that it be necessary to fix a lieutenant - governor at agra i show they it could be do without expense sir charle metcalfe should be the person appoint with precise instruction oblige he to a system of non-interference in the internal concern of the malwa and rajpoot state sir j malcolm would have interpose the treaty with the rajpoot state generally secure they internal independence those with the state of malwa give we the right and impose upon we the duty of supervision it require therefore a most delicate hand to bring the whole into one system animated by one spirit i say incidentally to-day ' i will not sit here to sacrifice indium to england ' a sentiment which escape I but which i feel to be correct not only socially but politically ashley come and bore I about a petition of some hindoo and mahometan in calcutta who wish to be grand juror i tell he i could not proceed hastily in any matter of legislation and that this be one of much delicacy i should speak to fergusson a cabinet have be fix for 3 i conclude it be on account of a delay on the king 's part in give the royal assent to the relief bill the cabinet be counter-ordered the commission have arrive at two the chancellor have send a note to the king with the bill call he attention to they the king on send they back with the commission sign thank the chancellor for have call he attention to the bill and say he give he assent reluctantly the chancellor have send a note last night to watson the equerry desire he to remind the king of the commission so at a few minute before four to-day the chancellor lord bathurst and i sit as commissioner to give the royal assent to the relief bill and about thirty-nine other so many have be keep back to force a early decision the indemnity bill be one of the bill and the militia list bill another there be thirteen peer in the house and seven or eight more about lord savoy he son young lambton lady petre and she daughter mrs fox and some other lady be there -- lady stanhope the old duchess of richmond come too late i observe that in pass each other very close the duke of wellington and the duke of cumberland take no notice of each other lord durham say to I ` now the king will turn you all out in revenge as soon as he can ' to which i assent he certainly will when he dare the duke of norfolk and mr petre be in the house give and receive congratulation all party congratulate the duke falmouth alone still look sad and sombre the duke of wellington have a bad cold he be very hoarse and wrap himself in he cloak as soon as he have do speak _ April 14 _ see mr fergusson respect a petition from hindoo and mahometan at calcutta pray to be allow to sit on grand jury he think they should -- as they be allow to sit on petty jury if the matter have be well consider the privilege they now ask should have be grant before that they have obtain mr fergusson be however rather afraid of allow they to sit on the trial of christian by the newspaper i see that there have be a quarrel at teheran between some of the russian ambassador 's suite and the populace which lead to a attack upon the russian palace and to the death of the ambassador and all he people except two this be a unfortunate event as it will give the russian a new claim to indemnity which they will exercise inexorably probably they will insist on the junction of persium in the attack on turkey as the only satisfaction they can accept it be just possible that the example once give and the people despair of pardon a rise against the russian may take place and something of a national feeling arise in persium but i fear this will not be the case i suppose we minister be at tabriz _ April 15 _ the duke be at windsor to-day to ask the king 's permission to restore the resigner the king say he think the duke could not do better he just mention wetherell 's name as if he think he be to be except from the restoration but desire to be _ certior-factus _ the king be cold the duke have to wait twenty minute the duke of cumberland be with the king however i believe this delay may only have originate in a necessary change of dress on he majesty 's part as he be sit for he picture _ in a highland dress _ the duke see a large plaid bonnet in the room and he believe the king have still on plaid stocking the business of the restoration be finish in ten minute when the conversation flag and the duke be rise to go away however something more be then say and the interview in all last twenty minute the king say he be delighted with lord winchelsea he be so gentlemanlike and speak _ in so low a tone of voice _ he likewise think lord farnham very gentlemanlike and lord rolle more violent than any the duke have to wait twenty minute before he could see lady conyngham they seem to wish he not to see she however he do she say all would have be quiet if the duke of cumberland have not come over and all would be quiet when he go away the king seem relieved since the bill be pass on he return the duke send for george banke and offer he he place again banke ask two or three day to consider the duke give he till to-morrow it seem he have now a notion that he owe he place not to the duke but to some other influence i think this have be insinuate to he since he resignation the fact be otherwise the king have mention banke for other situation but not for the one he hold on my return home i find banke have call upon I after dinner we consider whether the prosecution of lawless for he conduct at ballybeg should be persevere in goulbourn peel lord bathurst sir g murray and i be for drop it i think the chancellor incline the same way the duke and the rest aberdeen be absent be for go on i think no benefit would be derive from success even success would revive feeling and recollection which be die away and which we wish to be forget if we decline proceed we can say we do so from the fear of exciting dormant passion if we proceed we shall have no excuse should we revive the memory of bad time reference be to be make to ireland to ascertain the feeling about it there banke come at twelve o'clock he tell I he have be with the duke and have receive from he the offer of he old office he have ask permission to consult one person whose name he do not mention to the duke -- it be the duke of cumberland he have call at the palace and find the duke of cumberland be at windsor he want to write to he to ask if he have any objection to he take the office again banke say he have attend none of the meeting at lord chando 's he have avoid as much as he could all communication with the duke of cumberland he have fully determine not to take a part with any new government which might be form unless it should clearly appear the king have be unfairly deal by or unless there should be a attempt to make peer to carry the bill the duke of cumberland have always say that he make he he first object and he have reason to think that he have mention he to the king and have be instrumental in he appointment the duke of cumberland have desire he to come to he -lrb- during the bill -rrb- and have apparently intend to name some particular office for he but see he coldness have only sound he and have receive the answer i have mention above the duke of cumberland have tell he it be a understand thing that all be to be restore and that he see no reason why he should not take he office again _ this be ten day ago _ i tell he i advise if he think it necessary to write to the duke of cumberland at all that he should merely state he intention to take he office back again refer to he conversation with the duke himself upon the point and add _ distinctly _ that take office he could no longer have any communication on political matter with a person who have declare he hostility to the government i advise he to send off he own servant on a post-horse at six o'clock to-morrow morning with a letter to the effect i have state to the duke of cumberland and whether he receive a answer or not to go to the duke of wellington and accept at 12 i advise he to tell the duke the whole state of the case and all he have do the duke of wellington do not seem by any means well to-day he be blood yesterday _ April 16 _ cabinet at 3 it seem banke call on the duke this morning but he be engage i tell he all that pass between banke and I last night if banke should go out the duke mean to offer he place to sir j graham we meet upon foreign affair aberdeen read he instruction to gordon who go to constantinople they be unobjectionable we then consider what be to be do in consequence of this second violation of they word on the part of the russian in blockade candium count heyden have write two letter to sir pulteney malcolm in the first he justify the blockade of candium on the ground of its be necessary to protect the morea from the pacha of egypt in the second he rest it on the necessity of blockade the two extremity of candium for the purpose of watch constantinople we can not permit the russian to make fool of we in this way -- to promise one thing as party to the treaty of london and to do another as belligerent after the cabinet i ask the duke whether he still wish I to press courtney upon the director he say yes he very much want he place i say it have occur to I that _ herry _ might take the governorship of bombay it do not seem to have occur to he he say he think herry would not go but he evidently think it would be a very good thing if he would the duke say he want to have the place of courtney and sir g hill and to bring in lord chando and m fitzgerald we mention ashley i suggest ashley 's go to the treasury and sir j graham take he place this would i dare say be do if we could get the place at the treasury i have not as yet hear a surmise as to the new lord privy seal lord o'neil have sign the duke of richmond 's protest against the franchise bill it be very hostile to the government and lord o'neil will probably be put out the duke of richmond have be very imprudent have he take a moderate line he probably might have be privy seal he time be now go by _ April 17 _ go by appointment to see lady jersey find there duncannon and lord sefton duncannon talk big about o'connell 's power and in the same sense in which he talk to fitzgerald wish to induce the government to let he take he seat i say we could not it depend not on we but upon the law lady sefton come in afterwards for a few minute and lord rosslyn lady jersey talk a great deal about the restoration and fear the whig would imagine they be never to come in and would form a violent opposition she mention mr stanley as be much annoyed he have make a laudatory speech in favor of peel i tell she it would have be very harsh to have eliminate those who have take office under the idea that the government be rather against than for the catholic certainly _ neutral _ and that it be a little unreasonable to expect other to be turn out to make way for new friend _ April 18 _ the duke think he could not offer the privy seal to lord gray but he would be conciliate by have a friend -- that be rosslyn -- in if we could get lord beresford out lord rosslyn would go to the ordnance the duke say the king would make it a point of honor to resist the introduction of lord gray though in reality he be in communication with lord gray in 1820-21 after the queen 's trial and then intend to bring he in and to turn out the then minister for the milan commission he have be himself at the bottom of that commission the duke the only member of the cabinet who be not mix up with the milan commission induce the king to give up he idea of make a change banke receive a letter from the duke of cumberland very long and against he acceptance of office but he beg banke to go down to see he and talk it over he do so bankes tell he he would not accept if he on consideration object but he be determine not to join any other government the duke of cumberland speak of himself as have be ill-use by the duke of wellington this be explain the conference end by the duke of cumberland 's acquiesce entirely in banke 's acceptance of office banke see the duke of wellington and detail the whole to he _ April 21 _ call on sir h hardinge at richmond he tell I the duke have at first great reluctance to have anything to do with the whig by he account he must have principally contribute to lead the duke to adopt that view which he have now of admit rosslyn & c _ April 22 _ the duke of norfolk call and not find I leave a note beg I to ascertain privately from the duke of wellington whether the king would be please if the english catholic present a address to he thank he for the relief bill receive a letter from the duke of wellington express a decide opinion against any address from the roman catholic he say ` everything have be do that be possible to efface all distinction between the king 's subject on the score of religion and this with a view to the general benefit and not to that of a particular body i confess i shall think that this measure have fail in attain its object if there should be any general act of a particular body ` in respect to the king himself i be certain that the most agreeable thing to he would be that all should remain quiet ` we must have no distinct body of roman catholic except in the church and in affair of religion the less we act inconsistently with the principle the better ' i so entirely agree in opinion with the duke of wellington that have for my own amusement write a address for the roman catholic in the event of they make any to the king the first sentence i imagine be this : ` the roman catholic of england approach you majesty for the last time as a body distinct from the rest of you majesty 's subject ' _ April 25 _ i have a good deal of conversation as to the next director there be three city man candidate but none be good -- lyall ellice and dougla of ellice no one know anything he be brother to the ellice who marry lord gray 's sister lyall be or be chairman of the committee of shipowner dougla be brother to lord queensbury they say he be not a very good house _ April 28 _ read the correspondence between the duke and lord anglesey then read a memorandum of the duke 's in reply to one of hardinge 's on the subject of the discipline of the british army hardinge wish to introduce the prussian -lrb- footnote : which do not include capital punishment see _ wellington correspondence _ vol v p 932 -rrb- discipline into ours the duke show that with we discipline we have more man fit for duty in proportion to we number than the prussian in the proportion of two to one that in prussium the army be everything there be no other profession all be soldier -- the officer live much with he man -- they be always in mass always in fertile country in we service the worst man in the community enter the army the officer be gentleman they can not mix with the man without discipline we army would be inferior to other it be not even now the favorite profession there be much jealousy of it it be not popular with the common people it be difficult to find recruit even in time of distress i be in a army the duke conclude which can not be govern on the prussian principle you can not treat the english soldier as a man of honor the duke have be with the king who be in very good humor he have not however get to close quarter with he as to the change _ April 29 _ cabinet at 12 a letter have be receive from lord heytesbury from which it be clear that russium will very soon resume altogether the exercise of she belligerent rights in the mediterranean nesselrode communicate to he the blockade of candium lord heytesbury only observe that ` it be a resumption of belligerent rights ' this count nesselrode do not deny and he say they could not long remain in the false position in which they now be in the mediterranean count heyden at the end of January blockade candium on pretext arise out of the state of greece in three week from that time he rest he interception of the egyptian vessel near candium on the necessary exercise of he rights as a belligerent lièven when first speak to disavow heyden he now change he tone and it be evident that russium now for the second time break she word the french do not behave much better they have 6000 man in the morea and mean to keep they there notwithstanding they engagement to withdraw they troops as soon as the egyptian be embark to be sure they say if we insist upon it they will withdraw they i have always be for get out of the treaty we have be drag along very unwillingly -- we have be subject to much humiliation we seem to I to have gain nothing by all we compliance we have be lead on from the violation of one principle to that of another we position have discourage turkey we have be make the tool of russium and have be dupe with we eye open i think the sooner we get out of this false position the better and there be no time so favourable for we to hold strong language as this when by the settlement of the catholic question we be really strengthened and when all foreign power believe we be yet more strengthened than we be the duke be certainly for get out he have long wish it a paper of peel 's be read suggest the difficulty in which we should still be place by we moral obligation towards the greek and by we reasonable fear that on the principle of the greek treaty to which we have unfortunately give we adhesion russium and france may combine and make a partition treaty my expectation be that russium and france would soon quarrel and i think i could before now have make they jealous of each other but we have do nothing after much conversation v fitzgerald agree with I and the other say nothing it be determine to insist upon the freedom of communication with candium under the protocol to insist upon the greek withdraw from they advanced position near prevesa _ under the protocol _ and to insist likewise upon the withdraw of the french troops from the morea accord to the engagement i be not satisfy with this every part of we diplomacy have be unfortunate we have succeed in nothing i predict if we become engage in the war it would be ultimately on a little point and not upon a great one we diplomacy can not be defend it be we weak point house all the catholic there every good old name in england the duke of norfolk be much pleased with the duke of wellington 's answer to he enquiry as to the propriety of address the king i be go to send he the duke 's original letter as a _ record _ the king certainly receive the protestant peer and particularly those who have be at windsor with great favor and so the bishop of durham the duke of cumberland stand at the king 's left hand and quiz the people as they pass he seem _ rayonnant _ after dinner i have some conversation with loch the chairman as to govern indium in the king 's name he do not positively object i think i shall be able to carry that point i consider it to be of the most essential importance _ April 30 _ cabinet at 12 determine to fund eight million of exchequer bill no tax to be take off or impose we have some conversation as to the east retford question v fitzgerald communicate a proposal from littleton to propose the adjournment of all discussion upon the subject till next year as it be evident nothing can be do this year littleton propose this because he wish to disappoint the mischievous design of some people -lrb- palmerston particularly -rrb- it be determine to adhere to the line take by the government last year -- namely to that of throw east retford into the hundred the duke be decidedly of opinion that whatever we do we should do from ourselves and certainly not act in concert with a enemy the tory look to we conduct upon this question as the touchstone drawing-room the king as yesterday very civil to the brunswicker and take no notice of we friend he take particular notice of the brazilian madame de lièven be endeavor to form a government with the duke of cumberland the ultra-tory the canningite and some whig the king be very russian i believe all this will end in nothing the chancellor think they may try to make a change when parliament be up and so have six month before they they may think of it but the only object of such a government would be _ revenge _ they can not repeal the relief bill nor do they wish to pursue a different line of policy either at home or abroad the foreigner think that have settle the catholic question we be ready to draw the sword and find a field of battle wherever we can this the russian be afraid of and hence arise in some degree they wish to overthrow the duke 's government but the real foundation of all the russian intrigue be madame de lièven 's hatred for the duke and she rage at feeling she have overreach herself _ may 1 _ sir thoma tyrwhitt be with the king for two hour to-day the duke of cumberland be in the room and the king in bed the king be very much out of humor and abuse everything and everybody he be very angry at lady be admit to the house of lord and particularly at they go in such

and a good speaker tindal be of course to be master of the roll i be most anxious to give up the privy seal to rosslyn _ may 3 _ cabinet at 2 decide the government be to take the same line exactly this year as to east retford -lrb- that be as to give the two member to the hundred -rrb- that it take last year however as it be impossible to get any bill through the lord this year peel will be very willing to accede to any proposition for postpone the whole question till next session on the question of irish education and on that of the grant to maynooth the vote will be as before -- it be say that the state of the session and the circumstance of the present period make it advisable that the question of any change should be defer indeed minister have not have time to consider it many of lord anglesey 's letter to peel and of peel 's answer be read we have a very strong case against he on he letter to dr curti which by a letter from dr curti to the duke we know lord anglesey direct dr murray to publish if it could be do with curti 's consent and which dr murray do publish without obtain such consent curti 's letter be date January 2 lord anglesey write to curti for the duke 's letter and he answer and have they two day before December 23 the date of he letter to curti peel think the east indian committee should not be refuse it be better for the east indian company that it should be grant than refuse i entirely coincide with he _ may 4 _ coal committee at 12 meet lord bathhurst with whom i have some conversation as to the duke 's reading letter in answer to lord anglesey he beg I to go to the duke and try to induce he not to do so i find the duke agree with I entirely as to the danger of the president and disposed to read only what might be absolutely necessary lord anglesey bring forward he motion for ` the letter of recall ' the duke answer he and so well that even lord holland could not say one word so the thing end the duke have be assure by the king and within the last fortnight the king have give the same assurance to aberdeen that lord anglesey have not _ permission _ to read confidential letter lord anglesey state that he have the king 's permission the duke certainly seem to contradict he lord londonderry throw a note over to I suggest that the contradiction be so direct there might be a awkward explanation out of door unless the thing be soften down i mention this to lord bathurst he think not however when he reply lord anglesey treat the contradiction as absolute and lord bathurst tell the duke he must give some explanation which the duke do say he do not mean to accuse lord anglesey of declare he have the king 's permission when he have not but only that he have reason to think he have not in fact the king as we always think tell the duke one thing and lord anglesey another and the only result of the debate be that the king be prove to have tell a lie lord wharncliffe who overtake I as i be ride home consider lord anglesey to be blow out of water at lady brownlow 's ball i talk with lord farnborough longford and beresford all think the reading of the letter should have be stop and that the duke do wrong to read anything we could not stop the reading of the letter when the king 's permission to read they be state distinctly by lord anglesey the misery be that we have a lie master _ may 5 _ i call at the treasury and see the duke on the subject of what take place yesterday he say that have receive the king 's command to declare lord anglesey have not he permission to read the letter he could not do otherwise than make the observation he do the gravaman of the charge against lord anglesey as arise out of those letter be that in the last he declare he intention of use they as public document and this be the ground upon which the king have acquiesce in he be relieve for the king to have afterwards permit the reading of those letter would have be a withdrawal of confidence from he minister i meet lord ravensworth and talk to he upon the subject he seem to be in a sort of alarm as to what take place yesterday this be superfluous the duke 's explanation that he do not mean to say lord anglesey have reason to think he be permit to read those letter be quite sufficient the duke add that he have understand the contrary lord ravensworth seem to think he royal master come the worst off -- which be true he tell I the duke of cumberland have be abuse every one at lady brownlow 's last night and have declare as he have before that he would not go away till he have we out lord anglesey be report to be very ill to-day _ may 6 _ cabinet dinner at sir g murray 's the duke see the king to-day he be in good humor and say the duke be quite right in declare lord anglesey have not he permission to read the letter it seem the king say the same thing in the duke of cumberland 's presence on Monday at dinner and this make the duke so very angry that evening we have a very good division last night on the retford question almost all the brunswicker vote with we -- none against we in fact the government be very strong there be disturbance at manchester which look rather serious _ may 7 _ nothing in the house the meeting respect the statue to the duke of wellington seem to have finish in detestable taste hunt propose a vote of thanks to lord anglesey and o'connell and _ lord darnley _ speak for it both these say the catholic bill arise out of lord anglesey 's government lord darnley repeat the same thing to I to-day in the house i tell he the contrary be the fact that lord anglesey have place the carrying of the question in peril -- that without he recall it could hardly have be carry there have be serious disturbance at manchester the baker ' shop have be break open and rob and money extort by fear this arise out of real distress but it seem as might be expect that notorious thief lead on the mob _ may 8 _ the disturbance at manchester have more the character of robbery than of riot baker 's shop have be break open and pillage and money have be extort at rochdale a attack be make on the military they behave with extreme forbearance but at last fire and kill and wound many _ may 9 _ dine at the trinity house hardinge whom i meet there tell I wood have be ask by lord mansfield to go to the pitt dinner on the 28th wood say he do not know whether the minister would go or not lord mansfield say ` why you must know it be understand that as soon as parliament be up the government will be change at this dinner we shall make such a display of protestant force as will enable the king to take we as he minister ' it be surprising to I that any able man as lord mansfield be should be so deluded by the lie of the duke of cumberland the country be not agitate it be not dissatisfy it would repudiate as a act of the basest treachery such conduct towards a government which have be permit to carry a great measure and which be displaced solely on grounds of personal pique manchester and its neighborhood more quiet have some conversation with peel about the next member for the direction he incline to marryatt hardinge report a communication from e ellice who canvass for he brother russell ellice e ellice offer some vote in the house of common if we will support he brother i believe e ellice would be a good man but the brother be a nonentity i say we must strike at the mass and not at individual we must gain the city by assist a fit man on public grounds peel agree in this sentiment i be sure it be the only wise course for any government to pursue _ Monday may 11 _ the king have get the habit of take large dose of laudanum he send for the chancellor yesterday as usual at two o'clock when he get to the palace the king have take a large dose of laudanum and be asleep the chancellor be tell he would not wake for two or three hour and would then be in a state of excessive irritation so that he might just as well not see he _ may 12 _ the east retford question be last night defer till next session so we may i think finish all we business by about June 10 that be really allow full time o'connell publish yesterday a argument on he right to sit in the house of common in the shape of a letter to the member at first lord gray think it unanswerable -lrb- as found on the provision of the relief bill -rrb- but at night he tell I he have look into the bill and find it certainly exclude he a large portion of the letter be quite absurd that in which he assume a right to have he claim decide in a court of law parliament alone be by common law the court in which the privilege of its own member can be decide _ may 12 _ house lord lansdowne put a pompously word question as to we intention with respect to the course of proceed on indian affair i answer simply that we be as sensible as he be of the extreme importance of the question that for my own part my mind be never absent from it and that i have not be many day in office before i take measure for procure the most extensive information which would be lay before the house at the proper time that the government be desirous of form its own opinion on the fullest information and with the greatest consideration and that we wish the house to have the same opportunity that i be not then prepare to inform he in what precise form we should propose that the enquiry should be make the chancellor introduce the bill for appoint a new equity judge and separate the equity jurisdiction from the court of exchequer the latter object by-the-bye be not to be accomplish immediately but it be part of the plan open he soothe lord eldon by high compliment to he judicial administration and to the correctness of he judgment the wonder of the day be that lord eldon should have live to hear a chancellor so expose the error of the court of chancery as they be expose by lord lyndhurst to-day _ may 13 _ recorder 's report the king not well he have a slight stricture of which he make a great deal and a bad cold he seem somnolent but i have see he worse before the council there be a chapter of the garter the duke of richmond be elect the knight

and papers promise immediately _ may 16 _ chair at 11 we speak of the charter they rather dislike the notion of use the king 's name and i fear mr elphinstone and all the indian will give they

should acquaint the house with the circumstance and that we should appoint a committee to inquire before the message from the common come up this be do we order a message to be send but before we messenger leave the house we hear the common would not receive a message so i move that the order we have just make should be rescind and we have a second conference the common be well satisfy with we reply the last sentence have be ` the lord hope the common will be satisfy with this explanation ' as we in the first paragraph express we desire to preserve a good understanding between the two house

of the relief and franchise bill and there he be right and he convert the prayer that the measure might tranquillise ireland & c into a _ hope _ that it would -- thus make it a little stronger but that he do not know the duke of cumberland on hearing of castlereagh 's appointment say ` whoever rat he would not ' allude to lord londonderry who have be nibble at the cumberland faction however lord londonderry be much annoyed at castlereagh 's take office he neither like the expense of a election for downshire nor lose a vote he think he could dispose of hardinge will not sit again for durham without hardinge lord londonderry will have trouble enough there the king be much out of humor during the chapter of the garter and say everything be do wrong see the chair they have just get a letter from sir john malcolm resign from December 1 1830 this would have be in any case a long time for courtenay to wait out of office but they say the idea of he be propose have get wind and several of the director be very adverse neither of the chair like he and if they support he they would do it very reluctantly as loch go out of office in April and we can not tell who will be deputy and six new director come in there really be not the means of say to courtenay ` you be sure of you election ' and without this he could not be ask to resign i take the chair to the duke he receive they very cordially tell they i have state the circumstance to he and he give up the point we then talk of the legality of the removal of the supreme government from calcutta on look into the act it seem very doubtful whether any act do by the governor-general in council away from calcutta would be valid unless it be one of the act the governor-general might do of he own authority for instance ' a regulation ' issue by the governor-general in council at meerut would not be valid because the governor-general alone could not issue one the duke say lord william do everything with the best intention but he be a _ wrong-headed man _ and if he go wrong he would continue in the wrong line other man might go wrong and find it out and go back but if he go wrong he would either not find it out or if he do he would not go back _ June 24 _ sit as commissioner to prorogue parliament the king 's alteration in the speech certainly make it better and stronger he now express he _ sincere hope _ the measure of the session will produce tranquillity & c people think the speech rather short and jejune dine at the ` albion ' with the director the dinner be give to lord dalhousie there be there the duke the chancellor peel sir j murray lord rosslyn and goulburn the speaker the attorney general courtenay ashley and banke duke of buccleuch lord camden lord montagu lord hill sir herbert taylor

of the cordiality and good understanding exist between the director and the government _ which be never more necessary to the company than now _ i say the good understanding would always exist while such man as loch be in the chair and while i be at the board of control i pay a high compliment to loch and then congratulate they on the appointment of the two general they mildness of manner they benevolence of character and the goodness of they nature would obtain for they the affectionate devotion of a grateful soldiery and educate in a school of continued victory they be the fittest leader of a army which have never meet a enemy it have not subdue i end by say i be sure they would devote themselves to the maintenance under all circumstance not only of the efficiency but of a object which they would pursue with equal interest -- _ of the happiness and well-being of the native army of indium _ i speak rather well be attentively hear and well receive i sit by the duke of buccleuch we have a good deal of conversation he seem a fine young man lord rosslyn complain he could never see a draft till it be a month old and that there have be no new despatch place in the box since he come into office i tell he no one complain more of the same thing than aberdeen do when dudley be in office and i believe all foreign secretary have a shyness about show they draft till they be send off and unalterable _ June 25 _ at the office find a letter with enclosure from colonel macdonald date tabriz April 20 what he have be do in persium i do not know i have write to he to call upon I on Saturday call on the duke to tell he the substance -- which be that the turk have already 30000 man and sixty piece of cannon at erzeroum that a dispossessed pacha be in arm at akiska that the russian have reinforce the garrison of natshiran and abbasabad and have withdraw all they troops to the left bank of the arax with the exception of those who garrison bayazid the plague seem rife at erivan the russian about count paskewitz abuse the english very much _ June 27 _ the chair tell I lord w bentinck have extend to all person the benefit of the regulation as to coffee planter _ omit however _ all the restrictive clause they think very seriously of this and very justly the calcutta newspaper consider the principle of colonisation to be concede we must abrogate this ` regulation ' without loss of time i go to the duke to tell he of it he say lord w bentinck be not to be trust and we should be oblige to recall he he be go down in a steamboat to penang no news of much importance at the cabinet room except that lord heytesbury 's despatch confirm the account of the sickness of the russian army the turk seem to have give the russian a great smash at eskus arnaut _ June 30 _ a battle near schumlum between the russian and turk the turk be besiege pravadus diebitsch march from silistrium and move upon they communication with schumlum the turk seem to have be surprise they fight gallantly however and seem to have cause the russian great loss see arbuthnot he come to the indium board to speak about he friend russell ellice whom he wish to make a director we afterwards talk of the house and the government i think all will turn out well we have six month before we but certainly at present we be weak in the house of common though i believe gather strength in the country and already very strong there if we play the great game striking at the mass we must succeed it would never do to go pick up individual we must do we best for the country and we shall have it with we the worst of it be the king be the most faithless of man and cumberland be at work the duke ask hardinge the other day what he think of the government he say he think that by lose canningite and brunswicker it be fifty weaker than lord liverpool 's and these fifty go the other way make a difference of one hundred on a division lord camden think if the brunswicker would not come in we must get a few whig -- abercromby sir jame graham the althorpe people stanley would come for anything good and brougham too arbuthnot ask I if i think lord rosslyn would be cordial with we i say yes he letter of acceptance be most cordial and with the lord he be on excellent term the only danger would be if peel and the commoner be shy lord gray i say i do not think in very good humor but he would differ on foreign politics rather than on question of a domestic nature the duke will not be coquet with he because he say very honestly he should be exciting expectation in lord gray which while the king live he do not think he can gratify saw mr elphinstone by appointment i wish to have he opinion with regard to the new settlement of indian government which may take place on the expiration of the present charter he seem to think that the administration of the government in the king 's name would be agreeable to the civil and military service and to people in england he doubt whether as regard the prince of indium it would signify much as they now pretty well understand we he doubt whether the order of government here would be better obey he think there might be a advantage in keep the king 's authority in reserve to be use only on grand occasion he confess however that ` have be educate and have live under the exist system he be not best qualify to propose to another he have he prejudice ' he think the best mode of arrive at the truth would be by take the opinion of practical indian as to reform and alteration suggest by theoretical man i ask he to consider the expediency of divide the territory as now into three unequal presidency of give to the governor-general the labor of superintend the administration in detail of the bengal presidency -- of have member of council i tell he there be many minor point of detail discoverable only by those employ at home which require and must receive amendment such for instance be the interpretation give to the act of parliament by which a _ regulation _ must be sanction or reject _ in extenso _ there be no power to alter a word or to reject part and take the rest mr elphinstone seem to dread a long peace in indium we hold everything together by the native army and we can not retain that unless we retain the affection of the european officer in the present state of we finances this be difficult _ July 1 _ at half-past five receive a letter from the chairman and the draft relative to the removal of the governor from calcutta the court wish to have it back to-day that be impossible but they have omit word i insert in the _ précis _ and must restore declare that have the removal be legal still the member of council would have be order back i have now be oblige to give reason for this addition and the reason will be so much worse as matter of record that i have suggest to the chairman he have better substitute a draft contain the word i think we must detain the _ palla _ that it may take out both letter -- this and the one relate to the lease which be not yet prepared or we must have a overland dispatch delay be one of the inconvenience attend the present system of indian government i tell the chairman in my private note that if we allow lord w bentinck to emancipate himself in this manner we should really be abandon all real control over the government of indium i see clearly there be a bentinck party in the court _ July 2 _ see hardinge we have some conversation upon the subject of the government he seem more alarmed than i be i trust to the king 's fear and the duke 's fortune besides we have the country hardinge tell I the king be very much out of humor the admission of lord rosslyn have not answer none follow lord durham calthorpe and other leave lord lansdowne to coalesce with lord gray hardinge wish I to try herry again with the view of open the mint by make he chancellor of the exchequer in indium but i tell he herry say he domestic circumstance make it impossible and the duke do not seem to like it at all herry think lord durham would be glad to be minister at naple for my part i be sure nothing will win lord gray but a place for lord gray himself and _ that _ in the present state of the king 's mind the duke be not in a condition to offer _ July 4 _ cabinet at half-past three the duke read a list of the several point to be consider before the next session i can not recollect half of they east indium charter bank charter usury law east retford duty on sugar duty on tobacco canada west indy education in ireland irish and english church poor in ireland public work commission on ecclesiastical court reform of english court reform of welsh judicature reform of court of equity scotch law of entail salary of scotch judge -- _ increase _ salary of english judge -- _ reduction _ grand jury ireland militia law stamp duty & c & c the only talk we have be about irish poor and public work in ireland the feeling seem against anything like poor law and against public work too this be mine the first productive of mischief the second useless undoubtedly it be a great hardship that the english parish should have the burden of irish poor but on the other hand in many case the payer of poor 's rate in these parish have derive advantage from irish labor fitzgerald peel and goulburn be to look into this subject and all connect with ireland fitzgerald peel lord rosslyn and i think either herry or goulburn seem to think the opposition to the continuance of the china monopoly would be much greater than we expect fitzgerald seem desirous the question of commerce should be reserve and that of government decide i tell he the two be inseparably connect _ July 6 _ write to lord w bentinck tell he i much regret the have be oblige to send the two letter relative to the removal of the government and the lease -- tell he the duke coincide in opinion with the court i then express my surprise that the local government do not obey better say they seem to forget the order of the director be the king 's order transmit through the channel of the court and the board i add i should endeavor to introduce into every branch of indian government the subordination and the improvement now establish in the king 's service -- depend on he co-operation & c i send the letter to the duke to ask he if i should send it _ July 7 _ at quarter to six a messenger arrive from the duke to whom i send yesterday my letter to lord w ask if i should send it the duke desire to see the despatch to which it refer i have accordingly beg jone to send they to he

excuse for not go to windsor to the recorder 's report _ July 8 _ office at 2 wilson absent so i could not transact any military business carry the letter relative to the lease and the six regiment to the duke he say mine about the regiment be _ very good indeed _ the emperor of russium seem to have lay himself out most ably at berlin to captivate the king and the army and the people seymor 's despatch be useful he mention _ small _ thing which show the character of man the emperor do not disguise he desire of peace he want no _ garanty matérielles _ at the bosphorus for safe passage he ask the principle of a pecuniary indemnity but do not seem disposed to contest the detail bernstorff observe truly we could not get out of the greek treaty without the help of russium and russium want we to get out of the way the sultan begin to affect european manners call upon lady and talk about education dine with a merchant after all consider he education and he _ entourage _ sultan mahmoud be the most remarkable man in europe _ July 9 _ office at 2 meet herry tell he i should send he a statement of we indian loan and place leach at he disposal we could then talk they over and see whether we could effect any financial operation my idea be that by offer some little higher interest in indium we might induce the holder of the remittable loan to give up that privilege of receive the interest in england if resident here see major cunningham he look more than forty well certainly but i should doubt he do much hard work he do not think himself a good person to command irregular he rohilla be almost in as good order as regular he tell I lieutenant-colonel skinner be a man of large land property he have raise he corps very much from he own estate and neighborhood and be a sort of feudal chieftain he have be educate like a native though the son of a colonel in the company 's service see sir murray maxwell -lrb- footnote : he have command the ` alceste ' which take out lord amherst as ambassador to china twelve year before -rrb- it seem to I sir murray want to be send with a frigate to try to open a commercial communication with pekin he think even japan might be induce to trade the instant the chinese find the ship be go and lord amherst mean to return by land they would have nothing to say to he they probably take he for a spy sir murray think the chinese might be lead to give a port to the northward he describe the spanish population of manilla as be very small -- the native population large it be but four day ' sail with a good breeze from manilla to canton always a favourable wind the harbor magnificent i think the whole object of he visit be to get a ship and a sort of half embassy _ July 10 _ receive a letter from lord clare who see the duke yesterday he say the duke be very kind and tell he he should get all the information he could before the committee of next year i shall most willingly assist he _ July 11 _ cabinet talk of ireland the disposition to outrage seem increase the duke say we be responsible for the success of the measure of this year and we must put down the armed meeting warburton must be order to do so the duke say emphatically if we do not preserve the peace of ireland we shall not be a government peel be to write immediately he think the first appearance of a determination to put down these meeting will have the effect of crush they we speak of poor law education and grand jury lord f leveson _ despair _ as to the two first upon both the government will form its opinion i be glad to see that the more the question of poor law be consider the more the introduction of they appear unadvisable _ or of any approach to they _ i have ever hold this opinion in cabinet we again have do so many week ago consider whether any extension of time should be give to the brazilian for the termination of they traffic in slave aberdeen seem very indulgently inclined towards the slave dealer -- not so peel and fitzgerald they seem first of all to think it would be a awkward parliamentary case and peel protest against we become responsible as we should for the horrible consequence which might attend the continuance of the trade for six month the chancellor think a vessel leave the coast of africa that be engage in the slave trade at such a period as would afford a reasonable probability of she arrive on march 13 should be safe i think February 13 be after much desultory discussion fix as the day after which no vessel should leave the coast of africa the brazilian have offer as a equivalent for six month a agreement that in future vessel fit for the slave trade even if they have no slave on board should be seizable it seem to be the opinion a little exaggerated i think that no prospect of future prevention of slave - trading could justify we in permit for a instant the immediate benefit we have within we grasp _ July 12 _ the great day in ireland but i hope its happen on Sunday may break its effect the order for vigorous interposition determine upon on Saturday will have be of no use in prevent collision to-day or even to-morrow should the anniversary be postpone the duke of cumberland go to hanover but he return in October and old eldon meet he then in london they have a regular cabinet to decide whether he should go or not read the court-martial of lieutenant lewi of the bombay artillery who strike a officer in the presence of he wife the chair wish to restore he it be impossible there be a end of all moral and gentlemanlike feeling if it be not understand that a man 's person be sacred in the presence of he wife we presume a wife to have feeling and a man to respect it _ the blow _ alone would have be a good cause of dismissal have a letter from the bishop of calcutta who on offer to execute episcopal function at the cape be tell by hay of the colonial office that the cape be not in he patent and he could no do so this be a mistake he can exercise episcopal function but not episcopal jurisdiction have a letter from mr joliffe of merstham -lrb- footnote : the seat of the joliffe family near reigate in surrey -rrb- propose steam-boat navigation to india a application from salisbury for a letter of recommendation to lord w bentinck in favor of mr chester tell he this be not a good time to ask a favor of lord william and it would be better to send the recommendation with the man who do not sail till October _ July 15 1829 _ office find a letter from loch suggest the irregularity of my send for he officer and communicate with they on the subject of despatch to be send to the indian government and express a hope that nothing would occur to interrupt the harmony which exist between we i say in reply that i have express a wish to see colonel salmond and afterwards to see colonel farant merely from my desire to expedite business and to do it well that it be mention in conversation with colonel salmond and mr wilson on Monday that there be no irregularity in that course and that i immediately determine to desist from it that i believe i have so express myself at the time to colonel salmond i add that i could assure he i would not willingly by endeavor to extend the limit assign by parliament to the power of the board or by my manner of exercise that power interrupt the harmony which so happily exist between the court and I go to the foreign office i fear the defeat of the turk near shumlum be decisive but still we have only russian account and they do _ so lie _ it seem certain the russian take the opportunity of open a negotiation the carelessness of the turk in not keep a good look-out towards silistrium seem unaccountable and they dawdle sadly before pravady the new vizier be very inferior to old hussein pacha whose caution would have avoid this catastrophe dine with the east indium volunteer the officer of the regiment be all clerk in the company 's service the non-commissioned officer and private serve in they warehouse there be now 600 man during the war they have three regiment each 800 strong -- all they own servant when my health be drunk i speak of the duke of wellington 's natural fondness for indium of the high term in which he always mention the gallantry of the indian army and the purity of the civil service i say the minister be animated by he example & c the speaker tell I he think mr stanley -lrb- footnote : a curious instance of the failure of political prophecy even by man of judgment and experience seventeen year later he be leader of a party and twenty - three year afterwards prime minister -rrb- would never rise higher than he be now it have be a curious session -- all man endeavor to avoid commit themselves _ July 16 _ loch show I two letter of sir j malcolm in which he deprecate the send of more writer and say _ number _ may be diminish but not _ salary _ especially in the higher rank and if writer be send they must be provide for i believe he be right i have already suggest the non-appointment of writer this year and the chair seem to acquiesce -- indeed to have think of it themselves recorder 's report before the report madame de cayla the duchess d'escars & c be present to the king i have some conversation with rosslyn and herry as to the indian question herry seem to be afraid of the house of common rosslyn a little too of public opinion as to the opening of the china trade they both seem rather hostile to the continuance of the present system i say i consider it to be a settled point that the patronage of indium should be separate from the government the necessity of make that separation lead to one great difficulty the necessity of remit home in goods 3200000 # lead to another difficulty and to make the government of indium wherever it might be place _ mercantile _ the east indium company would not and could not without the monopoly carry on the concern neither herry nor rosslyn seem to admit the necessary separation of the patronage of indium from the government i say that if it might not be separate it would be easy to make a better and a cheaper government i can see that peel fitzgerald herry rosslyn -- perhaps sir g murray -- will be against the company the duke say it be clear to he that the remittance must be make in goods and could not be make by bill he be for the monopoly in a few day the papers will be print a copy will then be furnish to each member of the government and i shall receive they observation the recorder 's report be a very heavy one all the case bad and seven order for execution the king seem very well stratford canning and lord strangford be at the court to be present on they return before the report we read the last irish papers the duke of northumberland and lord f leveson seem to think rather favourably of the condition of ireland the belief of peel and goulburn and i believe of the duke be that _ one _ example would settle all lord f leveson say that the brunswicker be encouraged _ from st jame 's _ to expect that the relief bill will be repeal many wish for a explosion the catholic less than the protestant _ July 19 _ hardinge and wood dine with I hardinge say the duke of cumberland have determine not to leave england but to send for the duchess and he son the duchess of gloucester do not before and will not now receive the duchess of cumberland old eldon want a guarantee that no more whig will be admit i believe he would be satisfy with none but he own admission hardinge seem to think we may not have a majority when parliament meet i think he be wrong i trust to the duke 's fortune and to ` the be a government ' which be much and to the other not be able to form a government which be more _ July 22 _ have a letter from loch he do not like the disbanding of the six regiment but he say he bring it before the court again on Monday have promise every possible information read some of colonel tod 's ` rajastan ' i have rather see rajastan or rajpootana than any part of indium it would really be interesting colonel tod seem to be a enthusiast about the country and the people he be there apparently at least sixteen year the story of the beautiful princess of oudeypore -lrb- footnote : krishna komarus she be poison by she father to avoid the hostility of the rival prince who demand she hand the father be still live when colonel tod write the house of oudeypore be the only native reign family who disdain to intermarry even with the emperor of delhus see tod 's _ rajasthan _ i 066 -rrb- in tod 's book and sir j malcolm 's be the most romantic and the most interesting i know that family of oudeypore or mewar seem to be the most ancient in the world it far surpass the bourbon and the house of hapsburg _ July 23 _ chair at eleven tell they of the danger in which they be from the feeling of the mercantile district and of the country that we could not look parliament in the face without have do all in we power to effect reduction in a deficit of 800000 # a year that without a commanding case no government however strong could venture to propose a renewal of the monopoly they be oblige to I for my information i advise they to turn they attention immediately to all the great point on the subject of the six regiment the court differ from the view i take loch give I a long statement of fact which i must read attentively and then communicate with the duke they be so enamoured of old habit that they hesitate about desire they indian government and the subordinate correspondent of these government to place upon the back of they voluminous letter a _ précis _ of they substance after the chair be go i see banke and leach and while they be with I sir archibald campbell call i see he immediately he be a fat rather intelligent-looking man well mannered and sensible i talk to he of the idea of exchange tenasserim -lrb- footnote : the furthest province of the british territory towards siam extend along the coast south of pegu and lately conquer from the burmese empire -rrb- he do not like give up he conquest i give he one secret letter and he will make he observation upon it he leave lord william at the mouth of the hooghly they have find out the removal of the government be contrary to law they have intend to be itinerant for a year or two it be only in the bengal army that the officer be old there they rise by seniority in the madras army they be make from fitness the madras army though most gallant be quite unequal from deficiency of physical strength to face the burmese the burmese soldier bring fourteen day ' provision all man be liable to be call upon they never have more than 120000 in the field the english army take 2000 cannon and it be believe the burmese have 2500 leave sir a campbell say there have be 60000 refugee from ava -- all now settle in tenasserim i have think there have never be more than 10000 and that some about half have return upon the whole he seem enamoured of he conquest but he do not adduce any good reason against exchange it at the cabinet room see lord rosslyn there as i use to be last year _ désoeuvré _ and bore as all privy seal will be he seem dissatisfied with the state of affair in ireland and in england at manchester there be a fear of a turn-out of some more cotton-spinner every thing depend upon the harvest the negotiation with the turk come to nothing the grand vizier 's answer to diebitch be excellent the sickness amongst the russian troops continue and diebitch have not more than 40000 man even with roth 's corps the ambassador have be very well receive at constantinople all be in good humor there notwithstanding the loss near shumlum the emperor do not go to the army lord heytesbury represent russium as be the least formidable of the great power for the purpose of offensive operation and seem to think she contain many element of convulsion metternich be try to cajole the russian by pretended fear of revolutionary principle they talk of a king in columbium and the french be intriguing to place a french prince on the throne after bolivar _ July 25 1829 _ cabinet room the ambassador seem to have be receive most cordially at constantinople we know no more of the grand vizier 's loss that he experience a complete defeat there can be no doubt in columbium the french seem rather incline to place after bolivar a prince of the house of orlean on the throne and it do not seem unlikely that the columbian may consider it they best arrangement the emperor of russium seem to be desirous of peru and the king of prussium have at he request send the baron von müffling as he minister to the porte to mediate the irish account be very bad lord f leveson seem now to think very seriously of the state of thing doherty be come back much alarm from barris where he have be with blackie on a special commission _ July 28 _ i recommend to the attention of the chair the establishment of steam communication with indium by the red sea _ July 29 _ read _ précis _ relative to kotah these _ précis _ will make I thoroughly acquaint with the history and circumstance of the rajpoot state which be by far more interesting than other there be a looseness and a vulgarity in the east indium house write the literature of clerk which be quite disgusting we clerk write better than theirs but they do not write concisely and correctly _ July 30 _ read lord heytesbury 's letter he be very russian they have certainly get the plague at odessa and in all the station of the russian army meet peel at the cabinet room he say ireland be in rather a better state he agree with I in think the brunswicker be the cause of all the mischief he believe the king have beg the duke of cumberland to stay and that the duchess be certainly come over they wish to attack the ministry through the side of ireland -- to make a civil war rather than not turn out a government he have write to the duke suggest that we ought to have a cabinet respect ireland and he think the duke would come to town on he letter _ August 1 _ have from sir g murray papers relative to the canada question upon which he wish to have the opinion of the cabinet to-morrow the immediate question be whether a bill pass by the colonial legislature for alter the state of the representation shall be confirm by the crown the state of canada be such that i be convince we ought in prudence to place the revenue collect under the 14th geo ii at the disposal of the chamber retain as they be willing to retain a fix salary for the government judge independent of the annual vote _ Sunday August 2 _ cabinet at 4 irish question lord f leveson seem to be much alarmed he want to use the bill of this year for the suppression of a expect meeting at derry which meeting be to be unarmed sing song drink toast make speech and petition for a change of minister it be consider that the power entrust to government by the bill for the suppression of the roman catholic association be never intend to be exercise for the put down of such a meeting as that intend to be hold at derry if the brunswicker there come out of they house and have a procession _ cause fear _ and threaten the peace the common law can put they down care will be take to have troops enough at derry lord f leveson likewise ask whether he shall proclaim martial law peel very properly ask he what martial law be in fact it be the absence of all law -- and can only be endure when a country be on the eve of rebellion or actually in rebellion -lrb- footnote : this be exactly the description give of it by lord beaconsfield with reference to jamaica in 1866 -rrb- it seem to I that lord franci be unequal to he situation i wish we have hardinge there he would never go wrong herry tell I he think after read the papers i have send he that there be more of care for the company than he expect peel have write a very good letter to lord f gower tell he that the first thing they must do be to establish a _ efficient police _ to be pay for by ireland -- and of which the officer must be appoint by government _ August 3 _ see hardinge he have perfect a very excellent system in ireland by which all the 30000 pensioner be divide into district in each of which be a chief constable who pay they if they move from one district to another they have a ticket so that the residence and the movement of all be know of 30000 about 10000 be fit for duty blank order be ready at the castle direct the march of these man upon five central point where they would be incorporate with the regiment so that in a few day the army could be reinforce by 10000 man there be other who be not very capable of do anything but mischief if against we these would be order to the garrison i wish hardinge be in ireland instead of lord franci _ August 6 _ chair at 11 astell do not seem to like my letter relative to the delay in answer despatch from indium and in communicate event in indium and respect the amount of military store send to indium and the expediency of enquire whether they amount could not be diminish loch do not say anything it be a attempt at bully on astell 's part which i resist and successfully _ August 10 _ the russian appear to have pass the defile on the northern side of the balkan and almost without loss there be i conclude a force near bourga but all that be to be hope be that the turk will be wise enough not to fight it be a unlucky appointment that of the grand vizier old hussein never would have commit he fault r gordon have be magnificently receive at constantinople polignac have be make prime minister of france de rigny be make minister of marine the government be tory and i should think very favourable to english alliance not greek and certainly not russian if it should be able to stand it must be good for we receive letter from colonel macdonald from tabriz he say the russian at tifli talk as if they be go to war with we _ August 11 _ receive persian despatch the persian will pay no more they want to go to war no one would go as envoy to petersburg but a _ attaché _ they all think they should be behead macdonald seem to have keep they quiet cabinet room meet lord melville read gordon 's letter from constantinople the turk have not above 20000 man there they be not dispose to yield at all gordon think if we declare we would fix in any manner the limit of greece and maintain they the porte would not quarrel with we and would rather do anything than yield the point of honor by acknowledge the independence of the greek the russian mean to pass the balkan with 60000 man and march on adrianople they send a large force by sea to sizebolus to turn bourga lord franci leveson hold out the apprehension of a long religious contest in ireland -lrb- footnote : unhappily like other pessimist he seem to have judge ireland correctly -rrb- i believe he look only at the surface and judge from first appearance _ August 12 _ a victory gain by paskewitz over the seraskier whom he have take prisoner with thirty-one piece of cannon & c near erzeroum -- that be three day after the battle paskewitz still in pursuit be within forty mile of erzeroum write two letter to the duke -- one on the subject of sir j p grant who have close the court at bombay because the government would not execute a unlawful process and the other respect persian affair give the substance of the despatch which i enclose we have a cabinet to-morrow at 12 on turkish affair i would not allow the russian to advance any further i would send one from we own body _ incognito _ to pari to talk to polignac and endeavor to get he to join we in a act of vigorous intervention which would give character to he government and save constantinople i would pass the english and french fleet through the dardanelle and give russium a leaf out of the greek treaty but i do not expect that this will be aberdeen 's course drummond whom i saw say the duke be delighted with the account of the jaghirdar of the kistna granville be go to ireland the duke be go to windsor it be the king 's birthday _ August 13 _ when the cabinet be assemble the duke say we be not to consider the state of thing at constantinople and what we should do he think the russian would get to constantinople and into it if they do he think there be a end of the ottoman empire he be doubtful whether after the innovation introduce the turk would cordially support mahmoud -lrb- footnote : sultan mahmoud as be well know remodel the whole internal organization of the turkish empire he be denounce as the giaour sultan by old-fashioned turk -rrb- and already there be insurrection of the greek it be just what he predict in he letter to la ferronay and what lord dudley afterwards say in a letter to lièven the success of the russian be the dissolution of a empire which could not be reconstitute it be too late to interfere by force even if we have be dispose to do so alone he think france if we do nothing would be quiet -- if we do anything she would take the other line polignac be a more able man than people suppose and he would adhere to the course he adopt we might endeavor at any rate to ascertain he feeling and intention as to the greek question we must have a conference and consider the suggestion of the ambassador namely that whatever we choose to make greece should be declare independent and guarantee both the duke and aberdeen think france and russium would both take the proposition into consideration the former as to _ limit _ the latter for delay france have already tell we that provide we could agree upon the limit she be incline to adopt the suggestion of the ambassador we ask whether the permanent occupation of constantinople by russium be to be submit to the answer be _ no _ to be oppose by war it seem to I and to fitzgerald we have better endeavor to prevent at a small expense even if alone a measure we could only retrieve if it take place at a enormous expense if at all and which would in all probability effect the ruin of the turkish empire i do not think affair quite so desperate i think the russian might get to adrianople but not to constantinople and that they could not maintain themselves at adrianople without the command of the sea we have six ship at the mouth of the dardanelle and these with the turkish fleet would open the black sea i be for pass we ship up to constantinople and place they at the disposal of the ambassador for from hence we can not give order adapt to circumstance it be reply _ that _ would be war if war be to be declare we should do as much mischief as possible and go to cronstadt not to the black sea we should have we ship beyond the bosphorus when russium occupy the dardanelle and shut we in this would make we ridiculous as the object be not to do mischief to russium but to save the turkish empire i should say that measure be to be effect at the bosphorus for constantinople once take and the ottoman power annihilate it would be of no use to distress russium fitzgerald seem to be of my opinion that however desperate the chance we should do all we could to save constantinople and at any risk it be determine that we fleet in the mediterranean should be reinforce by three or four line-of-battle ship on the principle that wherever any power have a large force we should have one -- not a very wise principle it seem to I if we be never to use force i intercede for a few powerful steamer with 68 pound carronade and i think lord melville seem inclined to acquiesce question be to be put to polignac to ascertain what he would do in certain event i say he never would open himself to lord stuart it be then suggest by the duke that aberdeen could write a private letter this will i believe be do i say to fitzgerald who be next to I ` neither letter nor stuart will get anything out of polignac one of ourselves should go to pari as a individual see polignac and return before the conference ' i suggest rosslyn as he have nothing to do fitzgerald say he could go and return in a week and seem to wish to do so however nothing be say openly and with all the means of success in we hand for i think polignac _ might _ be bring into we view we shall lose all by not use proper instrument just as we have lose the greek question by persist in keep stratford canning we have a good deal of conversation as to the limit of greece the duke be for adhering to the morea it be _ really _ the best line it be what we have guarantee we have tell the turk we do not mean to go beyond it aberdeen have always have a little private hankering after athen though he ridicule it he have no scruple about annex athen although not yet take i say i think polignac would be dispose to hold we language to russia if we would make some concession on the subject of greece and enable he to settle that question with _ éclat _ he would then be support by france in any strong language he might hold and would establish himself by the experiment of he first fortnight of office however the cabinet seem disposed to look at accessory not at principle at the minor object rather than at _ the one great object _ which be induce france to act with we to prevent the occupation of constantinople or to force its evacuation instead of yield upon point of minor importance in order to carry the question we be to insist now on the minor points-the evacuation of the morea by the french and then i fear we shall weaken polignac 's government and lose we object we foreign policy have certainly be most unsuccessful we have succeed in nothing the communication to be make to polignac be to be make to he confidentially and he be to know it be not to be make to austria it be consider that in any case austrium would support france and england if they act together and any indication austrium might give of move alone would bring down prussium upon she this line i think well consider and prudent it seem to be think that if the turkish empire should be _ dissolve _ austrium might be incline to share the spoil and be quiet but if it be only _ weaken _ she would feel she suffer it seem to be admit by all that we ought to have take a decide step long ago that we be too late and that we be inexcusable i say a year ago aberdeen would ruin we -- he would gradually let we down not by any flagrant error but by be always under the mark the duke occupy as he be as prime minister want a efficient secretary for foreign affair and he could not have have a worse peel seem to think ireland stand much better since the proclamation respect the attack make by the ribbonman upon the orangeman in fermanagh he seem to think the irish government ready enough when thing be bring to they notice but that they do not read or attend to the report make to they _ August 19 _ i be incline to think from what colonel hodgson say that leather might be make in indium as well as here they have the hide of the buffalo they want the _ tan _ and some one must be send from this country to teach they he tell I of a mr cotton who be long at tanjore where the iron be and i have write to he _ August 22 _ the russian have take erzeroum and have quite disperse the turkish army in asia every success of theirs in that quarter make my heart bleed i consider it a victory gain over I as asia be _ mine _ _ August 28 _ the ` courier ' of last night throw doubt on the report victory of kirkhilissa the sultan be say to be now ready to treat the plague be in the russian army and in the country before they have a long conversation with hardinge on indian affair _ August 29 _ read a letter from mr cartwright the consul at constantinople date the 9th the loss of erzeroum be to be attribute to the janizary in all asia they seem to be rise the russian be not expect to advance till they be join by 15000 man come by sea thus we fleet would have save constantinople cabinet at half-past three before the cabinet read lord heytesbury 's and mr gordon 's despatch lord heytesbury seem to be a mere russian _ August 31 _ mr gordon describe the turkish empire as fall to piece the national enthusiasm and religious feeling of the people seem to be go the sultan be unpopular the populace of adrianople desire the advance of the russian so scandalous have be the conduct of the asiatic the pacha of egypt give no assistance and think the weakness of the porte constitute he strength the people of trebizond have invite count paskewitz erzeroum be lose by the treachery of the janizary the sultan have accede to the treaty of london this accession be qualify but not in such a manner as to preclude negotiation he have consent to treat with russium to give freedom to the navigation of the black sea and to observe the treaty of akerman -- but he stipulate for the integrity of the ottoman dominion in europe and asia he have not however send plenipotentiary general muffle the prussian be arrive at constantinople he report the moderate view of the emperor nichola and state they the french government from the information it derive from its minister at berlin have instruct count guilleminot to declare to the turk the term on which russium will make peace russium require the execution of the treaty of akerman -- indemnity -- -lrb- but moderate -rrb- for the expense of the war and the loss sustain by she commerce for which indemnity as it seem she be willing to take anapa she require the free navigation of the dardanelle for all nation this cession to be secure by treaty not by territorial occupation the term of the turk be not very dissimilar but as count diebitch have order to advance till preliminary be sign a catastrophe may take place still mr gordon manage to get a paper into the sultan 's own hand which may have lead in some measure to this result he naturally give credit to the information contain in the despatch of count guilleminot but the french government have no authority for they opinion as to the term on which russium will make peace no communication to that effect have be make officially to they the french and russian minister at the conference say they could not act on mr gordon 's letter which be as yet uncorroborated by count guilleminot they could not yet act as if turkey have accede to the treaty of london the russian would now declare the independence of greece within the gulf of volo and arta and they want aberdeen to take that instead of the treaty he think he could get they to declare the independence of greece _ within the morea _ -- that they would be satisfy with that and that if they would we have better secure that for the turk now than run the risk of the event of war and of the extension which might be give to the term which might be force upon they under the treaty of london however even admit that the russian would be content with the independence of greece within the morea -lrb- with attica -lrb- footnote : attica be still hold by the turk have be reconquer after its first occupation by the greek -rrb- by-the-bye -rrb- it be the opinion of the duke and of every one -lrb- but aberdeen -rrb- that it would neither be generous nor honorable to force upon the turk in they distress term which _ they _ attach much value to the _ suzeraineté _ might think less favourable than what they might obtain under the treaty of london and that we should be draw ourselves into the embarrassment of what would be practically a new treaty at the moment that we be begin to entertain hope of get out of that which have so long harass we upon the whole i think the aspect of eastern affair be better than it have be since we have be a government diebitch be say to have 35000 man and a reserve of 40000 i doubt the reserve be so strong the 15000 from sebastopol have join paskewitz be make grand cross of st george diebitch will be so of course the king peel say be very blind he have lose the sight of one eye the duke say when he be at windsor last the king be particularly civil to he and peel and the duke be both of opinion that the king would be most cordial with the government if the duke of cumberland be away and be now more so than could be expect under he influence aberdeen seem to have write the letter to stuart and stuart to have communicate it to prince polignac stuart 's idea be that polignac have have too much to do in fix himself to think much of foreign politics he express himself however dispose to consult with england as to the measure which should be adopt if russium should break she engagement several representation have be make to france for the withdraw of the french troops from the morea -- but hitherto without effect these troops keep the country quiet and enable the whole force of the greek state to act offensively thus assist by french and russian money the greek have acquire possession of everything within the gulf of volo and arta except the island of negropont _ September 1 1829 _ read with attention a paper of courtney 's on leach 's observation write some memorandum upon it which i shall send with it to the duke when i have get from shepheard a statement of the benefit derive by the territory from the fixed rate of exchange it be a valuable paper i have write to thank he for it and to ask he to give I the result of he consideration on the mode of transfer the government of indium from the company to the king without materially increase the patronage of the crown and likewise the view he take of the alteration it would be desirable to introduce if the company should continue to govern indium in the power of the board of control and in its relation with the court _ September 3 _ the director be much afraid of the russian so be i and the russian begin to threaten we they hint that they have open to they the route to bagdad and they announce the presence in petersburg of a afghan chief and of ambassador from runjeet singh i feel confident we shall have to fight the russian on the indus and i have long have a presentiment that i should meet they there and gain a great battle all dream but i have have they a long time i have some idea of a secret letter to bombay direct the government to take possession of the island of karak -lrb- footnote : a small island in the persian gulf to the north-west of bushire -rrb- and of any other tenable point to seal the euphrate in the event of the russian move down loch want to dethrone runjeet singh _ September 4 1829 _ see colonel willoughby

matchlock over the arm at full gallop and with correct aim they strike a tent-peg out of the ground with they lance _ September 5 _ receive a answer from the duke he think the question of the six regiment begin to be serious as the court throw upon the government the responsibility of run the risk of a mutiny in the army -- desire to see the paper which i have send he and say it must go to the cabinet i feel satisfied i be right if the cabinet give in to the court they weaken my hand so much that i shall be unable to effect any great reform they make the director the real minister of indium and almost emancipate the indian government so i tell the duke in my letter _ September 7 _ office see sir a campbell he come to offer himself for a command in indium i speak to he of he papers respect war with the burmese he say large boat carry 100 man could go up to aeng the troops need not land at ramree he be never a advocate for a diversion at rangoon and think they make too much fuss about the frontier of munnipore see a mr cotton for a long time collector of tanjore he be against introduce the ryotwaree settlement into that country and by he account it seem very ill adapt to it for accord to he the murassidar be there really proprietor and with they the settlement be now make for the village i send for he to tell I about the iron i have understand to be in the neighborhood of tanjore but there be none it be at satara he seem a sensible man and i must see he again the turk seem to have endeavor to back out of they accession to the treaty of london or rather to clog it with insuperable objection but mr gordon have bring they back again and on August 12 all be right but no plenipotentiary send the russian be say to be move on adrianople they have not above 35000 man there be a very bad account from smyrna of the state of the population in asia in fact the duke of wellington 's prediction be fulfil the turkish empire be break to piece by lord heytesbury 's account the russian be very desirous of peace and very apprehensive that a popular tumult may put a end to the sultan it be impossible to see the end of the calamity which would occur complicate as they would be if such a event as the dissolution of the turkish empire take place the new french ministry be change the municipality they hope to succeed at the next election lord stuart consider m de la bourdonnaye as the real head polignac very prudently rest on he oar as to greece and properly observe it be idle to make protocol here when the march of event may have altogether change the state of thing before the protocol arrive _ September 8 _ office at 11 go to the duke he read to I a long letter he have write on the question of the six regiment in which he enter at length into the state of the indian army such as he know it to be and conclude in favor of a revision of the line i have adopt with he approbation he say the government of indium be wrong -- every line of the propose letter abstractedly right but there be to be consider the expediency of write it i have write a letter to lord w bentinck state confidentially the grounds of the change of opinion as to the disbanding of the six extra regiment i add ` however such a event will not happen in you time nor i hope in mine ' or something to that effect _ September 11 _ chair at 11 read to they the duke 's letter on the six regiment tell they i have write a private letter to lord william to relieve he mind from the censure intend for former government -lrb- a very small portion of which be chargeable on he -rrb- and to caution he against similar error give they the alteration i have intend to make in the draft respect pension grant to king 's soldier enlist into they army they will consider it _ September 14 _ read the papers contain the correspondence with the local government respect the provision of store in indium it be hardly credible yet it be true that till within these few year the medical board indented upon england for drug which be produce in indium from madras as late at 1827 they indent for file handle and blacksmith ' tong from bombay in 1826 for wooden canteen and triangle it be evident the local government have never display any energy _ September 16 _ receive from the duke he idea on the subject of a campaign against ava he would hold the great dagon temple at rangoon but only for the purpose of have vessel in the river to co-operate with the army _ September 17 _ to-day have be a idle day i have do nothing but i have take exercise and so acquire _ health _ without which i can not do business _ September 20 _ meet mr conyngham of the foreign office he tell I the turk be ready to make the require concession of the disposition of the russian nothing seem known r gordon have of he own authority order up sir pulteney malcolm from vourlum to the dardanelle i suppose to carry away englishman and they property in the event of a insurrection or of some terrible catastrophe at constantinople lord stuart as i suspect give no opinion as to the probable result of the political contest in france i have a letter from the duke respect half-batta _ September 24 _ cabinet room read all the letter from petersburg pari berlin and constantinople during the last fortnight and the despatch send during the last month r gordon seem to have do very well he and guilleminot have act cordially together and when they have induce the porte to consent to make peace on the term prescribe by the russian gordon manage very prudently to get general muffle to send he secretary to the russian head-quarter with the turkish plenipotentiary muffle would have go with they to the real effendi have he be well enough as it be he send he secretary who afterwards go to the russian head-quarter and be thus enable to state distinctly what have pass in the conference hold with the effendi i think it very possible that without the intervention of the prussian minister who be know to be acquaint with the feeling of the emperor general diebitch would not have agree to a armistice the armistice seem to have be make on August 29 we know of it from seymor at berlin polignac seem excellently well disposed he would act cordially with we if he dare at present he be oblige to cover all he do under the instruction give to guilleminot by he predecessor under a different state of thing before the great russian success he talk of a congress of the power interested and of a joint declaration if russium should not adhere to she promise russium may be keep to she promise by the fear of a revolutionary movement in france the french opposition desire the success of the russian the dissolution of the turkish empire and the occupation of the dardanelle by the emperor nichola because they know that such event would lead to a _ sotto sopra _ in europe a general scramble in which they would get the rhine as they boundary generally i have no doubt young france wish for confusion austrium be alarmed and would do nothing the prussian hold that the existence of the ottoman empire be not essential to the balance of power -lrb- that be some of they do -rrb- and they would be glad to see austrium and russium divide turkey prussium have she compensation in germany however muffle go rather beyond he instruction have be make to do good i think all thing tend to the preservation of peace if there should be no explosion at constantinople or in france the ottoman empire seem however to be fall to piece the government have be so oppressive that the people will not fight for it the sultan have but 4000 troops and it be say the appearance of 10000 russian would lead to the capture of constantinople diebitch seem to dread the catastrophe which might ensue and the ambassador have place before he in strong term the fatal consequence of a explosion at constantinople i must say r gordon have do ably and well the rascally russian have be intriguing with we ionian subject and aberdeen have write a very strong letter to lord heytesbury on the subject polignac desirous as he be of withdraw the french troops altogether from the morea be at present afraid of do so aberdeen tell I thing be not go on well here the king have quite lose the sight of one eye and the sight of the other be indistinct it give he pain too and the fear of blindness make he nervous the duke of cumberland be always about he as mischievous as ever but pretend not to be hostile the duke of wellington give the king up as a bad job he see he very seldom at first he like see he and set thing to rights but he say he find what he do one day be undo the next and he be in despair the king have no constancy there be no depend upon he from one day to another aberdeen say the accession of rosslyn have not produce the effect we anticipate -- that lord gray be very hostile what we shall do for a majority next session i know not but i think we shall stand -lrb- footnote : this might have be but for the event on the continent in the year follow which form a new starting-point in the politics of a large part of europe -rrb- although we shall not i fear be a strong government the catholic relief bill have destroy we unity and the spirit of party it have likewise destroy that of the opposition who have no longer any rally point thus the formation of a strong government be difficult the brunswicker can not form one and the king can not be persuade to make one out of the opposition indeed that the duke of cumberland would never advise the brunswicker will endeavor to make term with we as a body -- to make martyr of some of the old protestant particularly of the duke and peel and place themselves at the head to go on as well as they could with the rest of we this will not do _ September 26 _ the chair or rather the court somewhat impertinently object to the addition i make to a recent draft recommend a enquiry by practical and scientific man as to the power indium may possess of produce many article of store now send from england they say this be liable to misconstruction and then misconstrue it themselves they suppose these practical man not be servant of the company to sit in judgment upon the proceedings of the military board i have correct they intentional misconstruction and have acquiesce in the substitution of a draft they propose to send instead which will i hope practically effect my object and therefore i have say we be willing we object should be attain in the manner most agreeable to the court of director it be very lucky i have just send they my letter about store it will appear to be write subsequently to theirs they think to humbug and to bully I they will find both difficult _ September 30 _ read the collection respect the health of the king 's troops it be incredible to I that so many thing should remain to be do -- nothing seem to have be do that ought to have be do i fear we finances make the building of new barracks impossible at present we could not build proper barracks for all the european troops in indium much under a million still much may be do for they health _ October 5 _ arrive in london at 3 to the cabinet room where i find lord bathurst come up to town for seymor bathurst 's -lrb- footnote : hon seymor bathurst fourth son of third earl bathurst married October 6 1829 julium daughter of john peter hankey esq -rrb- marriage and afterwards fitzgerald come in fitzgerald be a fortnight in ireland and give a bad account of it a letter from metternich say peace be actually sign sir e gordon 's despatch give every reason to expect it soon would be the peace can not last i be incline to think it would have be better for the russian to have occupy constantinople and for the ottoman empire to have be overthrow that we might have know at once where we be than to have have such a peace as this it be practically present occupation -lrb- for a year -rrb- of _ more _ than they now hold for they be to have the fortress cede to they they exact 750000 # for the pretended loss of they merchant and five million for themselves the indemnity to the merchant to be pay by three instalment on the payment of the first adrianople and a few place on the coast to be give up on the payment of the second everything to the balkan and on the third bulgarium these payment occupy a year the five million be to be pay in ten year or sooner if the turk can manage it the principality to be occupy till the payment the turk to confirm the government establish during the ten year and not to impose any tax for two year more all the fortress on the left bank to be destroy none of the island to belong to turkey no turk to enter the principality the prince to be for life all payment _ in kind _ from the principality to cease and instead the turk and the prince to _ agree upon a compensation _ it be unnecessary to go through the other article relative to the principality the treaty contain a real cession of they to russia the term as to the navigation of merchantman they not be search in a turkish port the refusal of acquiescence in the demand of the russian minister where any injury be pretend to have be do to a russian to be _ just ground for reprisal _ & c be of a nature intolerable to a independent power and not to be carry into execution on the side of asia everything be cede that can enable russium to attack either turkey or persium with advantage the term impose with regard to indemnity be extravagant and altogether contrary to all the emperor 's promise he have not deceive we but he have lie to we most foully sir r gordon seem to have do all that could be do perhaps he have save constantinople from conflagration and the empire from dissolution he have manage to settle the greek question turkey consent to everything the ally may determine under the protocol of march 22 sir r gordon have take upon himself to order up the english ship and guilleminot have order up the french ship but they be still at smyrna when the dispatch come away these ship it be hope may be some check on the russian and ostensibly they only go up to constantinople to save christian however if the russian advance they will probably lead the turk to fight gordon and guilleminot have very properly tell the sultan they will remain by he in any case the turk declare the term be as regard payment such as they have really no means of comply with the ally will make representation to petersburg to obtain a relaxation of these condition in the meantime while this be do at constantinople lord heytesbury be ask nesselrode what the term he intend to propose be and nesselrode would not tell he lord heytesbury 's despatch and gordon 's be both date on September 10 the 12th be to be the day of signature lord stuart by aberdeen 's direction have be press polignac very hard to withdraw the french troops from the morea and polignac have be oblige to plead the weakness of he government and to put off lord stuart by refer it to the conference i should say from what the papers show of polignac that he will not stand i do not know what he antagonist may be but he be evidently not a powerful man a liberal tell fitzgerald they object be now in france to make the king of the netherland king of france and give holland to prussia take belgium and everything to the rhine to themselves i should say thing look ill everywhere and unless we can make the emperor of russium fear a convulsion in france and determine to recede from some of he stipulation with turkey to satisfy the rest of europe we shall have war and war under the most unfavourable circumstance -- that be if austrium be not as pusillanimous as she may be weak for she ought never to consent to the establishment of the russian on the danube the only line for the turk to pursue be to promise everything to endeavor to perform everything and to withdraw to asia leave the rest of europe to settle who shall have constantinople _ now _ they could not do that as they be too weak but six month hence they may we dine with the duke on Wednesday -- and shall then i suppose determine what we be to do _ October 7 _ cabinet at 3 all present except lord melville aberdeen read a paper he have write before the peace be know the object of which be to show that the ottoman empire be dissolve and that it could not be reconstitute that we view with regard to greece should now change with circumstance and that we should endeavor to make it a substantive state to turkey it could no longer signify whether greece have a more extended or more limited line of frontier and we desire should be to place a fit man upon the throne france be willing to propose in the conference that to turkey should be offer the alternative of a greece with extended limit under suzeraineté & c accord to the protocol of march 22 or a greece with narrower limit entirely independent the duke say we must first have satisfaction for the insertion of the article in the treaty of peace which bind turkey to the protocol of march 22 russium as a party to the treaty of london have no right to settle that treaty herself next we should insist on a armistice between the greek and turk we must recollect that turkey have bind herself to acquiesce in the decision of the conference upon the greek treaty -- that be to defer to we mediation could we as mediator propose to turkey to cede attica negropont and other possession she now hold and would we willingly bring the frontier of the greek state into contact with we ionian island if greece be to have a sovereign prince philip of hesse homburg would be the best man for we -- austrium would prefer he france admit that the wish of austrium ought to be consult france however rather wish for prince charle of bavarium russium for a duke of saxe-weimar aberdeen seem to think there would be no great difficulty in carry we point and have prince philip of hesse homburg peel say he think we could not allow a treaty such as that sign by turkey to pass without a remonstrance on we part we refer to a letter of dudley 's and to aberdeen 's recent instruction to lord heytesbury and likewise to the various declaration of moderation put forth by the emperor nichola several way be start of express we opinion -- a sort of circular to the power which sign the treaty of the congress -- a declaration to parliament the duke suggest a remonstrance to the emperor nichola to be communicate in the first instance only to russia this seem likely to be adopt but we be to have another cabinet to - morrow in whatever we do we must endeavor to keep austrium out of the scrape for there be nothing the russian would like so much as the opportunity of march to vienna not only it would be romantic for we alone to go to war to maintain the balance of power but it would in this case be absurd indeed for if we army have drive the russian out of turkey we could not reconstitute the turkish empire it be dissolve in its own weakness great dissatisfaction be express and justly at the conduct of lord heytesbury who have be humbug by the russian all along the king have run up a bill of 4000 # for clothes in six month all the office of the household except the chamberlain 's which have 1900 # in hand be fall into arrear and if there should be a arrear upon the whole civil list it must come before parliament fitzgerald give a very bad account of trade generally the king do not like we better than he do and the duke of cumberland mean to keep he son in england and educate he here take the 6000 # a year he want to drive the government to make he viceroy of hanover the cabinet dine with the duke _ October 8 _ cabinet at 3 a great deal of conversation of which the result be that a remonstrance should be make to russia on the subject of the term of the peace this remonstrance will temperately but strongly more by statement of fact than by observation show that the peace be not such as the emperor have give we reason to expect he would require and that it in reality threaten the existence of the turkish empire that the destruction of that empire would seriously affect the peace of europe by change the relative position of the several state aberdeen want a guarantee of the territorial possession of turkey not of its government -lrb- footnote : it be observable that this guarantee seem to have say nothing of the internal system of government and so far to have be unconditional it would therefore have go considerably beyond the anglo-turkish convention of 1878 it would also have apply to europe as well as asia it be a commentary on the statement of mr gladstone in later day a colleague of lord aberdeen that no statesman whom he have know in former time would ever have listen to the idea of such a engagement -rrb- i think no one seem much inclined to agree with he such a guarantee would impose obligation without confer rights upon we it would be a guarantee which would give rise to infinite complication and which would embarrass we very much without a guarantee we may succeed in bring the great state to a understanding that the distribution of the turkish territory in the event of the fall to piece of that state must be a subject for the decision of a congress austrium have express herself very frankly she be ready to do anything she see the danger and desire to know we view of it the real view of france do not seem to be very different but there be no dependence to be place upon a government tremble for its life prussium will be satisfy with the peace she sovereign be very weak and the prussian think they interest be serve by the progress of russium in a direction contrary to they and in which she menace austria the smuggling case be say to tell against lord stuart he write unintelligibly and the french will not trust he -- so i shall not be sorry if we can get rid of he with lord heytesbury we be all dissatisfied and have be from the beginning there be a council on Monday and we have a cabinet on Sunday at 3 when we be to hear aberdeen 's letter and may probably have the treaty there seem a determination to effect a armistice by force if the conference will not order it in greece we have nine good ship there the russian seven bad one and the french two before the conference can proceed the 10th article of the treaty of peace must be declare _ non avenu _ -- that which oblige the porte to accept the protocol of march 22 -- all negotiation upon that protocol have be commit by russium to the french and english ambassador and it have be expressly reserve to the porte by we that she objection should be fairly weigh the french have take advantage of the peace to order they troops home from the morea _ October 9 _ read many of the protocol of the early conference after the russian declaration of war i shall to-morrow read these again carefully and sketch _ my _ state paper if i be in opposition i should describe the detail relative to the principality as show the moderation of the thief who would stipulate that man should sleep with they door open till they have ransom themselves by pay they uttermost farthing _ October 10 _ receive a letter from sir j malcolm he seem pleased with the secret dispatch relative to persium and the pacha of bagdad he seem upon the whole very much gratified and very grateful he strongly press the appointment of a indian as he successor and mention sir ch metcalfe and jenkin he likewise mention a mr chaplin of whom i never hear i take jenkin to be a cleverer man than sir ch metcalfe -lrb- footnote : afterwards lord metcalfe -rrb- who rather disappoint I have three letter by petersburg from colonel mcdonald the last date in August the persian thoroughly alarm be do all they can to satisfy the emperor nichola by punish the person engage in the massacre of the russian mission but they have a insurrection to quell on banish the high priest who be at the head of all as they conclude all the bad character have a hand in it they mean to take the opportunity of punish they paskewitz be say to have from 20000 to 22000 man -- to have sustain no loss in the late engagement but to suffer from the plague at erzeroum the mahometan be not only satisfied but well pleased the government of a russian general be better than that of a turkish pasha the prince abba mirza be at last do something towards make a army major hart alone however keep it together the troops be as yet ill - armed but they have they pay mcdonald think the king not likely to live long he want a cypher _ October 11 Sunday _ come up from worthe to a cabinet before we meet read the last letter from lord heytesbury which show a degree of infatuation respect the russian which be quite wonderful before we begin to talk rothschild call out the duke of wellington and offer at once all the money to pay the russian indemnity he say he only want the guarantee of england if the russian remain in the principality there would be a general war irvine a english loan jobber see the duke yesterday with the same offer the joke be that rothschild be to pay the money for the turk and to be make king of jerusalem aberdeen begin by beg we would first settle the greek question he bring a paper the russian be willing to deliver in contain a sort of apology for the 10th article and declare that it by no means interfere with the power of the conference we take a great deal of time in consider whether we should not suggest some alteration in this paper -- some be to be propose -- not very essential we have a long discussion as to the name of the new state at last it seem to be think ` sovereign prince of greece ' be the best aberdeen think he shall have little difficulty about the prince the russian agree to the description give but i dare say they imagine we mean to describe a different man i suspect they think we want to give they leopold aberdeen read a letter he propose send to lord stuart the purport of which be that we want to know what he mean to do towards redeeming france from the responsibility she have incur and make we incur by give instruction to count guilleminot state the term of peace and the moderation of the emperor -- instruction which mislead we ambassador and induce the two ambassador to give assurance to the porte which event prove to be unfounded the letter i think likewise desire he to enquire in what form we joint representation as to the amount of the indemnity be to be make to these the ambassador have pledge the two cabinet there be a great deal more in the letter which be to be leave out it go into the detail of the treaty or rather of its effect the offer be to be make to the turk of a independent greece from the gulf of volo to missolonghus or of a greece under suzeraineté with negropont and the line from volo to the gulf of arta i think we be all agree that at the commencement of the war it be we interest to take as little as possible from turkey -- that now it be we interest to make greece a substantive state which may hereafter receive the _ débris _ of the ottoman empire -lrb- footnote : this may explain the apparently illiberal view of many of the cabinet as to the greek boundary they see the difficulty of any halt place outside the isthmus of corinth short of a wider boundary even than that ultimately adopt -rrb- as to the really important matter the remonstrance to russium nothing be do nothing be i conclude write and aberdeen do not like cabinet criticism nor do i think the cabinet at all agree as to what should be say dudley 's letter use to occupy we for day and certainly they be the better for it -- although we lose a good deal of time occasionally aberdeen say he would send it to I i think i shall write a _ esquisse _ myself we be to have no more cabinet for some time the chancellor wish to have the remain fortnight of he holiday uninterrupted _ October 12 _ go to town at quarter-past one to the foreign office the treaty arrive last night lord aberdeen take it with he to windsor it differ materially from the _ projet _ the article respect indemnity be _ relégués _ to a separate transaction the payment of 100000 ducat be to lead to the evacuation of adrianople 400000 form the next payment then 500000 and 500000 make the sum originally demand for individual loss but as i understand mr backhouse eighteen month must elapse before turkey can be evacuate to the danube i have much conversation with he as to other point on look into the act of the congress i find the power adhering to it may be consider as binding themselves not to _ disturb _ the territorial arrangement that act establish but they be not bind to _ maintain _ they thus if france appropriate to herself spain she would violate the treaty but no power sign the treaty would be oblige by virtue of that act to make war upon france for do so that the general treaty contain no guarantee be evident from the specific guarantee of the cession make by saxony to prussium which would have be unnecessary if the spirit of the treaty have be that of existent guarantee _ October 13 _ cabinet room find lord rosslyn there read the treaty the king be very well yesterday the recorder 's report be so long that half be defer the last dispatch from persium which arrive on Friday be open at the foreign office and read by everybody aberdeen send they to the duke who have probably take they to walmer in he carriage the chair send for they and could not get they i must put a stop to this i have write to lord heytesbury to beg he will in future forward letter to they address write a ` proposed draft ' to lord heytesbury direct he if he should have reason to think the russian intend to exact further concession from persium to intimate that such a attempt will be consider by he majesty as unfriendly to himself as a asiatic power i doubt my get the duke to agree to the send of this despatch but i shall try _ October 14 _ carry my propose letter to lord heytesbury to aberdeen who agree to send it with a trifling alteration at least one not very important read to he my proposed letter to lord heytesbury on the peace of adrianople he seem to approve of great part of it he have do nothing at he yet and seem to think there be no hurry we shall stand very ill in parliament if we have nothing to show i think mine be a good _ cadre _ of a letter but that specific instruction should be give to lord heytesbury as to what he shall endeavor to obtain in a separate despatch read my draft to lord rosslyn after dinner he seem to think the view i take be the right and that much of what i have write be very good but that it might be shorten so i think _ October 15 _ henry copy the draft to lord heytesbury for the duke to whom i send it with a letter show the chair the draft to lord heytesbury on persium they be much pleased with it so be old jone send it to the duke in little doubt he approve it receive from the duke the persian despatch which i give to the chair the duke have not read they receive from he a letter on the subject of half-batta he say as a officer he should have think there be a compromise in 1801 that it should be look into as a question of economy that above all thing in deal with a army you must _ be just _ the duke think the publication of the letter of lord combermere 's secretary indiscreet and _ wicked _ and be very angry with lord combermere a letter will be write to the government on the subject directing enquiry _ October 19 Sunday _ read mcdonald 's despatch from persium and send they to the duke with a letter suggest the head of a letter to the envoy the russian have give up one of the two crore due and allow five year for pay the other they mean therefore to rule persium _ by influence _ however there be a good mahometan and anti-russian feeling beyond the euphrate and if mischief happen it be we fault receive a letter from hardinge respect half-batta he be for stand firm and give some general boon as a addition to march money to the whole army that be my idea i be sure it be the safest course write to loch suggest it and at the same time advise he to answer the paragraph respect half-batta and not give misrepresentation too much head _ October 20 _ two letter from the duke write very hastily it be evident he do not like my make a sketch of a letter to lord heytesbury and that he do not like any difference of opinion as to the batta question on the first point i still think i be right he mention some idea of russium order diebitch across the balkan and even the danube of she give up the principality & c in short he say all we know be that there be a peace -- we do not know what it be -- and it would be ridiculous to remonstrate against we know not what my draft be write before these report be spread and i only from anxiety to have the despatch well write and soon sketch what i think would do as to the report i have tell aberdeen i can not believe russium have on a sudden cease to be ambitious or to use perfidy as a mode of accomplish ambitious end she may give out she will make these change -- she may make some -- but she object be to prevent all combination on the part of austrium france and england if we do not remonstrate against what be sign we shall lose all credit if that which be execute should be comparatively favourable and we shall incur great blame if no relaxation take place a remonstrance might be so word as to do no harm to turkey or to europe and to do good to we the duke 's other letter be on the batta question upon which he do not like contradiction yet i think he course would lead to continued demand on the part of all the army i have tell he i shall be in town to see the chair on Saturday and will try to see he on Friday and if he wish bring the chair to he on Saturday _ October 21 _ receive a long confused letter from fitzgerald upon my project of a draft to lord heytesbury he be at sudborn -lrb- footnote : seat of lord hertford in suffolk -rrb- where the duke be the duke be not so much inclined to think the russian would make any considerable concession as aberdeen but he think and have make fitzgerald think it would be premature to remonstrate i have write to fitzgerald and tell he my opinion more at length than i tell aberdeen yesterday _ October 23 _ cabinet room read the despatch from petersburg and pari all the hint of the emperor of russium 's intention of not retain he army in turkey come through pari nesselrode have on September 29 speak thus specifically to the duke de mortemart and merely talk about take less money and make some change in the guarantee to lord heytesbury i do not see aberdeen who be engage with the spanish minister i do not depart from my original idea that russium do all this to gain time and with as much perfidy as she have show throughout polignac would take a loyal view if he dare i can not see the duke till Monday as he do not return to london till Sunday evening i see hardinge and have a long talk with he about batta & c _ October 24 _ chair at 11 the chair say the court have the matter entirely in they hand as to batta they wish to have the opinion of the cabinet and to be govern by that i have write to the duke to tell he so i be glad there be to be a cabinet because i think a cabinet will take a more popular view of the question than the duke and as i think a juster view i be for stand firm the duke 's letter on persian affair arrive while i be with the chair i read it to they the duke suggest that mcdonald should raise he escort in persium -- a excellent idea he object to major hart have a assignment of land he think willock may be recall the officer not but if the prince will pay they so much the better i think the duke may be right as to the assignment of land upon all the other point i entirely agree with he read last night a letter of lushington 's or rather a minute which show he be determine to remain cabinet room cunningham come in and show I a draft of aberdeen 's to we minister in spain on the recognition by spain of don miguel -- find excuse for spain and say we can not do it what i saw be the _ brouillon _ which have be send to the duke it have he observation in pencil and it seem aberdeen send all he propose despatch to he and alter they at he suggestion certainly aberdeen leave to himself would be a very incautious writer _ October 26 _ office early see captain hanchett on the subject of the navigation of the red sea he be there two year and a half he say in go in you should make aden and wait there for a wind water can be have there avoid mocha where the anchorage be dangerous and the water bad and go to the island of cameran then straight up in mid channel all the danger be visible and in the mid channel there be none cosseir a good little harbor the danger be go up to suez but that easy for a steamer he work with topgallant sail against the north-west monsoon there be a breeze along shore at all time the danger have be occasion by the timid sailing of the arab who always hug the shore and anchor at night _ October 27 _ i omit yesterday to mention that at the foreign office i see some despatch just receive from sir r gordon i think the date of the first be October 2 he have the day before at last get the turk to ratify the treaty but it seem there be a hitch and until the ratification the officer do not set off to stop hostility in asia a pasha have advance on philippopolus and general geismar on sophium diebitch threaten to advance on constantinople however the day after he write he threatening letter he must have receive the ratification the sultan be very anxious to get the egyptian fleet to constantinople probably as a pledge for the allegiance of the pasha and to show he greatest vassal obey he the turk say it be the moral effect of the presence of the fleet on they own subject that they want that they have no idea of not act faithfully sir r gordon assure I they mean to preserve the peace and must he have write the representation the turkish ambassador be to present to the emperor it would be a good remonstrance for we but it be not a good one for the turk it be very well write but it be quite european in its style and the russian will at once know as i do the author the turk intend to send a splendid embassy to petersburg and halil pasha once the slave of the seraskier now the sultan 's son-in-law be to have be the ambassador he be they least officer however diebitch tell they they must not send it till they have the emperor 's consent the turk have ready the first 100000 ducat to get the russian out of adrianople i should say from these despatch that thing do not look peaceful _ October 28 _ have a letter yesterday from mr elphinstone on nazarre it appear to be a fine on descent & c of jaghire land i think he opinion will be different from sir j malcolm 's -- the latter wish to make the jaghire hereditary or rather to give a fee simple interest to the actual proprietor mr elphinstone on the contrary thinking they should be resume on death without heir _ October 29 _ read a work just publish by colonel de lacy evan on the practicability of a russian invasion of indium the route would be first to china across a desert from the shore of the caspian -- from china by water up the oxus to within 550 mile of attock the great difficulty be between the end of the river and the southern side of the hindoo koosh this difficulty however have be often surmount and the road be constantly travel by caravan i think it be clear that the invasion of indium could not be attempt till the third year but when should we begin to take precaution a government wholly asiatic would not be still if the russian take possession of china but ours chained by european politics would hardly move if they enter cabul we ought to have full information as to cabul bokhara and china my letter of last year direct the attaining of information but i dare say nothing have be do _ October 30 _ receive a memorial from mr fullerton ask some remuneration beyond he salary for past service he have a claim _ if we be rich _ i think he should have 10000 dollar i dare say he think 20000 thoughtless extravagance be the destruction of generosity and even of justice upon the subject of the invasion of indium my idea be that the thing be not only practicable but easy unless we determine to act as a asiatic power on the acquisition of khiva by the russian we should occupy lahore and cabul -lrb- footnote : it may be remember that lord ellenborough strongly disapprove of any occupation of afghanistan or interference with its internal affair in 1840-42 at that time russium have not advance to khiva it be clear that he would not have hold the same opinion as to we policy towards afghanistan after the event of 1873-74 -rrb- it be not on the indus that a enemy be to be meet if we do not meet he in cabul at the foot of the hindoo koosh or in its pass we have better remain in the sutlege if the russian once occupy cabul they may remain there with the indus in they front till they have organise insurrection in we rear and completely equip they army i fear there be pass from balkh upon peshawur if these could be close and the enemy pour upon cabul we should know where to meet he now we be at cabul might be cut off from its resource by the descent of the enemy upon peshawur there be some road from roondorg through cashmere but i do not fear that the road a enemy would choose would be that by the valley of the cachgu we know nothing of these pass nothing of the country beyond they nothing of the course of the indus -- but we should have full information so as to be able to crush a advance enemy by make the whole country hostile which money would do to meet a invasion we must raise every regiment to 1000 man 168 regiment 360 ----- 1008 504 ------ 60480 man besides artillery 4000 king 's inf raise to 1000 each reg 1000 do four regiment of cavalry 4000 four new regiment 2000 two new cavalry besides king 's artillery ------ 71480 besides the increase which would take place in the irregular corps particularly in skinner 's a smaller increase than this would not be sufficient for we should require 20000 man at delhus 20000 in lahore and 60000 in cabul i speak of enrol not effective -- but with these augmentation the regular army would only be 148000 nus 24000 king 's ------- 172000 20000 native cavalry 6000 king 's ------- 198000 the out provisional battalion local corps & c of 198000 i do not think above 100000 could possibly be disposable and there would not be 70000 effective the artillery must be very numerous i omit the company 's english regiment about 3000 man of all nation the russian be the least adapt for a enterprise of this nature they have neither medical staff nor commissariat and the man be without resource a french army would be the best i doubt the possibility of russium bring more than 20000 man to cabul and these could not descend the mountain till the third year if cabul be occupy what i fear be a occupation of khiva unknown to we no preparation on we part -- no march forward -- so that in three or four month from leave khiva the enemy might be at cabul i be sure we can defeat the enterprise we ought to defeat it before the enemy reach the indus if 20000 russian should reach the indus it will be a sharp fight _ November 1 1829 _ a letter from the duke he return the papers i send he he have doubt as to the expediency of make the commissary-general of store i propose but he seem to have suppose i wish to do away with the military board i have explain what i mean he approve of my suggestion as to correspondence but think every paper must be send home and the collection form here i have explain that i always intend every paper should be send home and i have tell he that i have the opinion of the clerk i consult that the collection might be frame in indium with a saving of time and without diminish the check on the local government _ November 4 _ receive from aberdeen he draft of a remonstrance to russium which it seem must be send at last he have already show it to the duke and peel there be no great substantive objection to it but it be not very carefully write i shall send it to he tomorrow with many propose alteration in the second box come gaily -lrb- footnote : h gaily knight best know for he work on the norman in sicily and ecclesiastical architecture in italy -rrb- knight 's letter to aberdeen which be a poor flimsy production a peacock 's feather in the hilt of a drawcansir 's sword _ November 5 _ alter not only verbally but substantially aberdeen 's paper and send it to he cabinet room read a memorandum by lord heytesbury of a conversation he have have with the emperor of russium the emperor expect the early downfall of the porte -- and a revolution in france ask if another march to pari would be possible lord heytesbury see nesselrode afterwards and tell he what the emperor have say nesselrode say the emperor always see thing _ en noir _ he have a different opinion he do not think the porte in immediate danger nor do he expect a french revolution the other guarantee they talk of be further cession in asia specifically batoum or the occupation of varna or silistrium instead of the principality the latter be worse and the turk will probably consent to neither they do not value the principality and they know europe do -lrb- footnote : the principality as command the lower course of the danube be all important to austrium especially thus occupation by russium while it would have be feel as a menace to central europe would have leave turkey a compact state beyond the danube -rrb- _ November 6 _ see aberdeen he be always gloomy about _ division _ he be afraid of a attack on foreign policy he think the two party will unite in that he hear there have be some approximation between lord gray -lrb- footnote : lord gray have be separate from the bulk of the whig party since they junction with canning in 1827 -rrb- and lord holland at the same time it be say there be a notion of bring in lord gray i suspect this report to have be fabricate by the ultra-tory to annoy the king he think the duke be annoy more particularly at the king 's not treat he well and at he government not be well support in fact however it be a government which will not fall for the king hate the whig the people do not regard they he may like the tory but he know they can not make a government and the duke 's administration have four-fifth of the country receive a letter from the duke tell I he have settle colonel mcdonald 's knighthood and ask I if i should be ready to talk about indium on the 13th i say about batta certainly about indium i have rather talk first to lord melville and he write to the duchess of kent tell she a bengal cavalry cadetship be at she disposal for the son of colonel harvey there be a very interesting letter from a english officer at adrianople with respect to the state of the russian army it have suffer and suffer most dreadfully i tell aberdeen if i have see the account of the conversation between lord heytesbury and the emperor nichola before i read he proposed letter i should have suggest that much stress should have be lay upon the effect the downfall of turkey would have upon affair in france polignac seem confident he can stand he think he have the chamber the french behave ill in the settlement of the greek business and object altogether to we man prince philip of hesse homburg they equally object to prince frederick of orange and to prince leopold whom russia would have have willingly i wonder aberdeen do not laugh when he be propose they want to settle the thing without a prince i suppose they want a frenchman aberdeen be for settle greece as a power into whose lap the broken part of turkey may fall he give up euboea that be the surrender of euboea be to be propose to the porte with a frontier limit in other respects instead of the protocol of march 22 the turk who have leave the morea have no indemnity the turk who be in the other part of the new greece remain it be altogether a wonderful business these anti-revolutionary state combine to revolutionise a rebellious province of a unoffending ally _ November 11 _ it seem the french do not like the idea of give to the turk the option of a independent state with smaller limit or of a state under suzeraineté with extended limit contrary to the treaty and send at the same time secret instruction to the ambassador to insist upon the _ entire _ independence of the new greek state the french seem likewise to have be offend at the protocol have be settle between russium and we before they be call in to give they opinion no wonder certainly we diplomacy have not succeed we have fail in all we object _ November 13 _ cabinet i be first call upon to say my say upon the general indian question i observe that the present prospective deficiency be one million a year that until we could ascertain whether that deficiency could be diminish or do away with we be really not ourselves prepare to come to a decision upon the future government of indium nor would parliament endure that the china trade should be close upon the country for twenty year more without first inquire whether it be necessary the first question be ` can we make such a reduction of expenditure or effect such a increase in income as to enable the government of indium to go on without any assistance direct or indirect from england ' if it can then we have the china trade in we hand if it can not we have to decide whether the necessary assistance shall be find by means of a continuance of the monopoly or in some other manner i state the increase of two million in six year in the civil charge of bengal that the court have issue the strongest instruction and the local government seem to have a real intention to curtail expenditure that i have do something and should do all i could investigate every item peel suggest a commission i say that have occur to I last year the duke however object to a commission as really supersede the governor - general and be the government another objection certainly be the delay difficulty would be throw in its way and we should at last be oblige to decide without its final report have throw away we time here in wait for it i mention that the character of the local government be ` disrespect and disobedience ' that nothing but a long continuance of strict rule could bring indium into real subjection it be this disobedience which be the chief source of increase expenditure it arise in a great measure from the unequal hand which have be hold over they -- the indulgence of the court of director -- and the great delay in the communication with indium arise out of the system of correspondence i have endeavor to remedy that and hope to get a answer to letter within the year it be now two year and a half i have likewise endeavor to make arrangement for steam communication by the red sea i hope to be able to send a letter to bombay in sixty day the cabinet seem generally to acquiesce in the expediency of only have a committee this year at first they all seem to think the continuance of the government in the company a matter of course i tell they that even with the china trade the government could not now go on without great reduction of expenditure and that i hope the cabinet would not come to a hasty decision upon a question involve so many important political and financial consideration the present system be not one of great expense but it be one involve great delay -- and delay be expense and not only expense but abandonment of authority it be in this point of view that i hope the cabinet would look at the question when it come before they i mean to go quietly to work but i mean if i can to substitute the king 's government for that of the company -lrb- footnote : this be not carry out till 1858 after the great mutiny -rrb- i be sure that in do so i shall confer a great benefit upon indium and effect the measure which be most likely to retain for england the possession of indium we afterwards speak of the batta question i read lord wellesley 's letter and state the opinion of sir j malcolm sir archibald campbell and sir j nicholl i state that it seem the feeling in the army be excite more by the apprehension of further reduction than by the establishment of the half - batta station that if concession be make to the bengal army the other army would be discontented and further demand would be make the duke say as a soldier and have be in indium at the time he must say he think the order of 1828 -lrb- footnote : order issue by lord william bentinck abolish full batta or the larger scale of allowance to the military at station where half-batta only have be recognize before the act of the bengal government allow full batta in consideration of officer provide themselves with quarter -- see thornton 's _ british indium _ pp 221-25 -rrb- a breach of faith -- but these have be issue he think we must stand to they the general opinion be that as nothing could be say or do till the arrival of despatch there could be no necessity for decide i mention my supreme court bill which will be ready immediately i hope to save -- ultimately 60000 pound a year in the supreme court # # 1000 on each judge 9000 1 judge at calcutta 5000 1 judge at m and b 8000 recorder 's court 8000 fee at calcutta 30000 ------ # 60000 ireland be put off till Monday that we may all read the papers we dine with the duke to-morrow the french oppose all the people we name for the greek coronet they have name prince charle of bavarium and the second son of the king of bavarium with a regency till he be of age however this folly they do not press we first name prince philip of hesse homburg whom the french would not hear of then leopold they do not like he prince emilius of hesse darmstadt be think of the french have suggest prince john of saxony second son of the king a fine young man about 28 but unknown he elder brother too may soon succeed to the throne and he have no child otherwise there be no objection to this prince it seem to I they be run after trifle russium adhere to we as to the prince or rather remain neutral thinking i have no doubt that france and england will quarrel about the feather the secret instruction which it be propose to give to the ambassador be now abandon france have object they be to have be order to _ insist _ upon turkey take one of two thing of which she be to have ostensibly the pure option now they be only clearly to intimate they _ wish _ however it seem russium will take a million of ducat less if turkey will make greece independent that

successor to lord william sir j malcolm 's sentiment be know and he nomination would show the feeling of the government here it would be a hint to lord william that we could replace he at once and

there be a good paper of aberdeen 's to sir r gordon in which he consider the turkish empire as fall and we interest as be to raise greece that that state may be the heir of the ottoman power with this view he consider it to be of primary importance that the government of new greece should not be revolutionary and the prince a good one there be another good paper defend england against a accusation of metternich that we should have speak in a firmer tone to russium at a earlier period the king seem much take with these papers and write great encomium upon they by lord stuart 's account it appear probable that villele will come in the government mean to avoid all question upon which it be possible to have a difference of opinion and to bring forward only measure of clear and undeniable utility they think that if they opponent should endeavor to throw out these measure the chamber will support government france coincide with we entirely as to the portuguese question but wish and she be right that question more specific have be put to the emperor pedro the intention seem to be to acknowledge miguel on condition when pedro admit he can do nothing _ December 16 _ read lord ashley 's memorandum on the judicial administration of indium i write a note on return it in which i say he seem to have take great pain to collect the opinion which have be give by different person upon the subject mine have be express by I in a letter to sir j malcolm on August 7 in which i declare my general concurrence in the view entertain by he and intimate by he in he minute give a account of he tour in the southern mahratta country i have add that i be satisfy the more we could avail ourselves of the service of the native in the fiscal and judicial administration the better and that all good government must rest upon the village system i tell sir j malcolm i have come to my office without any preconceived opinion that i have keep out of the way of prejudiced man and have allow opinion to form themselves gradually in my own mind as i acquire more knowledge from pure source i could not if i have write this passage on purpose have have one more suit to my purpose it show ashley i be not _ prejudiced _ that my opinion be form before i read he memorandum and that i have form they by abstain from the course he have pursue -- for he allow all sort of person to come and talk to he and to inoculate he with they notion i afterwards say that he would see by sir thoma munro 's memorandum of December 31 1824 that he think we have succeed better in the judicial than in the fiscal administration of indium and in the criminal better than in the civil branch of the judicial government this i say to show i have read sir t munro 's memorandum which he do not give I credit for have do and that it be not so much to the judicial as to the revenue branch that he should have direct he attention with a view to improvement -- the field be greater i then say i do not doubt that there be capable native to be find but i do doubt that they would be select for that the european servant have disappoint I the native be better than i expect & c & c see the duke suggest to he sir j malcolm 's be make provisional successor to lord w bentinck for the reason i have mention he think well of the suggestion but say we must consider it and mention it in cabinet as lord william be a great card and we must not do anything to offend unnecessarily he and he connection the objection occur to he that have occur to I that sir j malcolm would die if he go to calcutta i hope he would not go there that he would remain in the upper province but i look to the effect of the nomination upon the conduct of people in indium and that of lord william himself more than to he actual succession the duke then say we must look not to indium only but to all asia and ask I if i have read evan 's book i tell he i have that in forty-eight hour after i read it i have send a copy to macdonald and another to malcolm i tell he all the view i have with regard to the navigation of the indus and the opening of a trade with cabul and bokhara he say we mind appear to have be travel the same way we must have good information of what the russian might be do there i remind he i have desire the government a year ago to obtain information as to all the country between the caspian and the indus and i intend now to give a more particular direction he say macdonald should have he eye upon the caspian and information as to those country would be best obtain through native i remind he that that have be the suggestion in my letter of last year the duke 's opinion be that it be a question of _ expense only _ that if the russian get 20000 or 30000 man into cabul we could beat they but that by hang upon we there they could put we to a enormous expense in military preparation and in quell insurrection they could not move in that direction without view hostile to we and by threaten we there they would think to embarrass we in europe i propose that in the event of the russian move in that direction we should permit the government of indium to act as a asiatic power by money at least he allow without further order not to move in advance without instruction but the duke be ready to take up the question here in europe if the russian move towards indium with view of evident hostility he approve of a message go at once with order to macdonald _ December 18 _ chair they will consider favourably mr hasting 's case but she must address she representation to they i tell they of my suggestion of make malcolm provisional successor to lord william and the reason for it they seem to like the idea but the same objection occur to they which have occur to the duke and to I -- that if malcolm go to calcutta he would die i say i do not want he to go i do not look to he go i look to the moral effect of the appointment upon lord william and upon all they servant in indium they want to get some political man of high rank and talent and determine character to go they be heartily sick of lord william whom they want to send i do not know i tell they of my conversation with the duke and go over the same ground they acquiesce in all i say we shall have the mission to scinde and to lahore and the commercial venture up the indus and the instruction to macdonald in short all i want

consideration of the court one jone it seem have write almost all the memorial and be consider a rebel more than a radical we have a little conversation respect the future government of indium i tell they it must be a strong government and i doubt whether in its present form it could secure obedience in indium it require more of appearance they seem to feel that astell acknowledge there be nothing impose in the name of ` the company ' and that the present government be fall into contempt i tell they i be satisfy that the patronage and the appeal should always remain where they be i pay they a high compliment which they justly deserve upon the fairness of they conduct in decide upon the claim of they servant they feel they government be weak in its last year but that the minister could not do otherwise than have a committee _ December 18 _ write a letter to the duke which he may send to the king state the result of my communication to the chair respect mr hasting request information as

the event of leopold 's be make king of greece the chancellor look and think claremont would certainly remain to leopold and if he die or give it up go not to the crown that be not to the king but by specific enactment become a portion of the revenue under the wood and forest of course leopold will give up claremont which be in fact a source of expense the duke say leopold would be at least innocuous and he might be of use the king ask how we could be such fool as to think he would be of any use while the duke be with the king the duke of cumberland be with lady conyngham and tell she amongst other thing that the ` time ' be the duke of wellington 's paper the ` morning journal ' be _ he _ paper and use the expression he put into the king 's mouth aberdeen say leopold be quite

before the two judge the change of circumstance since the institution of the supreme court and the present reason for make they jurisdiction without the limit of the presidency the exception and not the rule the judge seem to enter into my view the lord chief baron suggest that there might be a previous enquiry before the country court which might for that purpose be a sort of grand jury -lrb-

majority captain scarlett be a very young captain -- and lord hill feel the thing ask can not be do he be go to see the duke of wellington about it not very long ago the king give away a regiment without ask lord hill -- however that be settle but it be clear that unless lord hill be allow to exercise the fair patronage of he office he will resign _ January 26 _ cabinet it seem the french have accede to the proposal of the pasha of egypt and finding 50000 man would be require to take algier prefer he operating with 40000 of he own he pretend to have make arrangement which will secure a easy conquest and promise to place tunis tripolus and algier under regular government nominally under the sultan whose consent he reckon upon and capable of preserve the relation of peace with other mediterranean power the pasha 's army be command by french officer and the annexation of these state to egypt would be they practical annexation to france when he army be disseminate along the coast

good friend of mine _ January 27 _ cabinet at four there can be no council to-morrow as greville have the gout and buller be in cornwall there be to be a intimation send to the pasha to the effect that we _ disapprove _ of the propose attempt to conquer tripolus tuni and algier france be to be tell the same i wish conditional order to be give to the fleet and that the pasha should be tell order have be give it be doubtful whether french vessel might not convoy the egyptian fleet and transport i think we have better now consider what we should do in that event that we have better not threaten without determine to execute we threat and that we should consider how we should deal with the french ship if we stop the egyptian -- in short not take a first step which might make a second necessary without know in we own mind what that second step should be the duke think the french will back out when they know we _ disapprobation _ and that at any rate the pasha would i rather doubt this of either of they the french say they have a sort of quarrel with tripolus but none with tuni and they enter into a scheme for conquer both as stepping-stone to algier tuni in they hand would be more dangerous than algier hardinge tell I he have have a long conversation with peel the other day on the state of the country he think peel seem to have apprehension and to think that if the king through some intrigue of the brunswicker get rid of the duke thing would go very ill indeed that the authority of the duke alone keep thing quiet england be in a bad state because the country gentleman have ill-paid rent but scotland and ireland do very well and the trade of the country be not depressed cabinet dinner at the chancellor 's the duke of montrose there as it be to have be a dinner for the

further with they i go to the duke and tell he what they say he be as usual sanguine and think it will blow over i tell the duke i think he have better look out for a governor-general for it might be

malcolm and tell he i would defend every word of it elephant and all then we have a good deal of discussion respect the policy to be pursue with regard to cuba against which the mexican be prepare to organise a slave insurrection for which purpose they have send a minister to hayti it seem to be generally believe that canning about the year 1823 issue a sort of prohibition to the mexican and columbian state to attack cuba but no trace can be find in the foreign office of any such prohibition sir r wilson mean to ask a question upon the subject to-morrow he say if you prohibit the mexican and columbian from attack cuba you should prohibit the spaniard from attack they -- which be fair -- in fact the expedition of barrada be undertake before we know anything about it and if we have wish we could not have interfere the question as to what answer should be give to sir r wilson and what policy pursue be defer till to-morrow in the meantime it appear that mr robertson who be at mexico remonstrate strongly with m de bocaregna respect the object of the embassy to haytus and he be tell by aberdeen that he do quite right and that not only ourselves but other state might view with disapprobation a attempt to excite a warfare of a uncivilised character in cuba the french have assemble 35000 man to attack algier they promise not to keep it -lrb- footnote : this promise be repudiate by the government of July -rrb- they intimate they intention of assist mehemet alus with a fleet but in the meantime they be satisfy at constantinople that mehemet alus will not move aberdeen tell laval that we have inform the pasha of egypt that we should view with disapprobation he attack upon tuni and tripolus without the consent of the sultan laval beg this might be repeat to he three time much conversation as to the state of the house of common the tory be most radical sir r vyvyan tell holme or planta he object be to reduce the government majority as much as possible and to make the government as contemptible as possible sir e knatchbull lead about twenty-three i think the probability be that unless we make some coalition with the whig we shall go to the ground between the two party -lrb- footnote : this eventually occur on the civil list question after the accession of william iv -rrb- both unite against we upon some point -lrb- upon my letter to sir j malcolm as likely as any other -rrb- i take home sir george murray he express he surprise the duke should cling to the hope of reclaim the ultra-tory whom he would not get and who be not worth have i confess i think he carry it on too long although i be not surprise he should have wish it at first prince leopold have give no reply to aberdeen 's letter or to the offer of the ambassador lord holland give notice to-morrow of a motion about greece and lord melbourne move for some papers respect portugal lord melville give notice for I of the committee on east indian affair and i be not to go down till Tuesday that we may have out the letter to malcolm and other indian matter all at once _ February 8 _ write a memorandum for peel and banke to this effect : ` that i have neither copy nor recollection of the letter but that i have no doubt the letter publish as mine be substantially correct it be a confidential exposition of the motive which induce I to recommend two judge to the king -lrb- footnote : it be suggest that with these colleague sir j grant would be like a wild elephant between two tame one allude to the method of tame capture elephant in indium -rrb- it be never intend to be publish nor do i expect it would be the expression therefore be unadvised but the sentiment be and be mine deliberately form upon full consideration of the official document before I cabinet it appear on look into papers of 1825 and 1826 that so far from we have prohibit mexico and columbium from make any attack upon cuba we uniformly abstain from do anything of the kind the american declare they could not see with indifference any state other than spain in possession of cuba and further they disposition to interpose they power should war be conduct in cuba in a _ devastate _ manner and with a view to the excitement of a servile war we offer to guarantee cuba to spain in 1823 if she would negotiate with the colony with a view to they recognition subsequently we be willing to enter into a tripartite guarantee of cuba to spain with the united state and france the united state seem not unwilling but france hold back peel be to say there be no record of any prohibition but that the united state declare so and it be possible mr canning may have intimate a similar disposition on we part this be to keep open to we the faculty of interfere if we please the duke think my letter do not signify one pin the simile of the elephant evidently mean no more than that a indiscreet judge be place between two discreet one the duke tell I he have offer a lordship of the treasury to ashley who have decline it he then tell he to make himself master of the batta question ashley say he have not see the papers he say let he see the papers i tell he i have send they the moment i get they to he and he have desire I to send they to the cabinet room which i do when they be take from the cabinet room they go to the indium board and ashley might have see they i have never keep any papers from he we then talk about the speech to be make in move the committee the duke seem incline to have little say peel seem disposed to say little but he know little i think they be wrong i be sure it be necessary to correct the erroneous notion which have be propagate with respect to the trade they will otherwise acquire so great a head it will be impossible to beat they back however this we be to talk over with peel tomorrow general king who vote against the address on Thursday be turn out by the king himself the duke have only mention the fact i dare say the king may be alarm by the spirit show by the house of common the suicide of on account of he wife 's seduction by the duke of cumberland will drive the duke of cumberland out of the field _ February 9 _ call on the duke he advise a very narrow statement in move for the committee i rather doubt he judgment upon this point i fear the opinion of the country will become settle and that when the strength of we case be bring forward it will be find unequal to the drive back of the stream however i make a speech as he desire lord lansdowne say a few word lord durham then question I as to the authenticity of my letter to sir j malcolm i acknowledge it be substantially correct and declare i could not have entertain any other sentiment without a dereliction of duty he express disapprobation consider the letter as evince a determination to control the independence of judge the duke reply -- then lord melville -- then lord holland -- i last i declare that as my father 's son i be the last man capable of harbour a think against the independence of judge but i would resist they usurpation more especially when they usurp power withhold from they by parliament as dangerous to the peace of indium and to the stability of the british power i say indium could not bear the collision of the supreme court and the local government if we do not support the government we should lose indium i be determine to maintain the integrity the dignity the authority and the unapproachable power of the local government and especially to support a man who at that distance from england act in the faithful discharge of he public duty incur the highest responsibility and the greatest personal risk in defense of what he consider essential to the stability of the british power in indium i believe i do well they all tell I i should hear no more of it _ February 10 _ see banke he say the house of common be loose indeed but he think minister will have a majority on the east retford business the worst of it be that those who ought to be the friend of government will not stay out a debate last night peel and goulburn be leave with a decide minority but the house be count out saw hardinge he seem to think there be no great danger and he think the house be in so loose a state that the accession of a individual or two would not draw other that brougham may be quiet and that the other do not much signify in the meantime abercromby have be make chief baron of scotland another whig go a very valuable intimation to those who remain lord lansdowne bring in zachary macaulay son of the old saint -lrb- footnote : the late lord macaulay he be erroneously describe by he father 's christian name -rrb- they say a very clever man indeed at least as a writer hardinge tell I the duke tell mr arbuthnot i speak very well last night at dinner the chancellor and sir george murray congratulate I on what have take place after the cabinet dinner much talk and nothing settle the motion of sir j graham will i think be amend -- and easily there be a disposition very properly not to give portuguese papers as to the lord holland 's motion on Friday no decision be come to give the duke the petition of the bengal half-caste mr jenkin who be for many year resident at nagpore call upon I and offer himself as successor to sir j malcolm he say the chair be dispose to he if the government have no objection i say i be aware of the service he have render but that there be many distinguished servant of the company and likewise person of ability who have not be in indium whose several qualification must be consider it be further a point upon which i must of course communicate with the duke of wellington the man be a person of dry cold manner not prepossessing i be dispose to think mr chaplin the best indian for the situation _ February 11 _ i think polignac 's ministry must fall and really as regard himself i can not feel regret as he be the greatest liar that have exercise diplomatist function for a long time i have think better of he if they expedition ever sail for algier they will find what it cost to send a expedition over sea i think however they will succeed and if they do they will keep algier sir r gordon entertain a very different opinion from that express by aberdeen as to the future fate of the ottoman empire he think the event of the late war prove little and that the sultan have learn a lesson which will induce he to treat he raya better -- that the war once over all man will return to they duty however he give no good reason for he opinion he state very fairly the difficulty of he own position he say he have hitherto believe it be the intention of he government to support turkey he have therefore have influence because where he have advise concession the turk have understand we mean it should not be hurtful to they -- but now how can he advise the turk to yield to what be ask when he know the government think that the more be take from turkey the more be save from russium sir r gordon say he colleague be by no means of opinion that the ottoman empire be fall and that france allow they officer to go in number to serve with the turkish troops receive a letter from sir j macdonald in which he tell I the turkish asiatic province be fall away from the sultan he enclose a letter from a mr sterling give a very interesting account of he journey by mesh and near balkh to cabul he take a new road to the north of the paropamisan ridge in cabul he experience no difficulty _ February 12 _ house lord holland 's motion of a resolution that the house would not be satisfy with any plan for the pacification and settlement of greece which do not secure to that state the means of independence by sea and land and leave the greek free to have they own constitution he information be most inaccurate yet on this he found he distrust of the government notwithstanding this distrust he be neither with they nor against they nor do he wish to turn they out he make a indifferent speech aberdeen a fair one ill deliver the duke speak admirably the brain be beat out of the motion no division goderich and clanricarde and melbourne speak lord melbourne poorly on the east retford -lrb- footnote : it will be remember that this question have lead to the resignation of huskinsson and he friend -rrb- question last night we have a majority of twenty-seven in a house of 226 member -- the high tory vote with government banke have now the offer of a lordship of the admiralty till croker can be get rid of but he will not go castlereagh will have the treasury lordship -- that be 600 # a year more for have be careless _ February 13 _ after see the chair speak to the duke about the bombay succession he ask what i mean to do with elphinstone i consider he have leave indium altogether the duke think he must return -- that he would go to bombay again with the expectation of afterwards go to madras i think the duke have a idea of make he governor-general i mention mr chaplin the duke mention mr jenkin of whom he think highly he have do well at nagpore and he have have some correspondence with he when in indium which give he a good opinion of he the duke speak of mr russell but think he have be mix up with the hyderabad transaction i then mention clare the duke think he better than any of the other mention that it be a great thing to have a man of rank he must be well support he have not a very strong mind however on the whole he seem better than the other and i be to propose he i be very glad to have clare i have a great respect and regard for he -- but i have a little hesitation as to he fitness he will however be a most zealous and honorable servant of the public and he good manners will keep people in good humor and in order leopold have send in he answer i have not see it yet he accept on condition the debate last night in the common be consider very favourable dawson 's amendment be adopt -- and planta and holme say the temper of the country gentleman be much improve they be quite in spirit again a hint of peel 's but a hint that the government do not fear a appeal to the country seem to have have a good effect _ February 14 _ cabinet on Thursday peel in open the compensation bill will detail the various legal reform he be dispose to diminish gradually the number of crime for which the punishment of death be award the duke seem reluctant and so do other however the chancellor do not object my father consider that where a man could not protect he own property the law ought to protect it for he by higher penalty however now it seem a man must protect he own property and punishment be to be proportion more to the extent of the moral offence than to the necessity for prevent crime then we consider leopold 's answer the man accept provide -- 1 there be a guarantee of the new state 2 that the frontier be slightly altered 3 that the three power protect the present insurgent in samo and candium 4 that a loan of 1500000 # be guarantee 5 that he may have troops furnish to he 6 he stipulate that the greek should have the power of decline he _ le soussigné _ as they prince a guarantee there will probably be and therefore the alteration of boundary which leopold know could not be listen to be in fact unnecessary each power separately and individually may use its good office with the porte for the protection of the greek in samo and candium and indeed under the agreement as to a amnesty each would be bind to do so but no triple agreement will be enter into the object be to get out of the treaty of July 6 aberdeen seem disposed to allow 1000 man of each of the three power to go to greece this would continue the triple action and as these troops would go not against any external enemy but against greek the measure would be somewhat in contradiction to the declaration the other night that the greek and they prince might make what government they please after some conversation it seem the general opinion that it would be better to pay the cost of the troops than to have we own there and in fact the same money would enable greece to have twice the number of german or swiss that she could have of british this i thought but i suggest that greece could not want a large sum down a sum might be require for outfit but then a annual sum peel propose the whole loan guarantee should be 700000 # of which 100000 # to be pay down as outfit and then 100000 # a year for six year at 5 per cent the three power guarantee each a third part of the interest it be better to guarantee the loan then to pay money down the loan they say can be make at three aberdeen say the greek give a most flourishing exposé of they future finances and he think they will become a rich state and the power be expose to no danger of be call upon for the payment of the interest i think he begin to love he greek progeny the duke only desire we would get out of the treaty i suggest the inexpediency of we join in the guarantee a guarantee give no right of intervention we should not otherwise possess and it oblige we to interfere when we might not desire to do so however i fear there will be a guarantee _ February 16 _ cabinet there seem to be little doubt that the emperor pedro mean to direct a expedition from rio against portugal terceira be the point of _ rassemblement _ this be a practical answer to the question recently put by we conjointly with france and austrium as to the intention of the emperor and therefore we be at liberty to act as if a specific answer have be receive it seem austrium will be very unwilling to recognize don miguel france not the object of recognize he be to prevent a revolutionary war in portugal and the entrance of spanish troops into portugal to oppose it whenever miguel be recognize i think lord rosslyn will be make master - general of the ordnance lord beresford go to portugal as minister and then the privy seal will be disposable i dare say the duke out of good nature will offer it to lord westmoreland aberdeen read the remonstrance he propose send to spain against the propose expedition to mexico leopold meet the plenipotentiary and aberdeen think he would have accede but he evidently require the sanction of another person the french ambassador use very strong language tell he he court would be very much hurt indeed at find he make these difficulty after all that have pass & c peel tell I he be dispose to grant the motion for any correspondence between the board of control or any member of it & c with a direct negative to move the previous question be a admission of some error i be tell he the circumstance when it be necessary to attend to aberdeen 's business i must tell he to-morrow _ February 17 _ at the cabinet dinner at lord melville 's talk to peel and give he a copy of the report of the privy council and of my letter to sir j grant he be dispose to take a high tone and think man will follow he better when he do than when he temporise i be sure they will he say he would reduce everything so low as not to be beat upon establishment if he be beat upon unimportant question he do not care and will not go out they will not get a majority for stop supplies and if they can agree upon motion he be prepare to play the game of '83 -lrb- footnote : allude to pitt 's course at the beginning of he first ministry he retain office a whole session in spite of the motion carry against he and in the general election of 1784 obtain a overwhelming majority -rrb- with they i be sure he be right _ February 18 _ house first a question from lord holland whether the order to the admiral respect greek slave & c would after the settlement of greece apply to candiot greek then lord melbourne 's motion for portuguese papers he do not speak well -- but very bitterly goderich speak pathetically against the terceira affair -- lord wharncliffe well with we -- lansdowne wide and loose -- the duke very excellent -- aberdeen worse than usual and very imprudent abuse miguel and make awkward admission it be quite establish that canning have nothing to say to the portuguese constitution and i think we shall hear no more of terceira fifty-two to twenty-one -- no proxy _ February 19 _ cabinet leopold 's answer he want troops and money after long talk it be resolve the french troops might stay a year till he could raise other and money should be give _ February 20 1830 _ in ride with lord rosslyn have a long conversation with he upon indian matter he have just be read the despatch from lord stuart and lord heytesbury upon these subject i tell he i have anticipate all lord h suggest and have do i really think all that could be do i be to send he the secret letter he think as i do that aberdeen be in a great hurry to get rid of the greek question and disposed to incur future embarrassment to avoid present inconvenience lord rosslyn do not much like the division of last night but i believe it be a good one _ February 21 _ this morning look through the finance account of the three year end 1819 and the three end 1828 with a view to compare the state of the country with what it be before peel 's bill the increase consumption be astonishing the increase of british tonnage and in the number of seaman since 1819 be equal to the whole tonnage and to all the seaman in the foreign trade with great britain although that be increase nearly in the same proportion with we own the increase consumption of tea and coffee be 50 per cent the number of pound in 1819 be about 30000000 of pound and now 45000000 pound the import of foreign raw produce be much increase -- of that produce which compete with the land produce of england hardinge call he think the government quite safe now indeed he never have much apprehension he regret sir jame graham 's divergence from the road which lead to office he think he come up to london intend well but that he think under present circumstance he could be a more considerable man out of office than he would be in a subordinate situation the duke of northumberland say the salary of the lord-lieutenant may well be reduce to 20000 # a year _ February 24 _ lord rosslyn who call upon I at the office think i may go a little too far in my direction with regard to russian spy that be in a public despatch i have direct that if it appear danger be likely to arise from they return to europe or from they passage into any asiatic country they person should be place under restraint and in all case they papers and letter get possession of he suggest that this might be mention in a private letter or leave to the discretion of the local government we have a long conversation on lord stanhope 's motion for to-morrow when whig and tory be to combine to beat we the division last night in the house of common on lord j russell 's motion for give two member to manchester birmingham and leed be not satisfactory there be 140 for it and only 188 against it the tory stay away _ February 25 _ house at 4 and until 2 lord stanhope 's motion for a committee of the whole house on the internal state of the country he make a weak speech because to get vote he abstain from state the cause of distress which in he opinion be currency or any remedy goderich and lansdowne make good speech rosebery not a bad one though as usual pompous all suggest some remedy -- all for reduce taxation but against a committee of the house lord radnor make a good vulgar speech king speak better than usual he propose but afterwards withdraw a amendment for a committee upstairs the duke who alone speak on we side do not speak well and some of he statement be hazardous lord darnley and bute declare there be no distress near they we divide well there be but fifteen present for lord stanhope 's motion and ten proxy _ February 26 _ chair at 11 go over with they the letter on batta lord wharncliffe intend on Tuesday to propose examine the chairman of the east indian company _ February 27 _ write a note to loch to tell he of lord wharncliffe 's intention he do not like the idea at all and wish to see I before the committee sit i have name Monday at eleven i tell he my feeling be against he be examine as i think it unfair besides he be not the best witness i tell lord wharncliffe he should examine lord amherst at the cabinet room i attempt to read the papers respect irish education my opinion be that it would be better to let the matter rest for the present the agitation of it may revive animosity and if any good be attainable it may be attain at a more favourable period than the present i rather doubt whether it might not be yet more safely leave to the people themselves as education in england and in scotland _ march 1 _ cabinet we be to have talk about irish education but more important matter intervene there be a motion on Friday of mr davenport 's for a committee on the internal state of the country peel think there will be a union of party in favor of it he feel it must be oppose some of the friend of government have say they must vote for it he propose that goulburn should to-morrow give notice of he intention of explain he view as to taxation on Monday week peel think that he can procure a adjournment of the debate till after goulburn 's exposé goulburn suggest take off the whole of the beer tax and remit the hop duty for this year as well as remodel it he likewise propose lower the duty on east and west indium sugar the former from 37_s _ to 25_s _ and the latter from 27_s _ to 20_s _ as the revenue be decrease these reduction can not be take from it there must be a commutation this he propose to be a modify property tax to apply to land property all fix property and the fund as well as all office but not to the profit of trade _ march 2 _ there seem to have be some incivility last night on the part of sir charle burrell and sir e knatchbull against I with reference to my opposition to the duke of richmond 's motion on the wool question last year _ march 3 _ peel 's meet banke graham and ashley it be after talk agree that the papers ask should be refuse unless in the course of the debate it should appear that the grant of grant 's petition and the report of the privy council would improve the division i expect a regular attack upon myself from all quarter i would give a year of the house of lord to be there to throw grape-shot amongst the small lawyer cabinet room read despatch relate to the expedition to algier which be certainly go cabinet dinner at peel 's the affair of the vacate office become serious for it seem certain that it be necessary to take the declaration again upon any new patent and the board of admiralty should have take the declaration as well as castlereagh -- the board of control as well as I the chancellor continue to have no objection to reduce the salary of the supreme court judge _ march 5 _ chair at 11 i get rid of they as soon as i could as i wish to go to the committee loch show I a letter from lord william bentinck by which it appear that the officer of the cawnpore division of the army wish to have a general meeting for the election of delegate to england sir j whittingham forward they request to lord combermere highly disapprove of it lord combermere direct the adjutant-general to write a letter coincide with sir j whittingham 's opinion and add that he would be the advocate of the army both in indium and in england lord william -lrb- bentinck -rrb- be go up the country with the _ government _ and wish to take lord dalhousie with he he expect very uncivil treatment and say the discontent be deep-seated the same account be receive from other quarter the debate be adjourn last night r grant make a speech in a moderate tone but disingenuous lord ashley speak good stuff apparently but henry say he could not hear he lord graham be unembarrassed and do well but the ` time ' hardly give he ten word i send a note to peel to-day observe upon the disingenuousness of grant 's speech he tell I he have be read the papers and see it be no question of judicial independence but of judicial aggression and he think the tone of the governor who be in the right much better than that of the judge who be in the wrong so i hope he will make a good speech _ march 6 _ read letter from sir j macdonald they come by constantinople the only news they contain be that the russian certainly have the intention of conquer khiva and bokhara this come from chasane murza i tell the duke who seem disposed to make it a european question i show the duke a most atrocious libel on royalty which have be publish in the ` calcutta gazette ' if the king see it he would recall lord william by the sign manual a letter must be write immediately in the press it be in such a state that we government can not stand if it be permit to go on uncontrolled i ask the duke as to taxation he say he think it could be do without income tax to lay on income tax would be to weaken ourselves in the opinion of all foreign power besides it would prevent we reduce the four per cent he calculate the loss of the beer duty at 3500000 # and marine insurance cider remission of hop duty & c would make the loss 4500000 # to meet this he expect # surplus of last year 1700000 additional from general improvement 400000 additional malt by reduce beer duty 500000 increase duty on spirit 500000 reduce four per cent 750000 savings 1400000 ireland soap & c 450000 stamp 200000 --------- 5900000 4500000 --------- 1400000 there may have be more but he speak and i write from memory i tell he i think that with a diminish duty on beer and a increase duty on spirit he could not expect a increase of 500000 # on spirit he admit that be the weak point he say he be sure we could not carry a income tax while we have a million surplus if we have a good harvest i have no doubt the increase on malt will be great but i apprehend there must be a repayment of beer duty and if there should be the loss will be enormous _ march 8 _ send mr elphinstone a letter give a account of the travels to the north of the paropamisan range into cabul the duke say we really must look out for a new governor-general i suggest hardinge he say hardinge have not as yet station enough in the opinion of the public in the army or in parliament he wish he to be secretary in ireland it would have be much better if he have go there instead of lord f gower and lord p to the war office to be sure then we should not have have the reduction hardinge have effect he have as i know always wish hardinge to go to ireland i observe that hardinge be rise every day in public estimation which the duke acknowledge and i add that i be sure none would do the duty better for he have firmness and habit of business the duke seem to think of elphinstone he say he be a very clever man i tell he i have be a hour and a half with elphinstone last night i tell the duke all my notion respect individual responsibility member of council & c and that i have beg elphinstone to think of they the duke seem generally to approve of they it seem lord wellesley never would go to council i do not wonder at it but the duke use to tell he he be governor-general _ in council _ -- that he ought always to go there _ march 10 _ dine with the duke cabinet dinner only the peer there the other detain by lord palmerston 's motion on portugal on which there be a majority of two to one 150 odd to 70 something huskisson make a very bad dull speech we talk about a successor to the speaker they seem to think he will not resign now as he would not get a good pension in the present temper of the house the candidate be sir j beckett littleton g banke wynn of course i mention frankland lewi as a good man which he would be i dare say the chair will think he should be elect unanimously it seem there must be a bill of indemnity for not take the declaration two bishop chester and oxford not have take it the duke find he have at dover as lord warden we have some little conversation about the income tax which the duke be very hostile to and i be glad we shall not have it _ march 11 _ the russian have at last send they reply to we expostulatory note i have not have time to read it lord heytesbury calculate that the last war cost they 12000000 # but they endeavor to conceal the amount peel tell I the house be quite excite against the bombay judge and that the division fairly represent its real opinion _ march 12 _ there be but one black ball in the election of lord clare and the chair think that be put in by mistake no one object _ march 13 _ read sir h parnell 's pamphlet on taxation cabinet room at two i have only get half through the russian answer when the cabinet meet for the subject of taxation i rather expect to find that the duke have have communication with goulburn and that the idea of a property tax be give up however that seem not to be the case it be determine the whole beer duty should be give up in any case # the expect revenue be 50250000 the expect expenditure 47930000 ---------- surplus 2320000 add by reduction of four per cent 777000 by 1_s _ 6_d _ on british and 2_d _ on irish and scotch spirit 400000 by stamp in ireland 220000 3717000 deduct beer tax # 3200000 but the loss to the revenue from the probable increase of malt calculate at 2500000 ---------- 1217000 probable increase of revenue 450000 ---------- sink fund 1667000 the conversion of stock into annuity be proceed at the rate of 1000000 pound a month and the increase annual charge already be 250000 pound certainly to this extent the estimate three million of surplus might be fairly reduce but to reduce the surplus to 1200000 pound or 1600000 pound would be a entire abandonment of the system adopt by the finance committee and the government it seem to I that the member of the house of common be all in favor of the income tax all the peer against it the duke be strongly against it he apprehend the reduction of establishment and particularly the pressure of the tax on man of 1200 pound a year and under if i impose the income tax i would make it the means of a thorough reconciliation between the higher and lower class in this manner only would it be effectual and make a strong government i object greatly to goulburn 's deduction from the old income tax he except _ occupier _ that be as regard land occupier quite right but he except manufacture capital and capital engage in commerce now why should the man who have 100000 pound in a manufactory and make 10 per cent on that sum pay nothing while the man who invest he 100000 pound in the fund get only 3 1\/2 per cent and pay 5 per cent out of that reduce profit the man who have a manufacturing or _ commercial capital _ be a _ save man _ he can afford to pay something to the state and why should he not so the lawyer who may be make 10000 pound a year be to pay nothing if he take 5500 # a year and become a judge he pay 137 pound 10 shilling yet he interest be still for life in all this there seem to I unfairness if the tax be impose as it be propose it will be very difficult to include afterwards the class now exempt it will be impossible to take off the tax and whenever a tax be unpopular those upon whom it press will say ` take it off it be only add 1\/4 or 1\/2 per cent to the income tax ' a real property tax be the fairest of all tax -- but a income tax be the most unfair even when it affect all income but when it affect the income of some who have a life interest and not the income of other in the same situation it be most unfair indeed it be quite erroneous to suppose that those who pay a income tax be the only person who suffer from it the reduction of establishment the diminish consumption the increase economy in every article of expenditure on the part of those affect by it have necessarily the effect of reduce the wages of labor the labourer may buy some thing cheaper but he have less wherewith to buy _ Sunday march 14 _ see hardinge at two tell he how we stand as to the question of taxation he say he think the income tax would be popular but agree with I in think it should be establish on strictly just principle cabinet at three goulburn read a new statement show the surplus this year if we reduce beer and leather and next year too the surplus this year be about 2 million next year about 1500000 # the income tax reach the fund and the irish and the parsimonious and the rich -- so far it be good but it likewise reach the man of 100 # a year it tend to diminution of establishment to diminish demand for labor to create a alteration in demand generally it be propose to exempt profession and trade this be unjust and it would have lead to a entire separation and hostility between the land proprietor and the unite body of labourer and manufacturer these last would have join on all occasion in urge a further and still a further increase of income tax and would never have consent to a tax on consumption the income tax would finally absorb all other tax another great objection to the income tax now be that it would have the effect of perill the reduction of the 3 per cent the duke rosslyn and i be decidedly against income tax lord bathurst and lord melville as well as the chancellor less decidedly so but still in favor of abide by the reduction of the beer and leather tax aberdeen say nothing neither do sir g murray so they be understand to go with the majority goulburn acknowledge the discussion have to a great extent change he opinion and that he be not then prepare to propose the tax herry seem much in its favor but more as it seem to I because he wish to maintain a large surplus accord to the decision of the finance committee than for any good reason peel be decidedly for a property tax he wish to reach such man as bare he father rothschild and other as well as absentee and ireland he think too it be expedient to reconcile the lower with the higher class and to diminish the burthen of taxation on the poor man i accede to the principle but i doubt whether tax on consumption do really press more heavily on the poor man than a income tax what he have to look to be not the actual price of the article he want but the proportion which he wages bear to that price it matter little to he what the price of candle may be if he have not money wherewith to purchase they that system of taxation be best for the poor man which most tend to increase the fund for the employment of labor and every disturbance in the system every alteration of demand do intrinsic mischief after this matter be decide peel behave most fairly and declare he would support the decision of the cabinet whatever it might be and that in this case the decision of the treasury be to be principally look to we talk of queen donna marium in whose name don pedro have establish a regency in terceira i read leopold 's letter to lord aberdeen in which he refer to he letter of February 11 for the statement of he view in take the greek coronet say that he only accede from courtesy and as a matter of form to the protocol and further urge some alteration in the frontier he have make a application for a joint guarantee by the three power of a loan of 60000000 paras or 2400000 # now we only agree to guarantee 50000 # a year and that for troops nothing will be say upon this point till he have withdraw he letter he seem to be aberdeen 's pet i do not think have the greek search europe they could have find a man whose character be more congenial to they own _ march 17 _ leopold have withdraw he obnoxious letter _ march 18 _ house at five debate on the duke of richmond 's motion for a select committee on the state of the labor class and the effect of taxation upon the productive power of industry a most dull debate till lord holland speak i answer he lord lansdowne next then the duke i speak show the impracticability of the committee i however show up committee rather too much this lord lansdowne take hold of not very fairly but he do it well we have in the house 69 they 39 with proxy we have 140 to 61 my uncle vote in the minority and so do coplestone dudley lord malmesbury lord gower vote with we the whig brunswicker and canningite be in the minority the duke of cumberland be there i find we have some recruit -- in proxy lord lauderdale duke of bedford downshire lord wilton and lord jersey sit behind we he have now lord lauderdale 's proxy all this be consequent upon lord rosslyn 's accession lord gray have now no one leave no one express a wish to turn out the minister _ march 19 _ it seem that in the house of common huskisson make a friendly speech finding he can do no harm and lord althorp a very friendly one in short everybody seem to be of opinion that the worst thing that could be do would be to turn out the government peel say and so do herry that the house be in favor of a income tax that what we have determine upon be the best for this year but that next year there must be a income tax cabinet leopold want more money it be agree he should have 70000 pound a year loan guarantee to he for seven year instead of 50000 pound the holder of 4 per cent be to have the option of 100 pound stock 3 1\/2 or 70 pound stock 5 per cent trustee may only convert into the 3 1\/2 per cent _ march 20 _ chair at 11 they have make some alteration in the letter to the indian government respect they conduct and have praise lord william for he _ perseverance _ & c this be contrary to the duke 's view

murray 's consider what course should be adopt upon p thompson 's motion for a committee to revise taxation peel still hanker after the property tax and rather unwillingly oppose this motion however it will be do on the ground that the remission of such a question to a committee would derange by exist apprehension and hope the whole industry of the country in fact it would likewise vest the government in the committee peel planta and holme all think the division will be close i do not apprehend that if the debate be well conduct have a long conversation with the duke upon indian matter the recollection of he youth be strong upon he and he still cling to the old form _ march 25 _ read some evidence before the common on the china trade committee examine mr elphinstone he give very good evidence house a flat discussion on the kentish petition _ march 26 _ we have two to one last night the house not very full it seem by no mean the wish of the house to have a property tax quite

insist and the man will be hang the lord lieutenant have take upon himself to give a reprieve only and not to promulgate the pardon the duke describe the king as a bold man afraid of nothing if he minister would stand by he and certainly neither afraid of pain or of death i do not think this of the king in general he have be suppose to be a coward in cabinet it be decide to authorise and advise the lord lieutenant to put into execution the law for suppress the association against that which o'connell be now endeavor to organise and at the same time to give silk gown to shiel and two or three other roman catholic barrister omit o'connell however this last measure will be mention to the king although a king 's letter be not require we have afterwards a talk and a long one about algier

copy we want a write declaration of they view none other be official they be afraid of they chamber and of give a pledge to england different from that which they have give to other power and with which other power have be satisfied peel think they will promise to abstain from permanent occupation and exact a amount of indemnity so large with occupation as a security as to make that occupation permanent if they get possession of algier i do not believe they will ever give it up -- say what they may peel object to I say what declaration would satisfy we as in the event of they deceive we or

alleviate however the bulletin so little correspond with he real state that they think he see it it seem to be now more a affair of day than of week it may happen at any moment peel suggest the possible case of both king die before a act appoint a regent and we may be call upon to provide for it the duchess of clarence would be queen regent we talk about a bill for enable the king to give authority for the affix of the sign manual to avoid delay and the examination of physician rosslyn propose that if the king would sign it there should be a message it will be arrange that there shall be two minister present-one to countersign the other to affix the stamp the attorney - and solicitor-general be call in they evidently think the king 's mind be go as well as he head for they propose

better he drink a great deal and be actually sick thence the indifferent night of Friday on Saturday he be better again and when the duke see he seemingly very well quite alive -- in very good humor with everybody and quite without nervousness however he pass a bad night as the bulletin say probably in consequence of have drunk again sir h halford be quite in tear on Saturday not more on account of the king 's state than on account of he own professional disappointment he have think on the Friday that he have accomplish a miracle they have treat the king as if he have be a hospital patient and have _ épuisé would _ the resource of art boldly apply to he case the king do not express the least apprehension to the duke but to the woman he speak of he danger and as if he be a die man the duke think he do this to try and vex lady conyngham the thing most surprising to I be the duke 's opinion of the king 's firm courage he say he have see he not only now but before when he be consider not to have twenty-four hour of life in he yet he know he situation be perfectly firm before the duke come i have some talk with holme whom i meet with drummond holme say they could finish the session

emergency then the government be not to move from calcutta and he endeavor in he minute and the other in theirs to make a apparent case of emergency that they might move as to the last point there be a anachronism as the order not to leave calcutta _ as a government _ arrive after the minute be record the duke tell lord combermere that all the order for reduction of expenditure have prove inefficacious it be necessary for the government here to take reduction into they hand and it be very natural and obvious to enforce a order twice repeat and already obey at the other presidency when the army assume the tone which appear in the memorial it be impossible for the government to do otherwise than insist upon the enforcement of the order they have expect from he that he whole influence would have be use to strengthen the government and to prevent any ebullition of feeling on the part of the army lord combermere leave the duke very angry if the king have be well he would have join

better the duke see he to day he be look more healthy he have have some refreshing sleep he be more likely to live than to die the only danger be from mortification in consequence of the puncture but he constitution be so good that in all probability he will avoid this danger this wonderful recovery quite change we position in all public business we must now calculate upon he living -- at least till the end of the session lord morpeth be to make a motion for the repeal of the banishment clause in the last libel act to the repeal of that clause which be inoperative against the common libeller we have no objection and the attorney-general be pledge to it but the house of lord would not like and the king would not endure the repeal of that provision without the substitution of some other security that propose by the attorney-general be the require security to the amount of 500l from two surety that the editor shall pay _ fine _ on account of libel this be reasonable and would to some extent prevent the put up as be now do man or woman of straw as editor who have no means of pay fine the other proposal of the attorney - general that the type should be seizable to whomever they may belong be objectionable and would hardly be carry peel be very sorry the question be stir at the present moment the press be generally with we or quiescent and the ` morning journal ' -lrb- footnote : it have be oblige to pay heavy damages for a libel on the duke of wellington -rrb- a paper institute to oppose the government have within these few day be give up altogether from the want of support certainly this be not the moment at which it be desirable to appear to commence a attack upon the press -- and the attorney - general can do nothing that will not be suspect by they the duke have write a memorandum on the hyderabad affair _ may 16 _ read the duke 's memorandum he mistake the law however i can not write note upon he memorandum without the act of parliament the king have a indifferent night but still feel better i only meet lord bathurst who tell I so he have not see the private letter have a long conversation with lady c wood at lord camden 's about the clarence it

this expedition and the annexation of algier to france i do not fear it -- we can if we manage well make it very costly by bring forward the people of tuni and morocco not near the coast but almost from the desert we must take care to secure tunis and then the french will be no gainer by they move lord londonderry make a very foolish speech about foreign policy in put off he motion which stand for the 25th aberdeen promise the greek papers on _ Monday next _ _ may 19 _ the duke see the king to-day and find he look better than he do at the last council the drain from the leg be now very small he be annoy last night by they and send for halford who send off for brodie but there be nothing of importance they can not yet say that he will not ultimately die of this complaint knighton think he will be a invalid all he life tierney say they can not tell for a week whether there be any mischief remain about the chest the duke wish to speak to he about the stamp but he make a excuse about he leg require some dress and the duke see he do not choose to talk about business go away it seem clear that leopold mean to abdicate the attorney-general have make he libel preventive measure a poor weak inoperative thing ridiculous and unconciliate the french chamber be dissolve as a _ coup de théâtre _ on the sailing of the expedition and they be to meet on August 3 by which time they expect to hear of its success a union of party be expect on the greek affair i be not sorry for it the huskissonian and whig be draw nearer together the tory on the other hand be rather approximate to we -- so that by the beginning of next session man will be at last in they right place _ may 21 _ the king have a bad night the private letter give a bad account he have be _ drink again _ very irritable _ intolerably _ so halford say would neither sit in a chair nor lie in a bed & c halford at last hold strong language and i believe tell he he life depend on he obey he physician i be very much disappointed indeed at this i hope he be really get better and would live aberdeen be to allow the instalment of the loan guarantee to leopold to be pay in four instead of eight year if he can keep he to he principality by do so the french be off on the 18th there be a partial change in they ministry _ may 23 _ ride to the cabinet at three from roehampton the bulletin be that the king have have embarrassment in he breathe the duke wait two and a half hour before he see he yesterday the king sign the two message and then say ` the duke have just catch I in time ' and in a instant there be a gurgle in he throat he seize knighton 's arm the duke run for halford go out into the gallery where he do not find he then into another room where he be halford immediately take a bottle from the table and give the king something which seem to relieve he the duke think the king be in pain three or four seconds but it be a minute and a half before he be relieve he then do not speak but make a motion with he hand for the duke to go he have just before be talk of go to ascot and then to aix-la - chapelle the king be perfectly satisfy with the propose arrangement for the stamp he ask the news be tell leopold be behave very ill and agree as to algier he be tell the note of the french minister be unsatisfactory and that it be under consideration whether a note should not be present he think it right the duke 's opinion be that if the king should be seize with one of those attack when no one be with he he would die the opinion of halford and the other be that the disorder be mortal but he may live six week or two month the puncture be heal they be afraid of open they again for fear of mortification and can only proceed by medicine the king 's state seem distressing he can neither remain quiet in he chair or in he bed he be in a state of constant restlessness the duke of cumberland be there to-day but the king have desire he might not see he leopold have decline he send a note to that effect on Friday night at twelve o'clock -- very well write not by himself aberdeen think palmerston write it he take popular ground and can not impose himself upon _ a reluctant people _ the fact be Friday 's bulletin write he letter the duke think he will be show up the papers present to-morrow will be no more than it be before intend to present but aberdeen will announce the _ evasion _ of the sovereign and say that that circumstance will render necessary the production of other papers which will be present as soon as they can be print the whole discussion will turn upon leopold 's conduct aberdeen will be in the position of the manager of a country theater who just as the curtain be about to be draw up be oblige to come forward and announce that the amateur gentleman who have solicit the part of macbeth who have attend all the rehearsal and whose only difficulty which be about money seem to be in a fair way of adjustment have unexpectedly intimate he intention to withdraw in a print address to the gallery forsooth there should have be a appeal to the people of greece on the subject of they government a appeal to the people of newgate on the subject of the new police -lrb- footnote : this sentiment however severe represent the feeling about the greek of many englishman at that time and especially of those who as in the case of naval officer employ in greek water have see much of they during the war they struggle for independence be undoubtedly disgrace not only by cruelty but by a treachery and disregard of faith which though perhaps attributable to past subjection and oppression be peculiarly odious to english observer lord ellenborough adopt this view -rrb- by a letter of c capo d'istrium 's dated 25 m April 6 write immediately after he receipt of one from leopold -lrb- after he acceptance -rrb- it appear that leopold have intimate he intention to change he religion he must have have about forty-eight hour to consider the point lord melville have hear that leopold have consult lord gray and lord lansdowne without acquaint one that he have see the other _ may 24 _ ride to the office at four to receive the manufacturer mr crawford be there finlay be ill i tell they of my plan as to the indus i direct they attention to the point of bring out in evidence the effect the stoppage in china have upon the general trade of the east i again desire they to show if they could why british manufacture do not go to china by the country trade meet aberdeen tell he i think on consideration that a reply to leopold would lead to a answer from he to which the plenipotentiary could not reply without enter into a undignified discussion with palmerston who would be the real controversialist there should be a answer but it should be address to the resident and what could not be address to they might be state in parliament that be all relate to letter conversation & c i dare say leopold will publish to-morrow it be unlucky the french have troops in the morea if they have not i should be dispose to leave the greek to settle they affair as they please give they no money they would soon become reasonable the bulletin have ` the king have a sleepless night ' house at five the message and address the opposition make no objection to the address which be carry _ nemine dissentiente _ lord gray seem to expect a delegation of the royal authority i tell lord holland i think he would be satisfied then aberdeen present the greek papers and have explain they contents state the change of circumstance since Friday night he represent leopold as have make preliminary objection on other point but none on any but money since February 20 when he accept within these few day other grounds have be take and the abdication be on these other grounds there be much movement amongst the opposition aberdeen be accuse of unfairness lord durham open the fire and i prevent aberdeen from answer he the other -- darnley lord londonderry and lord winchelsea all for leopold in short there be a general union of all those who prefer the rise to the setting sun we shall have a personal debate we go into e retford i sit by the chancellor and work the bill for the king 's relief in the house of common little be say upon these point aberdeen do well he can make a bite speech as well as any one and in a quiet way _ may 25 _ the king pass yesterday uncomfortably he be a little relieved by medicine during the night water be form again house the chancellor explain very well the object and detail of the king 's relief -lrb- footnote : relieve he from the necessity of constant signature -rrb- bill the only objection make be to read it to-morrow and it be concede that it should be read on Thursday -- to its duration and it be concede that should last a month lord gray i hear say it be too complicate that it would have be better to appoint a custo regni i hope he will say that on Thursday there be but little hope of the king 's living till the bill be pass _ may 26 _ hardinge whom i meet in the park tell I sir j graham inform he there be to be a opposition _ à l'outrance _ that lord anglesey be to be minister lord gray would serve with he palmerston be to be make a great man of huskisson to have nothing but revenge the duke of richmond be to be have at all event all this be childish house i expect nothing but the chancellor 's bill and go at half-past five expect to find eldon in the midst of he speech but i find lord durham talk about greece and soon engage in the talk myself lord gray be decidedly in opposition i call the attention of the house to this that we conduct be to be judge of by the papers on the table -- the resignation of leopold be not allege to have take place in consequence of any act of the government if noble lord choose to put on one side the conduct of the government and to make this a mere personal question as to the conduct of leopold we be prepare to enter into the discussion in speaking of leopold i say he ` be connect with this country by some of its dearest recollection ' cabinet dinner the king 's digestion be affect now but otherwise he be well he have have many attack of embarrassed breathing but none serious the duke of clarence be in the room with he -lrb- the duke of w be present -rrb- for a quarter of a hour today the king talk of he own danger he say ` god 's will be do i have injure no man ' this he often repeat he say speaking of he own danger to the duke of clarence ` it will all rest on you then ' he be in very good humor very angry however with leopold -- he anger bring on a slight spasm he afterwards talk of go to ascot and tell the duke to manage that he might be able to go to aix-la-chapelle he be much pleased with the conduct of both house about he signature bill after dinner aberdeen read he propose answer to leopold to be address to the resident with a copy of leopold 's letter it be full of admission many of which peel notice aberdeen be go to meet laval about it i object to send a copy of the letter to leopold as that would as much lead to a reply as if they answer he directly this the cabinet seem to feel and if there be a letter to the resident it will be print with the other papers only and not communicate _ may 27 _ privy council at one the archbishop of canterbury order to frame a prayer for the king 's recovery cabinet king 's signature bill amend then aberdeen read a letter from the resident in greece give a account of all that take place from the notification of the protocol to the senate to they adhesion unfortunately this letter be not send to leopold as it ought to have be when he on the 15th send capo d'istrium 's letter to aberdeen and it be think we can not publish it it show that the adhesion be entire no answer to he letter be to be publish we be to wait till we can have a protocol laval would not sign any joint letter to the resident be so near he prefer wait for the order of he court house king 's signature bill pass with some amendment it be to last till the end of the session the king 's command be to be signify by _ word of mouth _ a very inconvenient mode

from pari that he think the french will not retain algier that a energetic demand on we part would have draw from polignac a distinct disavowal of the intention that he do not think the channel -lrb- lord stuart -rrb- a good one i think fitzgerald would not at all dislike be make ambassador at paris it seem there be a very sore feeling indeed excite by de peyronnet 's appointment he think the only safety of the government be in throw themselves upon the ultra-royalist the king be a little better he stomach begin to bear a little light food again _ may 28 _ the account of the king not good cabinet find they talk about scotch borough aberdeen present the papers relative to leopold in the house some conversation as to the correctness in point of form of present they print the rule be to present papers write by the king 's command and to have they print for the immediate use of the house the common pass the king 's signature bill without a word i think it necessary to determine at once who should be the new judge at bombay and upon full consideration think awdry the best man the chancellor have no objection and i immediately write to awdry to tell he i should advise the king to appoint he _ may 29 _ before the cabinet meet hardinge and walk some time up and down down street with he he tell I the duke have propose a exchange between he and lord f leveson hardinge decline

that the property of many will be expose to much danger by the abolition of the punishment of death one ashe who have libel the duke of cumberland or write a threatening letter will be prosecute as if he have do the same thing against any private individual the fee bill will be alter in the committee -lrb- which out of delicacy be indefinitely postpone -rrb- and the commissioner continue by

entirely by aberdeen who really with a bad manner say very good thing at last lord londonderry choose to say the contents have it and do not divide so that the motion be negatived _ nemine contradicente _ most scandalously many go out not vote against the motion after aberdeen have declare it would be injurious to the public service to give the papers the king rather better but weaker _ June 12 _ chair they do not come till half-past 11 i begin to think they have take huff and do not mean to come at all as i have take no notice of astell 's letter however they come they do not much like my nagpore letter which it seem be contrary to the line of policy lay down by the court and approve of by wynne i tell they i take the responsibility upon myself they be ministerial only my opinion be confirm by that of jenkin and of the duke meet at dinner at hardinge 's arbuthnot with whom i have some conversation about the report he be write on the china evidence he be to show it to I the duke see the king who be much better the king say he would defer take the sacrament till he be well but he take it to-morrow as a _ convalescent _ _ June 13 _ cabinet at half-past 3 first consider the line to be adopt on the forgery bill which seem to be to allow it to pass unaltered throw the whole responsibility on the house of common but peel be to see the banker and merchant that he may ascertain what they opinion be now the bill have pass the common abolish the punishment of death for forgery peel 's idea be that no conviction would be obtain i believe the french and the russian be so alarm by the effect produce in france by the continue exhibition of democratic violence in greece and successful rebellion that they would be dispose to enter into we view with respect to the nomination of a prince rather than leave the question open but that they will procrastinate if they find we will unite with they in give money which may keep greece in a state of tranquillity as to capo d'istrium he first wish to prevent the nomination of any prince and to keep the government to himself when he find that would not do he endeavor to frighten leopold into subserviency but if he find he can get money without have a prince he will frighten other prince and remain there himself it be like pay money in consequence of a threatening letter if it be do once there be no stop i say i believe the dissolution of the acarnanian army happen as it might would be better than its maintenance and that the state of anarchy into which it be pretended greece would fall if it have not money would be a better foundation of improvement than the state of military thraldom in which it be now hold peel propose that dawkin should be instruct under circumstance of imminent danger to advance money not exceed 20000 # and this would be the best way of do it the duke have great repugnance to give anything and object to do what might be consider a unconstitutional act he hope aberdeen will be able to persuade the other power to give 30000 # each leave we out of the subscription the thing be leave undetermined i suggest that it be by no means impossible a question might be ask by some ` friend of greece ' whether we intend to give or have give money in consequence of capo d'istria 's representation and then what we have do would come out in fact if the king be well the matter would be bring before parliament he illness create great embarrassment it be doubtful whether the government can command majority on question on which a defeat under ordinary circumstance would lead they to resign but it be know that now they can not resign and can not dissolve and the opposition have no other effect than that of interfere with the conduct of public business a powerful man would place this strongly before the country and bring the house to a sense of its duty the duke show I the letter he have write to lord combermere in reply to he upon my memorandum it be _ excellent _ there be to be a great fight upon sugar charle grant make a proposition and goulburn propose to modify he original proposition by suggest the addition of 6_d _ a gallon to scotch and irish spirit and to rum

radical have bring the house into such a state that no man could do business but themselves he seem not well and thoroughly out of humor we have some discussion about the forgery bill we be to see the governor and deputy-governor of the bank & c the duke be much indispose to acquiesce in the common ' amendment peel think that after the vote of the house of common no verdict will be obtain but may not a contrary vote of the house of lord turn public opinion into its former course i think it may _ June 17 _ in french newspaper a bad report of the french fleet which be very much disperse one

wish to keep durham and radnor in check or answer they have i speak the debate would have last three hour more as it be we get away by nine on the division we have 62 to 47 not brilliant we case be

sign by halford and tierney of the king 's death and halford 's private letter to the duke of wellington the letter state that the king have sleep for about two hour and wake a little before three soon afterwards sir w waller only be in the room he suddenly put he hand to he breast and say ` good god what be the matter this be death ' he then send for halford he and the other come and so soon afterwards as i have say he expire without the least struggle or pain peel summon a cabinet at half-past ten we meet and talk of very little but in what dress we should go to the council which be to be at twelve it be agree we should go in black shoe and stocking but not full dress however after i leave the room the duke arrive and say the king -lrb- footnote : the duke of clarence now become william iv -rrb- intend to appear in uniform so the duke lord bathurst rosslyn and sir j murray who be there put on they uniform the group at the council be most motley lord gray lansdowne spencer tankerville sir j warrender and some other be in black full dress lord camden and some more in uniform which several send for after they arrive as salisbury and hardinge the mass however in plain black some in color the royal duke come in full dress we wait a long time before the council almost two hour a time occupy in audience the duke of cumberland get the king to send for lord eldon who go in for a minute only the duke of cumberland receive he gold stick and seem very active the duke of wellington lord bathurst rosslyn the chancellor and sir r peel go in together and personally acquaint the king with the late king 's death the king say he might not have a opportunity of see that day the rest of he late majesty 's confidential servant but he tell those present that all have he confidence and that they would receive he _ entire cordial and determine support _ he tell the chancellor in a private audience not only the same thing but that if at any time he should hear report of he cease to place confidence in he government they be not to be believe if he have any fault to find he would at once tell they when the duke and the other come out from the king we all go to the ball-room where we begin to sign the proclamation and a few the royal duke and other have sign when we be call to the privy council room where the king soon arrive attend by the household of the late king he take he seat and read he declaration he read it with much feeling and it be well imagine and will have a good effect the lord president entreat it might be print i should have mention that before the king come in the council make the usual order with the addition of a order for deface the late king 's stamp which be accordingly do by the clerk of the council when the declaration have be read the king take the scotch oath in the usual form the lord-president reading it to he and the king hold up he right hand he then say it be a satisfaction to he to find such a privy council and request they all to take the oath this the royal duke do first then the speaker that he might go to the house of common then the archbishop and the chancellor together then the duke with the lord president and privy seal then the marquis then other accord to they rank when all have take the privy councillor 's oath the lord chancellor take he and the clerk of the council be swear by the lord president the king then retire and the council order as usual respect the disposal of the late king 's body after the swearing in we sign the proclamation some remain to alter the liturgy queen adelaide be to be pray for and the rest of the royal family the duke of norfolk be there as earl marshal he observe he be the only person there who be not a privy councillor and express a wish to be one the duke mention it to the king who readily assent he observe there have be no duke of norfolk a member of the privy council since the time of jame ii and that that duke of norfolk be a protestant the duke of norfolk however will consider the oath before he take it he would have take the earl marshal 's oath to-day but it be not there we meet in cabinet at 4 the only innovation i yet hear of be in the dress of regiment the king intend as he tell lord farnborough to live at windsor he intend to have a battalion of the guard at edinburgh and a regiment of the line at windsor i go in by some misdirection the wrong way and find wood and sir ch pole wait for the king wood whom i meet near the horse guard as i be ride down to the cabinet tell I the king have rehearse he declaration to he sir ch pole and lord errol before he go into the privy council there be no grief in the room in which we wait it be like a ordinary _ levée _ the chancellor go down to the house between the cabinet and the council and take the oath the lord steward be send for by peel and only arrive a quarter before four at the house of common lord holland gray and other seem to think the proclamation ought to have be make to-day and i think it might have be just as well the duke of wellington be much cheer by the people the duke be call out of the cabinet to see halford but we have a long conversation as to the course to be pursue with respect to the parliament and especially with respect to the regency question the house must sit next week as the sugar duty expire on Saturday next and goulburn seem disposed to propose a bill for the continuance of the present duty for a time to take money on account for miscellaneous service to throw over the judicial bill and end the session at once the stumble block be the regency question -- whether it should be bring forward now and if bring forward who shall be regent peel seem to think we can hardly avoid bring it on as the session would have last two month in the event of the late king 's living why should it not now when the reason for parliament sit be so much greater and what would be the situation of the country if the king should die leave a minor queen peel suggest appoint the queen regent for a year i say depend upon it when the king once have she as regent he will never consent to change she and if you appoint she for a year you appoint she for the whole time he afterwards suggest she appointment for a year after the king 's death on account of the probability of she pregnancy to this i object the state of distraction in which the country would be place during that year it be impossible consistently with the constitution to have a executive of which the existence shall be dependent on the good pleasure of parliament peel then suggest the give to the king the power of name either the queen the duchess of kent or any member of the royal family the objection to this be that he ought to name one of the two first -- that we get no security against a bad nomination which we ought to do the view we ought to have be these : to give all possible strength to the monarchy this we do not if we permit a frequent change of the executive if we diminish the power of the crown while in the hand of a regency we want to give stability to the government and this can only be give by make the queen regent if we do that we provide as far as human wisdom can for a stable government of seven year we can in no case _ name _ any other person than the queen because she may become pregnant and in that event it would be monstrous to make the duchess of kent regent all we can do then be to give the king the option of choose the queen or the duchess of kent he will name the queen and she will be the best it have be observe that all king of england die either on saturday or sunday _ June 27 _ come up to a cabinet at half-past three we have a great deal of conversation as to the course to be pursue the chancellor say that in the event of a minor succeed to the throne all the minor 's act would be valid and under the responsibility of minister the great seal might be put in the minor 's name by the minor 's sign manual to a act create a regency it be determine to take the opinion of the attorney - and solicitor - general upon this point on the supposition that the law be as the chancellor state we consider what should be do all turn upon we be able to get a temporary act for the sugar duty and if we can not get that we be _ really _ no longer a government it be determine to carry through the beer bill and beer duty bill to throw over stamp in ireland and carry spirit to take a sum of 800000 # on account of miscellaneous estimate and 250000 # on account of the civil list these last point be decide at a cabinet at sir r peel 's which assemble at eleven and sit till near one at which the attorney - and solicitor-general deliver they opinion in conformity with that of the chancellor as to the legal competency of a minor sovereign the attorney-general remind we that if the king die before the new parliament assemble the old parliament would revive peel talk a good deal of the regency he be much in favor of make the queen regent for a year after the king 's death to provide for the possible pregnancy it seem the principle of all regency have be to make the guardian of the person regent it be curious that the case should never have be provide for of a queen be leave pregnant of a heir apparent and that it should never have occur the difficulty would be infinite i consider the death of the king to have be one of the fortunate event which have often save the duke of wellington i really do not know how we could have go on have he live two month the king wish to make lord combermere a privy councillor think all gold stick have be so we find he be misinform and the duke mean to show he the list of gold-stick not privy councillor and at the same time to tell he how lord combermere stand have within these few month be censure by the government the duke will show the king the correspondence which pass lately and leave it to he to decide there would be no objection to make he a privy councillor some month or a year hence brougham make a violent speech against lord conyngham for not be in readiness to swear in the house of common _ June 28 _ go to st jame 's at eleven the household the royal family and the minister only be there the king be dress in plain black he go to a large window look into the courtyard and stand forward there be but few people there at first the horse guard and the herald the king 's band play god save the king and those who be there cheer upon which number of people come round from before the palace and fill the courtyard they then cheer well as the king pass through the line we form for he to go to the window he come up to I and say he must begin by chide I for not come to he yesterday in fact he have forget i be a cabinet minister and he therefore would see I to-day i say ` it be my first and i hope it would be my last fault ' after the proclamation he send for the duke of wellington and when the duke leave he for I he ask about china i tell he how we stand there that there be a interruption which would probably prevent the arrival of any ship this year that order have be give for a double investment next year i say the state of affair generally be by no means satisfactory the king say he be afraid lord w bentinck have not be do well i say i fear he have let down the dignity of he office and have when he first go there run after popularity too much and allow the press to get ahead it would now be very difficult to check it i add that he go to make great reduction and have make some that that have render he unpopular he be honest and well-meaning the king say he should go down to bushey soon and as i be live near he would have I over at eleven o'clock some morning and give I some hour to make he acquaint with the state of indium i tell he of the secret letter to the bengal government about the nagpore treaty and the principle lay down of which he highly approve he then express apprehension of russium i tell he all that have be do upon that subject and of the present to runjeet singh and the navigation of the indus with all which he seem much pleased i say i would send he the secret letter and get together information that would bring the whole state of indium before he as concisely as possible as i be lead to mention sir j macdonald i ask a coat for he and the king grant it think it very proper the duke attend the opening of the king 's will at 12 the late king die as be think of fatness about the heart the dropsy be go cabinet we have none at st jame 's but there be a council the duke of norfolk attend to be swear in as a privy councillor we find on reference to the act of last session that he must have take the oath within three month before he receive any office of trust or profit so on my proposal the petty bag be send for and the chancellor hold a court of chancery in the ball-room where the duke take the oath he be afterwards swear in as be the duke of bedford sir s canning sir j mackintosh lord bexley and two or three other who be not in time yesterday there be a good many order in council but of no moment there be the usual proclamation against vice and immorality the king do very well he be very gracious to all who approach he and have something to say to every one he take little notice of sir j mackintosh lord bathurst have to change a sheriff the king when he hear the name of the new one -lrb- sheriff of suffolk i think -rrb- say _ ` he be a whig ' _ lord bathurst say ` he be a very good man i believe sir and be recommend by the duke of grafton ' ` oh ' say the king ' i do not mean to say it be wrong only remember _ he be a whig _ ' after the council we go to peel 's but we remain but a short time the duke go to the house and peel too before 4 in we house not a word be say in the common brougham who seem as frankland lewi tell I half frantic make rather a apologetic speech for he attack upon the lord steward but again hint at intentional disrespect towards the house of common not on the part of minister in that house but of person elsewhere he remind peel that whatever accession of strength minister might have recently obtain they could not carry on the government without the confidence of the house of common he speech be very mysterious and hardly any one understand it some think he allude to the accession of lord gray to the government that must have rest upon foolish rumor he allude i conclude to the king 's support now well know what symptom of disrespect for the house of common he may have discover i know not probably he choose to imagine they to produce a effect he be evidently mad with disappointment he could not well be woo in such a temper even if he be to be woo at all after the house i ride to leave my name at the princess augusta 's and forget the duke of cumberland who live close by then i go to the duke of gloucester 's where i meet f lewis who tell I of brougham 's speech and so on i go with wood to the princess sophium of gloucester 's he tell I all the king say of the late king 's error in not frankly support he government and of he own determination to do so he have be long in the habit of say ` the queen be not with child ' there have be a report to that effect ride to the duchess of kent 's and duke of sussex 's meet lord graham mr and mr arbuthnot and the chancellor ride on with the chancellor to kensington as we be come away from the palace we hear the trampling of horse behind we and turn round see the king come full tilt with he lancer we have but just time to wheel round and salute he majesty who seem much amuse at see two of he minister amongst all the little child who be run by he carriage and the chancellor so lately in all the gravity of he official robe mount on a little white new forest pony of lady lyndhurst 's i ride on to roehampton dine there and ride back at 10 a cabinet at peel 's we frame the message peel be very flat the measure of immediate dissolution be one he do not half approve he wish to settle the regency question he have be put out of humor by have he opinion upon that point not at once acquiesce in he see all the difficulty of we position and do not meet they with energy and _ elan _ he certainly be not a agreeable person to transact business with but he be a very able man the account from ireland be very bad the potato be exhaust at limerick tralee and other place and the new crop will not come in till August at limerick some store have be force and the troops attack with stone at tralee there be a subscription of 450 # for the purchase of potato 300 # be expend and the mayor of tralee and other _ gentleman _ buy some of these potato which be offer at a reduce price to the people for _ seed _ can any country be tranquil in which resident gentleman can do such thing a discretionary power have be give to the lord lieutenant to expend 3000 # in food should it become necessary without further reference about 180 peer have take the oath i fear we shall be beat upon the forgery bill we have a very narrow margin indeed not above six or eight without bishop it be suppose the bishop will stay away i fear those will stay away who would if present vote with we and all who be against will come if this should be the case we must be defeat the king be perfectly reasonable about lord combermere the duke show he majesty the letter which have pass and the king say he should not think of it he tell peel and lord melville he wish the royal academy to remain open till after the king 's funeral that he might see the exhibition and say peel should attend he when he go this peel think very foolish and he disposition seem to be to turn the king into ridicule and to throw the suspicion of insanity upon all he act this be the _ tactique _ of the whig the king take the sacrament on Sunday and have desire the two english and one irish archbishop to attend this they call ` a indication ' _ June 29 _ at half-past ten go to lord rosslyn 's to arrange with he the lord ' address go with he to peel 's to show it to he he be read when we go in and hardly look up he hear the address which i read and approve of it but he hardly take any notice of we or of it he seem really ill and quite break down call on hardinge we have some conversation respect the state of the government he idea be that the strength of the government in the house of common be much injure by peel 's be in a subordinate situation to the duke that if he be chancellor of the exchequer and first lord of the treasury thing would go on better the duke take a secretaryship of state this would do very well in the house of common but very ill in the cabinet he be for get mr stanley and suggest -lrb- or rosslyn do or both for have talk to both on the same subject i may confound they -rrb- that lord f leveson should be make a peer i think that a good idea he be of no use in the common and he peerage would open a place which mr stanley could fill rosslyn think aberdeen 's notion upon foreign politics have together with he assumption of independence which be of recent date make the duke rather sore and that he would not be sorry to have another secretary of state for foreign affair lord rosslyn want to have lord gray in and say he would as soon be first lord of the admiralty as foreign secretary rosslyn would i think like to go to ireland as lord lieutenant he would willingly give up the privy seal to aberdeen he think sir g murray would make a excellent governor general i fear he would be too indolent he say he know if there be a vacancy the duke would be glad to make he master general i have say i believe lord beresford would go to portugal as minister if miguel would be on good term with we it seem goulburn would be glad to be speaker that would open a proper office for herry and he office might be divide lord althorpe have the board of trade i really think some arrangement must be make to give we strength in the house of common see the duke at two he approve of the address rosslyn be with he i tell he how ill peel seem he say he would go to see he house the duke move the address he give a character of the late king as one of the most accomplished able and remarkable man of the age i see lord gray smile a little but the house generally be grave and formal lord gray assent to the address but _ laissait entrevoir _ that he should be hostile to the address to-morrow hint at the regency the same thing be do in the common the duke tell I the late king have three disorder which must have prove fatal and he die of burst a blood-vessel in the stomach he have a concretion as large as a orange in he bladder he liver be diseased and he heart be ossified water there be not much and all proceed from the interruption of circulation about the heart i read the report sign by halford tierney brodie and a cooper we have east retford again lord londonderry whom lord durham put forward as he tool move a adjournment the question be postpone till Friday afterwards the duke of buckingham when most peer have go away move the same thing and then lord londonderry twice we have majority but give it up at last the chancellor be heartily tire of the whole thing the duke go away while lord londonderry be explain in answer to he speech to the noble lord 's great annoyance i ride home with the duke who speak of lord londonderry as a madman he say peel have not take a sufficiently high line he do not like the position he stand in in the house of common the duke say no government be ever beat by its enemy but many have be by they friend the king be very amenable and good-natured to-day _ June 30 _ occupy all the morning in look at the precedent in the case of regency there be two modern contradictory precedent 24 geo ii and 5 geo iii and no experience of either nor have there be a minority since edward vi in 1547 it be clear the sovereign be sovereign whatever be he age and the act appoint a regent must have he assent whatever have at any time be do have be do or sanction by parliament parliament can not supersede the royal authority it be remarkable that parliament in 1811 make provision for the care of the king 's person in case of he death but none for the care of the kingdom in the event of the regent 's death although the princess charlotte be but fifteen house at 5 the duke move the address in a very short speech not advert to the regency lord gray follow and declare he opinion of the incapacity of government as exhibit in they measure during the last five month goderich say ` nothing have be do ' and be for go on with the business lord harrowby wish a short regency bill to be pass give the regency to the queen for six week to provide for the case of pregnancy the chancellor make a speech not long admit the law to be as state that be that the sovereign immediately on accession possess all royal power eldon speak against we and treat the question of a king _ en venire sa mere _ with jocularity i follow and observe gravely upon he jocularity on such a subject then state my view of the question and express my regret and surprise at lord gray 's declaration add i be happy to know at last where we be who be we friend and who be we enemy then get up the duke of richmond totally misrepresent what i have say as to lord eldon and lord gray and endeavor to make they appear as personal attack to which no gentleman could submit lord londonderry follow in the same tone -lrb- after the duke of richmond i explain that i have not attribute improper motive to lord gray nor attack lord eldon 's character -rrb- we have afterwards lord lansdowne lord harewood give he first vote for the government after the catholic question and _ that _ because it be the first measure of the new king a foolish reason but i dare say many vote on the same ground lord wharncliffe speak against we lord bute and wicklow and the duke of buckingham for we lord radnor shortly against the duke reply then lord gray speak and observe of course upon what i have say but not angrily and i make a explanation which be satisfactory and set we quite right again he have imagine I to say he owe a debt of gratitude to the government for the measure of last session i say he have express gratitude but we have not claim it because we only do we duty in the lobby during the debate lord

at ten to goulburn 's to dinner and expect soon to see the member of the house of common and to hear of as good a division there as in the lord but after a hour we hear the division have only be 185 to 139 this make we a little flat and lord bathurst drink no more champagne i intentionally commit the government thoroughly with the whig for after lord gray 's declaration it be idle to expect a

salisbury tell I he stay away to-night not like to vote against we on account of yesterday 's declaration of war the duke of gordon tell I he be much pleased with I last night i do not however think i

answer for the present session he have reduce the duty on west indian sugar to 249 and on east indian sugar to 32 the duty on other sugar to be 63 i do not fail to tell dudley and banke in what strong term the king have express he determination to support the government they be both ` colpitus ' dudley have have no idea term so strong have be use he come to the council to be swear in on Saturday _ July 2 _ chair at eleven they have send a representation on the subject of the kattywar draft impugning as i understand for i have not yet read it the power of the board to give order in the secret department which do not require secresy i tell the chair distinctly that i intend to take upon the king 's government the whole responsibility of the foreign policy of indium i see wortley who thank I very much indeed for my note of yesterday evening he be much distressed and evidently regret extremely that he have tender he resignation he adhere however to he opinion that the regency question should have be settle at least provisionally before parliament separate he be go to see peel and afterwards the duke he tell I the government could not be conduct in the house of common unless some more minister would speak-that there must be a change i call at hardinge 's he tell I the same thing and that he have talk about it to the duke yesterday and make he promise to place the ministerial seat in the house of common at peel 's disposal hardinge be for have edward stanley he speak of wilmot horton but he be not of cabinet calibre i think hardinge be dispose to displace murray rather than either of the other he talk again of make peel first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer and the duke secretary of state for foreign affair -- aberdeen go to ireland aberdeen would not go there i think i tell hardinge lord bathurst have suggest he as chancellor of the exchequer he would not hear of it it seem brougham be almost drunk the other night hardinge and several other be get up to question he when peel stop they he pull hardinge down by the coat hardinge say peel manage admirably in the house speak to the chancellor and lord bathurst and tell they i have hear we must have a addition of strength to the treasury bench they both say they believe so too lord bathurst again mention hardinge speak to the duke about wortley he say he have write a kind note to he and tell he he have be too hasty he should have speak to some of the minister first the duke evidently intend the thing to blow over speak to lord wharncliffe about the same thing he say he would neither have vote nor have speak against government on Wednesday if he have have a idea of wortley 's resign because it give the appearance of concert and there really be none he do not know of the letter till after they have be write i say lord harrowby 's take the same line both voting and speak give the appearance of concert he say he think wortley altogether wrong that a young man have join a government have no right for a difference on a single point to resign if he differ upon a system of policy it be another thing i say i think it would be allow to blow over he afterwards talk to the duke and i have no doubt wortley will remain lord bathurst say w horton be a gentleman i doubt it he rather wish to have wilmot in office but the person to be get be mr stanley we have a discussion on a motion of lord londonderry 's whether we should proceed with east retford or not i follow lord gray and speak very quietly but i think reasonably for go on i say if we be oblige to postpone any measure the last we should postpone should be one deeply interesting to the house of common and affect they privilege i think we do all peel could require we have 45 to 13 i remain till eight but i could stay no longer lord londonderry attack I again and say instead of plant a dagger in the side of lord gray i should have apply a _ healing plaster _ he comparative civility to the government to-day be to conciliate they support to sir r gresley for durham the duke tell hardinge yesterday i be always ready i be a little too lively but i be of great use _ July 3 _ the king have do two popular thing he have allow a passage to be make from waterloo place into the park and he have dismiss all the late king 's french cook he will have no foreigner about he the foreign minister be all introduce to he to-day he be very gracious aberdeen say but he do not choose he topic quite so well as the late king who have much tact and grace neither do the king speak french well lord combermere come and have a audience to present a picture of the king of delhus paint by a indian artist it seem not ill do and have the appearance of a ordinary picture but when place against the light be a transparency lord combermere do not remain long with the king and when he come out he seem annoyed he remain some time and the duke be afraid he remain to be swear in in consequence of some incautious promise of the king it be arrange that buller who have a list of the privy councillor should turn he out with the rest who be not so when the council begin however he go away a little before the duke of montrose have resign and the king have place the office at the disposal of the duke of wellington peel seem to think lord graham be dissatisfied and unfriendly it seem he have be hear complain of vacillation & c on the part of the government and do not attend well the queen have name lady wellesley and mr berkeley paget as two lady of the bed-chamber valletort be to be in some high situation about the queen lord errol she master of the horse i conclude lord conyngham will resign but it be not know the duke go to windsor to-morrow respect the late king 's papers the duke of cumberland have meditate a _ enlèvement _ peel think brougham really rather mad and would not be surprise to hear he be confine last year he be melancholy and he friend and _ he himself _ fear he might commit suicide now he be in a excited state peel speak of he as a most wonderful man in ability it seem that last night the leader come down to make a attack but the follower not have be consult would not support r gordon come over to herry and say he should vote with government hume who in the morning have send to ask planta whether government intend to oppose he for middlesex -lrb- a question planta be desire not to answer till the end of next week -rrb- be very civil and disposed to let business pass it be not impossible that the house of common may have do they business by this day week i be to look at the beer bill and have already begin to read the common ' debate upon it _ July 4 _ read all the debate on the beer bill make note and consider the subject the queen seem to have select she maid of honor from the neighborhood of bushey this be amiable and very right _ July 5 _ i propose to wortley as edward stanley be a acquaintance of he to give he a hint not to commit himself against the government just now but he say he do not know stanley intimately enough i ask he whether he do not find the duke of wellington very kind he really have the kindest heart of any man i ever know when i look up i see the tear in he eye clare tell I he hear all the whig in we house except lord lansdowne be determine to push we _ à l'outrance _ but lord lansdowne think the duke must endeavor to strengthen himself during the vacation he could not do it now as it would be a confession of weakness but he think he would do it before parliament meet however the other would not hear he there be a meeting at lord althorpe 's yesterday but i have not hear the result talk to clare about the affair of kattywar and promise to give he precise instruction before he leave england he will remain at bombay i think he tell he mother three year but he will remain till he have make some money and do something worth go there to do he have get elphinstone to make a list of the civil servant _ with they character _ the king take the sacrament yesterday with the royal family and afterwards receive the bishop and the judge he make long speech to both thirty minute to the first and twenty to the second polignac seem quite firm although certain he shall be in a minority of 1 to 2 or 3 it be expect he will _ evade _ and that villele may be able to go on with the new chamber no news from algier 15000 man be assemble at toulon as a reserve _ July 6 _ cabinet peel say the lord advocate would resign if we do not pass the scotch judicature bill so we must struggle through with it the welsh judicature bill be to be pass too this will keep we sit some time the common will have finish on Friday house we have the second reading of the beer bill i say a few word to show the inaccuracy of one of lord malmesbury 's conclusion but i must speak in detail in the committee _ July 7 _ last night we have 247 to 93 a great division the tory in general voting with we look over again all the papers relative to the beer bill in my way back from roehampton meet lord ravensworth who tell I the king have the gout and that he have give the guelphic ribbon to he three son - in-law he likewise tell I what i know before that the duke of montrose have resign i tell he of the dismissal of the french cook which horrify he cabinet dinner at herry 's all the house of common please with they division they get three county member to speak for other the whig do not like the motion and be unwilling to divide robert grant divide the house the king be delighted with the division he come to town to-day almost for nothing and receive the duke and other he send for lord rosslyn and tell he he have make he regiment the queen 's own he have change the uniform of the navy which be to be blue with red cuff and facing he wear the uniform so to-day aberdeen introduce prince william of prussium the king desire he to stay and say he should never receive foreigner except in he presence and never but in he naval uniform he should wear the military uniform now and then but as little as possible all the cavalry be to be in red no news from algier the duke think they must be rather in want of provision the french be all in a state of sentiment as bourmont 's second son have be dangerously wounded certainly the way in which it be mention in the dispatch be good and indeed bourmont a very clever man and first under fire with he four son will soon be popular with a army polignac seem to be insensible rather than bold he think all will go on well still the present intention be that we should all be in gala at the funeral with black scarf & c i have ask several to dine at roehampton and go from thence the queen be to be present i suppose in the king 's pew the king be certainly to be chief mourner we have a great deal of talk after dinner about election i fear they have not be attend to in time it be hope seaford will be conquer from lord seaford and that the two grant will be throw out we have nobody for surrey and nobody for middlesex _ July 8 _ house answer the duke of richmond on the sale of beer bill the duke seem very well satisfied and the house be very attentive and cheer frequently we have on a division 60 to 15 _ July 9 _ lord radnor make some observation upon the continue of the irish arm bill without explain the reason the bill have be introduce in troublesome time and expire at the end of this session lord gray support he it be clear lord durham and lord radnor evidently intend to make we look about we and not do work in a slovenly manner i can not find fault with they lord durham move the printing of the appropriation list which be negative without a division as unusual but i dare say he will ask question as to some of the item _ July 10 _ as i be come home from the office i call on hardinge he consider the division to have be invaluable to we here and even to france certainly the french fund rise when it be know the present king hold the same course as he predecessor hardinge think many man be dispose to support the duke 's government under the idea that all sort of calamity would attend the weak government which must succeed it he think palmerston the best man to have in goulburn 's place goulburn go to the speakership he think w horton would be better than frankland lewi as he successor at the war office it be necessary in either case to get lord f leveson into the house of lord fitzgerald have write to hardinge and seem eager about politics i wish he be well and could come into office again i do not know that the duke or anybody would have any objection to palmerston come in by himself but i doubt huskisson 's ever be in office again while the duke live neither will the grant come in -- indeed it be to be hope they will both be turn out of they seat _ July 12 _ office backhouse bring the account of sir j macdonald 's expect death the date may 12 sir henry willock will take charge of the mission _ ad interim _ he may be a sensible man but the loss of macdonald be severe i do not know how we shall replace he cabinet at 2 the business be the eternal slave question -- what answer should be give to brougham to-morrow he be expect to propose some pledge of proceed _ legislatively _ in the next session as to the admission of slave evidence and other point a bill have be prepare make slave evidence admissible and it would probably have be introduce but for the early termination of the session however there seem to be great reluctance to embark in a contest with the colonial legislature the foolish resolution move by canning be deeply regret i be the only man who object to they when two year after they have be find of no avail it be propose that the lord should concur in they peel object to any pledge on the part of parliament more particularly on the eve of a dissolution it be think that _ by pay from we fund _ for a improve judicature in the west indy we may induce the colony to acquiesce in the admission of slave evidence although impose by the interposition of parliament i doubt it and if we pass a law to which the colony be adverse which they will regard as be _ no law _ how be we to execute it we may make judge and pay they but we must procure submission to those judge and further we must make _ juryman _ all these difficulty i foresaw when the lord adopt the common ' resolution but i suppose canning force it upon lord bathurst and the cabinet house at 5 debate on the scotch judicature bill lord wynford make a miserable speech which prove he know nothing about the subject the chancellor be very angry with he and once interrupt he improperly the debate be dull and there be no division _ July 13 _ go to st jame 's at half-past one a few privy councillor be there to be swear in amongst the rest the duke of hamilton the duke of wellington have to talk over the king about give a lodge in bushey park to one of the fitzclarence for he life and about gazette

cumberland the duke of buckingham be lord steward a bad appointment the office of lord chamberlain be offer by the duke of wellington to the duke of bedford lord rosslyn go to make the offer the duke

bill and it be read a second time without a further word the forgery bill pass with a motion of lord holland 's _ pro formâ _ that he might protest we have sir jonah barrington for a short time he be very roguish and sly there be no particulars yet of the capture of algier except that the fleet co-operate the french seem to have be highly delighted _ July 15 _ sir g murray goulburn and herry come down to roehampton at four to dinner at five we set off for windsor the day be beautiful and all the world make it a holiday carriage of all sort and hackney coach be on the road all the morning to richmond i never see so many person there and chiefly of the class of shopkeeper london be quite empty but the park quite cover with the people it seem to be a day of general recreation arrive at

of the long walk and drive through the park to the great gate of the castle within the court be horse and foot guard we enter at the visitor ' entrance and go to st george 's hall where we all assemble a great many be already come they begin form the procession at half - past seven and it be all form so as to move before nine i walk with lord hill there be ten or twelve baron a number of judge six or eight bishop and upon the whole a fair representation of the peerage and the privy council there be a double line of life guardsman within the castle without foot guard and the blues in the chapel we do not see the body as we pass a screen of black conceal the room in which it lay in state i imagine the king be in the room as we return it be open it strike nine as we come to the round tower a rocket be fire as soon as the body move to give notice to linden for the firing of the minute gun the band of the several regiment play the dead march in saul & c as the procession pass the foot guard stand close together with arm reverse every fifth man have a flambeau the platform be in most place open on both side there be a good deal of air but the night be warm have there be rain or have it be cold some must have die there be but few people on the right of the platform in the inner court but in the outer court there be a dense mass of people and all the roof be cover there be hardly a whisper all the people seem very decent in they dress and they conduct be perfect the procession enter at the great door of the chapel and turn to the left go down to the end of the aisle and then turn face the door of the inner chapel in the space we thus go round be the eton boy in the chapel there be some person on the right of the altar i could not well see who they be as there be a sort of haze but they be all in uniform with this exception the chapel be empty we be all place as we enter in the seat and stall the body be draw upon a carriage it be too heavy to be carry the king have a vast number of attendant such as equerry & c half of they captain in the navy the attendant press rather too close upon he he be in black with the collar of all the order he nod occasionally as he recognize people but when he countenance be still he look very grave he be become very like he father the assistant mourner who be lord goderich sidmouth granville grantham carlisle and some other have no seat and stand during the service the last who enter be the guard the color precede these come half way into the aisle the color depress the colonel of the battalion and the general sir h vivian come in with they cap on and sword draw and stand to the right and left of the king but not near he the banner be depress on the two side of the grave over the grave be a black

passage on the other side be the earl marshal when all be over the king go out by the small door on the leave near the king 's closet and so by the cloister to the platform as soon as he appear the guard receive he with present arm and god save the king we all return by the way we come there be tea in st george 's hall but we go on and find goulburn 's servant follow he to the carriage which be on the other side of the entrance gate and so get away even before the king we be at roehampton by half-past one the whole procession last about two hour and a half or rather less -- that be from the first move to the end it be very well arrange pohlman we deputy black rod who be a herald be the act person and do he duty admirably there be no interruption no confusion but everything manage as if we have be drill and do the same thing every day and so king george iv be go to he grave with all the pomp of royalty and splendid the pageant be but it be consider a mere pageant even by he household who have live so intimately with he for year there be no regret a coronation could hardly be gayer but the procession be gravely do and decently the magnificence of the castle aid the spectacle and make royalty appear almost as impose in death as at the moment when the crown be assume in the abbey we have supper and they all go to london huskisson and palmerston be there huskisson very sulky and sour palmerston very cordial as if he think he might come in i should be glad if he do it seem the duke of buckingham hint that he must have something more than the stewardship for he seven vote no one like he appointment and we all feel as if a alliance with the grenville party would bring we ill - luck _ July 16 _ house administration of justice bill a great many amendment make by lord tenterden we strike out a clause by which le blanc would have be oblige to sit to tax cost every day in the year lord eldon say the bill as it be originally draw be more like a string of resolution at the london tavern than a act of parliament the attorney-general be very angry indeed at the alteration make in the bill and threaten to throw it over in the house of common nothing say about the libel law but lord holland be to say something on the third reading sir jonah 's case w goady speak he speak so slow it be like a banker pay in sixpence to gain time he be so dull i go away for fear of fall asleep the duke stay and sleep the duke remain at windsor all night i meet he as he be come down to the office to-day he say he have remain to see the king and give up to he the late king 's snuff-boxes & c which be all in a great box lord wharncliffe tell I he think duncombe bethel lord morpeth and ramsden would come in for yorkshire afterwards we hear brougham be to stand it will have a very bad effect if hume and brougham come in for great county yet i dare say they will wortley go down to stand for some scotch borough which will lead to the county of forfar long wellesley have be arrest by gosle the banker for 4000 # on which it be find that he have but 3000 # in the book in the bank so he remain in durance for the other 1000 # till he find five people each willing to be bind for 200 # this dispose of he for essex he have give out that he have 30000 # a express have be send off to a mr lloyd the son-in-law of the old eliab harvey to stand for essex i know the man he be at ryde in 1813 and at cowe in 1826 he daughter be rather pretty girl i suggest tower who would have do very well for essex _ July 17 _ st jame 's at 2 the lord mayor and alderman first come up with they address then the same with the common council the king receive the address which be very loyal on the throne he read the answer very well the minister stand on he left and the household on he right about seven gentleman pensioner be on each side from the door to the foot of the throne the lord mayor & c be introduce by the lord chamberlain it be well do and be rather a impose ceremony cabinet first a question as to what should be do about ashe the man who write a libel on the duke of cumberland which he send to he and now reclaim he have write many letter indicative of a intention to assassinate and be now come up from carlisle on foot and have be walk opposite the duke 's house for three hour have first write another letter of a threatening nature lord wynford write to peel on the duke of cumberland 's part but the duke will not exhibit article of the peace colonel peter give ashe 5_s _ and he go away the question be what could be do with he i suggest that as in the case of a expect duel a magistrate on mere information that a breach of the peace be apprehend would take person into custody and hold they to bail so here the same thing might be do one of the letter distinctly threaten a breach of the peace this would secure the man till it could be discover whether there be legal ground to indict he for the letter this will be do we then come to the consideration of the east retford question all the press be for give up the bill i take some part in the discussion however peel be so strongly for the lord go as the common have do and for prevent the appearance of disunion in the cabinet that he wish be accede to and we support the bill the duke _ think _ it will be throw out and i _ hope _ it will it will be very difficult to make a speech in favor of the bill which will not commit we to a bad precedent however i shall try peel be very obstinate and disagreeable in fact the interfere with the exist franchise never be make a cabinet question the give the franchise to bassetlaw -lrb- footnote : the hundred of bassetlaw form the exist borough of east retford -rrb- rather than to birmingham be and it be because after a agreement that we should all vote for bassetlaw huskisson vote for birmingham and then resign that the separation take place these question never be make government question before and it be much better they should not be peel think he will not be able to oppose reform in general if we do not show a disposition to punish individual case of corruption i do not get away till seven and then go to hardinge 's to bring he down to wilderness -lrb- footnote : seat of lord camden near sevenoak -rrb- he tell I the speaker have be with the duke and do not resign just now there have be a question whether he should not but it be think we might be damage at the election if we make any change now the duke ask hardinge what he think as to take huskisson and palmerston back again hardinge declare against have huskisson but recommend palmerston i dare say as soon as the election be over something will be do and that palmerston will be offer the chancellorship of the exchequer peel once want edward stanley but it seem he have waver a good deal unless he manner should change it would be impossible to go on with he as minister but i trust in god we shall never lose the duke _ July 19 _ receive at nine a card from lord bathurst inform I that the queen would be in down street at ten go in plain clothes as i be desire find the queen be to be there to see the guard whom the king be to inspect the

of joke i come away as i have business afterwards there be a council and the lord lieutenant be admit to take the oath house east retford the chancellor make a capital speech and we have a better division than case 29 to 7 lord durham speak temperately and well lord gray well too we have wynford with we there be no explain that man the duke of cumberland vote against we and eldon speak at st jame 's lord westmoreland tell I that yesterday at a great dinner the king give he household he give as a toast ` the land we live in and let those who do not like it leave it ' this and many other

give the franchise to birmingham instead of the hundred dudley speak for birmingham and well i speak shortly i guard myself against be consider as pledge to any other measure intend to decide all measure accord to the special circumstance of the case the duke be not so cautious as i be and speak strongly against give the franchise to great town -lrb- footnote : no one expect it to occur in two year ' time -rrb- lord holland say to the chancellor ` he will live to see it do ' i think i may and therefore be cautious we have 39 to 16 so end the business of this session _ July 21 _ go at ten to the duke of wellington 's where the king and queen be to breakfast after a inspection of the 2nd life guard the day be beautiful and the people in excellent humor the king first go with the queen to

aberdeen say the king speak very well to the foreign minister to-day there be a extraordinary number of naval officer and the fullest _ levée _ i ever see the king recognize very cordially all he old friend he be very gracious indeed to elphinstone whom he see for the first time he be imprudent enough to make a sort of speech to the west indian deputation and pledge himself warmly to support they interest this i saw after i be go i hear astell and campbell come up with the address of the east indium company and that he speak in similar term to they this the foolish astell will publish everywhere the duke say he go away when the king begin to speak i really cover my face when he begin to speak about the catholic to the deputation from cambridge what he say to they which be no more than a indifferent joke have be variously misrepresent and not at all understand it must have be imperfectly hear the king be angry with the duke of gloucester for slur over a part of the address from cambridge which be very loyal and for not kiss he hand he have reason to complain of this the duke of gloucester kiss the queen 's hand with marked devotion the duke of sussex have be already infuse poison into the king 's ear and talking of invasion of the property of the church this the king tell peel those who observe the duke of sussex at the levee think he seem very triumphant and receive he whig friend with a smile which say ` we shall do they yet ' he be invest with the thistle to-day the king ask all the knight present to drink a bottle of claret with he in October blomberg be up with a address the king say ` you and i know each other of old you need not be present by-the-bye you may as well dine with I to-day ' the king make a extemporaneous reply to the address of the canon of windsor the day after the funeral they beg to have a copy he endeavor to recollect it for they and send it to peel peel find some curious historical inaccuracy the duke of wellington think we shall gradually bring the king round and induce he to move more quietly to thwart he directly would have a bad effect but he may be lead in the meantime he be very well in health the king have promise to dine with leopold who have ask the duke but not aberdeen the duke think the king should not dine with he now the two other power have manifest the greatest dissatisfaction with leopold 's conduct and we have intimate it in the house it would be incongruous and injurious for the king to dine with he leopold have write one if not two letter complain of the conduct of the ally power we go to the house for fear lord durham should play we a trick and it be perhaps fortunate we do for he be there and make a protest speech which be follow by one from westmoreland on the east retford bill however we have a majority in the house and there be no division _ July 22 _ ride to town cabinet consider the king 's speech peel have introduce a plagiarism from the first speech of the old king ` bear and educate in this country i glory in the name of briton ' however the whole sentence would not do and it be omit i assist in work the sentence into form and break they up into short one go away to dress for the council think the whole settle council at three first the deputy of the two house carry up the joint address respect sir jonah barrington then the king be alone and say he be ready for he minister -- none be there but I -- i go in and first ask he to allow clare to wear the uniform the late king give he this lead to a long talk about uniform for indian governor and i have some little difficulty to carry my coat without have a general consideration of the whole question of governor 's uniform i then tell the king of the approach death of sir j macdonald he ask whom we propose send in he place i tell he it do not entirely depend upon the king 's minister but that i think if we recommend a very fit man we should get the chair to name he the king say ` you hear what i say to the east indium company yesterday ' i have not but i bow and he add ' i tell they they should not be unfairly deal with there be a run on they and the notion of people be very much exaggerated with regard to the question ' i say the question would require and receive the most mature consideration from he minister before they venture to offer any advice to he majesty upon the course to be pursue the king say in about ten or twelve day he should be able to give I a day or two for indian matter i think i have give time to the other to arrive and rise i should mention that he speak of algier and say he suspect there be a understanding about it between the russian and the french i say i do not entertain much fear of the french have algier with a little money we could raise morocco on one side and tuni on the other and harass they from the interior and while we take care they have not tunis algier be comparatively unimportant with tuni malta and corfu we should hold we hand across the mediterranean i go out and find they come the duke go in the king give up dine with leopold he give it up the moment the objection to it be mention to he the speech be i find much improve after i go away the king say he think nothing could be better and indeed it be a very good speech he say he think the reference to the catholic question be unavoidable as it be the great measure of the parliament and it be particularly proper that he should refer to it as he have vote for it really think that the church would be more secure by means of catholic admission than by they exclusion i think the king seem a little tired well he might be he have be at a inspection of troops the grenadier guard and the lancer from ten to one and the day be very hot he inspect the troops on foot the duke of wellington pass the king at the head of he regiment and lord rosslyn at the head of he lord rosslyn be delighted with the opportunity of wear he uniform and play the general officer again _

charle ross come into clark 's place macnaughten go out _ July 26 _ dine at st jame 's the king of wurtemburg the minister foreign minister household and knight of the garter there in all 80 after dinner the king make a speech which make he minister ' heart fail within they however we be _ quitte pour la peur _ he only speak of he love of peace the only thing painful be that he should speak at all and before he servant like a chairman of a public meeting at the duke of wellington 's on Sunday he make a speech praise very much the duke and declare he entire confidence in he this be before the foreign minister the speech be a little warlike i believe the duke 's reply very short indeed and peaceful the king should recollect that what he speak be as important as what be write in a state paper _ July 28 _ levée before it a council _ standing _ in the king 's closet for swearing in privy councillor sir r wilson be present on he restoration to the army and hold the king 's hand in he express he gratitude the king make a energetic reply and then there be a short rejoinder from sir r wilson i could not hear what be say we afterwards shake hand cordially with sir r wilson whose restoration please everybody the french government have dissolve the chamber without allow it to assemble have place the press under restriction and alter the mode of elect deputy so as as far as i can understand to give to _ les plus imposis _ the power of elect a majority no letter have be receive by any foreign minister or by we the whole be keep a profound secret the report to the king respect the press which be make the foundation of the ordonnance be a long violent declamation very weakly write indeed -lrb- footnote : these be the celebrated ordinance which cost charle x he crown -rrb- _ July 28 _ cabinet at half-past three i be rather late and find they consider what should be say by lord stuart at paris respect the late violent measure of the french government they have decide that lord stuart if prince polignac endeavor to draw from he in conversation he opinion should say he be direct to offer none they seem inclined to tell he if prince polignac require he opinion by offer a explanation to say we consider the measure adopt be in violation of the charter at my suggestion if polignac ask he opinion more formally and offer no explanation he be direct to request the explanation might be in write and he would transmit it to he court or it might be make through the french ambassador here the french ambassador however know nothing of what be do left england on Monday and would meet the news on he road to pari at six o'clock on Tuesday evening a row be go on and a guardsman have be kill this be resistance when the police break the type & c of a press which would go on the idea be that the chamber of deputy will meet consider the dissolution to be illegal matuschevitz openly inveigh against the measure it be doubtful whether metternich do not advise it he send a long paper from johannisberg give he view on the present position of the french government the king of wurtemburg have a interview of two hour with the duke of wellington yesterday he be very anxious on the subject of france he say the people of wurtemburg will cry out that a similar measure be intend against they -- that everywhere the two extreme party will be place in collision bulow think the same the duke advise the king of wurtemburg to avoid pari on he return but the king have some _ emplette _ to make and go there the duke advise he then if he must go for he _ emplette _ to stay only a day he say he would not stay above five or six thus be every consideration of real importance sacrifice to motive of private fancy and convenience lea inform aberdeen that a vessel be fitting out in the thame with spanish refugee and arm to endeavor to raise a insurrection in spain after some time they find the vessel and to-day she be detain she have sixty-nine man and about 150 stand of arm on board they sink the print proclamation which be pick up torrijo and valde be to be the leader torrijo be to join below the revenue vessel some of the man have 10 # each give to they by the spanish committee to aid they voyage to rio there be some doubt under what law they be to be indict and the attorney and solicitor-general be out of town receive a letter from lord heytesbury enclose one he have receive from captain campbell announce the death of sir j macdonald _ July 29 _ the duke tell I he have see rothschild that morning who have recent intelligence from paris the guard be faithful but the 53rd regiment which be at the hôtel de ville have join the people and so have individual soldier of other regiment the people and the national guard be arm the chamber have assemble the king be not at paris he be nought to be at compiègne the duke think henry have better not go to pari that one party or the other would soon attack the english call on elphinstone offer he persia he be much obliged but say nothing would induce he ever to go to asia again speak to he of monteith he know he and a little doubt he discretion he promise to find he and send he to the duke if he be in town but he think he be at algier speak to he of jenkin and brigg he say jenkin be the abler man see lord essex and lord clinton they have hear the duke of orlean be proclaimed regent _ July 31 _ go to town early call at the duke 's to hear the news none have arrive since yesterday morning the duke say he consider the king dethrone and we should soon have to consider whether we should acknowledge the new government i observe that we course must depend very much upon the manner in which the french effect they revolution the king have put himself decidedly in the wrong and if they make they revolution as we make ours in 1688 there be no reason why we should not acknowledge the new government be it what it might the duke say the foreigner be already come to know what we think and mean to do we should have they all in we train and provide we take a reasonable course on the question of algier and other which might arise we should do very well the mischief be that this event would place the two party in presence on every occasion and every trifling difference would resolve itself into one of liberal and anti-liberal i say i fear whatever party predominate even if the king regain he power france would be precipitate into a war for no party would be able to maintain itself in quiet time the duke say the king 's government be become very dangerous it have as be show in the case of algier and they discussion with we no more morality than that of buonaparte and it have the favor of european power as a ancient dynasty while it be prepare to act upon the principle of a new one now under a government of revolutionary origin all they act would be view with disfavor and suspicion the duke speak very strongly against canning 's policy in admit france to the triple alliance -lrb- footnote : by the treaty of london with reference to greece -rrb- and thus bring she into a prominent station in europe again she would naturally have rise again in good time the time should not have be anticipate by we the duke agree with I in think the government here would be strengthen by what be occur in france i lament brougham 's success in yorkshire and view with some apprehension the increase power it would give he he say yorkshire be quite radicalise by have four member no gentleman could bear the expense -- the middle class have it all to themselves at a quarter to four i call at the treasury and find rothschild have receive intelligence down to the 29th at 4 pm drummond show I the duke 's letter to peel which contain this account : -- that there be fight all Wednesday the 28th and Thursday till 3 pm there have be a terrible massacre but the troops get the worst of it the people be lead by the student of the ecole de droit and of the ecole polytechnique the 53rd regiment which it be say yesterday have join the people have in fact surrender the people have arm themselves at the arsenal on the night of the 28th the guard retake the hôtel de ville but be drive out again and retire to the louvre the firing do not cease at the tuilery till past 3 pm the people pillage it when the troops retreat and the tri-coloured flag be hoist there and on the column in the place vendôme the minister escape by subterraneous passage from the tuilery and be with the king who have a great many troops about he at st cloud la fayette command the national guard and be a member of the provisional government general gerard lafitte and casimir perrier be the other c perrier be depute to the king at st cloud no courier be allow to leave paris these letter be send by private servant to the first stage i tell all this to henry but he go so do many other there be thirty people apply for passport when he go for he on the other hand many english come away _ August 2 _ there be a great deal of information in the ` time ' the result be that the king 's offer to change he minister and to recall the ordonnance be not accept and the duke of orlean accept the office of lieutenant - general of the kingdom he address be quite in the spirit of the revolution the guard be disorganised and desert the swiss only be say to remain with the king who it be think be go to nante lord stuart say if the royalist do not resist the french will invade belgium in three month the deputy at first in very small number not more than thirty nor at any time much above sixty seem to have be irresolute they be decide by other and indeed the whole seem to have be do by the people there be no appearance of previous concert if there be leader they be the boy of the ecole de droit and the ecole polytechnique polignac seem to have be firm after the beginning of the fight and when lafitte and other go to marmont at the tuilery in the middle of the tumult he declare concession impossible the guard at st cloud tell the king they would protect he but would not advance again to pari general -lrb- blank -rrb- seem to have have 6000 man at versaille but the people would not admit he at rouen there be great ferment and forty piece of cannon be send by the people to the assistance of paris the troops seem to have be order upon pari from all quarter the total loss of life be estimate at 5000 the people be become impatient and cry _ vive la république vive napoleon ii _ this it be say determine the duke of orlean to accept : and the deputy offer because they fear the establishment of a republic would be the signal of general war i do not hear of the pillage of private house the church have be pillage and the palace ransack the priest think fit to fire from the archbishop 's palace which lead to the death of many and to the pillage of the palace the duke say they have do everything in the most offensive way re - establish the tri-coloured flag & c they seem determine to force the revolution down the throat of europe he speak of the duke of orlean ' address i say i suppose he be oblige for he own safety to throw himself at once into the revolution the more natural thing would have be for the french to have send for young napoleon the duke say he hear young napoleon be get hold of french pamphlet & c the duke of orlean ask lord stuart 's advice as to accept the crown lord stuart remind he of he oath and tell he the power of europe which restore the bourbon could never recognize he on consideration i think we should endeavor to induce the power which sign the treaty of vienna to declare that they be determine to maintain the territorial arrangement make by that treaty but that they will not interfere with the internal government of france i think this declaration make at once would perhaps prevent any attempt on the part of the french to make war for the frontier of the rhine the election go well for we except canterbury where lord fordwich have beat we man henry b bare the husband of lady augusta _ August 3 _ the account from paris state that the due de mortemar who have be appoint minister by charle x himself see it be too late and that the only chance for the house of bourbon be in the place the duke of orlean in the office of lieut-general this he propose himself to the duke of orlean who write to the king and in accept the office say he conduct would show with what view he do it then he issue a tri-colour proclamation lord stuart say this be do at the last possible moment the proclamation be receive with cry of _ vive la republique vive napoleon ii _ however these cry cease and it be hope thing would go on quietly sebastianus and b constant express hope that in a few month man 's mind would be tranquillise and thing place on a regular footing it seem that the king be at trianon with about 4000 guard he talk of resign to the dauphin if he have not already do so it will probably be too late and the dauphin be suppose i believe very justly to be implicate in all that have pass lord stuart state the loss of the troops at 3000 that of the people at 6000 of course these calculation be very vague and probably exaggerate it would appear as if there have be more preparation on the part of the insurgent than be imagine the decisive measure that of the bank refusing discount be of course suggest by lafitte the royalist be much in want of money they leave forty-two million in they caiss and 150 million at the bank bourmont be to leave algier on the 25th probably he be call home to be present at the crisis the king 's troops still remain in force at st cloud the barricade be continue everybody seem to think the military force be as ill-managed as everything else marmont act _ mollement _ we have be beat at canterbury and what be worse at norwich where a brother of peel 's have be drive out by robert grant the most decide enemy of the government no one declare himself the opponent of government and as such ask support but we candidate do not succeed at popular election _ August 4 _ to london early the king of france be suppose to be go towards cherbourg we fear he will come here the duke say the king seem disposed to receive he and remind the king that the pretender have be three time order out of pari on the representation of this country i be glad to find a very general feeling that the king of france could not be permit to remain if intrigue be allow by he that he could have no more than a refuge peel seem to feel this most strongly the duke seem to think there have be previous concert on the part of the _ patriot _ the king be violent against the duke of orlean we duke of orlean as i call he the duke of sussex stick close to the king whenever he appear the duke of cumberland have resign the blues in a huff because they be place under the commander-in-chief however he wear the uniform to-day at the levée we have a cabinet to-morrow at 4 on civil list and regency indeed we know not how soon we may meet parliament perhaps on September 15 the queen receive the address of the london clergy she have she whole _ état major _ _ August 5 _ at four cabinet talk about the civil list there be pension to the amount of about 7000 # a year which the present king will pay and he will pay 6000 # a year to mr fitzherbert she charge on brighton she have 10000 # a year before many pension be strike off one of 500 # to sir j lake many other to jocky & c it seem the late king borrow 50000 # for himself and as much for the duke of york on the revenue of hanover which sum have be pay off the king of france abdicate and so do the dauphin in favor of the duc de bordeaux in a letter address by they to the duke of orlean in which he lieut-generalship be treat as emanate from the king the duke of orlean in he speech to the chamber announce the abdication but do not say they be in favor of henry v hence the people of pari hear the king make difficulty suppose he have recede from he original promise -- whereas he only say he original promise be conditional _ and have not _ be fairly make known be this as it may 35000 man set off for rambouillet to take he 10000 be send afterwards by the duke of orlean to protect he and he have 7000 at rambouillet chiefly cavalry and artillery for the same purpose i think there must be a smash stuart and pozzo go to the duke of orlean to represent the personal danger of the king and to desire that measure might be take to preserve he life the duke be represent as have be _ très ému _ and as have say that he character depend upon the preservation of the king 's life and the measure i mention be immediately take chateaubriand and hyde de neuville be for the due de bordeaux stuart have i know not why counsel the duc de bordeaux 's friend to be quiet the duke of wellington think there be radicalism in everything-that the lieut-general will have no power the king go in grand state through the city to the tower he have six carriage and six at the tower the duke give he a breakfast he then go on to greenwich by water and return to london by land he be very well receive _ August 6 _ at the dinner we have the minister household and trinity house chairman and deputy-chairman of the east indium company governor and deputy-governor of the bank lord mayor and ward and thompson member for the city the king make speech and give toast as if he be duke of clarence at the trinity house he alarm and pained we but he do less mischief than i should have expect and as all the people present be real friend he only let down the dignity of the crown he give the health of the minister and afterwards of the duke of wellington some thing he say very well the duke answer very well there be so much good feeling about the king that he error of taste be pardon he will improve and wear he robe more gracefully _ August 7 _ cabinet determine that the principle of the regency bill should be that the mother of the sovereign should be regent the regent to have unlimited power if any limitation it should only be place upon the creation of peer and a council of regency should exist only for that purpose we separate till the 23rd _ August 9 _ in come down to sandgate read jame 's and cabell 's memorandum on the progress of the british government in indium and we foreign relation as i be come out of maidstone meet the candidate come in sir e knatchbull in a cocked hat attend by thirty or forty gentleman in black all cover with dust precede by about six blue flag and follow by some carriage with ugly woman then come t law hodge -lrb- why _ law _ i do not know -rrb- with many light blue flag and some low people -- few gentleman the number however of the hodge color and people be greater than that of the knatchbull squad not a cheer for either the whole thing flat and ridiculous -- worthy of hogarth there be some people collect in maidstone but not so many as on a market day -- there be none on the road by the ` time ' i see the chamber have modify the charter and have proclaim the duke of orlean king of the french at least have offer he the crown on the condition of he acceptance of the modify charter the chamber of peer be put by it be only advise to _ eliminate _ the last seventy-six peer _ August 10 _ briscoe come in for surrey to the exclusion of jolliffe we friend certainly the popular election have all be unfavourable to we in fact the tory have not yet recover they good-humour and the government have some furious enemy and no warm friend i do not think we can go on without a accession of speak strength we measure must be modify to meet the circumstance of the time and so far i have no fear _ August 13 _ cabinet room read lord stuart 's despatch there be little in they that be not in the newspaper he say the revolution have be bring about by small proprietor act under the influence of banker and lawyer the troops have show no great popular feeling many have take the opportunity of go home the new king 's oath-taking be flatly receive as long as he can keep la fayette with he he be master of pari lord stuart seem to have behave prudently in merely acknowledge the receipt of the communication from marshal jourdan of he be appoint foreign secretary the neapolitan ambassador wish to have a note generally agree upon all the ambassador say they be so sure england will judge rightly that they will without instruction follow in we wake la fayette have originate the idea of a mission of deputy of the national guard to london to thank the english people for they sympathy lord stuart hope the king will induce la fayette to give up this mischievous and foolish scheme _ August 18 _ lord j russell be not return for bedford he lose it by one vote he have publish a good address and be evidently very indignant brougham have have question put to he by martin bree which he have answer satisfactorily to the venereal doctor it would have be good fun have they fight the only merit of the french revolution seem to be that it have not be vindictive if they be wise they will not touch the life of the minister the new king call he eldest son duke of orlean all the daughter be to be princess of orlean distinguish by they christian name this be like henry iv 's policy in reserve the duchy of lancaster he wish to be able to make room for henry v he have give up he property to he eldest son 's little child and would probably if he be displaced emigrate quietly as he have often do before and leave he child in possession when brougham accuse the duke of wellington of advise polignac the whole meeting of he own friend express dissent it be incredible that he should be so foolish as to believe such a thing or as to attempt to make other believe it _ August 19 _ i see by the ` sun ' that the ex-king of france be arrive at portsmouth i be very sorry for it although he will not be receive by the king and will probably sail immediately he may require refit for i dare say he bring off little from rambouillet he packet be accompany by two french vessel of war and all the french vessel at spithead hoist the tri-coloured flag when he be know to be there _ August 20 _ it seem the royal party have land at cowe _ August 23 _ go to the cabinet room to read despatch lord stuart represent the government as by no means settle anxious to remain at peace and to prevent revolution but not secure thing which be essential the new king be oblige to ask humbly of la fayette who be now really sovereign la fayette want to dissolve the chamber the king rightly think that to do so now would be to make a convention -lrb- footnote : ie as in 1792 -rrb- some person be go off to bring napoleon ii but the austrian will stop they on the way the prussian on the first intelligence of the event at paris send order to they minister to come away but he be direct not to do so without concert with he colleague they meet and agree to recommend he to stay the disposition of metternich and nesselrode who meet at toplitz or carlsbad i forget which be the same and reasonable -- to leave france to settle she own affair quietly and only to interfere if she invade the peace of other state the duke have leave a memorandum on the cabinet table show clearly from treaty that this be not a case in which we be bind to interfere we engage to support a constitutional monarch against revolutionary movement but the monarch have violate the constitution have break the condition france may still form a part of the congress of europe in ` union or _ pacific concert _ ' with the four great power the treaty of offensive alliance between those power be dormant while france remain under a constitutional king the duke properly think that the sooner after have take a decent time for deliberation we can recognize the duke of orlean the better for he and for we he expect at no distant period war as the consequence of these event and i fear he may be right it will arise by the imitation of the spaniard and portuguese and the ambitious sympathy of the french it be evident that russium mean to indulge france with algier _ August 23 _ receive a letter from the duke respect rajpootana he think the cession of territory will only lead to new demand on we part and advise that unless it should be necessary to give some instruction the letter should not be send he think too that as no brevet have be give to king 's officer in ava none can be give to those of the company i be to see he tomorrow upon these point cabinet at 3 show herry the answer i propose send respect the interest bill of which he entirely approve peel be not at the cabinet read the duke of orlean ' letter to the king which be proper he say he lament and wish he could have prevent the fall of the eldest branch of he family he _ devoted _ himself to prevent misfortune which would have endanger the peace of europe he avow pacific intention the king be to receive general baudrand who bring the letter in the levee which will be before the council on Wednesday the king of the french will be acknowledge a letter will be write to we minister with the great power state we reason for do so this will be read to the foreign minister here i suggest that it might be as well to make the letter substantially the duke 's memorandum and particularly to remind france that the quadruple alliance still exist we shall have the draft of the letter tomorrow parliament to be prorogue to October 26 to-morrow the brazilian will acknowledge miguel as the regent if he will marry marium da glorium then come some absurd condition however the thing be to be consider to-morrow aberdeen 's idea be that there be no do anything with don pedro and that we must acknowledge don miguel as soon as he will grant a amnesty we be to have a council on Wednesday for the prorogation the king will not much like this as he want to go to ascot but he may have it as early as he like and he ought to receive general baudrand soon we may have the council at 10 and he may be at ascot in excellent time _ August 24 _ the council be at 1 at 1 i go to the duke tell he of my recent letter to the chair he say we must not make bankrupt of the company if we would use they hereafter i say it be my duty to state the case of the public as the board be guardian of the territorial revenue a letter from count moltke request to see I i have appoint to - morrow at 3 cabinet at 3 aberdeen read the propose letter from the king to king loui philippe with a few trifling alteration it be adopt the duke call on marmont to-day and receive from he a military account of the affair at pari marmont say he know nothing of the ordonnance and disapprove of they he be at the king 's levée on the Tuesday and be tell there be _ quelque inquiétudes _ at pari and to take the command of the troops he find only 7000 man polignac forget any be _ en congé _ think there be 12000 he occupy the place de l'hôtel de ville de la bastille de victoire and de vendôme in sufficient force he troops be not attack he withdraw they at night and reoccupy the post in the morning then the attack begin the troops maintain themselves but he find it necessary to withdraw they to the louvre the tuilery the pont neuf and the place de vendôme in the louvre he have two battalion of swiss two battalion of the line in the place de vendôme the guard in the tuilery he keep open he communication with the country by post at all the avenue lead to the garden of the tuilery and the bois de boulogne champ elysées & c the battalion at the place de la bastille could not retreat by the straight road and be oblige to march all round pari cross the river at the bridge nearest charenton and come to the tuilery by the faubourg the two battalion in the place de vendôme go over to the people he then send one battalion from the louvre to the grille of the tuilery garden opposite the rue de rivoli and so protect he flank on Thursday he have lose 1800 man kill and wound and 1200 _ égarés _ -- besides the two battalion but he have receive a reinforcement of 3000 man the troops be _ extenués de fatigue _ when lafitte and the other come to he he tell he he could not order the fire to cease he be attack if the fire of the people cease he troops would not fire he fairly tell the king it be not _ une commotion _ nor even _ une insurrection _ but _ une révolution _ there be not above thirty or forty people behind the barrier but all the window be occupy by armed man he counsel concession but polignac would not hear of it he say polignac be _ l'homme le plus présomptueux _ he have ever see when the louvre be attack the swiss run out towards the tuilery and carry with they a battalion he have in the place de carrousel as well as two gun he have with he the rush be such he could hardly get upon he horse and the man run so fast that a person he send after they on horseback find they almost at the extremity of the tuilery garden however some return to protect the retreat of about sixty man whom he have get together to defend the grille at the arc de triomphe in the place de carrousel they be just enable to retreat marmont be violent against the swiss who be he say retain in the french service by higher pay and privilege for _ this very thing _ and yet they run away in this shameful manner marmont mean to go to italy for a year after that he hope he can return to france he have no wish to emigrate if the account in lord stuart 's report be correct france be in a deplorable state in many part of the country no tax be pay and the republican party have not lose hope the condition of what don pedro consider a conciliatory arrangement be entirely inadmissible they be found upon the marriage of donna marium da glorium and england france and austrium be to guarantee she against any _ injure _ she may receive from she husband certainly we may safely say these term be inadmissible and so break off all negotiation with don pedro who since these term be propose by he have recognize the independent regency of terceira by-the-bye one of he term be the payment by portugal of all the expense incur by himself for donna marium it seem the draft of a decree of amnesty have be send to lisbon and if miguel will pass that decree we be to recognize he the chancellor and other seem to think this be a awkward time and we have better wait a little i think so too however undoubtedly we early recognition of miguel might lead to the prevention of a portuguese revolution there be much conversation respect the bank charter it seem to be the general opinion that government should take it upon itself to arrange term with the bank which term will be prohibition to any other bank to issue note within twenty-five mile of london this be grant the bank will do the public business for 100000 # a year less the whole question of country banking whether it be to be with limited or unlimited responsibility a limited or a unlimited number of partner be to be leave open to parliament i suggest that the most important question be the revision of taxation my view now be that we must take off some of the tax which press most on the poorer class and have a income tax i dislike a income tax as much as any one to I it be a very oppressive tax but i believe it may become necessary walk to the corner of hyde park with lord rosslyn have some conversation with he respect the change necessary in the government before we meet parliament he say lord althorpe will not come in without lord gray and he be not sure lord gray would not stipulate for lord durham the latter be out of the question on account of he temper i do not think the government could go on with the duke and lord gray of the huskissonian palmerston be the only one to e stanley there be no objection _ August 26 _ at 3 count moltke come to the office he have two danish claim to speak about dinner at the albion for clare there be present of the minister peel rosslyn goulburn herry then lord f leveson calcraft the solicitor - general w peel lord g somerset planta gen macdonald col fitz - clarence lord tenterden of clare 's friend glengall agar elli sneyd lord templeton besides h vyner and upton who go with he i speak feebly not be well besides i do not think it in good taste to make a great speech but to leave clare 's the first speech of the day peel make a very good speech but too much of it clare really speak very feelingly and well he speak a little too much of he gratitude to the court i have some conversation with loch i be as well receive as i expect and better consider the run that have be make at I the duke go off to walmer castle very wisely for he want sea air but clare would have be more pleased have he be present and the director too the minister ' health be well receive _ August 28 _ receive from elphinstone he remark upon the propose letter to bombay respect native education of which he generally approve he strongly urge the send out of european professor young man acquaint with english literature to learn the language there and teach the native i have send the extract from he letter to astell suggest that the university of oxford cambridge dublin and edinburgh should each name those from whom should be select the necessary number i have observe that the object of native education be of such importance that the state of the finances must not prevent its accomplishment _ August 30 _ write a very long letter to hardinge on the present position of the government and we policy i give my opinion that any accession of man which destroy the unity of the duke 's government would do harm that we must meet we difficulty by measure that the first be a revision of taxation that no man we could get would add moral strength to the government and the whig would not support unless they have half the government that the question of reform could not be make a open question it be best for the country that party should be decidedly separate it might then choose which it prefer and man would be oblige to take a side we have better be out with character than in with a detachment of the enemy in possession of a gate still talk we must have and we want a financier i say of myself that i care little about office i should without reluctance acquiesce in retirement if the duke could fill my office more advantageously and i believe rosslyn would do i think rosslyn would like ireland or pari i do not think it improbable hardinge may send this letter to the duke _ August 31 _ a insurrection at brussels the house of the minister burn the troops fire and kill many they not be 1500 retire to the park and form before the palace a evening paper i get at ashford say the nobility have join the people and the troops have accede on condition of keep they arm and guard the palace if this revolution take the line of union with france war be almost inevitable it may be only for a more popular form of government but what the people of the netherland desire be annexation to a great state they be ashamed of be dutch most fortunately all we manufacturer be in full employment and the harvest be abundant the peace and constitution of england have depend upon fine weather clare from whom i hear to-day tell I lord wellesley assure he there be to be a revolution in spain and name the day the noble be suppose to be at the head of it this may all be true for we minister never find anything out but my apprehension be that there will be a low ill - support revolutionary movement receive a letter from lady londonderry she first wish I to obtain if i can ward 's exchange to a better climate this i have tell she i have already endeavor to do but that i have no expectation of aberdeen 's do it lady l say she brother be two hour with the duke and as long with lord gray the latter would have act a second part but the duke would not admit he i have tell she i think she must have misunderstand lord camden 's account and that she may be assure it be not the duke 's character to fear a equal i send she letter to hardinge and ask he if he know anything of the affair i can not imagine when it can have take place lord camden be a odd person to employ he know so little of lord gray rosslyn would have be the natural envoy if it procede from the duke but i think it must have be a volunteer of lord camden 's _ September 2 _ read the papers relative to the danish claim canning seem to have decide one case that of the danish east indium company hastily however we can not undo a decision of a secretary of state the other case that of the private individual at tranquebar have be determine in they favor _ September 3 _ have a long conversation with herry with whom i ride for a long time respect affair both here and abroad he be rather downcast however he think this belgian insurrection will be put down rothschild have export 800000 # in silver and 400000 # in gold to meet he bill when they become due -- diffident of have anything pay to himself _ September 5 _ cabinet room find lord rosslyn there he tell I the substance of a report i do not see of col jone who be send by the duke to the netherland and be return he say the prince of orange be with 1600 man in the park and palace at brussels 5000 man be close at hand under prince frederick of orange at vilvorde and two body of 10000 each be march upon the same point the troops at the palace have twelve gun all the troops show a good disposition the first deputation from brussels be rather insolent they be treat accordingly and tell to return without cockade & c they do so and the prince agree to go into brussels without troops there be a great crowd and for a moment he be separate from the staff and the garde bourgeoise and alone in the midst of the people he leap he horse over a barrier and so get back a commission of very respectable man have be appoint to investigate grievance so the thing will rest till the meeting of the state on September 13 there be a letter from lord heytesbury give a account of he conversation with the emperor of russium the emperor be violent against the bourbon say very correctly that he treaty only oblige he to maintain a constitutional king still he may recognize but shall always consider the duke of orlean as a usurper prussium seem very prudent disposed to recognize but to state the condition of peace -- that the territorial possession of 1815 shall be maintain austrium seem to be less prudent metternich send to bernstorff the answer he intend to give which require a declaration of not have any intention to interfere in the affair of france but require a pledge as to the observance of the treaty of 1815 before recognition bernstorff very prudently advise austrium to recognize unconditionally the spaniard seem to have be in great consternation at first the minister -lrb- addington -rrb- think the king and queen be so popular and the public interest be so much direct to the queen 's approach accouchement that no revolutionary movement of importance be likely to take place he deprecate however the commencement of any such movement because he think it would enable the apostolical party -lrb- footnote : the name give in spain and portugal to the absolutist and clerical party -rrb- to induce the king to dismiss he present quiet minister and have recourse to measure of rigor which would infallibly ruin the dynasty spain and indeed all the power seem to look for instruction to england and there can be no doubt that all will recognize and all be quiet salmon when he communicate to the king the event in france say ` you majesty see how dangerous over-zeal be in a minister no one could be more devoted to the royal family than prince polignac ' the king say ' i see it ' however notwithstanding this they say he be so weak that he may adopt a violent course nothing can be more correct than the conduct of m molé the french secretary of state for foreign affair he be most anxious to preserve peace in europe the new king 's government in france and himself in office he be much alarm by the event in belgium and wish we minister to join the french minister at brussels in recommend some concession to the king of the netherland the duke have as rosslyn tell I write a memorandum to serve as the basis of aberdeen 's dispatch very civil indeed to molé very much satisfied with the disposition evince by the french government but in we ignorance of the real state of thing decline to advise the king of the netherland it be very amusing to see the french government most _ liberally _ permit the bonaparte family to return to france and most _ prudently _ send circular to all the minister of the power which sign the protocol of 1815 urge they in the name of that treaty not to allow the member of the bonaparte family to leave they present residence it seem this be very necessary for although they partisan can do little without they presence they might do much with it martignac have get together sixty member of the chamber of deputy who will act _ en masse _ for royalty there be no military force to keep people in order and the national guard do not like do so in fact the revolution be not over thing may go on as they be but we have as yet no security the french seem heartily sick of algier it cost a great deal of money tropical product will not grow there the climate do not suit the french troops who have besides a most extraordinary _ maladie de pay _ they must send 15000 man more there to maintain it as now they have no more than the town they be willing to give it up to the sultan if he will renounce tribute & c i never consider the acquisition of importance to france i always feel we might vex the french to death by the use of a little money which would at any time have bring forward all the arab from the desert the port will only hold a few vessel the emperor of russium propose to cut the greek question short by propose the crown at once without the intervention of france to prince frederick of orange and if he should refuse then to prince charle of bavarium who we know will accept i should say from all i have read to-day that if france should make a aggressive movement all europe would be unite against she as in 1813 but if she remain quiet within she own frontier no power will wish to molest she it be satisfactory to observe the increase prudence and reasonableness of the great state they general union and the deference which in the hour of danger they all show to the opinion of england there be some apprehension i hear of riot at manchester there be no cause for they all man can get work i would put they down with a strong hand _ September 6 _ see at the office colonel monteith the king of persium have about six million sterling leave in he treasury in gold and silver besides jewel unsaleable on account of they high price but which might be estimate at four million more there will be a civil war on the death of the shah abba mirza might succeed if he have energy but he be the weakest man on earth probably all the raja will be put down and some new dynasty establish the chief be not likely to serve the russian at any time the persian be fine man and make excellent soldier bear heat and cold but not wet and damp officer there be none the russian lose 10000 man a year in georgium and caucasus and it cost they about 500000 # a year they have never conquer the country the cession lately obtain from turkey have enable the russian to put down the robber who live in abkasium -lrb- footnote : the country at the western end of the caucasus -rrb- but it be of no value for purpose of offensive war -- of some for defense it be cheaper in the proportion of 100 to 220 to send goods to tabriz by trebizond than by the persian gulf the imaum of muscat carry on a large trade in opium between the red sea and china he carry british manufacture to the indus and trade extensively with cochin china where sugar be half the price it be in indium the officer of the crown prince 's army all speak turkish it be more important to have at the head of it a man of energy than one conversant with persian he rank should be increase as now he be make to rank below the last member of the mission the disturbed state of persium have drive much trade to the indus which be carry on by the euphrate persia may now be consider not as a monarchy but a federative state all the king 's son be independent prince colonel monteith be at algier -- the only englishman in the army there may have be twenty foreigner in all he have letter of introduction and get there in a transport take he chance of be send back he be with the intendant of the army and at the siege be attach to a division bourmont offer to receive he in he family bourmont be hate and despise he seem to take very little trouble about the army and to leave everything to the general of division on the 19th the day of the battle he lose 600 man by not advance sooner the moment he advance the enemy flee the loss be 2200 man in all yet fifty be never to be see dead and wound together the loss be by skirmish at long shot along the whole of the line this sometimes last all day and the troops be young be too foolhardy the arab be a miserable race half naked everything beyond algier seem a desert for eight mile round algier the cultivation be beautiful and the villa more numerous than near any town he ever see a profusion of water the town miserable in the extreme inhabit by moor and the descendant of turk about 50000 the port be form by one pier which hardly protect two or three frigate there be no safety in the bay there be 3000 turkish soldier in algier and about 7000 in the country these keep order now they be send away the french may colonise extensively but they can not keep the country with the present inhabitant the dey have ten million sterling in gold and silver a treasure which have be accumulate since the time of barbarossa -lrb- footnote : a famous corsair of the sixteenth century -rrb- he claim 400000 # as he own and be allow to carry it away the french enquire about the jewel of the regency the dey say there be no jewel but those which belong to he wife and _ la galanterie française _

monteith see one officer coolly put into he pocket a watch set in diamond which have evidently be give by a king of england worth he suppose 2000 # general lavardo pillage more openly than any one he have thirty soldier employ in carry off he pillage the affair at belida be accidental bourmont go out with 1600 man and invite the chief to meet he they be come peaceably but some arab see the french artilleryman take they horse down to water without they gun and they could not help attempt to steal the artilleryman beat they off but the firing have begin be soon convert into a battle bourmont beat they off but think it expedient to retreat the beach be particularly favourable for land the weather fine and there be plenty of time to prepare the thing best do be by general valagus who in eighteen hour raise a continued work of a mile and a half he have 1600 sapper and miner colonel monteith be in admiration of this entrenchment which be beautifully finish and be capable of resist 30000 regular troops the arab be miserably mount the dey 's two best horse be not worth 30l each duperre he think a man willing to do all but quite overpower by the management of 100 ship of war and 500 transport he report be all lie bourmont 's be nearest the truth the ship with the exception of those which be in the levant be not in good order there seem to be no discipline the army never want either water or provision water be within three foot of the surface everywhere in the garden on the side of the hill towards algier the water be find at the depth of twenty foot nothing could be more perfect than the equipment of the army they calculate the cost of the expedition at four million i see by the newspaper that the prince of orange yield the point of the color to the deputation from brussels he seem to have concede a great deal but to have act with great personal courage and decision it be expect that the commission he appoint have ask for the separation of holland from belgium and the establishment of a federal union only two country under one king with distinct legislature army & c the great town be quiet holland ready to march upon brussels i shall not be satisfy unless some of the bruxelloi be hang for pillage the answer of the king seem to have be firm and judicious it be impossible not to admire the constancy of the troops who bivouac for eight day in the park the french government seem too weak or too timid to prevent outrage in paris the printer ' devil will have no machinery for print it be entertain to see those who make all revolution suffer by they _ September 7 _ see greville at the treasury he tell I he have get from lord chesterfield that palmerston have no objection to come in lord melbourne have but they require the sacrifice of aberdeen bathurst and arbuthnot there must be some mistake about this condition i tell greville if he could get a _ fact _ to communicate it to the duke it be fear the prince of orange be go away to the hague he promise colonel jone he would be firm _ September 8 _ the prince of orange certainly go to the hague he be receive there enthusiastically the proposition he take be for federal union i fear he must submit to some modification of that or encounter real opposition and civil war _ September 9 _ hardinge give I rather a indifferent account of ireland great animosity still exist between the catholic and protestant in the _ lower _ rank in the higher peace a revolutionary disposition raise in the middle class by the example of prance great dissatisfaction in consequence of the propose taxation of last session he tell the duke and so do arbuthnot that he might dispose of they office if he want they he seem to think peel be tired and anxious to withdraw -- annoyed at the idea of be unpopular a idea the defeat of he brother have give he this make he less energetic than he should be with respect to the measure necessary to strengthen himself in the house of common _ September 10 _ it seem the desire of separation be general in the netherland it be the result of national prejudice and vanity the dutch seem just as violent the other way and the deputy be rather in danger at rotterdam the separation will probably defeat the object of the great power in 1814 for it be idle to expect such term of federal union as will enable the two state to act cordially together _ September 11 _ by withdraw he troops from the palace and go to the hague the prince of orange have ruin he cause he have appear to give it up _ September 13 _ read on my way to london the intelligence obtain by lord heytesbury relative to the russian trade with tartary and on the caspian it be very full and satisfactory the ` time ' have a sensible article on the state of france the want of material to form a constitutional monarchy the grow dissatisfaction that _ more _ be not do in a revolutionary sense and the irresponsible power of a deliberative army of 800000 man ghent and antwerp seem to cling to the connection between holland and belgium and i begin to hope that if france be tranquil the bruxelloi and liègeois may grow tired and become reasonable man can not play at barricade long when no one attack they _ September 14 _ house of lord i have to wait half a hour for the seal which be carelessly carry off by lady lyndhurst in she carriage talk to rosslyn he tell I aberdeen be lead to expect another revolution in france the paper they be go to prosecute be a _ affiche _ call upon the french people to overthrow _ l'aristocratie bourgeoise _ which be as bad as the other and to divide the land in the netherland the people and they leader be divide and if antwerp and ghent & c remain firm it signify little what brussels do brussels will be bring into term by distress rosslyn think some of the whig as well as of the tory will be alarm by event on the continent and support government he hear of no negotiation for accession the people of brunswick very justly provoke have turn the duke -lrb- footnote : this be the eccentric duke who die a few year ago at geneva bequeath he whole property to the city who have erect a monument to he -rrb- out of the town and burnt he palace he escape with ten hussar he deserve he fate i believe he be mad he be a complete _ vaurien _ when parliament be prorogue as to-day the peer be without they robe the chancellor be in he legal dress the common appear without a summons by they clerk and the chancellor merely desire the proclamation to be read however as it be hold _ improperly _ to be the first day of the sit of parliament the return of the scotch peer be lay on the table all this be sanction by precedent but contrary to reason _ September 20 1830 _ write a long letter to hardinge upon the political consequence of huskisson 's death -lrb- footnote : he be kill as be well know at the opening of the liverpool and manchester railway -rrb- urge the introduction of palmerston and stanley the latter to vent the junction of the whig aristocracy with the radical i be sure if measure be not take immediately we shall have all the huskissonian whig and ultra-tory -lrb- the last be insane -rrb- unite against we receive from sir j malcolm a letter with some enclosure about suttee he have reluctantly and fearfully abolish suttee make it culpable homicide to assist and murder to force the victim he have do it i think wisely by a repeal of a clause in one regulation and a amendment thus not put it vainly forward as lord william do in a pompous document he have abolish the military board i believe very wisely but there may be a difficulty with the duke if i can not do it without talk to he about it i believe sir j malcolm be quite right and that there would have be no hope of preserve a system of real economy have the military board be permit to remain i be curious to see he measure of check on expenditure that if it be good it may be adopt at the other presidency receive some letter from lord w bentinck lord dalhousie have be very ill and the command of the army would fall lord william say into the weakest hand if anything happen to he the spirit of the army be become better i gather from lord william 's letter but it require much attention i have be think all day of what measure may be adopt for improve it _ September 21 _ office read to cabell my memorandum on the alteration which might be introduce into the army which i write hurriedly this morning he be long in the military department and can be of much use cabinet room i think the result of lord stuart 's dispatch be that the moderate party be gain strength i should say the fact we see in the newspaper lead to a different conclusion the minister and the old lead member of the chamber of deputy act manfully against the crowd they declaration of intention be satisfactory i really believe they mean to act honestly if they can austria seem to have hesitate about the acknowledgment of the king of the french after the receipt of a dispatch from petersburg and metternich who seem to be grow weak waver after he have receive general belliard very cordially prussia that be _ the king _ hesitate about sign the letter to loui philippe when he hear of the doubt of austrium the result however be that all _ entrainés _ by we will acknowledge the emperor of russium who be the most reluctant have determine to do so if the other do i should say there be this satisfactory conclusion to be draw from what we have see that if france show a disposition to aggrandise herself all europe would be against she the object of the french government be to place france exactly in the position in which she stand a fortnight before the ordonnance -- that be talleyrand 's wish and he have _ rédigé _ he own instruction read aberdeen 's letter date the 17th state the necessity of maintain cordial intercourse with and between spain and portugal and intimate that on the promulgation of a amnesty accord to the term recently communicate england will resume diplomatic relation with miguel but not otherwise spain seem to be sensible there be a movement of folly about royalist volunteer which be put down and the government seem by no means dispose to give way to absolutist if the queen should have a son spain will probably be tranquil talleyrand pretend the french will be reasonable about algier i do not wish they to be so i believe they could not have make a worse purchase they will find the possession very expensive they troops will hate it they will have nothing beyond they outpost and it be no port my first opinion be strengthen that they could not be worse than if they be leave as they be _ September 24 _ the populace and the burgher at brussels have quarrel and fight a little it seem the liberal and the catholic -lrb- footnote : they have form the two oppose party in the belgian chamber since the country become a independent state they have temporarily unite against protestant holland -rrb- as the other be call have be long diverge the deputy and man of property excepting m de stassart have become alarmed the prince de ligne and d'aremberg and other have leave brussels on the 21st probably the 20th in the evening a proclamation be publish at antwerp by prince frederick of orange notice the excess of the populace and announce that the troops would relieve the burgher guard this must have be do in concert with the influential person of the town who be alarm for they property the liégeois be very violent they will be expel from brussels no more can get there as the road be interrupt the dutch have but 20000 man of whom the belgian be as three to five the belgian have begin to desert but they do not join the bruxelloi in any number the hanging of some of the brussels mob would have a excellent effect the government of france seem to become weaker and to permit thing which discredit it a night or two ago some _ ouvrier _ insist on go into the king 's bedroom after he be go to sleep wake he and make he make a speech sit up in he bed twelve department have unite against indirect tax and few pay those which be direct meanwhile the algerine treasure have be pillage by the officer of the army and ship clear for toulon go elsewhere to land it they want a loan while the fall government would have have a surplus they will find the raising of a loan difficult the french be displeased by the coldness of austrium and prussium and by the march of austrian and prussian troops the king of saxony have resign or rather he have associate he nephew with himself as co-regent the brother waive he claim to the throne the landgrave of hesse cassel be meet by a deputation require he to do a number of public act and amongst the rest the dismissal of all mistress it seem the electoral prince have one to whom he be go to be marry the duke of brunswick lately gallop off _ luus troisième _ while he palace be burn these be odd time however here people seem to be incline to be quiet even the common council have by a large majority decide against congratulating or notice the french people _ September 26 _ brandreth tell I there be a report of the belgian troops have enter brussels and of a great massacre there will be news to-morrow as the wind be down _ September 27 _ no direct news from brussels yet there have be fight for two day and it be know at antwerp that the first regiment that enter be nearly destroy it seem the invitation of one section be a ruse there be to be no cabinet for eight or ten day the civil list not be prepare when we do meet we be not to separate there seem to be every expectation of a new ministry in pari and in the revolutionary sense i see aberdeen he rather expect it read the report of the commission appoint to form the article of accusation against the minister it be a party speech with little point and prettiness affect moderation and full of rancor it be a nation which have no idea of justice _ September 28 _ cabinet room dispatch of the 24th and 25th from sir ch bagot but none from mr cartwright when sir ch bagot write last thirty hour have elapse without official intelligence although the distance be only thirteen hour it be know there have be hard fighting that it be necessary to take in succession every house in the rue neuve royale that the troops be in possession of the upper part of the town and a proposition have be make by the lower town for a cessation of hostility after which they have recommence it be evident the resistance have be most serious 20000 french be in the town and these probably direct the defense all club and council of all sort have cease to have power two day before the attack there have be perfect anarchy the troops behave admirably they be much exasperated no assistance have be send by the country aberdeen be confident the king 's troops have be drive out because no official account be send the duke and all the military man say the non-arrival of dispatch prove nothing but that the affair be not over during a engagement a general can think of nothing but victory the importance of the result be incalculable at paris the national guard have disperse a meeting of looker on who be lead by curiosity to crowd about a ride school in which the society of les amis du peuple meet the day after they be denounce by guizot in the chamber as agitating france two officer of the national guard enter the ride school and warn the meeting of the danger they be bring upon public tranquillity on the representation of the second they adjourn at dinner at lord rosslyn 's the duke say the french government could not go on as it be the chief of the national guard necessarily command everything the national guard might become janissary i think the government may go on as it be _ in form _ but it will vary _ in substance _ from day to day management a little good fortune and a few example of determination may make it a fair government a single error may produce anarchy the duke give a excellent account of the feeling at liverpool manchester and birmingham at manchester it be better than at birmingham but there they receive very coldly tennyson 's speech about give they member and at last put a end to it by strike they glass with they knife which make such a ringing that tennyson be oblige to sit down he deserve this for he bad taste the duke be astonish by the machinery those who have witness the improvement of late year expect progressive improvement so great that they say a man who lay out 100000 # now in the best machinery would if he refuse to adopt the new improvement they anticipate be without profit in five year and be ruin in ten the rapidity of motion be so great in the steam carriage that even the duke with he quick eye could not see the figure on the post which mark the distance at every quarter of a mile and when two steam carriage cross no face could be see -lrb- footnote : this be on the manchester and liverpool railway then just open and describe the first impression make by railway travel -rrb- it be like the whizzing of a cannon ball the cold be great and they must have some defense against the wind through which they pass so rapidly a new canal without lock which bring coal to birmingham in two hour which by the old canal require nine be more magnificent even than the railroad splendid as that be the railroad cost a million for several day after it be open the proprietor make 250 # a day the king have the gout the duke go to brighton to-morrow we dine with he on Thursday cabinet will not begin till next week _ September 29 _ no news in the newspaper from brussels no dispatch from sir ch bagot or mr cartwright arrive at the office but a gentleman who leave brussels at five on Sunday report that they be then fight in the town but the troops have the worst of it the consul at ostend report that the king 's troops evacuate brussels on Sunday night that reinforcement from the country be pour into brussels that there have be a attempt at insurrection at ostend which be put down for the time by the governor who kill two and wound six that eleven or twelve man have march in from bruge which be in possession of the bourgeois that ghent be expect to rise and in a few day all belgium would be separate from the king a son of holme of the treasury arrive at the foreign office at four and say he have leave ostend at three yesterday when there be a report that the dutch have make another attack and have recapture the park it seem they never have more than the park they have to take and do take the rue royale they be more thoroughly master of the place royale they plant gun against the town which be answer by gun from the rebel at five on Sunday the latter be gradually advance and pick off the troops in the park the first day some rocket be fire and eighteen house burnt but prince frederick order the discontinuance of this the only efficacious mode of attack lord blantyre be kill he be lame and on a sofa but curiosity lead he to crawl to the window and peep out when a ball strike he in the forehead lady blantyre and he child be with he he be much esteem he be in the peninsula and a gallant officer i think the employment of european officer in civil situation under native prince may be very useful to they subject and while we do not ourselves employ native in high situation to force all native prince to employ they be to make a striking contrast between they government and ours very injurious to ours jone seem to hesitate and to think i commit myself however i feel sure of my ground a letter from lord cleveland express a wish to have the vicarage of ilchester and offer a equivalent living in shropshire or cheshire i send he letter to the bishop of bath and well say i should be much oblige to he if he could make the arrangement lord cleveland be a faithful and powerful supporter of government tell lord cleveland i have transmit he letter with a strong recommendation i make my letter as agreeable to the bishop as i could but i dare say he will refuse very likely he have give away the vicarage i tell lord cleveland i think it probable _ September 30 _ the consul at antwerp write a long foolish letter in much alarm mr cartwright 's report be come he describe a horrible carnage the event much as we know they sir a bagot say he russian colleague have with the consent of the king and the dutch minister write home to say belgium can only be preserve by foreign aid at dinner at the duke of wellington 's meet talleyrand and vaudreuil the other there be aberdeen goulburn herry

janet who be in brussels during the fight she walk about frequently and be treat with civility by the armed burgher a few grape-shot fall into the courtyard and she pick up one she be at the hotel de brabant in the rue neuve there be no pillage nor any riot the loss of the people be great she leave the town on Sunday -lrb- i think -rrb- with a passport from count hoogwoorst and get round to antwerp the troops be say to have lose only 600 man prince frederick be about two league from brussels on the road to louvain wait for heavy gun this be the report i suspect he will retreat altogether _ October 1 _ on consideration think it would be better to have a secret letter on the press authorise the government to allow they servant to be connect with the press to this letter i think it advisable to add a exhortation to redoubled zeal on the part of the company 's servant on account of the unsettled state in which the mind of man must be until it be decide under what form the future government of indium should be administer and i direct the government to make all thoroughly understand that no possible change could effect the public debt or the rights of the native or the just expectation of the european servant my reason for think the officer of government should be permit to be concern in the press be this that if none but those who be unconnected with the government and who accord to the exist system can not be connect with it manage the press the probability be that everything will be say against the government and nothing for it i show the propose letter to the duke he think it would be better to pay people for write than to employ the company 's servant and that the conclude paragraph would lead the government to suppose it be quite decide that the company should be put a end to it be wonderful the sort of prejudice he have in favor of the company he think that unless director select writer and cadet we should have a inferior sort of people in indium i have no objection to the patronage be in a corporate body but i be satisfy the present system lead to a degree of delay which be more mischievous than misdirection he acknowledge however that the service be much change the exhibition make by courtenay smith have produce a strong impression upon he mind he have do more injury to the company in he mind than all the evidence he still seem unwilling to make he opinion up against the continuance of the monopoly it must fall however the king wish to have sir e barne appoint provisional successor to lord dalhousie the duke think he a better man than sir r o'callaghan who be suggest by lord f somerset i suggest that it would be expedient to unite the influence of governor-general with that of commander-in-chief and make lord william bentinck provisional successor the duke seem to think lord william could not execute both duty and that it be better to adhere to the general usage of separate the two office it seem that after lord hasting ' return the court intimate a disposition to separate the office in future i can do nothing against the king the duke and the horse guard but i be satisfied it would have be better to send sir e barne as second in command to the governor-general the king -lrb- lord f somerset tell I -rrb- be desirous of do away with the company 's european regiment he could not do a better thing he have likewise some notion of bring the army under himself the duke think it must be a _ local army _ and certainly it must -lrb- footnote : in accordance with this view lord ellenborough oppose the eventual amalgamation of the queen 's and the indian army -rrb- i believe it be better to make it a army of three presidency not one army my doubt be whether it would not be advisable to allow exchange from the king 's army to the company 's everything would be beneficial that raise the tone of the indian army the duke show I a draft letter he have write for aberdeen to lord stuart inform the french government that the king of the netherland have require the assistance of he ally to re-establish he authority in belgium that it be as much the interest of france as of other power to put down a revolution not carry on by the higher or the middle but by the lowest class of the people that we be desirous of concert with france as one of the contracting party to the treaty of vienna what course should be now adopt it could not be suppose the ally would forego the advantage of the union of belgium and holland for which they have sacrifice so much this be the substance of the letter it will not be send without the concurrence of the cabinet which will be summon the moment peel come to town and he be hourly expect i think this letter prudent inasmuch as whatever may happen it will place we in the right but i do not expect that france will do anything against the rebel or sanction the do of anything the duke consider as indeed be clear enough that it be idle to expect the future submission of belgium to the king of the netherland it may be possible to place it under a prince of the house of nassau i do not think the duke see he way but he expect war _ October 2 _ cabinet aberdeen 's letter to lord stuart it be found upon the duke 's memorandum but much extended _ à l'indienne _ i think none approve of it but lord bathurst i object to the statement that the treaty of 1815 impose upon we _ obligation _ it may give we _ rights _ but it impose no obligation then the principle of non-interference be advance as just and wise but there be peculiar circumstance attend the position of the netherland which make a difference there be a assertion that the trouble in belgium have be foment by french agency although not assist by the government and a direct reference be make to the barrier treaty france be request to concert with we and the ally to _ suppress _ the anarchy which exist in the low country she be at the same time remind that in no case can the ally consent to renounce the security give to they by the treaty of pari in consequence of a insurrection amongst the lower order at brussels of this a great deal will be leave out peel seem to be rather averse to the whole tenor of the letter which look like a invitation to put down the insurrection by force he sketch in a few word a letter which would be innocuous the duke 's object be to make a effort to induce france to act with we to settle the belgian affair amicably they can not be settle _ without _ france without a war but be there any hope that the french government will venture to give we she _ appuus _ if they be self-denying enough to renounce the hope of annex belgium to france they fear of the jacobin will not allow they to do so my expectation be that they will say they neither have interfere nor will interfere to dissolve the union between holland and belgium that they will not interfere in the internal concern of other state some think they will go farther and declare they will not allow other _ power _ to do so i do not expect this every word of this letter must be well weigh for every discontented man in england and in france will criticise its word and its spirit there be no writer more unsafe than aberdeen rosslyn do not seem to like the letter at all but he say little i whisper to peel that i wish he would bring a letter to-morrow _ short _ it be at last agree alteration should be make and we be to meet at one to-morrow peel take the letter home and will i trust cut it down the king charle x be in danger of be arrest of which he naturally have a great horror and he desire to be allow to go to holyrood house where he would be safe at lulworth they be afraid of the due de bordeaux be kidnap the pretence be the get master from edinburgh for the child it may be fear that the place he in a royal residence may look or be represent as look like recognition on the other hand he removal from the southern coast to scotland be a renunciation of intrigue with france it would be inconvenient if the king should wish to go to edinburgh next year charle x be to be tell he can not stay there after the spring however he will probably live there all he life it would be a revolting sight to see a king imprison for debt and all gentleman all man of feeling would have cry out _ shame _ we be right in feeling but in policy i be not sure nieuport have fall as well as ostend the bruxelloi be drill and threaten to attack prince frederick probably van holen drill they to keep they quiet many people have apply to falck -lrb- footnote : dutch minister -rrb- for passport for brussels go in reality to join the rebel today two irish labourer ask for passport brussels will become the sink of europe and every unquiet spirit will go there the duke think we attempt to make france act in concert with we the only chance of preserve peace i fear its preservation be almost desperate one thing be in favor of it that all the european state desire it yet more than we do i caution they to-day not to take any advanced position from which it would be difficult and discreditable to retreat the people would not go in with we in a war to avert a distant danger nor indeed for any object not commercially interesting it come out accidentally in the course of conversation respect the loan to the netherland that we have lend 20000 # to the greek the sum to be repay by bill to be draw by we commissioner whenever the loan we be to guarantee may be make -- that be we be to be pay out of we own money of this loan i know nothing and my impression be that when it be earnestly press by aberdeen such objection be state on the ground of illegality that the decision be against it certainly nothing be decide in favor of it i recollect have say i would rather advance a portion of the money myself than be a party to the transaction _ October 3 _ cabinet the consul at ostend announce that nothing remain to the king of the netherland but antwerp the troops have everywhere lay down they arm on the 1st the brussels papers announce that order have be issue by the provisional government for arrest all the dutch officer peel read first the dispatch write by aberdeen with the omission agree upon and then he own substitution he be much the best it speak of ` compose trouble ' instead of ` suppress anarchy ' avoid all mention of interference and altogether be a more prudent paper touch the barrier very slightly it be understand that peel 's be adopt it be determine to allow the king charle x to go to holyrood house but he will be tell there be no furniture or very little and that he can only stay six month and that no expense can be incur on he account he have admit no one to a audience but many have be to lulworth to ask for place talleyrand say they have find a _ ébauche _ of polignac 's tell bourmont that he proposal that the money take at algier should be give to the legion of honor could not be comply with as the king intend to distribute it amongst he most faithful friend they pretend they do not intend to make use of this because there be no proof of its have be send in fact they do not use it because it reflect credit on bourmont lord rosslyn with whom i walk as far as pimlico palace show I the treasury list of the house of common 311 decide friend and 189 enemy - that be 500 the remainder consist of moderate tory violent tory good and bad doubtful as well as huskissonian -lrb- the latter 13 -rrb- be more likely to be against we than for we rosslyn still hanker after a coalition but reform have make it impossible we might have have this time last year sir j graham we might even now have palmerston -lrb- footnote : it appear from lord palmerston 's publish papers that this be a error he have already determine to act with the whig and not to take office without lord gray and lord lansdowne see ashley 's _ life of lord palmerston _ vol i p 211 -rrb- but the duke seem determine to go on as he be peel and all even bathurst seem to have a correct view of the danger but i see no flinching _ October 4 _ see the duke suggest that we must soon consider what should be do with respect to the china trade if we be to give up the monopoly we have better do so at once on the first day of the session with a good grace and not make ourselves appear to do it with reluctance the duke say we must certainly consider it have i talk with the chair about it i say no i have think it best to wait till the cabinet have come to a decision as to what should be do i have privately advise they to turn over in they mind the plan of the company go on with the government slightly vary but without monopoly the duke say he could not make up he mind without hearing first what the chair have to say i observe that if they that be astell think the government hesitate they would certainly say they could not go on without monopoly however the duke seem to think it be impossible for the question to come before the cabinet before we have talk with the chair so i have ask he and loch to meet at the treasury at twelve on Monday i should like to see tucker and stuart but i must do it privately as i have no principle to go upon in consult with individual director the duke seem very reluctant to give up the monopoly and to have very exaggerated idea of the value of the company 's intervention he show I a letter he have receive from molé in which he take a very moderate view of the belgian question express the most earnest desire for peace as war would place everywhere the two extreme principle in conflict france will not interfere neither can she suffer other to interfere in the internal affair of the netherland he hope to be able to arrange everything amicably a letter the duke show I from rothschild 's brother be still more satisfactory if the view take in it be correct he say france will _ with england and the ally _ amicably settle the question but she will not have to be exclude he mention leopold as a probable king of belgium the court of turin -lrb- footnote : the first french republic have make a similar non-recognition a plea for seize savoy -rrb- seem to be in a great fright because the french government take huff at they not recognize at once they be afraid to do so till they hear what the great power do m de la tour say they can bring 60000 or 90000 man into the field if genoa be guard for they by a fleet but genoa would require 14000 man on that place they must retreat the spaniard seem to be go on well they mean not to be _ empressés _ with they recognition but be advise not to be the last there have be insurrection at hanau swerin and i know not where else the diet intend to vary the law of the empire and to allow any neighbor whose assistance may be ask to give it at once the emperor of russium receive general athalium very graciously but he keep he wait for he answer lieven profess himself well satisfied with we reason for immediate recognition so do metternich in fact they can not do without we and if we lead they must follow _ October 5 _ cabinet goulburn 's civil list he transfer to the consolidated fund all the salary heretofore partly pay by the civil list and in diplomacy there be a reduction of 28000 # a year it be suppose there can be no reduction in the great department in the article of tradesman 's bill or in the board of work the king give up the droit -lrb- footnote : ` droit of admiralty ' -rrb- without any compensation this be all a loss to the privy purse it seem possible to reduce perspectively many officer in england and in ireland who do not really contribute to the state of the crown this however do not occur to goulburn but to peel the account of liege be very bad indeed thing there seem go on in the style of the french revolution nothing can be better than the account from france they will be please by the letter read to they all they fear be the attempt to exclude they from all concert in the settlement of belgium they think neither the king nor prince frederick can return to brussels but the prince of orange may and this will i think be finally settle _ October 6 _ council at 2 talleyrand be present he back to the window and read a speech in which there be several erasure he declare the determination of france to pursue the course so wisely follow by england of non - interference he speak of himself as ` ministre d'une royaute votée à l'unanimité ' the king do not much like receive he and be a little nervous to what talleyrand say about noninterference the king answer it be a very good thing especially when exercise _ de bonne foi _ this he say by aberdeen 's advice i read the king of the netherland ' letter he ask distinctly for _ military assistance _ cabinet dinner at the duke 's the prince of orange be go to antwerp this the duke think the very worst step that could have be take the only mistake the king have make in fact the king be unwilling and ever since the affair of brussels there have be a coolness between the king and the prince the duke fear the consequence of the prince 's go because he be a man devote to popularity-vain the duke and talleyrand be talk about popularity the duke say those who love it never love it with moderation talleyrand say ` il n ' y a jamais de modération où il n ' y a pas de _ goût _ -- et il n ' y a pas de gout dans l'amour de la popularité ' the duke ask talleyrand what sort of a man the duke of orlean be ` un prince de l'ecole normale ' of the queen he say ` elle est bonne femme et surtout grande dame -- c'est ce qu'il nous faut ' talleyrand say he have give the king a piece of advice ' _ to go to neuilly _ ' -- that be to rescue himself from the vagabond cortége talleyrand be very well pleased with the letter send to pari and the foreign minister be satisfy the king -lrb- we king -rrb- seem to I to be very weary to-day aberdeen say he be a good deal distressed at the state of europe and rather anxious lord and lady holland and rothschild appear to be the only people besides the minister who have call on talleyrand lord holland be very much with he lord holland be do all he can to save the life of the french minister -- for the interest of the french government not of the minister themselves he have write to la fayette and to the king _ October 7 _ i forget on what authority it be mention yesterday but it be mention as a fact that the liberaux would not have do anything unless they have be certain of the duke of orlean so afraid be they of a revolution that they would have submit to the ordonnance rather than run the risk of it _ October 9 _ at canterbury hear more particulars of the machine-breaking now go on in the neighborhood notice be give and the frame be break one gentleman boast at market they should not break he as he have arm man to protect they they on the same night set fire to he rickyard sir henry oxenden 's son go out to meet they when they come accord to notice to break sir henry 's machine one man speak for the rest he acknowledge sir henry seldom or ever use he machine and that he be the landlord in kent who give most to the poor but they must do as they be order they would however do as little as they could and they only saw off a shaft the farmer now leave they thrashing machine out in the field to be break the rickyard of one gentleman be set on fire because he commit a man for machine-breaking he lose 6000 # nothing be insure it seem suspicion be entertain that the machine-breaker be not all of the station they assume they all wear smock frock but they language be better than they dress when money be offer they if they want it by the oxenden they say they do not want money they obey order it be report but this must be a exaggeration that 500 assemble lately on a down near mr brockman 's the magistrate have no good evidence against any some bow street officer be here lord winchelsea and sir edward knatchbull have be here at every meeting of the magistrate although they live eighteen mile off the provisional government of belgium have declare the independence of the country and the defeazance of the house of orange in the meantime the prince of orange be arrive at antwerp as viceroy with a belgian etat major civil it seem probable the chamber of deputy will abolish the punishment of death for political offence and so save polignac the levy of 108000 man will hardly make the french army 240000 effective for it be not full before the revolution and number have desert besides the disbandment of the guard which be 25000 man _ October 11 _ cabinet aberdeen read lord stuart 's account of he interview with molé molé suggest a immediate conference and think the prince of orange may be make sovereign of la belgique no communication will be hold by the french government with the provisional government of belgium they will communicate through the king it be propose to have the conference here the minister of austrium prussium and russium have express they readiness to acquiesce in anything propose by this country they may inveigh against the diplomacy of england but in moment of danger all rally under we wing molé distinctly admit that the existence of the present government of france depend on its remain on good term with england and prussium and the affair of belgium give they a opportunity of show _ la droiture de leurs principes _ & c -- in short of gain a good character it be decide against guarantee the sum of 500000 # the dutch wish to raise here there would be no end to such loan if we once begin to assist the credit of foreign state parliament would not approve of the measure to the dutch government it be important that this administration should remain and likewise that they own credit should not be injure in all europe by the confession of weakness which they recourse to we imply to guarantee a loan be to give money and to do that be to assist one of the party to lose the mediatory character and in fact put ourselves out of the congress hardinge can reduce 57000 # a year in net and on the civil list 30000 # on the pension list and 27000 # on officer of state we have some talk about detail but goulburn do not reduce as much as hardinge have some talk with the duke and peel respect the fire in kent and the breaking of frame five be in prison the duke think smuggler be at the bottom of it there have be alarm at carlisle the officer in command of the castle apprehend a attempt to surprise it and seize the arm man have be see measure the wall sir j graham be alarm about it order will be give to provision for thirty day all the place where arm be keep the town include where there be 600000 stand of arm in the meantime all class be more comfortable in this country than they ever be and this alone keep down insurrection there be leader but no troops hardinge report that the spirit in ireland be _ disimproved _ since the event in belgium there be to be a anti-union society which as soon as it meet will be put down under the act _ October 12 _ at nine go to apsley house meet the chair we go in to the duke we conversation last two hour as they be to send in a _ procès verbal _ it be unnecessary for I to state it the substance be that suppose the monopoly to be take away they would administer the government of indium as heretofore on one of two condition either close they account with the public and receive payment in full or a equivalent annuity for all they property in indium in which case they would require no guarantee of the present dividend or make over all they property and take a perpetual guarantee of the dividend the public to make good in either case all deficiency of indian revenue and in either case the company to be the agent for the territory provide all necessary sum here and receive repayment at a rate of exchange to be pay from time to time fairly the chair be give to understand that the public be liable to the make good of indian deficiency we should require a strict control over the whole expenditure _ here _ as well as in indium they show especially campbell a disposition to leave off trading and become gentleman they be tell by the duke that if they do so we must be at liberty to revise we arrangement with they we might as well go to the bank as to they if we be to treat with a body not commercial the duke seem much pleased with he foreign prospects m de choiseul be wait to see he i suppose on the affair of holyrood house it seem probable that the french will abolish the punishment of death and so save polignac _ October 14 _ find at the office several papers give account of radical meeting in lancashire all the old radical be reappear on the scene they do not as yet seem to be attend by any numerous assembly never above 200 or 300 a letter from a clergyman at wrotham speak of burning near that place and of the bad conduct of the people who interfere with the working of the engine and seem to rejoice in the destruction read all the papers relate to the education of the princess victorium who seem to have be admirably bring up at the cabinet room read a long and excellent letter of hardinge 's respect the state of ireland the 87th regiment at newry when parade for church refuse to march without music to which it have be accustom in the south it have be discontinue in the north to avoid displease the orangeman the captain send for the lieutenant-colonel blair who be at first disobey but he place a drum to have a drum-head court martial and then they march the duke say it be and always have be the worst regiment in the service it run away at salamanca and expose he to be take prisoner it have always be unmilitary and from the same cause a disposition to seek popularity on the part of its officer hardinge propose embark it at once for the west indy the duke prefer bring it to dublin where there be other regiment to keep it in order and soon send it to england and by detachment at no distant period to botany bay they do not expect there will be any further exhibition of mutinous spirit the only mischief of this be the effect at this time there have be apprehension of a attempt to scale the pigeon house and a full garrison have be order into it with direction to add to its defence on the seaside so as to protect it from escalade hardinge can bring twenty gun together in a very short time at any point in dublin he talk of arm the student in trinity college in the event of a explosion they rather expect a explosion about the 18th or 19th when probably there will be the first meeting of the new association this it will be the first object to put down by the act of 1829 the meeting to petition for the repeal of the union will be permit hardinge be quite himself on horseback the only fear be that he should be too lively peel seem to think he be but it be a great comfort to have he there instead of lord franci leveson who be always wrong the king of the netherland have call he state at the hague the constitution require they to meet this year in belgium he take advantage of the provision in the constitution which permit he to call the state in holland in case of war they fear the loss of antwerp the prince of orange think thing look better the netherland ambassador be much annoyed at the refusal of pecuniary assistance but as be expect the dutch have get they money only pay a little more for it we depot be only 160 strong we have hardly a battalion one or two at least of those which be go abroad will be retain for a time the duke of brunswick do not much like abdicate the duke of wellington thought he have bring he to make he brother governor-general for he life retain the succession for he child however aberdeen seem to have blunder he back again he be to go to see the king on Saturday the king desire he might come early that he might not be oblige to have he to dinner and he desire aberdeen would remain in the room pozzo think the french government be gain strength but they be very inefficient in prevent armed man from assemble on the frontier of spain the french have exercise such coldness towards the belgian that they be become unpopular de potter be french while he have hope of become so now he be a republican the austrian will send troops into the sardinian dominion if there be any insurrection -lrb- footnote : they have similarly interfere to put down the constitutional movement in piedmont which follow on the neapolitan revolution of 1821 -rrb- this by invitation the queen of spain have it be say a son -lrb- footnote : it be a daughter afterwards queen isabellum ii bear October 10 1830 the alteration of the succession in favor of the female line lead to a civil war on ferdinand vii 's death a son might have secure peace but probably without a constitution -rrb- this event would it be think secure spain against any revolutionary movement _ October 15 _ call on the duke settle with he the alteration necessary in the chair ' memorandum of the conversation on the 12th he think we have go too far in lead they to expect they should be repay the money they have sink in the territory while they hold the government receive from he the opium letter he think the principle good but consider it be not fair to make the scindian prevent the transit of opium we can not prevent they for they be independent but unless we endeavor to persuade they and succeed in do so we shall lose we opium revenue _ October 16 _ chair at 11 head over with they my alteration of they protocol astell do not seem to see the greatness of the variation campbell do and particularly observe upon the word ` value of the fix property in indium which might be adjudge to appertain to the company in they commercial capacity ' he want a admission of the justice of the claim leave nothing for adjustment but they amount i say we could not admit claim without examination the nature of which we do not yet know all we could admit be that the claim be such as should be submit to examination and they validity decide upon just principle astell wish to go back again and recommence the discussion i say he know i could decide nothing without the cabinet and he nothing without the court all he have to do now be to bring the subject before they he ask whether they be distinctly to understand that the cabinet have decide upon the termination of the monopoly i say that the question not have yet be before the cabinet i could not give a answer officially but when the first lord of the treasury and the president of the board of control desire to know what the course of the court would be in the event of its be propose that the court should administer the government without monopoly i think it be not difficult to draw a inference _ October 19 _ send to the duke a memorandum on he letter read at the cabinet room the king of the netherland be much annoyed at the desertion as he think it of he ally he now propose a congress of the four power and _ france _ at breda or cleve he admit france very unwillingly and by no means acquiesce in the reasoning in favor of the advance we make sir ch bagot seem to think the prince of orange will be lose the affection of the dutch without gain the belgian the german confederation be arm in the neighborhood of hanau for the preservation of the peace they have put 6000 or 7000 man in motion and have a reserve of 15000 or 18000 the excitement against polignac and peyronnet increase and the minister run the hazard of they place by attempt to save they i fear that be hopeless the spanish radical seem to find it would be dangerous to pass the frontier _ October 20 _ office cabinet room the prince of orange have write a most offensive letter to the king of the french almost insinuate that the trouble in belgium be foment by france and say that by a declaration against the belgian france would show she good faith and secure the recognition of russium the french cabinet be much offend at the silence of the king of the netherland and count molé be go to write to the dutch minister upon the subject nesselrode seem to see great difficulty in the intervention of france in the settlement of belgium -- the union of belgium and holland have be make _ against _ france the russian minister at the hague have general direction to follow the course of england upon all point not provide for by he instruction there be a great fall in the fund to-day partly it be say in consequence of those who desire to keep up the fund be no longer able to do so partly from the general aspect of affair my surprise be that the fund have not fall before and much more cabinet dinner at the duke 's show the protocol of we conference with the chair the head of the speech be read aberdeen 's will not do at all to my surprise he intend to announce the recognition of miguel he have engage to do a great act of justice that be to publish the amnesty he will not do it till a british minister arrive at lisbon that be he make we whom he have once deceive dependent upon he word this would be a very incautious step on we part we meet on Friday to consider the speech in detail we have a good deal of conversation about the duchess of kent 's allowance which be to be much increase it be propose to give she 20000 # a year she have now 12000 # for herself and the princess out of which she pay interest and insurance upon 12000 # she borrow on the duke of kent 's death for she outfit the king have about thirty people at dinner every day belong to the household he expense must be enormous in live _ October 21 _ read in the newspaper the king of the netherland ' speech it be querulous and angry i really think the proclamation _ extraordinary _ of the prince of orange a forgery but it be genuine and he throw off all connection with holland declare the independence of belgium and place himself practically at the head of the rebellion on Monday night at a dance at the lodge hardinge see accidentally in a evening newspaper show to he for another purpose the advertisement of the anti-union association and by seven o'clock the next morning the lord lieutenant 's proclamation prohibit it be placard in the street this be decision there be no riot person in general be satisfy the act be right o'connell be alarm the duke of leinster be ready to sign a declaration in favor of the union all be safe in ireland with hardinge 's promptitude i wish he could remain and not come over to parliament _ October 22 _ see campbell who be very nervous and anxious and i at night write a letter to lord hill in favor of he son -- more i admit from a father 's feeling than from a conviction of be right it seem the lord lieutenant not have be near dublin when the proclamation be issue by hardinge he must have have a blank proclamation in he pocket and have issue it without the opinion of the law officer he have good debatable parliamentary grounds of defense but he have trodden upon the margin of the law not the worse for that in these time when it be most important that every one should see the government be vigilant and determine valdez who enter spain with a few hundred man have be smash at once at the cabinet we have a long discussion respect the regency question aberdeen start the objection that the propose measure be destructive of the principle that the king could not die on the other hand it be contend that we maintain that principle we make a regent for _ a king _ we acknowledge _ a king _ but we defer take the oath of allegiance till we know who he be the difficulty attend the _ unkinging _ of a sovereign on the birth of a prince nearer to the present king seem greater than any attend the measure propose it be ultimately determine that the chancellor should consult the judge and the law officer _ October 23 _ cabinet twenty-six magistrate at canterbury sentence to three day ' imprisonment threshing machine breaker who plead guilty such have be the terror strike into they sir e knatchbull be in the chair we go through the speech -- not decide absolutely upon the word but generally upon the substance then arise a conversation as to the regency which in this last hour be think a point of importance the chancellor seem alarmed and unwilling to move the suspension of the rights of the presumptive heir until the non - existence of a heir apparent be ascertain without the opinion of the judge it be admit there be no written opinion to guide we the analogy of property be in favor of the heir presumptive that of peerage in favor of the heir apparent _ in utero _ _ October 24 _ cabinet at 4 read two letter from hardinge by he account all the man of property will support the government and the union the press be come round -- _ buy _ a mr conway a able writer be furious against o'connell and upon the whole the press be on we side hardinge dilate with delight upon he military preparation and plan of defense and seemingly will be disappoint if he can not put they into execution the belgian minister resign after the prince of orange 's proclamation he be leave without adviser he have endeavor to get sir charle bagot to join he and grasioff he send for cartwright he seem much embarrassed in fact he be in heart a belgian and would sacrifice everything to be king of belgium he never know the dutch and not unnaturally like the belgian better they be indignant at he conduct in holland and with reason he seem to intend to rule the dutch by means of the belgian this he can not do the duke of wellington always think he a silly fellow the provisional government be go to send some mission here we have a long talk about the regency really it do we little credit to begin now within ten day of the meeting of parliament to consider that question seriously the chief justice will be ask whether suppose the queen to be pregnant at the death of the king the next living heir would succeed how in the event of the birth of a child the _ de facto _ sovereign be to be put aside and what should be do if the queen only may be with child the difficulty consist in the oath of allegiance which must be alter and make conditional but what a curious position the queen victorium would be place in if a baby be to oust she after eight month of reign i think the course adopt will be this -- to make a oath of allegiance conditional save the rights of a child to be bear to appoint the regent who would be name for the princess victorium with the provision that on the birth of a child the child 's mother shall be regent _ October 25 _ cabinet at 4 peel read letter he have receive from mr foster the magistrate of manchester mr hulton of hulton and a manufacturer whose name i forget they all give a alarming account of the state of manchester the collier have turn out in some district and where they have turn out the mill be necessarily stop this have throw number out of employment these collier can earn 10_s _ a day that be as much as many clergyman the spinner can earn 5_s _ a day yet they turn out this seem to be a maneuver like that of lafitte when he refuse to discount bill to stop the supply of coal be to throw all mill out of work and every one out of employment the question be shall the master resist if they do there will be a early collision if they do not they may defer it but not long concession be counsel six week ago on the ground that after the event in belgium and in france collision be dangerous and this even by bold man it seem there be 3000 infantry 3 gun and about 600 or 800 cavalry near manchester perhaps some howitzer may be send but more force there be not peel at the cabinet write a letter to mr taylor say that under ordinary circumstance he should have counsel resistance or rather non-concession but now it be a doubtful question whether a collision at manchester would not lead to collision in many other place and be we force sufficient he be desire to see mr hulton sir e bouverie and other and to consider what could be do particularly whether volunteer corps could be form the delegate who go to mr chappell seem to be amenable to the law and get-at-able this will be do the law officer come in and be ask as to the power of the crown to permit the formation of volunteer corps they be desire to consider the point by the act of 1794 there seem to be no doubt about it hardinge be arrive he have be call out o'connell i be sorry for it for o'connell have declare he would not fight o'connell have call he the duke 's aide-de-camp so far it do good that it lower o'connell still more and destroy the value of anything he might say against hardinge _ October 26 _ call on hardinge he say the account from manchester to-day be worse in the house lord hill show I a letter -lrb- from sir e bouverie i think -rrb- give a very alarming account -- 30000 out of work and apprehension of early collision parliament open take the oath office lord dalhousie be so ill on June 4 that i have no idea of he be now commander-in-chief in indium receive a summons to a cabinet at four _ precisely _ and go to the foreign office but nobody come i think it must have be summon to meet at peel 's house the time be so critical that i should be sorry to lose a cabinet i could not find out that any summons have be send from the foreign office there be a crowd of people in down street who have i dare say follow the duke from the house of lord there be a good many about the house all quite quiet _ October 27 _ _ levée _ at two address from the church of scotland and the lord mayor and corporation of dublin dr chalmer be with the church of scotland the recorder of dublin mr shaw who be member for dublin make a speech before he read the address -- a thing quite unprecedented and which might be very inconvenient the speech itself be innocent the _ levée _ by no means full peel have a audience of the king and in half a hour the king sleep twenty minute he say he never know any man so much alter in three month he somnolency increase he sleep during a interview with aberdeen yesterday when the duke see he he be alive enough cabinet prince at the chancellor 's some conversation respect the burning in kent peel think they be effect by a chemical process by some substance deposit hour before and ignite when the perpetrator be far off the person who meet lord winchilsea express detestation of the burning and go away to break threshing machine but a man who commit person for break threshing machine have he rick burnt another suffer the same thing who defend he threshing machine i believe the two offence to be commit by the same person the magistrate be supine and terror-struck but they have no police no military sir e knatchbull doubt whether they would arm as yeoman peel do not seem to I to view with sufficient alarm the effect these burning will produce upon man 's mind and the example of impunity nothing be say about manchester all seem to think less seriously of we danger than they do some day back the law officer mean to give in they report on the case put to they to - morrow they will say it be not provide for the chancellor have the judge at dinner on Friday and he will then obtain theirs _ October 28 _ captain harvey of the 4th dragoon call by the king 's desire to say the king of persium tell he when he be at teheran that he be hurt at not receive a letter from the king i tell captain harvey the king have announce he accession to the shah of persium as he have to other sovereign captain harvey be interpreter to he regiment it seem to I that he rather wish to command the persian troops he be brother to the tutor to prince george of cambridge he be a very gentlemanlike man the french insist on have the conference respect the settlement of belgium at paris if there be to be any regular conference they can not permit talleyrand to act for they the french would be jealous of he & c we have wish to have the conference here for the very reason that we think talleyrand would do he utmost to have the credit of preserve peace i see there will be no congress the french think that if they stand still the fruit will fall into they mouth the folly of the prince of orange will ruin he party in belgium the ambition of the belgian will induce they to attempt to form a separate state which after much disorder will be find impracticable and as they will not become dutch they _ will _ become french then we shall have a war and present forbearance only postpone it all the volunteer who be act in belgium be french all the force in the field be command by frenchman french money be employ the french be really now carry on the war covertly russium be paralyse by the devastating progress of the cholera morbus which have reach moscow the emperor be go to moscow to establish order and obedience for the civil and military authority be quarrel and the troops be unwilling to form the cordon all cordon i believe to be fruitless it would be as wise to form a cordon against the wind the disease advance however along the high road and navigable river it be the most extraordinary plague we have have prussium can not act for fear of disorder at home and austrium be literally the only power to which war be possible the french dare not go to war for fear of a republic it seem the french ministry will be partially change the due de broglie and guizot go out the due de broglie seem to be a pedantic coxcomb i pity the king of the netherland who be a good man to be hate by two - third of he subject betray by he foolish son and abandon as he think by he ally must be great trial to he while although the dutch adore he and really love he they will not give he money and i have a little doubt whether they will fight much probably however the fear of pillage will make they do that for themselves read a very well-written pamphlet in reply to brougham 's two i suspect the writer be philpott it be too powerful for a ordinary man and far beyond croker neither be it in he style brougham have make ridgway put forth a letter state that he never communicate upon the subject of the pamphlet with brougham -- which be no denial that it be brougham 's it be a good and useful pamphlet and will teach the whig good manners by show they they can not commit aggression with impunity there be no part much better do than that in which the falsehood and absurdity be show of what be say in the brougham pamphlet respect I to be sure my champion have a good case what be say about I rather lead I to think lord durham or t moore have a hand in it _ October 29 _ the letter from manchester recommend resistance on the part of the master -- that be non-concession this will put the collier to the necessity of adopt _ force _ and in the defense of property we should commence the contest which can only be defer with great advantage mr foster think the view of the union have be shake by the increase of force near manchester and that although there might be much disturbance the event would not be doubtful one committee of the union have propose acquiescence in the master ' term the account from kent be bad peel have offer to send down a magistrate and police officer and to go to any expense he be to receive mr hammond plumptree lord camden and other to-day poor lord camden in the meantime have the lumbago _ October 30 _ cabinet a very bad account of manchester no means of raise volunteer corps little hope of unite the master the operative triumphant no disposition however on they part to come to blow and a confidence on the part of the magistrate that a fight would be in they favor but then they must have _ troops _ keep all they have and get more if possible mr taylor recommend that constable should have the power of arrest _ picketer _ without warrant go through the speech it will do very well now speak to the duke about indian finance and tell he the result he wish to see all the papers which be not yet quite ready in the meantime nothing be to be do and we be to appoint the committee the attorney and solicitor-general deprecate the prosecution of a libel transmit for they opinion and say they think it unadvisable to prosecute without the sanction of parliament what this mean i do not know unless it mean that they be cow there be a infamous article in the _ time _ to-day against the conduct of the farmer and country gentleman and there be worse in the _ morning chronicle _ have some conversation after dinner at st jame 's with frankland lewi he long for the grant i tell he it would not do and what sort of a man charle grant be frankland lewi do not seem to like he office but he say he shall bring it into order if he remain there and make it a privy councillor 's office without drudgery he and indeed all seem to wish they be better and more boldly lead in the house of common all we want be that _ October 31 _ cabinet on Monday the 25th the prince of orange left antwerp he embark and intend to go to see he father and then to come to england on the 26th general mellinot march in and go on to breda with 5000 man on the 27th -lrb- there have be a parley on the 26th -rrb- the populace

this be render necessary by a intended meeting on penenden heath to-morrow march the solicitor of the treasury be go down there be much conversation about the state of the press and a resolution take to prosecute notwithstanding the unwillingness of the law officer scarlet appear to be quite cow by opposition and the press this press may be buy but we have no money five-sixth of the foreign secret service money be preoccupy by permanent old charge -- the secret service money of the treasury be preoccupy in the same way there be a small sum of droit which may be turn over to the privy purse and then by the king to the government but it be not more than 3000 # it be think that perhaps some of the pension on the secret service money of the treasury may be turn over to the foreign office the treasury money be the only money applicable to the purchase of newspaper we twaddle a great deal over the speech it be propose by peel to insert a paragraph refer to the disturbed state of the country he will write it and we shall consider it in a cabinet at st jame 's to-morrow at one before the council lord bathurst be more alarmed than any one but peel be a good deal alarm too there be _ danger _ for there be many to attack and few ready to risk anything in defense it be otherwise in 1793 the duke think that with every disposition to do mischief there be no conspiracy or we should have hear of it _ November 1 _ cabinet at st jame 's at one the lord-lieutenant have prohibit by proclamation the meeting of the volunteer society very properly and consistently it be a much more dangerous society than the other he be a firm man not to be turn from the course he think right o'connell have not be speak to in the club he have enter at brooke 's they turn they back upon he there be no meeting at maidstone probably they have intimation of the movement of troops lord beresford tell I there be 3000 artilleryman at woolwich enough to serve gun for a army go through the speech again aberdeen be the most obstinate man i ever see about the mere _ word _ of he part of the speech we lose half a hour at least in talk about word to-day peel read he conclude sentence which be very good he lament the outrage and the attempt to disturb the concord between portion of the empire whose union be essential to they mutual strength and happiness declare the king 's determination to exert the power confide to he by the law and the constitution for the punishment of sedition and end by express a firm reliance on the loyalty of the great body of the people as far as i could judge by the king 's countenance when the speech be read he acquiesce and think it right but be pained at be oblige to hold such language i have prepare a paragraph to be use in case it have be think right to say anything about indium for my own part i think it better not we could not produce a measure this year and it would hardly be fair by the court to declare to parliament that we think the monopoly must be put a end to without have previously acquaint they with we determination the duke say he have see nothing yet to satisfy he that the revenue of indium could meet the expenditure without the china trade i think he reluctance increase to put a end to the present system my disposition to terminate the existence of the company increase the more i see of they _ November 2 _ house at five lord bute make a very long heavy speech lord monson a very little one not bad the stuff would do but he have neither stature nor voice we then have lord winchilsea lord camden duke of leinster and lord farnham lord winchilsea right in tone but desire inquiry into agricultural distress this too be the burden of a mouthy speech make by the duke of richmond whom i have nearly forget lord farnham speak as he always do well he deprecate the dissolution of the union but desire relief for ireland this too be desire by the duke of leinster who speak very firmly as all do against agitator lord gray say it be a moment of great _ danger _ and _ importance _ fortitude caution and wisdom be require he speak strongly against the dissolution of the union and against the disturber of the public peace everywhere he use the word of the speech _ grief _ and _ indignation _ he join in the determination to put down sedition by law rejoice no new law be ask for approve of the prompt recognition of king loui philippe lament the _ necessity _ of the french revolution say ` all revolution be in themselves evil ' although they might produce eventual good express he hope for the honor of france and for the interest of liberty that they would not sully a revolution hitherto unstained by a single act of vengeance this part of he speech be very well word and speak he object to the term in which the passage respect the netherland be word as seem to cast all the blame upon the belgian and so to make we mediation less effectual he likewise object to the make the portuguese amnesty a seeming condition of the recognition of miguel of the recognition itself he do not complain as he have so long be king _ de facto _ these objection be fair lord farnham have suggest the necessity of prepare for war lord gray say the preparation should be by gain the heart of we own people -- and he advocate but very temperately reform he do not however allow that there be any abstract right to a particular mode of constitute a legislature the right of the people be to a _ good government _ and to whatever form of legislative assembly might seem best to secure that government he speech be good and temperate as well as firm the duke of wellington follow he he declare he intention to oppose reform he say we be not bind to interfere for the maintenance of the amnesty further than by advice and remonstrance not by war i should mention that lord gray seem please by the abandonment of the droit he be not very well and at time be almost unable to proceed upon the whole the tone of the debate be very good and will do good _ November 3 _ office at eleven to see col houston upon the whole the debate in the common be satisfactory peel be very much cheer o'connell speak well and be hear in perfect silence brougham make a ordinary speech theme a bad one violent there be much row in the street yesterday but all occasion by attack upon the police and attempt to rescue pickpocket the guard be call out rather hastily colonel rowan who command the police have beg they may be leave to themselves they be quite strong enough cabinet dinner at lord rosslyn 's no house of common people there the prince of orange be come he have write to the king and be to see he to - morrow it seem there be 7500 man in the citadel of antwerp which can only hold 2000 and have provision only for two month the fort of lillo and liefkenshoek be ill-garrisoned so be breda and so be bergen-op-zoom the dutch have not 4000 man in the field near breda the question be whether the evacuation of the citadel of antwerp would not be advisable for the purpose of get out the 7500 man it seem that if flushing be hold the scheld be of no use the conference respect belgian affair meet to-morrow talleyrand be sole representative of france the first object will be to establish a armistice after dinner we have some conversation respect the debate in the common of last night peel be disgust at not be support by the three cabinet minister present who know the whole subject which have be so often discuss in cabinet -- yet not one of they rise to answer brougham the duke be very angry with they and say he shall take a opportunity of advise peel in they presence never to rise till brougham have speak let other be abuse as they may if the three mute will not speak it be clear they will not remain in very long i consider a debate to be a battle in which the chief should be able to put every man into the fight as he would every battalion with a view to the ultimate object he himself be the reserve _ November 4 _ it seem sir g murray do speak last night but he go further than he intend on reform and so rather damage we position as a government office see mr sullivan he seem a sensible liberal man he evidence would be a death-blow to the government of the company he say the cotton of coimbatore be carry to tinnevelly and thence to madras by country boat where it be take up by the china ship it might be send directly to the sea on the malabar coast the distance be 300 mile there be no obstruction to the cultivation the country be under a ryotwar settlement the unequal demand of the company be very injurious they great demand at some period encourage cultivation and raise price exorbitantly -- the next year there be no demand at all they now purchase by contract the contract be too large for the native merchant and fall as job into the hand of european sufficient notice be not give of the contract the native merchant have from one lac to one and a half great injury be sustain by the tobacco monopoly the company 's officer sell it as retailer the government be as i always think practically in the hand of the native they require european co-operation but if they combine against they european superior he can do nothing house at five lord winchilsea make a violent tirade against the administration without any motion before the house the duke make a few observation on the point of order very quietly and we rise _ November 5 _ st jame 's at half-past one the clergy of the province of canterbury be there with they address on the accession they be not expect and there be no gentleman pensioner however they deliver they address to the king on the throne and a very good address it be peel have to write the answer in a hurry recorder 's report one man leave for execution for a street robbery accompany with violence the recorder give but a bad account of the disposition of the city the chancellor seem a good deal alarmed and so do peel every precaution be take but i can not help fear there be a conspiracy of which we know nothing aberdeen suspect connection with france we be to inquire into the circumstance of the fire in normandy which seem very much to resemble ours we have have one near godstone and another at fair-lawn in kent the sufferer unoffend person the object seem to be to spread general terror it be clear that they be effect by the discharge of some chemical preparation which ignite after a time no watching have any effect fire take place where no one have approach goulburn tell I he think sir g murray have say much more than he intend purely from want of habit of speak still he have do much injury the new french ministry be form and lafitte be at its head he pretend to have the same view as the late ministry but it be impossible to suppose the french can resist the offer of belgium we shall have no war if we can preserve internal peace and the integrity of the constitution _ November 6 _ a letter from hardinge who seem to think we stand ill not for want of number but of speaker astell tell I the duke 's declaration against reform have injure he in the city see wortley and have a long conversation with he respect the state of the government he think we can not go on the duke 's declaration against reform have make it impossible for any to join he and upon the question of reform it be doubtful if we should have number enough we talk over possible government on the supposition that lord gray be at the head and that peel remain in in walk away i be overtake in down street by lord graham who have be wait to speak to I on the same subject he seem to think we fall not so immediately necessary as wortley do i then call on hardinge who have be with the duke this morning hardinge have candidly tell the duke that if he have a minority on reform or a small majority he would advise he to resign and previously to tell the king in what a situation he stand if he have a good majority he might perhaps get some to join but if not the position of the government would be as bad in February or worse than it be now the duke say he think thing might do still he have a number of young man who depend upon he he would take care to give the king timely notice the king have behave very well to he indeed i know the duke feel very strongly how admirably and how kindly the king have behave lord maryborough have be to hardinge to express he fear for the duke 's life and the duke have receive many letter inform he there be a conspiracy to assassinate he on Tuesday as he go to guildhall hardinge say every precaution should be take but he beg lord maryborough not to tell the duke he apprehension hardinge however have the same and fear there may be a attempt that day to make london a scene of barricade like pari and brussels troops will be dispose at interval in body of half battalion with provision and there will be 1000 cavalry two gun will be ready with the marine at the obelisk and two in the park hardinge observe to the duke that he know he have bolt inside to the door of the carnage and add ' i shall take pocket pistol ' the duke say ` oh i shall have pistol in the carriage ' hardinge ask the duke to take he which he do arbuthnot go with the duke too i wish i could manage to follow he in my carriage i shall buy a brace of double - barrel pocket pistol on Monday hardinge show I he the duke have make himself very obnoxious by declare he resolution to oppose reform which in fact however he do not do in such term as have be say hardinge tell I there be a proposal to palmerston and other in the summer and they at once start the difficulty of reform which put a end to the negotiation if i think reform would tranquillise the country i should be quite satisfied with a change of minister which would produce internal contentment but that i do not expect i shall take care to have record in the office to show the line i be prepare to take on the east indian monopoly and the step already take i shall likewise leave a memorandum upon the alteration i propose in the army _ November 7 Sunday _ all the morning occupy with a letter on the salt question at half-past two ride to the cabinet robin the cabinet be to meet at three we do not however all assemble till four the duke have be with peel at the home office before the duke come we have all be talk of the lord mayor 's day and the manner in which we should go into the city and return and the precaution take against riot the duke and peel come together and it be evident from the first word the duke speak that he and peel have make up they mind to put off the king 's visit to the city the chancellor seem almost to take fire at the idea of this but the duke very quietly beg he to hear the letter before he decide the duke then read various letter he have receive all warn he against go as there be a plot to assassinate he and raise a tumult one of they be from pearson a radical attorney there be one from a coachmaker say he be satisfy from what he man tell he there be such a design and offer to come with eighteen of he people and guard the duke there be another offer in a letter not read to the same effect there be a examination of a man who serve a radical printer and who formerly live with cobbett which show the intention to exist of attack the duke the impression seem to be general that the attempt would be make there be a letter from the lord mayor elect -lrb- alderman key -rrb- to the duke tell he there be a intention amongst disaffected person to excite tumult and confusion and to attack he that he could not be in safety without a guard and a strong one and that if a attack be make _ in one quarter _ the civil force would not be sufficient the duke say he would not go peel who have receive many letter inform he of the intention to assassinate he say if he go he would go privately and come away privately he observe that if we force the disposition of which be mention and be admirable succeed in put down a riot along the line of the procession he could not answer for the security of life or property in other part of the town we have information that the duke 's house would be attack while he be in the city and it be to be fear that fire might take place to exercise terror and create a diversion the feeling in the duke 's mind be that we should not be justify in give a occasion for the shed of blood by means of a crowd of we own make the consequence of the collision would be incalculable and might affect all part of england the consequence of put off the king 's visit be not lose sight of the effect it would produce on the fund and on public confidence -- all that would be say against the government as weigh down the king by its unpopularity the letter it be propose to send be write and the duke and peel go with it to the king at a little before seven while they be go the feeling of the cabinet undergo a change lord bathurst first observe that it would put a end to the government and carry reform the chancellor be most unwilling to postpone the king 's visit it would be say we do it for we sake only and sacrifice he lord bathurst think the king would take the advice but be very angry and get rid of we there would be a violent storm in parliament and the mob would come to we house all these feeling rest upon the supposition that the procession could return without a tumult but the letter have be write on the supposition _ that it could not _ which be the correct one the duke and peel come back and tell we the king have think the advice quite right and have behave as well as possible the tear be in he eye while the lord mayor 's letter be read he say he have already determine in he own mind to bring the duke and peel back in he own carriage the duke think the king have rather expect the advice and that he mind be relieve by it we know the queen be much alarmed but it have be say that the king would not hear of there be any danger the account of the king 's manner of receive the advice seem to tranquillise those who have before be dissatisfy with the resolution which have be come to we then go to the home office where we find alderman thompson mr oldham -lrb- the chairman of the entertainment committee -rrb- lord hill lord f somerset sir w gordon general macdonald and mr phillip there be two city man i do not know the duke tell they the course we have determine to adopt alderman thompson say he anticipate the decision -- that it could not be announce in more proper term there would be disappointment undoubtedly but he think people in general would be satisfy with the reason he be almost in tear and indeed all be much affect -- the _ cause _ of the measure be the apprehend danger to the duke just as the letter be go off alderman thompson observe that although he have no doubt the letter from the lord mayor elect be write by he authority as it be in a handwriting in which a letter have be receive from he by the entertainment committee yet it be not in the lord mayor elect 's handwriting nor be it dated or sign by he as the other letter be it be immediately determine that it must be ascertain whether the lord mayor elect have authorise the send of the letter before peel 's letter to the lord mayor be deliver many begin to think there be a hoax and certainly the forgery of one letter would have throw suspicion upon all the rest we be to meet at half-past ten in go down at half-past ten i call upon hardinge who be in he dressing-gown he servant go to bed he do not seem at all surprised go on to the cabinet room find every word of the letter be in the lord mayor elect 's own handwriting mr phillip sir r binnie and col rowan come in and lord f somerset and sir w gordon the artilleryman and marine of whom there be to have be 500 with two gun at the obelisk be not to be move up all the other troops be to remain and every precaution to be take as a attempt to create disturbance may be expect on Tuesday after we have dispose of this matter we speak a little of civil list and regency notice be to be give to-morrow of the two bill _ as if we be still a government _ but i now think nothing but general alarm can enable we to weather the question of reform _ November 8 _ the letter to the lord mayor be in the _ time _ and the measure be temperately approve of at the same time the result of the conference on the affair of belgium be announce -- namely the declaration that there must be a armistice this will i trust give more solid expectation of peace than man have entertain since the king 's speech the opening of the west indium port to american ship be likewise announce both the measure be well-timed ride down to the horse guard overtake by the duke who say he hear that people be delighted with the measure of postpone the king 's visit to the city however whether they _ would say so _ be another thing he speak with much feeling of the king 's kindness he say he have behave as well as possible some boy hoot but in general people take off they hat dodd the coachmaker tell I the people in he neighborhood be almost all well-disposed there be very few radical colonel jone have tell he he could get very few people to attend he meeting and none who be respectable meet hardinge he consider it to be the end of the government we meet lord hill who lament the measure but conclude it be necessary go to the office where i see wortley he think it a sad business and fatal to the government he say london have be full of report yesterday wynne be talk of for the indium board hardinge 's idea -lrb- as well as the report -rrb- be that leach would be chancellor and brougham master of the roll all the world be much amuse by the chancellor 's give a dinner to lord gray brougham lord lansdowne and other they themselves must have be much amuse and the chancellor 's not get to dinner till a quarter past eight and go away at a quarter-past ten must have satisfy they that something be in the wind desire jone to make out the appointment of leach 's son to a clerkship immediately and sign it in the course of the evening house at five it be very full every whig who be above ground and some who be half under it be present after a hour of talk about everything but the only thing man be think of the duke of richmond out with it in a offensive manner and he be the last man who should have do so the duke make he explanation very well lord gray afterwards speak in a very bad temper with personal civility however to the duke the duke reply which prevent my speaking at all lord gray have speak ` of measure tend to bring this country into the situation in which france be the time of the late revolution ' word which should have be take up but the duke 's rise after he prevent it upon the whole i think the measure be consider right and people be very glad indeed the danger be no longer hang over they head i hear that in the common peel do admirably and that he be cheer by the whole house when a colonel davy _ sneer _ at the letter from the lord mayor to the duke brougham make as mischievous a speech as he could the chancellor give notice of the regency bill for Friday i do not think we friend see we danger and they will never forgive we if we go out of office without absolute necessity _ November 9 _ look into the salt question in the morning cabinet at two there be last night a meeting at the rotunda about 2000 people within and 3000 or 4000 without about half-past ten they disperse and from 200 to 600 run down to westminster

blackfriar road to the rotunda there will be about 300 or 400 new police there i suggest to chamber the have a boat ready to take a note to the horse guard as he messenger might be impede in the street person be flock in from brixton and deptford and by the kentish road mr chamber represent the mob as very cowardly there be two shorthand writer at the rotunda the speech be not very seditious the _ time _ be turn against we and i hear the press be worse than it be -- none of the newspaper fight we measure well after the duke be go there be a little say about reform many defection announce -- the stafford young hope lord talbot the clive very unwilling to vote against it think the public feeling so strong i suggest that neither the duke nor peel have go further than to say that no proposition have yet be make which seem to they to be safe and that we might perhaps agree to a committee to inquire into the state of the representation and afterwards defeat the specific measure peel say he think the term of the motion do not signify it be ` reform or no reform ' he never would undertake the question of reform lord bathurst of course be against I and generally they be but they have before my suggestion say ` have we not better then consider what we shall do ' afterwards they say nothing peel and the duke both think the measure generally approve and peel be satisfy with the house of common goulburn on the other hand think the general feeling be against we house nothing say there be a crowd at the door and much hooting i have to drive my horse through it while we be in the house the mob be remove by the police not know this clanwilliam and i come home in the duke 's carriage there be no mob till we pass bridge street where there be a good many people who recognize the carriage and follow it hooting they run into down street and we pass on through the horse guard i be glad to find a grenadier at the duke 's clanwilliam say he have ten or twelve there alter the bill respect the fee of officer in the superior court and send it with a letter to lawford appoint eleven on Thursday for see he at the office _ November 10 _ office write a placard and show it to peel who will have it print the tide be turn carlisle begin to abuse the duke last night and find it would not do some cry out ` he gain the battle of waterloo ' and carlisle be oblige to begin to praise he he then try to abuse the new police but that would not do and he be oblige to praise they too there be a good deal of rioting in different part of the town the city police be inefficient and at temple bar rascal be master for some time the new police however give they a terrible lick opposite southampton street and not far from northumberland house they get lick too in piccadilly -- and the whole be put down by the civil power the military be so arrange that have they be call for they would have envelop the rioter the thing may be consider as nearly put down and the government strengthen by it the fund have rise to-day and be as high as before the postponement of the king 's visit -- indeed higher so much for lord clanricarde 's speech cabinet dinner at the duke 's the king be anxious about the duration of he government he would concede on the subject of reform although he be against it peel tell he he think that by oppose all reform in the first instance the government would be able to make better term afterwards the king say either course have its convenience and inconvenience he do not decide between they but he evidently incline to concession it seem the queen _ now _ declare herself much disappointed at not go to guildhall and the fitzclarence family be turn against the government wish as the duke say to be duke and duchess which be impossible on Tuesday night 4000 troops could have be collect in st jame 's park in ten minute there be 2000 police near whitehall as a grand reserve the lord mayor write to peel acknowledge the total inefficiency of the city police the contrast between the city and westminster be most striking the press be turn against we like cat they be leave the fall house in the house of common this evening there be a almost unanimous shout when peel admit that the new bishop of exeter be to hold the living of stanhope _ in commendam _ it seem all unite upon that question which be a unlucky one although the interference of parliament be quite irregular there be much talk about the regency question after dinner and i leave they talk still at half-past eleven on Friday the chancellor should open the question to the house and we be not prepared have call parliament together for this specific purpose we have neglect the press too much the duke rely upon the support of ` respectable people ' and despise the rabble but the rabble read newspaper and gradually carry along with they the ` respectable people ' they outnumber i do not think the be out of office for a session would be of any ultimate disadvantage to I i be sure i should enjoy better health and i should have much more to do in the house i should be enable to regain my proper place _ November 11 _ office see wortley he say the spirit of we friend be improve and those of we foe lower the few last day as to reform cabinet at two a fire at melton-constable the country round battle and hawkhurst almost in insurrection troops send there the account

the postponement of the dinner and tranquil house the duke of buckingham tell I they have form they government and expect to be in in a week they think the duke will resign after Tuesday lord gray to be foreign secretary the duke of richmond to be first lord of the treasury palmerston and grant secretary of state lansdowne president the government to be as tory as possible the chancellor to remain lothian tell I all the best old friend of the government be against philpott i tell he the reason why parliament should not interfere with which he be satisfied and be sorry he have not hear they before lord camden speak to I on the same subject i wish we could get rid of philpott he will damage we more than reform the fund have rise to 84 3\/4 that be 7 1\/2 per cent in three day i believe this be the consequence not only of the broken head but of the idea that the duke will be firm and not run away we have a two hour ' talk about agriculture the duke acquiesce in a motion of salisbury 's for a committee on the poor law _ November 12 _ write a note to hardinge suggest to he the expediency of call upon dr philpott and place before he the hopelessness of he keep stanhope the damage to himself of a vote of parliament and to the church from the example of parliamentary interference lead he to propose the exchange of stanhope for a living near exeter and i mention dr barne if this could be manage we should turn evil into good and avoid the division we must lose the fund rise to 853\/4 and then fall to 84 3\/4 be still a rise in the city they think the government will stand there have be threaten notice as near as colnbrook in sussex and kent thing be very bad i do not however see peel to-day there be nothing in the house _ November 13 _ it seem peel and scarlet lick brougham well yesterday the temper of the house be say to have be rather good hardinge tell I goulburn make a indifferent speech philpott have so good a case that he look confidently to the result of the debate we agree that there be no reason-why the _ congé d'élire _ should not issue philpott himself decide that it should happen what may as to stanhope we have some talk as to the division on the civil list peel be for refuse a committee and the separation of the diplomatic expenditure and will not yield because he be weak i think he be right the better face we put upon it the more vote we shall have hardinge suggest the placing of doherty in arbuthnot 's office nothing could be better than that arrangement but he think and i think the duke would not displace arbuthnot arbuthnot know more about my office than any one else where would they put I we have some conversation respect the regency it be determine to legislate as _ little _ as we could _ November 14 _ cabinet at four peel be of opinion that the fire be in many case perpetrate for stock-jobbing purpose they be certainly do by person from london he say he be satisfy that whatever might be the division on reform the question be carry admiral sotheron lindsay he think -lrb- blank -rrb- and i think he mention another vote for it if the county member do and it be throw out by the representative of scotch and english borough it be impossible to stand much longer he read a paper circulate for signature in the parish of st ann in which the subscriber declare they readiness to be swear in as special constable and they determination to protect property at the same time they declare they opinion that there ought to be a reform first in the house of common but of church and state this he consider the commencement of a burgher guard i can not understand he reasoning if he think reform must be carry surely it be better to vote a general resolution and to fight the detail by object to the general resolution we shall probably be turn out and have much less power to do good out of office than if we be in it seem to I that obstinacy and the fear of be again accuse of rat lead to this determination to resist when resistance be in he own opinion fruitless clive whom i see to-day be for a modify reform but he will vote for we in order to keep the duke in we have a long conversation about the regency and agree upon the substance and form of the bill aberdeen want again to open the whole question on which he have no fixed opinion he have come round entirely first he think the right be in the presumptive heir now he think it must be in the child _ in utero _ it appear certain that at carlisle the 9th be look to as the day of signal to they and to all england it seem the plan be to attack the guildhall and massacre all in it there would have be a smash but a most signal defeat for there would have be 250 cavalry and from 700 to 800 volunteer there -lrb- the east indium volunteer and the artillery company -rrb- besides a battalion within reach sir claudius hunter have publish in the _ Sunday time _ a denial of the speech attribute to he and a statement of the city force they ordinary force be fifty-four man with volunteer artillery company picket man fireman lumber troop & c they would have have about 2250 _ November 15 _ house a very temperate speech of lord durham and a very good one of lord suffield respect the new police lord bathurst observe to I they speak as if they expect to come in i mention salisbury 's motion for a committee which be to be make on Monday next and lord bathurst say ` shall we be alive then ' he have a serious apprehension of be out the chancellor make a most excellent speech in move the first reading of the regency bill and be cheer on both side of the house it seem as if the measure would be unanimously approve lord eldon seem to say he should advise the duke of cumberland to acquiesce in it the ultra tory be to have a meeting to-day -- thirty-eight of they -- to decide what they should do about reform yesterday the report be they join we but the duke of richmond will do all he can to make they go against we and if they do i suppose we shall be oblige to make we bow _ November 16 _ goulburn oppose the submit the civil list account to a committee and be defeat we have 204 to 233 majority against we 29 hobhouse ask peel whether minister would resign to which he get no answer brougham rise and say minister would have time for consideration i suppose this division must be consider to be fatal to we henry be go off to take chamber he mean to apply himself to the law he be rather in a hurry for my own part i be by no means sorry to be out of office i think i shall be better able to regain my proper station in opposition than i could have do in office and the emolument be of no value to I now office see wortley he be glad that the division against we have be upon the civil list rather than upon reform he think we should resign to-day and thus throw upon the whig the burden of bring forward reform as a government measure probably brougham would postpone he motion if we resign at about half-past three i receive a note from sir robert taylor desire my immediate attendance at st jame 's i dress and go and in a few moment be admit to the king i meet lord melville come away the king desire I to sit down and ask I whether i have any expectation of the division of last night i say no -- i think that upon any question connect with the civil list we should have have a majority that the question itself be one of little importance but as the committee have not be grant before sir r peel think it would be a confession of weakness not to oppose it now and i think he be right the king say it be probably choose as a question merely to try strength the king ask I what have take place between the government and the company i tell he majesty and add a outline of the plan i have for the new military arrangement of which he seem highly to approve i then say i suppose i must take leave of he majesty he say in one sense he minister seem to think they could not go on i say i could not but express my sentiment which be i be sure those of all my colleague -- the sentiment of deep gratitude to he majesty for the constant kind and honorable confidence he have place in we he majesty say he think it he duty to give the full support of the crown to he minister he have confidence in those he find at he brother 's demise and since July 26 which be the commencement of we trouble he have regard with admiration that which be most important in they conduct they foreign policy he have a feeling of entire satisfaction with they i say it must likewise be satisfactory to he majesty to feel that he late minister fully aware of the real difficulty of the country would never be lead by any personal or party feeling to do anything which could be _ prejudicial _ to the country and that whatever might be they difference in principle from he new minister they would ever support he majesty 's interest the king be much affect and have the tear in he eye all the time i be speak to he i then rise and kiss he hand and he shake hand with I and wish I good-bye for the present i ask for the _ entrée _ which he give I very good-naturedly as i come away i meet rosslyn go in the three fitzclarence be in the

say as soon as he hear of the division he think the game be up -- that we could not go on the duke go to the king in the morning and tell he it be better he should resign immediately and so force the new government to bring forward they measure of reform it be better for the country the king ask the duke 's opinion of lord gray and whether he have ever have any communication with he the duke say no the king know the personal objection the late king have to lord gray and he could not although often press by lord gray 's friend have any communication with he without either deceive _ he _ or

postpone the question till march when they promise to bring in a bill lord lansdowne be say to be much dissatisfied and the palmerston party think they have not enough offer to they it be evident that
