first edition of the book -- editor _ speech of the prosecute attorney _ m ernest pinard gentleman in enter upon this debate the public attorney be in the presence of a difficulty which he can not ignore it can not be put even in the nature of a condemnation since offens to public moral and to religion be somewhat vague and elastic expression which it would be necessary to define precisely nevertheless when we speak to right-minded practical man we be sure of be sufficiently understand to distinguish whether a certain page of a book carry a attack against religion and moral or not the difficulty be not in arouse a prejudice it be far more in explain the work of which you be to judge it deal entirely with romance if it be a newspaper article which we be bring before you it could be see at once where the fault begin and where it end it would simply be read by the ministry and submit to you for judgment here we be not concern with a newspaper article but entirely with a romance which begin the first of October finish the fifteenth of December and be compose of six number in the _ revue de paris _ 1856 what be to be do in such a case what be the duty of the public ministry to read the whole romance that be impossible on the other hand to read only the incriminate text would expose we to deep reproach they could say to we : if you do not show the case in all its part if you pass over that which precede and that which follow the incriminate passage it be evident that you wish to suppress the debate by restrict the ground of discussion in order to avoid this twofold difficulty there be but one course to follow and that be to relate to you the whole story of the romance without read any of it or point out any incriminate passage then to cite incriminate text and finally to answer the objection that may arise against the general method of indictment what be the title of the romance _ madame bovary _ this title in itself explain nothing there be a second in parenthesis : _ provincial moral and custom _ this be also a title which do not explain the thought of the author but which give some intimation of it the author do not endeavor to follow such or such

one course : to beg she husband 's pardon no to explain the matter to he no for this husband would be generous enough to pardon she and that be a humiliation which she could not accept : she must

these souvenir of voluptuousness which she have leave to he and from that moment he neglect he office he family let go to the wind the last vestige of he patrimony and be find dead one day in the arbor in he garden hold in he hand a long lock of black hair this be the romance i have relate it to you suppress no scene in it it be call _ madame bovary _ you could with justice give it another title and call it _ story of the adultery of a provincial woman _ gentleman the first part of my task be fulfil i have relate i shall now cite and after the citation come the indictment which be bring upon two count : offense against public moral and offense against religious moral the offense against public moral lie in the lascivious picture which i have bring before you eye the offense against religious moral consist in mingle voluptuous image with sacred thing i now come to the citation i will be brief for you will read the entire romance i shall limit myself to cite four scene or rather four tableau the first will be that of the fall with rodolphe the second the religious reaction between the two adultery the third the fall with léon which be the second adultery and finally the fourth the death of madame bovary before raise the curtain on these four picture permit I to inquire what color what stroke of the brush m flaubert employ -- for this romance be a picture and it be necessary to know to what school he belong -- what color he use and what sort of portrait he make of he heroine the general color of the author allow I to tell you be a lascivious color before during and after the fall when she be a child ten or twelve year of age she be at the ursuline convent at this age when the young girl be not form when the woman can not feel those emotion which reveal to she a new world she go to confession : when she go to confession she invent little sin in order that she might stay there longer kneel in the shadow she hand join she face against the grate beneath the whispering of the priest the comparison of betrothed husband celestial lover and eternal marriage that recur in sermon stir within she soul depths of unexpected sweetness be it natural for a little girl to invent small sin since we know that for a child the smallest sin be confess with the greatest difficulty and again at this age when a little girl be not form do it not make what i have call a lascivious picture to show she invent little sin in the shadow under the whispering of the priest recall comparison she have hear about the affianced the celestial lover and eternal marriage which give she a shiver of voluptuousness would you see madame bovary in she lesser act in a free state without a lover and without sin i pass over those word the next day and that bride who leave nothing to be discover which could be divine or find out as the phrase in itself be more than equivocal but we shall see how it be with the husband : the husband of the next day whom one would have take for a old maid the bridegroom of this bride who leave nothing to be discover that could be divine arise and go out he heart full of the felicity of the night with mind tranquil and flesh content go about ruminate upon he happiness like one who be still enjoy after dinner the taste of the truffle he be digest it now remain gentleman to determine upon the literary stamp of m flaubert and upon the stroke of he brush now at the castle vaubyessard do you know what most attract this young woman what strike she most forcibly it be always the same thing -- the duke of laverdiere as a lover -- as they say of marie-antoinette between the messr de coigny and de lauzun emma 's eye turn upon he of they own accord as upon something extraordinary and August he have live at court and sleep in the bed of queen can it be say that this be only a historic parenthesis sad and useless parenthesis history can authorise suspicion but have not the right to establish they as fact history have speak of the necklace in all romance history have speak of a thousand thing but these be only suspicion and i repeat i know not by what authority these suspicion should be establish as fact and since marie-antoinette die with the dignity of a sovereign and the calmness of a christian she life-blood should efface fault of which there be the strongest suspicion m flaubert be in need of a striking example in the painting of he heroine but heaven know why he have take this one to express all at once the perverse instinct and the ambition of madame bovary madame bovary dance very well and here she be waltz : they begin slowly then go more rapidly they turn all around they be turn -- the lamp the furniture the wainscote the floor like a disc on a pivot on pass near the door the bottom of emma 's dress catch against he trousers they leg commingle he look down at she she raise she eye to he a torpor seize she she stop they start again and with a more rapid movement the viscount drag she along disappear with she to the end of the gallery where pant she almost fall and for a moment rest she head upon he breast and then still turn but more slowly he guide she back to she seat she lean back against the wall and cover she eye with she hand i know well that the waltz be more or less like this but that make it no more moral take madame bovary in she most simple act and we have always the same stroke of the brush on every page even justin the neighbouring chemist 's boy undergo some astonishment when he be initiate into the secret of this woman 's toilette he carry he voluptuous admiration as far as the kitchen with he elbow on the long board on which she be iron he greedily watch all these woman 's clothes spread out about he the dimity petticoat the fichus the collar and the drawer with running-string wide at the hip and grow narrower below what be that for ask the young fellow pass he hand over the crinoline or the hook and eye ` why have not you ever see anything ' félicité answer laugh ` as if you mistress madame homais do not wear the same ' the husband also ask in the presence of this fresh-smelling woman whether the odour come from the skin or from the chemise every evening he find a blaze fire he dinner ready easy-chair and a well-dressed woman charming with a odour of freshness though no one could say whence the perfume come or if it be not she skin that make odourous she chemise enough of quotation in detail you know now the physiognomy of madame bovary in repose when she be incite no one when she do not sin when she be still completely innocent and when on she return from a rendezvous she be by the side of she husband whom she detest you know now the general color of the picture the general physiognomy of madame bovary the author have take the greatest care employ all the prestige of he style in paint the portrait of this woman have he try to show she on the side of intelligence never from the side of the heart not at all on the part of mind no from the side of physical beauty not even that oh i know very well that the portrait of madame bovary after the adultery be most brilliant but the picture be above all lascivious the post be voluptuous the beauty a beauty of provocation i come now to the four important quotation i shall make but four i hold to my outline : i have say that the first would be the love for rodolphe the second the religious reaction the third the love for léon the fourth she death here be the first madame bovary be near she fall nearly ready to succumb domestic mediocrity drive she to lewd fancy marriage tenderness to adulterous desire she would have like charle to beat she that she might have a better right to hate he to revenge herself upon he what be it that seduce rodolphe and prepare he the opening of madame bovary 's dress which have burst in place along the seam of the corsage rodolphe take he servant to bovary 's house to bleed he the servant be very ill and madame bovary hold the basin madame bovary take the basin to put it under the table with the movement she make in bend down she skirt -lrb- it be a summer frock with four flounce yellow long in the waist and wide in the skirt -rrb- spread out around she on the flag of the room and as emma stoop stagger a little as she stretch out she arm the stuff here and there give with the inflection of she bust here be rodolphe 's reflection : he again see emma in she room dress as he have see she and he undress she it be the first day they have speak to each other they look at one another a supreme desire make they dry lip tremble and softly without a effort they finger intertwine these be the preliminary of the fall it be necessary to read the fall itself when the habit be ready charle write to monsieur boulanger that he wife be at he command and that they count on he good-nature the next day at noon rodolphe appear at charle 's door with two saddle-horse one have pink rosette at he ear and a deerskin side-saddle rodolphe have put on high soft boot say to himself that no doubt she have never see anything like they in fact emma be charm with he appearance as he stand on the landing in he great velvet coat and white corduroy breeches as soon as he feel the ground emma 's horse set off at a gallop rodolphe gallop by she side here they be in the forest he draw she farther on to a small pool where duckweed make a greenness on the water fade waterlily lay motionless between the reed at the noise of they step in the grass frog jump away to hide themselves ' i be wrong i be wrong ' she say ' i be mad to listen to you ' ` why emma emma ' ` oh rodolphe ' say the young woman slowly lean on he shoulder the cloth of she habit catch against the velvet of he coat she throw back she white neck swell with a sigh and falter in tear with a long shudder and hide she face she give herself up to he then she arise and after shake off the fatigue of voluptuousness return to the domestic hearth to that hearth where she would find a husband who adore she after this first fall after this first adultery this first fault be it a sentiment of remorse that she feel in the presence of this deceive husband who adore she no with a bold front she enter glorify adultery but when she see herself in the glass she wonder at she face never have she eye be so large so black of so profound a depth something subtle about she be transfigure she she repeat ' i have a lover a lover ' delight at the idea as if a second puberty have come to she so at last she be to know those joy of love that fever of happiness of which she have despair she be enter upon marvel where all would be passion ecstasy delirium thus from this first fault this first fall she glorify adultery she sing the song of adultery its poesy and its delight this gentleman to I be much more dangerous and immoral than the fall itself gentleman all pale before this glorification of adultery even the rendezvous at night some time after : to call she rodolphe throw a sprinkle of sand at the shutter she jump up with a start but sometimes he have to wait for charle have a mania for chat by the fireside and he would not stop she be wild with impatience if she eye could have do it she would have hurl he out at the window at last she would begin to undress then take up a book and go on read very quietly as if the book amuse she but charle who be in bed call to she to come too ` come now emma ' he say ` it be time ' ` yes i be come ' she answer then as the candle dazzle he he turn to the wall and fall asleep she escape smile palpitating undressed rodolphe have a large cloak he wrap she in it and put he arm around she waist he draw she without a word to the end of the garden it be in the arbor on the same seat of old stick where formerly léon have look at she so amorously on the summer evening she never think of he now the cold of the night make they clasp closer the sigh of they lip seem to they deeper they eye that they could hardly see larger and in the midst of the silence low word be speak that fall on they soul sonorous crystalline and reverberate in multiply vibration gentleman do you know of language anywhere in the world more expressive have you ever see a more lascivious picture listen further : never have madame bovary be so beautiful as at this period she have that indefinable beauty that result from joy from enthusiasm from success and that be only the harmony of temperament with circumstance she desire she sorrow the experience of pleasure and she ever-young illusion have as soil and rain and wind and the sun make flower grow gradually develop she and she at length blossom forth in all the plentitude of she nature she eyelid seem chisel expressly for she long amorous look in which the pupil disappear while a strong inspiration expand she delicate nostril and raise the fleshy corner of she lip shaded in the light by a little black down one would have think that a artist apt in conception have arrange the curl of hair upon she neck they fall in a thick mass negligently and with the change chance of they adultery that unbound they every day she voice now take more mellow inflection she figure also something subtle and penetrate escape even from the fold of she gown and from the line of she foot charle as when they be first married think she delicious and quite irresistible up to this time this woman 's beauty have consist of she grace she elegance and she clothes finally she be show to you without a veil and you can say whether adultery have embellish she or not ` take I away ' she cry ` carry I off oh i entreat you ' and she throw herself upon he mouth as if to seize there the unexpected consent it breathe forth in a kiss here be a portrait gentleman which m flaubert know well how to draw how the eye of this woman enlarge something ravishing expand around she and then she fall she beauty have never be so brilliant as the next day after she fall and the day follow what the author show you be the poetry of adultery and i ask you again whether these lascivious page do not express a profound immorality i come now to the second situation which be the religious reaction madame bovary be very ill be at death 's door she be bring back to life and she convalescence be make remarkable by a little religious awaken it be at this hour that monsieur bournisien come to see she he inquire after she health give she news exhort she to religion in a coax little gossip that be not without its charm the mere thought of he cassock comfort she finally she go to communion i do not like much to meet these holy thing in a romance but at least when one speak of they he need not travesty they by he language be there in this adulterous woman go to communion anything of the repentant faith of a magdalene no no she be always the same passionate woman seek illusion and seek they even among the most August and holy thing one day when at the height of she illness she have think herself die and have ask for the communion and while they be make the preparation in she room for the sacrament while they be turn the night-table cover with sirup into a altar and while félicité be strew dahlia flower on the floor emma feel some power pass over she that free she from she pain from all perception from all feel she body relieved no longer think another life be begin it seem to she that she being mount toward god would be annihilate in that love like a burning incense that melt into vapor in what tongue do one pray to god in language address to a lover in the outpouring of adultery without doubt they will tell we it be local color and excuse it on the ground that a vapourous romantic woman do nothing even in religion like anybody else there be no local color which can excuse this mixture voluptuous one day religious the next there be no woman even in other country under the sky of spain or italy who murmur to god the adulterous caress which she give she lover you can appreciate this language gentleman and you will not excuse adulterous word be introduce in any way into the sanctuary of the divinity this be the second situation i now come to the third which be a series of adultery after the religious transition madame bovary be again ready to fall she go to the theater at rouen the play be _ lucium di lammermoor _ emma return to she old self ah if in the freshness of she beauty before the pollution of marriage and the disillusion of adultery she could have anchor she life upon some great strong heart then virtue tenderness voluptuousness and duty blending she would never have fall from so high a happiness see lagardy upon the stage she have a desire to run into he arm to take refuge in he strength even as in the incarnation of love and of say to he : take I take I away let we go thine thine with thee be all my ardor and all my dream léon be with the bovary he be stand behind she lean with he shoulder against the wall of the box now and again she feel herself shudder beneath the hot breath from he nostril fall upon she hair you be speak to just now of the pollution of marriage then you be show adultery in all its poesy in its ineffable seduction i have say that the expression should be modify to read : the disillusion of marriage and the pollution of adultery very often when one be marry in the place of happiness without cloud which one promise himself he find but sacrifice and bitterness the word disillusion can then be use justifiably that of pollution never léon and emma have a rendezvous at the cathedral they look around or they do not it make no difference they go out a lad be play about the close ` go and get I a cab ' the child bound off like a ball by the rue quartre-vents then they be alone a few minute face to face and a little embarrassed ` ah léon really -- i do not know -- if i ought ' she whisper then with a more serious air ` do you know it be very improper ' ` how so ' reply the clerk ` it be do at pari ' and that as a irresistible argument decide she we know now gentleman that the fall do not take place in the cab through a scruple which honor he the editor of the _ revue de paris _ have suppress the passage of the fall in the cab but if the _ revue _ lower the blind of the cab it do allow we to penetrate into the room where they find a rendezvous emma wish to leave it because she have give she word that she would return that evening moreover charle expect she and in she heart she feel already that cowardly docility that be for some woman at once the chastisement and atonement of adultery once upon the sidewalk léon continue to walk she follow he as far as the hotel he mount the stair open the door and enter what a embrace word follow each other quickly after the kiss they tell the disappointment of the week they presentiment they fear about the letter but now all be forget and they be face to face with they laugh of voluptuousness and term of endearment the bed be large of mahogany in the shape of a boat the curtain be in red levantine that hang from the ceiling and bulge out too much towards the bell-shaped bed-side and nothing in the world be so lovely as she brown head and white skin stand out against this purple color when with a movement of shame she cross she bare arm hide she face in she hand the warm room with its discreet carpet its gay ornament and its calm light seem make for the intimacy of passion we be tell what happen in that room here be still a passage very important as a piece of lascivious painting : how they love that dear room so full of gaiety despite of its rather fade splendor they always find the furniture in the same place and sometimes hairpin that she have forget the Thursday before under the pedestal of the clock they lunch by the fireside on a little round table inlay with rosewood emma carve put bit on he plate with all sort of coquettish way and she laugh with a sonorous and libertine laugh when the froth of the champagne run over from the glass to the ring on she finger they be so completely lose in the possession of each other that they think themselves in they own house and that they would live there till death like two spouse eternally young they say ` we room ' ` we carpet ' she even say ` my slipper ' a gift of léon 's a whim she have have they be pink satin border with swansdown when she sit on he knee she leg then too short hang in the air and the dainty shoe that have no back to it be hold on only by the toe to she bare foot he for the first time enjoy the inexpressible delicacy of feminine refinement he have never meet this grace of language this reserve of clothing these pose of the weary dive he admire the exaltation of she soul and the lace on she petticoat besides be she not ' a lady ' and a married woman -- a real mistress in fine this gentleman be a description which leave nothing to be desire i hope from the point of view of conviction here be another or rather here be the continuation of the same scene : she use some word which inflamed he with some kiss which draw forth he soul where have she learn these caress almost immaterial so profound and evasive be they oh i well understand gentleman the disgust inspire in she by that husband who wish to embrace she upon she return i comprehend admirably that after a rendezvous of this kind she feel with horror at night that man against she flesh stretch out asleep that be not all for accord to the last tableau that i can not omit she come to be weary of she voluptuousness she be constantly promising herself a profound felicity on she next journey then she confess to herself that she feel nothing extraordinary this disappointment quickly give way to a new hope and emma return to he more inflamed more eager than ever she undress hastily tear off the thin lace of she corset that nestle around she hip like a glide snake she go on tip-toe barefoot to see once more that the door be close then pale serious and without speak with one movement she throw herself upon he breast with a long shudder i notice here two thing gentleman a admirable picture the product of a talented hand but a execrable picture from a moral point of view yes m flaubert know how to embellish he painting with all the resource of art but without the discretion of art with he there be no gauze no veil it be nature in all she nudity in all she crudity still another quotation : they know one another too well for any of those surprise of possession that increase its joy a hundred-fold she be as sick of he as he be weary of she emma find again in adultery all the platitude of marriage the platitude of marriage and the poetry of adultery sometimes it be the pollution of marriage sometimes the platitude but always the poetry of adultery these gentleman be the situation which m flaubert love to paint and which unfortunately he paint only too well i have relate three scene : the scene with rodolphe and you have see the fall in the forest the glorification of adultery and this woman whose beauty become greater with this poesy i have speak of the religious transition and you see there a prayer imprint with adulterous language i have speak of the second fall i have unroll before you the scene which take place with léon i have show you the scene of the cab -- suppress -- and i have show you the picture of the room and the bed now that we believe you conviction be form we come to the last scene -- that of the punishment numerous excision have be make it would appear by the _ revue de paris _ here be the term in which m flaubert complain of it : some consideration which i do not appreciate have lead the _ revue de paris _ to suppress the number of December 1st its scruple be revive on the occasion of the present number it have see fit to cut out still more passage in consequence i wish to deny all responsibility in the line which follow the reader be inform that he see only fragment and not the complete work let we pass then over these fragment and come to the death she poison herself she poison herself why ah it be a very little thing be death she think i be go to fall asleep and all will be finish then without remorse without a avowal without a tear of repentance over this suicide which be bring about by adultery in the night watch she go to receive the sacrament for the die why the sacrament since in she last thought she be go to annihilation why when there be not a tear not a sigh of the magdalene over she crime of infidelity she suicide or she adultery after this scene come that of extreme unction these be holy and sacred word for all it be with these word that we ancestor have fall asleep we father and we relative and it be with they that one day we child will see we sleep when one wish to make use of they it should be do with exactness it be not necessary at least to accompany they with the voluptuous image of a past life you know how the priest make the holy unction upon the forehead the ear upon the mouth the foot pronounce at the same time the liturgical phrase : _ quidquam per pede per aura per pectus _ etc always follow with the word _ misericordium _ sin on one side and pity on the other these holy sacred word should be reproduce exactly and if they can not be reproduce exactly at least nothing voluptuous should be put with they she turn she face slowly and seem fill with joy on see suddenly the violet steal no doubt finding again in the midst of a temporary lull in she pain the lose voluptuousness of she first mystical transport with the vision of eternal beatitude that be begin the priest rise to take the crucifix then she stretch forward she neck as one who be athirst and glue she lip to the body of the man-god she press upon it with all she expire strength the fullest kiss of love that she have ever give then he recite the _ misereatur _ and the _ indulgentiam _ dip he right thumb in the oil and begin to give extreme unction first upon the eye that have so coveted all worldly pomp then upon the nostril that have be greedy of the warm breeze and amorous odour then upon the mouth that have utter lie that have be curl with pride and cry out in lewdness then upon the hand that have delight in sensual touch and finally upon the sole of the foot so swift of yore when she be run to satisfy she desire and that would now walk no more now in the prayer for the die which the priest recite at the end or at the close of each verse occur these word : christian soul go out to a higher region they be murmur at the moment when the last breath of the die escape from he lip the priest recite etc as the death-rattle become stronger the priest pray faster he prayer mingle with the stifled sob of bovary and sometimes all seem lose in the muffle murmur of the latin syllable that toll like a passing-bell after the fashion of alternate these word the author have try to make for they a sort of reply he put upon the sidewalk a blind man who intone a song of which the profane word be a kind of response to the prayer for the die suddenly on the pavement be hear a loud noise of clog and the clattering of a stick and a voice rise -- a raucous voice -- that sing -- ` maid in the warmth of a summer day dream of love and of love alway the wind be strong this summer day she petticoat have fly away ' this be the moment when madame bovary die thus we have here the picture : on one side the priest recite the prayer for the die on the other the hand-organ player who excite from the die woman a atrocious frantic despairing laugh think she see the hideous face of the poor wretch that stand out against the eternal night like a menace she fall back upon the mattress in a convulsion they all draw near she be dead and then later when the body be cold above all should the cadaver which the soul have just leave be respect when the husband be there on he knee weep for he wife when he extend the shroud over she any other would have stop but m flaubert make a final stroke with he brush : the sheet sink in from she breast to she knee and then rise at the tip of she toe this the scene of death i have abridge it and have group it after a fashion it be now for you to judge and determine whether there be a mixture of the sacred and the profane in it or rather a mixture of the sacred and the voluptuous i have relate the romance i have bring a charge against it and permit I to say against the kind of art that m flaubert cultivate the kind that be realistic but not discreet you shall see to what limit he have go a copy of the _ artiste _ lately come to my hand it be not for we to make accusation against the _ artiste _ but to learn to what school m flaubert belong and i ask you permission to read you some line which have nothing to do with m flaubert 's prosecute book only to show to what a degree he excel in this kind of painting he love to paint temptation especially the temptation to which madame bovary succumb well i find a model of its kind in the line to follow from the _ artiste _ for the month of January sign _ gustave flaubert _ upon the temptation of saint anthony heaven know it be a subject upon which many thing might be say but i do not believe it possible to give more vivacity to the image stronger line to the picture apollonius say to saint anthony : -- what be knowledge what be glory wouldst thou refresh thine eye under the humid jasmine wouldst thou feel thy body sink itself as in a wave in the sweet flesh of swoon woman ah well here be the same color the same strength of the brush the same vivacity of expression to resume i have analyze the book i have relate the story without forget a page i have then make the charge which be the second part of my task i have exhibit some of the portrait i have show madame bovary in repose by the side of she husband in contact with those whom she could not tempt and i have point out to you the lascivious color of that portrait then i have analyze some of the great scene : the fall with rodolphe the religious transition the meeting with léon the death scene and in all this i find the double count of offense against public moral and against religion i have need of but two scene : do you not see the moral outrage in the fall with rodolphe do you not see the glorification of adultery in it and then the religious outrage which i find in the drawing of the confession in the religious transition and finally the scene of death you have before you gentleman three guilty one : m flaubert the author of the book m pichat who accept it and m pillet who print it in this matter there be no misdemeanor without publicity and all those concern in the publicity should be equally blame but we hasten to say that the manager of the _ revue _ and the printer be only in the second rank the principal offender be the author m flaubert m flaubert who admonish by a note from the editor protest against the suppression which have be make in he work after he come m laurent pichat from whom you will demand a reason not for the suppression which he have make but of that which he should have make and finally come the printer who be a sentinel at the door of scandal m pillet besides be a honorable man against whom i have nothing to say we ask but one thing of you which be to apply the law to he printer should read when they do not read or have read what they print it be at they own risk and peril printer be not machine they have a privilege they take a oath they be in a special situation and they be responsible again they be if you will permit the expression like a advanced guard if they allow a misdemeanor to pass it be like allow the enemy to pass make the penalty as mild as you will for pillet be as indulgent as you like with the manager of the _ revue _ but as for flaubert the principal culprit it be for he you should reserve you severity my task be accomplish we await the objection on the part of the defense the general objection will be : but after all the romance be moral on the whole for be not adultery punish to this objection there be two reply : i believe that in a hypothetically moral work a moral conclusion can not be reach by the presentation of the lascivious detail we find here and again i say : that the work be not moral at the foundation i say gentleman that lascivious detail can not be cover by a moral conclusion otherwise one could relate all the orgy imaginable describe all the turpitude of a public woman make she die in a charity bed of a hospital it would be allowable to study and depict all the pose of lasciviousness it would be go against all the rule of good sense it would place the poison at the door of all the remedy at the door of few if there be any remedy who be the one to read m flaubert 's romance be they man who be interested in political or social economy no the light page of madame bovary fall into hand still lighter into the hand of young girl sometimes of married woman well when the imagination have be seduce when this seduction have fall upon the heart when the heart shall have tell it to the sens do you believe that cold reason would have much power against this seduction of sense and sentiment and then man should not clothe himself too much in he power and he virtue man have low instinct and high idea and with all virtue be only the consequence of a effort ofttime laborious lascivious picture have generally more influence than cold reason this be what i respond to that theory that be as a first response but i have a second i hold that the romance of _ madame bovary _ from a philosophic point of view be not moral without doubt madame bovary die of poison she suffer much it be true but she die at she own time and in she own way not because she have commit adultery but because she wish to she die in all the prestige of she youth and beauty she die after have two lover leave a husband who love she who adore she who find rodolphe 's portrait he letter and léon 's who read the letter of a woman twice a adulteress and who after that love she still more even on the other side of the tomb who would condemn this woman in the book no one such be the conclusion there be not in the book a person who condemn she if you can find one wise person if you can find one single principal virtue by which the adulteress be condemn i be wrong but if in all the book there be not a person who make she bow she head there be not a idea a line by virtue of which the adulteress be scourge it be i who be right and the book be immoral should it be in the name of conjugal honor that the book be condemn no for conjugal honor be represent here by a devoted husband who after the death of he wife meet rodolphe and seek to find upon the face of the lover the feature of the woman he love i ask you whether you could stigmatize this woman in the name of conjugal honor when there be not in the book a single word where the husband do not bow before the adulteress should it be in the name of public opinion no for public opinion be personify in a grotesque be in the homais apothecary surround by ridiculous person whom this woman dominate will you condemn it in the name of religious sentiment no for this sentiment you see personify in the curate bournisien a priest as grotesque as the apothecary believe only in physical suffering never in moral and little more than a materialist will you condemn it in the name of the author 's conscience i know not what the author think but in chapter 10 the only philosophical one of he book i read the following : there be always after the death of any one a kind of stupefaction so difficult be it to grasp this advent of nothingness and to resign ourselves to believe in it this be not a cry of unbelief but it be at least a cry of scepticism without doubt it be difficult to comprehend and believe it but why this stupefaction which manifest 's itself at death why because this surprise be something that be a mystery because it be difficult to comprehend and judge although one must resign himself to it and as for I i say that if death be the beginning of annihilation that if the devoted husband feel he love increase on learning of the adultery of he wife that if opinion be represent by a grotesque be that if religious sentiment be represent by a ridiculous priest one person alone be right and that be emma bovary -- messalina be right against juvenal this be the conclusion of the book draw not by the author but by a man who reflect and go to the depths of thing by a man who have seek in this book for a person who could rule this woman there be none there the only person who rule be madame bovary it be necessary to seek elsewhere than in the book we must look to christian moral which be the foundation of modern civilization by this standard all explain itself all become clear in its name the adulteress be stigmatize condemn not because she act be a imprudence expose she to disillusion and regret but because it be a crime against the family you stigmatize and condemn suicide not because it be a foolish thing -lrb- the fool be not responsible -rrb- not because it be a cowardly act -lrb- for it sometimes require a certain physical courage -rrb- but because it be a scorn of duty in the life we be live and the cry of unbelief in the life to come this code of moral stigmatize realistic literature not because it paint the passion : hatred vengeance love -- the world see but the surface and art should paint they -- but not paint they without bridle without limit art without rule be not art it be like a woman who discard all clothing to impose upon art the one rule of public decency be not to subject it not to dishonor it one grow great only by rule these gentleman be the principle which we profess this the doctrine which we defend with conscience \* \* \* \* \* _ plea for the defense by _ m senard gentleman m gustave flaubert have be accuse before you of make a bad book of have in this book outrage public moral and religion m gustave flaubert be beside I and affirm before you that he have make a honest book he affirm before you that the think in he book from the first line to the last be a moral thought and that if it be not pervert -lrb- and you have see during the last hour how great a talent one may have for pervert a thought -rrb- it would be -lrb- and will become again presently -rrb- for you as it have be already for the reader of the book a eminently moral and religious thought capable of be translate into these word : the excitation of virtue through the horror of vice i bring m gustave flaubert 's affirmation here to you and i put it fearlessly in the light of the prosecute attorney 's speech for this affirmation be grave and it be through the personality of its maker through the circumstance which have lead to the writing of the book that i be go to make it understand to you the affirmation be grave on account of the personality that make it : and permit I to say to you that m gustave flaubert be not to I a unknown man who have instruction to give I and who have need of recommendation from I -- i speak not only of he morality but of he position i come here into this precinct fulfil a duty of conscience after read the book after feel myself exalt by this reading in all that be honest and profoundly religious but at the same time that i come fulfil a duty of conscience i come to fulfill a duty of friendship i remember and i can never forget that he father be a old friend of mine he father by whose friendship i be long honor to the last day of he life he father -- permit I to say he illustrious father -- be for thirty year surgeon-in-chief at the hospital at rouen he be in charge of the dupuytren dissect room and in give to science great instruction he have endow it with some great name i will mention but one that of cloquet he have not only leave for himself a good name in science he have leave a grand memento in he immense service to humanity and at the same time i be recall my bond of friendship with he i wish to tell you that he son who have be drag into court for a outrage against moral and religion this son be the friend of my child as i be the friend of he father i know he thought i know he intention and the counsellor have the right here of place himself as a personal guaranty of he client gentleman a great name and great memory have obligation child be not want to m flaubert there be three of they two son and a daughter who die at twenty-one the eldest have be judge worthy to succeed he father and he be to-day as he have be for many year carry on the mission which he father conduct for thirty year the younger son be here he be at you bar in leave they a considerable fortune and a great name they father have leave upon they the obligation of be man of intelligence and of heart that be to say useful man the brother of my client have be throw into a career where each day bring its own service this one have devote he life to study and to letter the work before you be he first work this first work gentleman which provoke the passion as the government attorney have say be the result of long study and much thought m gustave flaubert be a man of serious character turn he attention through he very nature to serious subject to sad subject he be not the man whom the prosecute attorney in fifteen or twenty line bite out here and there have present to you as a maker of lascivious picture no there be in he nature i repeat all that be gravest most serious and even the saddest that one could imagine he book by restore a single phrase by put beside the quote line the line which precede and follow will take on its veritable color as soon as you understand the intention of the author and of the too clever word to which you have listen there will remain to you only the memory of a sentiment of profound admiration for a talent which can thus transform thing i have tell you that m gustave flaubert be a serious and grave man he study conform to he nature have be serious and broad they have embrace not only all branch of literature but the right branch m flaubert be not the man to be content with observation of even the best where he live he have seek out the best in other place _ quus mores multorum vidit et urbes _ after he father 's death and the completion of he study at college he visit italy and from 1848 to 1852 travel through the country of the orient -- egypt palestine asia minor -- in which country doubtless a man travel through and bring to he travels a fine intelligence could acquire something exalted something poetic as well as the color and prestige of style which the public minister have just point out to make good the misdemeanor that he impute that prestige of style those literary quality point to with _ éclat _ in this debate be there but after no fashion can they be bring up for indictment since he return in 1852 m gustave flaubert have write and seek to produce in a grand outline the result of he close and serious study the result of what he have gather in he journey what be the outline he have choose the subject he have take and how have he treat it my client belong to any of the school whose name i have just learn in the attorney 's speech heaven know he belong to the realistic school in that he occupy himself with the reality of thing he belong to the psychological school in the sense that it be not material thing which engage he but human sentiment and the development of the passion wherever the human being be place he belong to the romantic school less perhaps than to any other because if romanticism appear in he book as do realism it appear only in some ironical expression here and there which the public attorney have take seriously what m flaubert especially wish be to take a subject of study from real life create from it some true type of the middle class arrive finally at some useful result yes what have most occupied my client in the study to which he have devote himself be precisely this useful aim follow out in put upon the scene three or four personage from actual society living in the condition of real life and present they to the eye of the reader in a true picture of what be meet with very often in the world the prosecute attorney sum up he opinion of _ madame bovary _ have say : the second title of this work might be : _ the story of the adultery of a provincial woman _ i protest vigorously against this title this alone have i not listen to you speech from begin to end would prove to I the prejudice in which you be firmly bind no the second title of this work be not : _ the story of the adultery of a provincial woman _ it be if it be absolutely necessary to have a second title : the story of the education too often meet with in the province the story of the peril to which such a education lead the story of degradation of dishonesty of suicide consider as a consequence of a first fault and a fault lead up to through wrong-doing by which a young woman be often carry away it be the story of a education and the deplorable life of which such a education be often the preface this be what m flaubert desire to paint and not the adultery of a woman of the province you will see this at once on read the incriminate book now the prosecute attorney perceive in all this and through it all a lascivious color if it be possible to take the number of line of the book which he have cut out and put parallel to they other line that he have leave we should have a total proportion of about one to five hundred and you would see that this proportion of one to five hundred be in no way of a lascivious color it exist only under the condition of be cut out and comment upon now what have m flaubert desire to paint first education give to a woman which be above the condition to which she be bear -- something that too often happen among we it must be confess then the mixture of discordant element that be thus produce in the intelligence of the woman and then when marriage come especially if the marriage be not in accordance with the education but rather with the condition under which the woman be bear the author explain all these fact which occur in the situation that he depict what have he show he show a woman enter upon vice because of a disappointing match then vice in its last degree degradation and wretchedness presently when through the reading of several passage i shall have make you acquaint with the book as a whole i shall demand of this tribunal the privilege of they accept the question on these term : would this book put into the hand of a young woman have the effect of lead she towards easy pleasure towards adultery or on the contrary would it show she the danger of the first step and bring upon she a shiver of horror the question thus put you conscience would soon decide i have here state that m flaubert wish to paint a woman who instead of try to adapt herself to the condition in which she be place to she position and she birth instead of seek to make herself a part of the life to which she belong be occupy with a thousand foreign aspiration draw from a education too far above she instead of accommodate herself to the duty of she position of be the tranquil wife of a country doctor with whom she should pass she day in place of seek she happiness in she house and in she marriage seek it in interminable fancy and then meet a young man upon the way who coquet with she she play the same game with he -lrb- heaven know they be both inexperienced enough -rrb- urge herself on by degree and frighten when she turn to the religion of she early year and find it insufficient we shall see presently why this be so at first the young man 's ignorance and she own preserve she from danger but she soon meet a man of the kind of which there be too many in the world who take possession of she -- this poor woman already pervert and ready to stray here be the main point now it be necessary to see what the book make of it the public minister become incensed and i believe wrongly so from the standard of conscience and the human heart over that first scene where madame bovary find a sort of pleasure of joy in have break she prison and return to she home say : i have a lover do you believe that this be not the first cry of the human heart the proof be between you and I but we must look a little further and then we shall see that if the first moment the first instant of the fall excite in this woman a sort of transport of joy of delirium in some line farther on the deception make itself manifest and follow the expression of the author she seem humiliate in she own eye yes deception grief and remorse come to she at the same time the man in whom she have confide to whom she have give herself up have only make use of she for the moment as he would a plaything remorse and regret now rend she heart it have shock you to hear this call the disillusion of adultery you would have prefer _ pollution _ at the hand of a writer who place before you a woman who not have comprehend marriage feel herself _ polluted _ by contact with she husband and who have seek she ideal elsewhere find the _ disillusion _ of adultery this word have shock you in the place of _ disillusion _ you would have wish _ pollution _ of adultery this tribunal shall be the judge as for I if i have depict the same personage i would have say to she : poor woman if you believe that you husband 's kiss be monotonous and wearisome if you have find only platitude -- this word have be especially bring to we notice -- the platitude of marriage -- if you seem to see pollution in a union where love do not preside take care for you dream be a illusion and you will one day be cruelly deceive but this man gentleman who know how to speak strongly make use of the word pollution to express what we would have call disillusion and he have use the true word although vague to he who can bring to it no intelligence i would have like better he not speak so strongly he not pronounce the word _ pollution _ but rather avert the woman from deception from disillusion and say to she : where you believe you will find love you will find only libertinism where you think you will find happiness there be only bitterness a husband who go tranquilly about he affair who kiss you put on he house cap and eat he soup with you be a prosaic husband revolt to you you aspire to a man who will love you idolize you poor child that man will be a libertine who will have take you for a minute for the sake of play with you there will be some illusion about it the first time perhaps the second you may come back home joyous singing the song of adultery i have a lover but the third time you will not wish to go to he for the disillusion will have come the man you have dream of will have lose all he prestige you will have find again in love the platitude of marriage and this time with scorn disdain disgust and poignant remorse this gentleman be what m flaubert have say what he have paint what be in each line of he book and this be what distinguish he work from all other work of the kind under he hand the great irregularity of society figure on each page and adultery walk abroad full of disgust and shame he have bring into the common relation of life the most powerful teaching that can be give to a young woman and heaven know that to those of we young woman who do not find in lofty honest principle and stern religion enough to keep they steady in the accomplishment of they duty as mother or who do not find it in that resignation and practical science of life which bid we accommodate ourselves to what we have but who carry they dream to the outside -lrb- and the most honest the most pure of we young woman in the prosaic life of they household be sometimes torment by that which be go on outside -rrb- a book like this would bring but one reflection of that you may be sure and this be what m flaubert have intend and notice carefully one thing : m flaubert be not the man who have paint a charming adultery for you in order to arrive later with the _ deus ex machina _ no you be carry too quickly on to the last page adultery with he be only a series of torment remorse and regret and then he arrive at the final frightful expiation it be excessive if m flaubert sin it be through excess and i will show you presently what be mean by this the expiation be not allow to wait and it be that which make the book eminently moral and useful it do not promise the young woman some beautiful year at the end of which she can say : after this one be willing to die no from the second day there be bitterness and disillusion the conclusion for morality be find in each line of the book this book be write with a power of observation to which the government attorney have render justice and it be here that i would call you attention to it because if the accusation be without foundation it must fall this book be write with a power truly remarkable for observe the smallest detail a article in the _ artiste _ sign flaubert have serve as yet another text for the accusation let the government attorney note first that this article be foreign to the indictment then that we will hold he innocent and moral in the eye of this tribunal on one condition which be that he will have the goodness to read the entire article from the place of the cut the most noticeable thing in m flaubert 's book be what some account have call a fidelity wholly daguerreian in the reproduction of the type of thing and in the intimate nature of the thought of the human heart -- and this reproduction become more powerful still by the magic of he style now notice that if he have apply this fidelity only to the scene of degradation you could say with reason : the author have be please to paint the scene of degradation with that power of description which be peculiarly he own from the first to the last page of he book he keep close to all the fact in emma 's life without any kind of reserve from she infancy in she father 's house to she education in the convent spare nothing and those of we who have read the book from begin to end can say -- and this be a notable point which should put he in a favorable light with you not only bring he acquittal but remove from he every kind of misunderstanding -- that when he come to the difficult part precisely at the time of degradation in place of do as some classic author have do -lrb- as the public attorney know full well but whom he forget when he write he address -rrb- a few page of whose writings i have with I here -lrb- not to read to you but for you to run through in court -- and i might quote a few line here presently -rrb- in place of do as we great classic author we great master have do who never hesitate at description when they have come to the scene of a union of the sens between man and woman m flaubert contents himself with a word all he descriptive power disappear because he thought be chaste because where he might write in he own manner and with the magic of he style he feel that there be some thing that should not be describe or even touch upon the public attorney find that he have still say too much when i have show he some man who in great philosophical work have delight in description of these thing and when in the light of this fact i have show that this man who possess the descriptive faculty to so high a degree and who far from use it desist and abstain from it i shall indeed have the right to ask why this accusation have be bring nevertheless gentleman just as he have describe to we the pleasant cradle of emma 's infancy with its foliage its rose-colored and white flower which gladden she with they blossom and they perfume so he have describe she when she go out from there into other path into path where she find mire where she foot become soil from its contact when the mire rise higher than herself and -- he need not have tell it but that would be to suppress the book completely and i be go far enough to say would suppress its moral element under a pretext of defend it for if a fault can not be show if it can not be point out if in a picture of real life which aim to show through think peril fall and punishment you would debar painting such as this it be evident you would cut out of the book its whole purpose this book be not a matter of a few hour ' amusement for my client it represent two or three year of incessant study and now i be go to tell you something more : m flaubert who after so many year of labor so many of study so many journey so many note cull from author he have read -- and heaven grant you may see the fountain-head from which he have draw for this strange fact will take upon itself he justification -- m flaubert -lrb- and he lascivious color -rrb- -- you will find impregnate wholly with bossuet and massillon it be in the study of these author that we shall presently find he seek not to plagiarize but to reproduce in he description the thought and color employ by they and can you believe after all that have do this work with so much love for it and with a decide purpose that full of confidence in himself and after so much study and meditation he would wish to throw himself immediately into the arena he would have do it no doubt have he be a unknown man if he name have belong to himself in sole ownership have he believe himself able to dispose of it and use it as it seem good to he but i repeat he be one of those upon whom rest the obligation of rank he name be flaubert he be the second son of m flaubert and he have desire to make a place for himself in literature profoundly respect the moral and religious phase of it -- not through the notoriety of a lawsuit for such a purpose could not enter he thought -- but through personal dignity not wish he name to be at the head of a publication that do not seem to some person and to those in whom he have faith worthy of be publish m flaubert read in fragment and even in totality to friend hold high place in the world of letter the page which he hope some day to print and i assure you that not one of they have be offend by what have just now excite such lively severity on the part of the government attorney no one even think of it they simply examine and study the literary value of the book as to the moral purpose it be so evident so write in every line in term so unequivocal that there be no need of raise the question reassure upon the value of the book encourage furthermore by the most eminent man of the press m flaubert think only of print it and give it to the public i repeat : everyone be unanimous in render homage to its literary merit to its style and at the same time to the excellent thought that pervade it from the first line to the last and when this action be bring it be not he alone who be surprised and profoundly troubled but permit I to say we who can not understand the action and i myself most of all who have read the book with a very lively interest as soon as it be publish but we be he intimate friend heaven know that there be some shades of meaning that might escape we in we easy-going habit which never could escape woman of great intelligence of great purity and unquestioned chastity these be not name which can be pronounce in this audience but if i could tell you what have be say to flaubert what have be say to I even by mother of family who have read this book if i could tell you they astonishment after receive from that read a impression so good that they believe they should thank the author for it if i could tell you they astonishment they grief when they learn that this book be think to oppose public moral and religious faith the faith of they whole life god know there would be in the sum of this appreciation sufficient to fortify I have i need of be fortify for this combat with the public attorney however in the midst of all the appreciative voice of contemporaneous literature there be one which i wish to mention to you there be one who be not only respect by reason of a grand and beautiful character who in the midst of adversity of suffer even have struggle courageously each day who be not only great by virtue of many deed useless to recall here but great through he literary work which must be recall because here he be a authority great especially through the purity which exist in all he work through the chastity of all he writings : lamartine lamartine do not know my client he do not know that he exist lamartine at he home in the country read _ madame bovary _ in each number of the _ revue de paris _ and lamartine find there such power that it recur to he again and again as i be go to tell you after some day lamartine return to pari and the next day inform himself where m gustave flaubert live he send to the _ revue _ to learn where m gustave flaubert live who have publish in the magazine some article under the title of _ madame bovary _ he then direct he secretary to go and present he compliment to m flaubert to express for he the satisfaction he have find in read he book and also he desire to see the new author who reveal himself in a essay of that order my client go to lamartine 's house and he find in he not only a man who encourage he but who say to he : you have make the best book i have read in twenty year in a word he praise be such that in he modesty my client scarcely like to repeat it to I lamartine prove to he that he have read each number prove it most graciously by repeat entire page from they lamartine only add : while i have read even to the last page without reserve i do blame the last page you have hurt I you have literally make I suffer the punishment be beyond all proportion to the crime you have create a pitiably frightful death assuredly the woman who defile the marriage bed should expect punishment but this be horrible it be a punishment such as i have never see you have go too far you have do mischief to my nerve that power of description which you have apply to the last moment of death have leave upon I a indelible suffering and when gustave flaubert say to he : but monsieur de lamartine do you know that i have be indict and summon to a court of correction for a offense against public moral and religion for have make a book like that lamartine answer : i believe that i have be all my life a man who in literary work as well as other comprehend fully what make for public and religious moral my dear child it be not possible to find in france a tribunal that will convict you this be what pass between lamartine and flaubert yesterday and i have the right to say to you that this approval be among those which be worthy to be well weigh this well understand let we see how my conscience could tell I that _ madame bovary _ be a good book a good deed and i ask you permission to add that i do not take to these thing easily this facility be not my habit some literary work i take up which although emanate from we great writer do not remain two minute before my eye i will pass to you in the council chamber some line that i take no delight in reading and i will ask you permission to say to you that when i come to the end of m flaubert 's work i be convince that a cut make by the _ revue de paris _ be the cause of all this i shall ask you further to add my appreciation to this highest and most distinguished appreciation which i be about to mention here gentleman be a portfolio fill with the opinion of all the literary man of we time upon the work with which we be engage among whom be some of the most distinguished express they astonishment upon read this new work at once so moral and so useful now how have it come about that a work like this can incur a process of law if you will permit I i will tell you the _ revue de paris _ whose reading committee have read the work in its entirety for the manuscript be send long before it be publish evidently find nothing to criticise when it come time to print the copy of December 1st 1856 one of the director of the _ revue _ become affright at the scene in the cab he say : this be not conventional we must suppress it flaubert be offend by the suppression he be not willing that it should be make unless a note to that effect be place at the bottom of the page it be he who exact the note it be he who on account of he self-respect as a author neither wish to have he work mutilate nor on the other hand wish to make trouble for the _ revue _ say : you may suppress it if it seem best to you but you will state that you have suppress something and they agree upon the follow note : the director have see the necessity of suppress a passage here which do not seem fitting to the _ revue de paris _ we give notice of it to the author here be the suppress passage which i be go to read to you we have only a proof which we have great difficulty in procure the first part have not a single correction one word be correct in the second part ` where to sir ' ask the coachman ` where you like ' say léon force emma into the cab and the lumber machine set out it go down the rue grand-pont cross the place des art the quaus napoléon the pont neuf and stop short before the statue of pierre corneille ` go on ' cry a voice that come from within the cab go on again and as soon as it reach the carrefour lafayette set off down-hill and enter the station at a gallop ` no straight on ' cry the same voice the cab come out by the gate and soon have reach the cour trot quietly beneath the elm-tree the coachman wipe he brow put he leather hat between he knee and drive he carriage beyond the side alley by the meadow to the margin of the water it go along by the river along the towing-path pave with sharp pebble and for a long while in the direction of oyssel beyond the isle but suddenly it turn with a dash across quatre-mare sotteville la grande-chaussée the rue d'elbeuf and make its third halt in front of the jardin des plantes ` get on will you ' cry the voice more furiously and at once resume its course it pass by saint-sever by the quai des curandier the quaus aux meules once more over the bridge by the place du champ de mar and behind the hospital garden where old man in black coat be walk in the sun along the terrace all green with ivy it go up the boulevard bouvreuil along the boulevard cauchoise then the whole of mont-riboudet to the deville hill it come back and then without any fixed plan or direction wander about at hazard the cab be see at saint-pol at lescure at mont gargan at la rouge-marc and place du gaillardbois in the rue maladrerie rue dinanderie before saint-romain saint-vivien saint-maclou saint-nicaise -- in front of the custom at the ` vieille tour ' the ` trois pipe ' and the monumental cemetery from time to time the coachman on he box cast despairing eye at the public-house he could not understand what furious desire for locomotion urge these individual never to wish to stop he try to now and then and at once exclamation of anger burst forth behind he then he lash he perspire jade afresh but indifferent to they jolting run up against thing here and there not care if he do demoralise and almost weep with thirst fatigue and depression and on the harbor in the midst of the dray and cask and in the street at the corner the good folk open large wonder-stricken eye at this sight so extraordinary in the province a cab with blind draw and which appear thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb and toss about like a vessel once in the middle of the day in the open country just as the sun beat most fiercely against the old plate lantern a bared hand pass beneath the small blind of yellow canvas and throw out some scrap of paper that scatter in the wind and farther off alight like white butterfly on a field of red clover all in bloom at about six o'clock the carriage stop in a back street of the beauvoisine quarter and a woman get out who walk with she veil down and without turn she head on reach the inn madame bovary be surprise not to see the diligence hivert who have wait for she fifty-three minute have at last start nothing however could prevent she set out she have promise to return that evening moreover charle expect she and in she heart she feel already that cowardly docility that be for some woman at once the chastisement and atonement of adultery m flaubert call my attention to the fact that the public attorney condemn this last clause the government attorney : no i have point it out m senard : it be certain that if he have make a reproach it would have fall before these word : at once the chastisement and atonement of adultery furthermore that could be make a matter of reproach with as much foundation as the other quotation for in all that you have condemn there be no point that can be seriously hold now gentleman this kind of fantastic journey have displeased the editor of the _ revue _ it be suppress this be certainly excess of reserve on the part of the _ revue _ and it be very certain that it be not a excess of reserve which could furnish material for a lawsuit you shall see now what have furnish the material what be not see what have be suppress come thus to appear a very strange thing people imagine many thing and often those which do not exist as you have see from the reading of the original passage heaven do you know what they imagine probably that there be in the suppress passage something analogous to that which you will have the goodness to read in one of the most marvellous romance from the pen of a honorable member of the french academy m mérimée m mérimée in a romance entitle _ the double mistake _ describe a scene which take place in a postchaise it be not the locality where the carriage be that be of importance it be as here in the detail of what be do in the interior i do not wish to abuse the audience and will pass the book to the public attorney and to the court if we have write a half or a quarter part of what m mérimée write i should find some embarrassment in the task that have be give I or rather i should have to modify it in place of say what i have say and what i affirm that m flaubert have write a good book a honest book useful and moral i should say : literature have its rights m mérimée have make a very remarkable literary work and it be not necessary to show ourselves too particular about detail when the whole be irreproachable i take my stand there i should acquit and you will acquit great heaven it be not by omission that a author can sin in a matter of this kind and besides you will have the detail of that which take place in the cab but as my client himself be content to make a journey reveal what pass in the interior of the carriage only by a bare hand which appear under the yellow silk curtain and throw out bit of tear paper which be scatter by the wind and settle down afar off like white butterfly upon a field of red clover all in flower as my client be content with that no one know anything about it and everyone suppose -- from the suppression itself -- that he have at least say as much as the member of the french academy you have see that there be nothing in it ah well this unfortunate suppression have cause the lawsuit that be to say when in the office where they have charge and with infinite reason of inspect all writings which could offend public moral they see this cut they take warn i be oblige to declare and gentleman of the _ revue _ allow I to state that they start the work of they scissors two word too far off they should have begin before they get into the cab to cut after that be more difficult this cutting be indeed most unfortunate but if you have commit the error gentleman of the _ revue _ assuredly you will atone for it to-day they say in the inspect office : take heed of what be to follow and when the follow number appear they make war on it to the syllable the people in the office be not oblige to read all and when they see that some one have write about a woman remove all she clothing they be startle enough without go further it be true that differ from we great master flaubert have not take the trouble to describe the alabaster of she bare arm throat etc he have not say as do a poet whom we love : i see she alabaster limb ardent and pure smooth as ebony like the lily coral rose vein of azure such indeed as in former time thou showedst to I of nudity embellish and adorn when night slip by and pillow soft see thee from my kiss wake and sleep oft he have say nothing like this of andré chénier 's but he finally say : she abandon herself she clothing fall from she she abandon herself why not be all description to be prohibit but when one make a incriminate charge he should read the whole and the government attorney have not read the whole the passage he make the charge against do not stop where he stop it have a corrective and here it be : nevertheless there be upon this brow cover with cold drop upon these stammer lip in these bewildered eye in the clasp of these arm something extreme something vague and lugubrious which seem to léon to glide between they in some subtle fashion as if to separate they in the office they do not read that the government attorney just now do not notice it he only see this : then with a single gesture she allow all she clothes to fall from she and then he cry out : a outrage to public moral surely it be too easy to accuse with a system like this god forbid that the author of dictionary fall under the government attorney 's hand who could escape condemnation if by means of cut not of phrase but of word one be to be inform of a list he have make that might offend moral or religion my client 's first thought which unfortunately meet with resistance be this : there be only one thing to do : print the book immediately not with part cut out but the work entire as it leave my hand restore to it the scene in the cab i be of he opinion believe that the best defense of my client would be a complete imprint of the work with special indication of some point to which we would beg to draw the court 's attention i myself give the title to this publication : _ memoir of gustave flaubert for the prevention of outrage to religious moral bring against he _ i have write on it with my hand : civil court sixth chamber with the signature of the president and the public minister there be a preface in which be write : they have indict I with phrase take here and there from my book i can only defend myself with the whole book to ask the judge to read a entire romance would be ask much but we be before judge who love truth who desire the truth and who to learn it would not shrink from any fatigue we be before judge who desire justice and desire it energetically and who will read without any kind of hesitation what we beg they to read i say to m flaubert : send this immediately to the printer and put my name at the bottom beside yours : senard _ counsel _ they have begin the printing arrangement be make for a hundred copy for we own use the work go on with extreme rapidity they be work day and night on it when the order come to we to discontinue the printing not of a book but of a pamphlet in which be the incriminate work together with explanatory note we appeal to the office of the attorney-general -- who inform we that the prohibition be absolute and could not be remove well so be it we should have publish the book with we note and observation 's but now i ask you gentleman if you first reading have leave you in doubt to give it a second reading you will willingly do this as you desire the truth and you could not be among those who when two line of a man 's writing be bring to they be sure to make it fit any condition that may be you do not wish a man to be judge upon a few cutting more or less skilfully make you would not allow that you would not deprive he of the ordinary means of defense well you have the book and although it may be less easy than you might wish you will make you own division observation and meaning because you desire the truth because truth be necessary for the basis of you judgment and truth will come from a serious examination of the book however i can not stop here the public minister have attack the book and it be necessary for I to defend it to complete the quotation he have make and show the nothingness of the accusation against each incriminate passage that will be all my defense i shall not attempt assuredly to place myself in opposition to the exalted animated pathetic appreciation with which the public attorney have surround all that he say by strive for appreciation of the same kind the defense would have no right to make use of such a manner of procedure it must content itself with cite the text such as it be and in the first place i declare that nothing be more false than what have just be say about lascivious color lascivious color where can you find it my client have depict in _ madame bovary _ what sort of woman my god it be sad to say and yet it be true a young girl bear as they nearly all be honest at least the greater number be honest but very fragile when education instead of fortify they soften they and turn they into bad path he have depict a young girl be she of perverse nature no but of a impressionable nature susceptible of exaltation the government attorney have say : this young girl have constantly be present in a lascivious light no she be represent as bear in the country bear on a farm where she be occupy with all she father 's labor and where no kind of lasciviousness can find a way to she mind or heart then she be represent in the place of follow the destiny which would be hers naturally instead of be bring up for the farm or in some analogous place in which she ought to live she be represent as under the short-sighted authority of a father who think he must have he daughter educate in a convent this girl bear on a farm who should marry a farmer or a man of the country she be then take to a convent outside she sphere as there be nothing that do not have weight in the public attorney 's speech we must leave nothing without a response ah you speak of she little sin and in quote from the first number you say : when she go to confession she invent little sin in order that she might stay there longer kneel in the shadow beneath the whispering of the priest you have gravely deceive yourself in regard to my client 's meaning he have not commit the fault with which you reproach he the error be wholly on you side in the first place upon the age of the girl as she enter the convent at thirteen it be evident that she must have be fourteen when she go to confession she be not then a child of ten year as it have please you to say and you be materially deceive on that point but i be not so sure of the unlikelihood of a child of ten year like to remain at the confessional under the whispering of the priest all that i desire be that you read the line which precede and that be not easy i agree and here appear the inconvenience of not have a pamphlet memoir at hand with such a aid we should not have to search through six volume i have call you attention to this passage in order to recall it to _ madame bovary _ and she true character will you permit I to say what seem to I very important that m flaubert have fully comprehend this point and put it in bold relief there be a kind of religion which be generally speak of to young girl which be the worst of all religion there may be in this regard a difference of opinion as for I i declare clearly that i know nothing more beautiful or useful or necessary to sustain not only woman in the way of life but man themselves who sometimes have the most difficult trial to overcome i know nothing so useful so necessary as the religious sentiment but a serious religious sentiment and permit I to add severe i wish my child to believe in one god not a god in the abstractness of pantheism but in a supreme be with whom they have relationship to whom they be accustom to pray and who at once awe and fortify they this thought you see it be you belief as well as mine be we strength in evil day be we strength against what we call the world the refuge or better still the strength of the weak it be this thought which give woman that stability which make they resign to a thousand little thing in life which make they carry all they suffering to god and ask of he grace to fulfill they duty that religion gentleman be the christian religion and it be that which establish a relationship between god and man christianity in place a sort of intermediary power between god and ourselves render god more accessible and communication with he easier that the mother of he who have make himself the savior should receive the prayer of woman can not affect so far as i can see purity religious sanctity or religious sentiment itself but here be where the change begin in order to accommodate a religion to all nature all sort of petty miserable paltry thing be introduce the pomp of the ceremony instead of be a true pomp which lay hold on the soul often degenerate into a commerce in relic medal of little saint and virgin to what gentleman do the mind of child curious ardent and tender lend themselves especially the mind of young girl to all these enfeebled attenuate miserable image of the religious spirit they then take upon themselves little religious duty to put in practice little devotions of tenderness of love and in the place of have in they soul the sentiment of god the sentiment of duty they abandon themselves to reverie to little device to little devotions and then come the poesy and then come it be very necessary to say it a thousand thought of charity of tenderness of mystic love a thousand form which deceive young girl and sensualize religion these poor child naturally credulous and weak take to all this poesy and reverie instead of attach themselves to something more reasonable and severe whence it happen that you have very many strong devotee among woman who be not religious at all and when the wind blow they from the path where they ought to walk in place of find strength to combat it they find only a kind of sensuality which bewilder they ah you have accuse I of have confound the religious element with sensualism in the picture of modern society accuse rather the society in the midst of which we live but do not accuse the man who cry with bossuet : awake and be on thy guard against peril and say to the father of family : take care these be not good custom for you daughter there be in all these mixture of mysticism something which sensualise religion say that and you will speak the truth it be for this that you accuse flaubert it be for this that i exalt he conduct yes he have give very good warning of the whole family of danger arise from exaltation among young person who take upon themselves petty devotions instead of attach themselves to a strong and severe religion which would sustain they in a day of weakness and now you shall see whence come the invention of the little sin under the whispering of the priest read page 30 : she have read ` paul and virginium ' and she have dream of the little bamboo-house the nigger domingo the dog fidèle but above all the sweet friendship of some dear little brother who seek red fruit for you on tree taller than steeple or who run barefoot over the sand bring you a bird 's nest be this lascivious gentleman let we continue the government attorney : i do not say that passage be lascivious m senard : i ask you pardon but it be precisely in this passage that you find a lascivious phrase and it be only by isolate it from what precede and what follow that you could make it seem lascivious instead of attend to mass she look at the pious vignette with they azure border in she book and she love the sick lamb the sacred heart pierce with sharp arrow or the poor jesus sink beneath the cross he carry she try by way of mortification to eat nothing a whole day she puzzle she head to find some vow to fulfill do not forget this when one invent little sin to confess and seek some vow to fulfill as you will find in the precede line evidently one have get idea that be a little false from somewhere and now i ask you if i have to discuss you passage i continue : in the evening before prayer there be some religious reading in the study on week-night it be some abstract of sacred history or the lecture of the abbé frayssinous and on sunday passage from the ` génie du christianism ' as a recreation how she listen at first to the sonorous lamentation of its romantic melancholy re-echo through the world and eternity if she childhood have be spend in the shop-parlor of some business quarter she might perhaps have open she heart to those lyrical invasion of nature which usually come to we only through translation in book but she know the country too well she know the lowing of cattle the milk the plow accustom to calm aspect of life she turn on the contrary to those of excitement she love the sea only for the sake of its storm and the green field only when break up by ruin she wish to get some personal profit out of thing and she reject as useless all that do not contribute to the immediate desire of she heart be of a temperament more sentimental than artistic look for emotion not landscape you shall see with what delicate precaution the author have introduce a saintly old maid and how with a purport of teaching religion there be allow to slip into the convent a new element through the introduction of romance bring in by a stranger do not forget this when the subject of religious moral be under consideration at the convent there be a old maid who come for a week each month to mend the linen patronize by the clergy because she belong to a ancient family of nobleman ruin by the revolution she dine in the refectory at the table of the good sister and after the meal have a bit of chat with they before go back to she work the girl often slip out from the study to go and see she she know by heart the love-song of the last century and sing they in a low voice as she stitch away she tell story give they news go errand in the town and on the sly lend the big girl some novel that she always carry in the pocket of she apron and of which the good lady herself swallow long chapter in the interval of she work this be nothing but marvellous speaking from a literary point of view and absolution can but be grant a man who have write these admirable passage as a warning against all peril of education of this kind as a indication to young woman of the stumbling-block in the life in which they will be place let we continue : they be all love lover sweet-heart persecute lady faint in lonely pavilion postilion kill at every stage horse ride to death on every page sombre forest heartache vow sob tear and kiss little skiff by moonlight nightingale in shady grove ` gentleman ' brave as lion gentle as lamb virtuous as no one ever be always well dress and weep like fountain for six month then emma at fifteen year of age make she hand dirty with book from old lending library with walter scott later she fall in love with historical event dream of old chest guardroom and minstrel she would have like to live in some old manor-house like those long-waisted châtelaines who in the shade of pointed arch spend they day lean on the stone chin in hand watch a cavalier with white plume gallop on he black horse from the distant field at this time she have a cult for mary stuart and enthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy woman joan of arc héloïse agnès sorel the beautiful ferronnière and clémence isaure stand out to she like comet in the dark immensity of heaven where also be see lose in shadow and all unconnected st loui with he oak the die bayard some cruelty of loui xi a little of st bartholomew 's the plume of the béarnais and always the remembrance of the plate paint in honor of loui xiv in the music-class in the ballad she sing there be nothing but little angel with golden wing madonna lagune gondolier -- mild composition that allow she to catch a glimpse athwart the obscurity of style and the weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria of sentimental reality now you have not remember this when that poor country girl have return to the farm and marry a village physician be invite to a evening party at the castle to which you have seek to call the attention of the judge to show that there be something lascivious in a waltz she take part in you have not call to mind this education when this poor woman be charm that a invitation come to take she from she husband 's common fireside and lead she to the castle where she see fine gentleman beautiful lady and the old duke who they say have have great fortune at court the government attorney have show some fine emotion _ à propo _ of queen marie-antoinette assuredly there be not one of we who would not share he thought like he we have tremble at the name of this victim of the revolution but it be not with marie-antoinette that we be concern here it be with the castle vaubyessard there be a old duke there who have have they say relation with the queen and towards whom all eye be turn and when this young woman find herself thus transport into the midst of the world thus realize all the fantastic dream of she youth can you wonder at the intoxication of it and you accuse she of be lascivious better accuse the waltz itself that dance of we great modern ball where say a late author write about it the woman lean she head upon the shoulder of she partner whose limb embrace she you find madame bovary lascivious in flaubert 's description but there be not a man and i will not except you who have take part in a ball like that and see that sort of waltz have not have in mind the wish that he wife or he daughter refrain from this pleasure which have in it so much of the untame if count upon the chastity which envelop this young woman we allow she sometimes to give herself up to this pleasure which the world sanction it be necessary to count very much upon that envelope of chastity and however much one may count upon it it be not unheard of to express the impression which m flaubert have express in the name of moral and chastity here she be at the castle vaubyessard observe by the old duke notice favorably by all and you cry out : what detail what do it mean detail be everywhere although we cite but a single passage madame bovary notice that many lady have not put they glove in they glass but at the upper end of the table alone among all those woman bent over he full plate with he napkin tie round he neck like a child a old man sit eat let drop of gravy drip from he mouth he eye be bloodshot and he wear a little queue tie with a black ribbon he be the marquis 's father-in-law the old duke de laverdiére once on a time favorite of the count d'artoi in the day of the vaudreuil hunting-party at the marquis de conflans ' and have be it be say the lover of queen mari-antoinette between monsieur de coigny and monsieur de lauzun defend the queen defend she especially before the scaffold say that because of she title she have the right of respect but suppress you accusation when one contents himself with say that he have be it be say the lover of the queen can that be so serious that you reproach we with have insult the memory of that unfortunate woman he have live a life of noisy debauch full of duel bet elopement he have squander he fortune and frighten all he family a servant behind he chair name aloud to he in he ear the dish that he point to stammer and constantly emma 's eye turn involuntarily to this old man with hang lip as to something extraordinary he have live at court and sleep in the bed of queen iced champagne be pour out emma shiver all over as she feel it cold in she mouth she have never see pomegranate nor taste pine-apple you see that these description be charming incontestably and that it be not difficult to take a line here and there for the purpose of create a kind of color against which my conscience protest it be not a lascivious color it be only lifelike it be the literary element and at the same time the moral element here we have a young girl whose education you be acquaint with become a woman the government attorney have ask : do she even try to love she husband he have not read the book if he have read it he would not have make the objection we have gentleman this poor woman dream at first on page 34 you will find she dream and there be something more here something of which the government attorney do not speak and which i must tell you and these be she impression when she mother die you will see if they be lascivious soon enough have the goodness to turn to page 33 and follow I : when she mother die she cry much the first few day she have a funeral picture make with the hair of the deceased and in a letter send to the bertaux full of sad reflection on life she ask to be bury some day in the same grave the good man think she must be ill and come to see she emma be secretly pleased that she have reach at a first attempt the rare ideal of pale life never attain by mediocre heart she let herself glide along with lamartine meanderings listen to harp on lake to all the song of die swan to the fall of the leave the pure virgin ascend to heaven and the voice of the eternal discourse down the valley she weary of it would not confess it continue from habit and at last be surprise to feel herself soothe and with no more sadness at heart than wrinkle on she brow i wish to make answer to the government attorney 's reproach that she make no effort to love she husband the government attorney : i do not reproach she for that i say that she do not succeed in loving he m senard : if i have be mistake if you make no reproach that be the best response that could be give i believe that i understand you to make one let we see how i may be deceive moreover here be what i read at the end of page 36 : and yet in accord with theory she believe right she desire to make herself in love with he by moonlight in the garden she recite all the passionate rhyme she know by heart and sigh sing to he many melancholy adagio but she find herself as calm after this as before and charle seem no more amorous and no more move when she have thus for a while strike the flint on she heart without get a spark incapable moreover of understand what she do not experience as of believe anything that do not present itself in conventional form she persuade herself without difficulty that charle 's passion be nothing very exorbitant he outburst become regular he embrace she at certain fixed time it be one habit among other habit and like a dessert look forward to after the monotony of dinner on page 37 we find a group of similar thing now here be where the peril begin you know how she have be bring up and i beg you not to forget this for a instant there be not a man who have read this would not say that m flaubert be not only a great artist but a man of heart for have in the last six page turn all the horror and scorn upon the woman and all the interest towards the husband he be a great artist as have be say because he have leave the husband as he be he have not transform he and to the end he be the same good man commonplace mediocre full of the duty of he profession love he wife well but destitute of education or elevation of thought he be the same at the death-bed of he wife and nevertheless there be not a individual to whom the memory return with more interest why because he have keep to the end he simplicity and uprightness of heart because to the end he have fulfil he duty while he wife be lead astray he death be as beautiful and as touch as the death of he wife be hideous on the dead body of the woman the author have show the spot make by the vomiting of poison they soil the white shroud in which she go to she burial and he have make she as he desire a object of disgust but there be a man there who be sublime -- the husband standing beside the grave there be a man who be grand sublime whose death be admirable -- the husband who find himself broken-hearted by the death of he wife see afterwards all the illusion of the heart that remain to he embrace in the thought of he wife in the tomb keep that i beg you in you remembrance the author have go beyond what be necessary -- as lamartine have say -- in render the death of the woman hideous and she punishment most terrible the author have concentrate all the interest upon the man who do not deviate from the line of duty who preserve he mediocre character to be sure -lrb- for the author could not change he character -rrb- but who preserve also all he generosity of heart while upon the wife who deceive he ruin he give he into the hand of usurer put into circulation forge note and finally arrive at suicide be heap all the accumulate horror we shall see that it be natural -- the death of this woman who if she have not come to she end by poison would have be break by the excess of misfortune with which she be surround the author have see this he book would not be read if he have do otherwise if in order to show where a education as perilous as that of madame bovary can lead he have not be prodigal with the fascinating image and the powerful tableau for which he be reproach m flaubert constantly set forth the superiority of the husband over the wife and what superiority if you please that of simple duty fulfil while the wife be stray from hers here she be fix by the bent of this bad education here she be go out after the scene of the ball with the young boy léon as inexperienced as herself she coquet with he but do not dare to go further nothing happen then come rodolphe who take the woman to himself after look at she for a moment he say : this woman be all right she will be easy prey because she be light-minded and inexperienced as to the fall will you re-read page 42 43 and 44 i have only a word to say about this scene and that be : there be no detail no description no image that can trouble the sens a single word indicate the fall : she abandon herself i pray you to have the goodness to read again the detail of the fall of clarissa harlowe which i have not hear decry as a bad book m flaubert have substitute rodolphe for lovelace and emma for clarissa if you will compare the two author and the two book you will appreciate the situation but i will return here to the indignation of the government attorney he be shock that remorse do not immediately follow the fall and that in the place of express bitterness she say with satisfaction : i have a lover but the author would not be true if he make the enchanting draught seem bitter while it still touch the lip he who write as the attorney understand might be moral but he would be say what be not in nature no it be not at the first moment of a fault that the sentiment of fault be awaken otherwise it would not be commit no it be not at the moment when she be under a delusion that intoxicate she that a woman can be avert from this intoxication even by the immensity of the fault she have commit she feel only the intoxication she go back to she home happy sparkling and singing in she heart : i have a lover but can this last long you have read page 424 and 425 on both page and if you please to page 428 the sentiment of disgust with she lover be not yet manifest but she be already under the impression of fear and uneasiness she think weigh the question and believe that she do not wish to abandon rodolphe : something stronger than herself force she to he so much so that one day see she come unexpectedly he frown as one put out ` what be the matter with you ' she say ` be you ill tell I ' at last he declare with a serious air that she visit be become imprudent -- that she be compromise herself gradually rodolphe 's fear take possession of she at first love have intoxicate she and she have think of nothing beyond but now that he be indispensable to she life she fear to lose anything of this or even that it should be disturb when she come back from he house she look all about she anxiously watch every form that pass in the horizon and every village window from which she could be see she listen for step cry the noise of the plough and she stop short white and tremble more than the aspen leave sway overhead you see unmistakably that she be not deceive she feel clearly that there be something about it of which she have not dream let we take page 433 and 434 and you will be still further convinced : when the night be rainy they take refuge in the consulting-room between the cart-shed and the stable she light one of the kitchen candle that she have hide behind the book rodolphe settle down there as if at home the sight of the library of the bureau of the whole apartment in fine excited he merriment and he could not refrain from make joke about charle which rather embarrass emma she would have like to see he more serious and even on occasion more dramatic as for example when she think she hear a noise of approach step in the alley ` some one be come ' she say he blow out the light ` have you you pistol ' ` why ' ` why to defend yourself ' reply emma ` from you husband oh poor devil ' and rodolphe finish he phrase with a gesture which signify : i could crush he with a fillip she be amaze at he bravery although she feel that there be a sort of indelicacy and naïve grossness about it that be scandalize rodolphe reflect a good deal on the affair of the pistol if she have speak seriously it be very ridiculous he think even odious for he have no reason to hate the good charle not be what be call devour by jealousy and on this subject emma have treat he to a lecture which he do not think in the best taste besides she be grow very sentimental she have insist on exchange miniature they have cut handful of hair and now she be ask for a ring -- a real wedding-ring in sign of a eternal union she often speak to he of the evening chime of the voice of nature then she talk to he of she mother -- hers and of he mother -- he finally she weary he then on page 453 : he have no longer as formerly word so gentle that they make she cry nor passionate caress that make she mad so that they great love which engross she life seem to lessen beneath she like the water of a stream absorb into its channel and she could see the bed of it she would not believe it she redouble in tenderness and rodolphe conceal he indifference less and less she do not know whether she regret yield to he or whether she do not wish on the contrary to enjoy he the more the humiliation of feeling herself weak be turn to rancor temper by they voluptuous pleasure it be not affection it be like a continual seduction he subjugate she she almost fear he and you be afraid mr government attorney that young woman might read this i be less frightened less timid than you on my own personal account i can admirably understand a father of a family say to he daughter : young lady if you heart you conscience if religious sentiment and the voice of duty be not sufficient to make you walk in the right path look my child look well at the weariness the suffer the grief and desolation attend the woman who seek happiness outside she home this language would not wind you in the mouth of a father would it m flaubert have say nothing but this he have make a painting most true and most powerful of what the woman who dream of find happiness outside she house immediately discover but let we go on and we shall come to all the adventure of the disillusion you show I the caress of léon on page 60 alas she will soon pay the ransom of adultery and that ransom you will find terrible in some page farther on in the book you condemn she seek happiness in adultery poor unfortunate one and she find besides the disgust and fatigue that the monotony of marriage can bring to the woman who do not walk in the path of duty the disillusion and the scorn of the man to whom she have give herself be any of this scorn lack in the book oh no and you can not deny it for the book be under you eye rodolphe who have show himself so vile give to she a last proof of egoism and cowardice she have say to he : take I carry I away i be stifle i can no longer breathe in my husband 's house to which i have bring shame and misfortune he hesitate she insist finally he promise and the next day she receive a terrible letter under which she fall crushed and annihilated she be take ill and be die the number you be consult show you all the convulsion of a soul at war with itself which perhaps could be lead back to duty by a excess of suffering but unfortunately she meet a boy with whom she have play when she be inexperienced this be the movement of the romance and then come the expiation but the government attorney stop I and ask : although it may be true that the purpose of the book be good from one end to the other could you allow such obscene detail as those that have be bring forward very certainly i could not allow such detail but where have i allow they where be they i now arrive at the passage most condemn i will say no more of the adventure in the cab this court have hear enough with regard to that i come to the passage that you have point out as contrary to public moral and which form a certain number of page in the December number and in order to pull away all the scaffolding of you accusation there be only one thing to be do : to restore what precede and what follow you quotation in a word to substitute the text complete as oppose to you cut at the bottom of page 72 léon after make a agreement with homai the chemist go to the hôtel de boulogne the chemist go there to find he emma be no longer there she have just go in a fit of anger she detest he now this fail to keep they rendezvous seem to she a insult then grow calmer she at length discover that she have no doubt calumniate he but the disparage of those we love always alienate we from they to some extent we must not touch we idol the gilt stick to we finger great heaven and it be for such line as i have be read to you that we be drag before you listen now : they gradually come to talk more frequently of matter outside they love and in the letter that emma write he she speak of flower verse the moon and the star naïve resource of a wane passion strive to keep itself alive by all external aid she be constantly promising herself a profound felicity on she next journey then she confess to herself that she feel nothing extraordinary this disappointment quickly give way to a new hope and emma return to he more inflamed more eager than ever she undress brutally tear off the thin lace of she corset that nestle around she hip like a glide snake she go on tip-toe barefoot to see once more that the door be close then pale serious and without speak with one movement she throw herself upon he breast with a long shudder you have stop here mr attorney permit I to continue : yet there be upon that brow cover with cold drop on those quiver lip in those wild eye in the strain of those arm something vague and dreary that seem to léon to glide between they subtly as if to separate they you call this lascivious color you say that this give a taste for adultery you say that these page excite and arouse the sens -- that they be lascivious page but death be in these page you do not think of that mr attorney and be simply frighten to find such word as _ corset clothing which fall off _ etc and you attach yourself to these three or four word such as corset and fall clothing do you wish I to show you that corset can appear in a classic book a very classic book i shall give myself the pleasure of so do presently she undress herself -lrb- ah mr government attorney how badly you have understand this passage -rrb- she undress hastily -lrb- poor thing -rrb- tear off the thin lace of she corset that nestle around she hip like a glide snake then pale serious and without speak with one movement she throw herself upon he breast with a long shudder there be upon that brow cover with cold drop in the strain of those arm something vague and dreary we must ask here where the lascivious color be and where be the severe color and ask if the sens of the young girl into whose hand this book might fall could be arouse excite -- as she might by read a classic of classic which i shall cite presently and which have be reprint a thousand time without any prosecution public or royal follow it be there anything analogous in what i be go to read you be there not on the contrary a horror of vice that this something dreary glide in between they to separate they let we continue i pray : he do not dare to question she but see she so skilled she must have pass he think through every experience of suffering and of pleasure what have once charm now frightened he a little besides he rebel against he absorption daily more mark by she personality he begrudge emma this constant victory he even strive not to love she then when he hear the creaking of she boot he turn coward like drunkard at the sight of strong drink what be lascivious there and then take the last paragraph : one day when they have part early and she be return alone along the boulevard she see the wall of she convent then she sit down on a form in the shade of the elm-tree how calm that time have be how she long for the ineffable sentiment of love that she have try to figure to herself out of book the first month of she marriage she ride in the wood the viscount that waltz and lagardy singing all repass before she eye and léon suddenly appear to she as far off as the other ` yet i love he ' she say to herself do not forget this mr attorney when you judge the thought of the author when you wish to find absolutely lascivious color where i can only find a excellent book she be not happy -- she never have be whence come this insufficiency of life -- this instantaneous turn to decay of everything on which she lean be that lascivious but if there be somewhere a be strong and beautiful a valiant nature full at once of exaltation and refinement a poet 's heart in angel 's form a lyre with sound chord ring out elegiac epithalamium to heaven why perchance should she not find he ah how impossible besides nothing be worth the trouble of seek it everything be a lie every smile hide a yawn of boredom every joy a curse all pleasure satiety and the sweetest kiss leave upon you lip only the unattainable desire for a greater delight a metallic clang drone through the air and four stroke be hear from the convent-clock four o'clock and it seem to she that she have be there on that form a eternity but a infinity of passion may be contain in a minute like a crowd in a small space it be not necessary to look at the end of the book to find what be in it from one end to the other i have read the incriminate passage without add a word to defend a work which defend itself through itself let we continue lead from this same incriminate passage look at it from a moral point of view : madame be in she room which no one enter she stay there all day long torpid half dress and from time to time burning turkish pastille which she have buy at rouen in a algerian 's shop in order not to have at night this sleep man stretch at she side by dint of manoeuver she at least succeed in banish he to the second floor while she read till morning extravagant book full of picture of orgy and thrilling situation often seize with fear she cry out and charle hurry to she ` oh go away ' she would say or at other time consume more ardently than ever by that inner flame to which adultery add fuel panting tremulous all desire she throw open she window breathe in the cold air shake loose in the wind she mass of hair too heavy and gaze upon the star long for some princely love she think of he of léon she would then have give anything for a single one of those meeting that surfeit she those be she gala day she wish they to be sumptuous and when he alone could not pay the expense she make up the deficit liberally which happen almost every time he try to make she understand that they would be quite as comfortable somewhere else in a smaller hotel but she always find some objection you see all this be very simple when one read the whole but in cutting like those of the government attorney the smallest word become a mountain the government attorney : i do not quote any of those phrase last mention but since you wish to quote what i have not incriminate it would be well not to pass over the foot of the page adjoining page 50 m senard : i pass over nothing but i insist upon cite the incriminate passage in the quotation we be quote from page 77 and 78 the government attorney : i refer to the quotation make to the audience and think you imputed I with have cite the line you be about to read m senard : mr attorney i have quote all the passage by whose aid you have attempt to constitute a misdemeanor -- which accusation be now shatter you develop before the audience what seem to you convince and have have a fair opportunity happily we have the book and the defense know the book if he have not know it he position allow I to tell you would have be very awkward i be call upon to explain such and such passage to myself and to add other for the benefit of the audience if i have not possess the book as i do the defense have be difficult now i can show you through a faithful analysis of the romance that far from be consider a lascivious work it should be consider on the contrary eminently moral after do this i take the passage that have be the motive for police correction and after i follow the cutting with what precede and what succeed the accusation become so weak that you be in revolt the moment i have finish read they these same passage that you stamp as recriminate i have use a equal right to quote myself for the purpose of show you the folly of the accusation i continue my quotation where i stop at the bottom of page 78 he be bore now when emma suddenly begin to sob on he breast and he heart like the people who can only stand a certain amount of music doze to the sound of a love whose delicacy he no longer note they know one another too well for any of those surprise of possession that increase its joy a hundredfold she be as sick of he as he be weary of she emma find again in adultery all the platitude of marriage _ platitude of marriage _ he who do the cut here have say : now here be a man who say that in marriage there be only platitude it be a attack on marriage it be a outrage to moral you will agree mr attorney that with cutting artistically make one can go far in the way of incriminate what be it that the author call the platitude of marriage that monotony which emma have dread which she have wish to escape from but have find continually in adultery which be precisely the disillusion you now see clearly that when in the place of cut off the member of certain phrase and cut out some word we read what precede and what follow nothing remain for incrimination and you can well comprehend that my client who know what he wish to say must be a little in revolt at see it thus travesty let we continue : she be as sick of he as he be weary of she emma find again in adultery all the platitude of marriage but how to get rid of he then though she might feel humiliate at the baseness of such enjoyment she cling to it from habit or from corruption and each day she hunger after they the more exhausting all felicity in wish for too much of it she accuse léon of she baffled hope as if he have betray she and she even long for some catastrophe that would bring about they separation since she have not the courage to make up she mind to it herself she none the less go on write he love letter in virtue of the notion that a woman must write to she lover but whilst she write it be another man she see a phantom fashion out of she most ardent memory -lrb- this be certainly not incriminate -rrb- then she fall back exhaust for these transport of vague love weary she more than great debauchery she now feel constant ache all over she often she even receive a summons stamp paper that she barely look at she would have like not to be alive or to be always asleep i call that a excitation of virtue through a horror of vice as the author himself call it and which the reader no longer perplexed can not fail to see unless influence by ill-will and now something more to make you perceive what kind of man you be about to judge and in order to show you not what kind of justification i may expect but whether m flaubert have make use of lascivious color and whence he get he inspiration let I put upon you desk this book use by he in whose passage he find himself inspire to paint this concupiscence the entanglement of this woman who seek happiness in illicit pleasure but could not find it there who seek again and again and never find it whence have flaubert derive he inspiration gentleman it be from this book listen : illusion of the sens whoever then attach himself to the sens must necessarily wander from object to object and deceive himself so to speak by a change of place as concupiscence -- that be to say love of pleasure -- be always change because its ardor languish and die in continuity and it be only change that make it revive again what be that other characteristic of a life of the sens that alternate movement of appetite and disgust of disgust and appetite the soul float ever uncertain between ardor which abate and ardor which be renew _ inconstantium concupiscentium _ that be what a life of the sens be however in this perpetual movement one must not allow himself to be deceive by the image of wander liberty this be what a life of the sens be who have say that who have write these word which you be about to hear upon these excitement and excessive ardor what be the book which m flaubert peruse day and night and which have inspire the passage that the government attorney condemn it be by bossuet what i shall read to you be a fragment of bossuet 's discourse upon _ illicit pleasure _ i shall bring you to see that all these incriminate passage be -- not plagiarize the man who appropriate a idea be not a plagiarist -- but imitation of bossuet do you wish for another example here it be : upon sin and do not ask I christian in what way this great change of pleasure into punishment will come about the thing be prove by the scripture it be truth who have say it it be the all-powerful who have make it so and sometimes if you will look at the nature of the passion to which you abandon you heart you will easily comprehend that they may become a intolerable punishment they all have in themselves cruel pain disgust and bitterness they all have a infinity which be anger by not be able to be satisfy there be transport of rage mingle in all of they which degenerate into a kind of fury not less painful than unreasonable love if i may be permit so to name it in this guise have its uncertainty its violent agitation its irresolute resolution and a abyss of jealousy and further : ah what then be easier than make of we passion a insupportable pain or sin when if we cut out as be very just the little sweetness through which they lead we there be leave of they only the cruel disquiet and bitterness with which they abound we sin be against we we sin be upon we we sin be in the midst of we like a arrow pierce we body a insupportable weight upon we head a poison devour we entrails be not all that you have just listen to design to show you the bitterness of passion i leave you this book line and thumb-marked by the studious man who have find he thought there and that man who have be inspire from a source of this kind who have write of adultery in the term you have listen to be prosecute for outrage of public and religious moral a few line still upon the _ woman sinner _ and you will see how m flaubert have decide to paint this ardor understand take inspiration from this model : but punish for we error without be deceive by it we seek in change the remedy for we scorn we wander from object to object and if finally there be some one who hold we it be not because we be content with we choice but because we be bind by we inconstancy \* \* \* \* \* all appear to she empty false disgusting in these creature : far from find there those first charm which she heart have have so much difficulty in defend she see in they now only frivolity danger and vanity \* \* \* \* \* i will not speak of a entanglement of passion what fear there be that the mystery of it can not dispel what measure to keep on the side of well-being and pride what eye to shun what watcher to deceive what return to fear from those whom one choose for they aid and confidant in they passion what indignity to suffer from he perhaps for whom one have sacrifice honor and liberty and of whom one dare not complain to all this add those cruel moment when passion less lively leave we to choose between fall back upon ourselves and feel all the humility of we position and those moment where the heart bear for more solid pleasure leave we with we own idol and find its punishment in its own disgust and inconstancy profane world if there be in you that felicity that be so much vaunted favor you adorer with it nor punish they for the faith they have add so lightly to you promise let I say to you here : when a man in the silence of the night meditate upon the cause of enticement for woman when he find they in she education and put aside personal observation for the sake of express he thought mature they at the source i have indicate not allow himself to use he pen except from inspiration of bossuet and massillon permit I to ask you if there be a word to express my surprise my grief on see this man drag into court -- on account of some passage in he book and precisely for the truest and most elevated idea that he be able to bring together and i pray you not to forget this in relation to the charge of outrage against religious moral and then if you will permit I i will put in opposition to all this under you very eye what i myself call attack the moral that be to say satisfaction of the sens without bitterness without those large drop of cold sweat which fall from the brow of those who give themselves over to it and i will not quote to you from licentious book in which the author have seek to arouse the sens i will quote from only one book -- which be give as a prize in college but whose author 's name i ask leave to withhold until after i have read you a passage from it here be the passage : i will ask you to pass the volume it be a copy that be give to a college student as a prize i prefer you to take this copy rather than m flaubert 's : the next day i be receive into she apartment there i feel all that voluptuousness carry with it the room be fill with the most agreeable perfume she lay upon a bed which be enclose in garland of flower she appear to be lie there languishingly she extend she hand to I and make I sit beside she in all even in the veil which cover she face there be a charm i could see the form of she beautiful body a simple cloth which move as she move allow I at one time to see and at another to lose sight of she ravishing beauty a simple cloth when it be extend over a dead body appear to you a lascivious image here it be extend over a living woman : she notice that my eye be occupy and when she see they inflamed the cloth seem to open itself away from she i see all the treasure of a divine beauty at this moment she take my hand my eye be wander there be only my dear ardasire i cry out who can be as beautiful but i swear to the god that my fidelity she throw herself on my neck and draw I into she arm suddenly the room become darkened she veil open and she give I a kiss i be beside myself a flame start suddenly through my vein and arouse all my sens the idea of ardasire be far from I she remain to I only as a memory there appear to I but one thought i be go i be go to prefer this one even to she already my hand have wander to she breast they run rapidly everywhere love show itself only in its fury it hurry on to victory a moment more and ardasire could not defend herself who now have write that it be not the author of _ the new héloise _ it be the president montesquieu here be no bitterness no disgust but all be sacrifice to literary beauty and they give it as a prize to pupil in rhetoric without doubt to serve as a model in the amplification and description that they be require to write montesquieu describe in he persian letter a scene which could not even be read it concern a woman place between two man who dispute over she this woman place between two man have dream -- which appear to the author very agreeable shall we sum up mr attorney or be it necessary for I to quote you jean-jacque rousseau in he _ confession _ and some other no i will only say to the judge that if on account of he description of the carriage in _ the double misunderstanding _ m mérimée have be prosecute he would have be acquit immediately one see in he book only a work of art of great literary beauty one would no more condemn it than he would condemn painting or statuary which be not content with represent all the beauty of the body but wish to add ardor and passion i will follow it no farther i ask you to recognize the fact that m flaubert have not weighted he image and have do only one thing : he have touch with a firm hand the scene of degradation at each line of he book he have bring out the disillusion and instead of end it with something charming he have undertake to show we that this woman after meet scorn abandonment and ruin of she house come to a frightful death in a word i can only repeat what i say at the beginning of this plea that m flaubert be the author of a good book a book which aim at the excitation of virtue by arouse a horror of vice i will now look into he outrage against religion a outrage against religion commit by m flaubert and in what respect if you please the government attorney have think he find in he a sceptic i can assure the government attorney that he be deceive i be not here to make a profession of faith i be here only to defend a book and for that reason i shall limit myself to a simple word now as to the book i defy the government attorney to find in it anything that resemble a outrage against religion you have see how religion be introduce in emma 's education and how this religion false in a thousand way could not hold emma from the bent that carry she astray would you know in what kind of language m flaubert speak of religion listen to some line that i take from the first number page 231 232 and 233 : one evening when the window be open and she sit by it have be watch lestiboudoi the beadle trim the box she suddenly hear the angelus ring it be the beginning of April when the primrose be in bloom and a warm wind blow over the flower-bed newly turn and the garden like woman seem to be get ready for the summer fêtes through the bar of the arbor and away beyond the river could be see in the field meander through the grass in wander curve the evening vapor rise between the leafless poplar touch they outline with a violet tint paler and more transparent than a subtle gauze catch athwart they branch in the distance cattle move about neither they step nor they lowing could be hear and the bell still ring through the air keep up its peaceful lamentation with this repeat tinkle the thought of the young woman lose themselves in old memory of she youth and school-day she remember the great candlestick that rise above the vase full of flower on the altar and the tabernacle with its small column she would have like to be once more lose in the long line of white veil mark off here and there by the stiff black hood of the good sister bend over they prie-dieu this be the language in which he religious sentiment be express and yet we have understand from the government attorney that scepticism reign in m flaubert 's book from one end to the other where i pray you have you find this scepticism the government attorney : i have not say that there be any of it in its inner meaning m senard : if not in its inner meaning where then be it in you cutting evidently but here be the work entire as the court will judge it and it can see that the religious sentiment be so forcefully imprint there that the accusation of scepticism be pure slander and now the government attorney will permit I to say to he that it be not for the purpose of accuse the author of scepticism that all this trouble have be make let we proceed : at mass on sunday when she look up she see the gentle face of the virgin amid the blue smoke of the rise incense then she be move she feel herself weak and quite desert like the down of a bird whirl by the tempest and it be unconsciously that she go towards the church incline to no matter what devotions so that she soul be absorb and all existence lose in it this gentleman be the first appeal of religion to hold emma from the trend of she passion she have fall poor woman and then be repel by the foot of the man to whom she abandon herself she be nearly dead but raise herself and become reanimated and you shall see now what be write in the 15th of November number 1856 page 548 : one day when at the height of she illness she have think herself die and have ask for the communion and while they be make the preparation in she room for the sacrament while they be turn the night-table cover with sirup into a altar and while félicité be strew dahlia flower on the floor emma feel some power pass over she that free she from she pain from all perception from all feel she body relieved no longer think another life be begin it seem to she that she being mount toward god would be annihilate in that love like a burning insense that melt into vapor -lrb- you see that this be the language in which m flaubert speak of religious thing -rrb- the bed-clothes be sprinkle with holy water the priest draw from the holy pyx the white wafer and it be faint with a celestial joy that she put out she lip to accept the body of the savior present to she i ask the pardon of the government attorney i ask the court 's pardon for interrupt this passage but i must need say that it be the author who be speak and bring to you notice in what term he express the mystery of the communion before go on with the reading i must need impress the literary value of this picture upon the court and insist that they seize upon these expression which be the author 's own : the curtain of the alcove float gently round she like cloud and the ray of the two taper burn on the night-table seem to shine like dazzling halo then she let she head fall back fancy she hear in space the music of seraphic harp and perceive in a azure sky on a golden throne in the midst of saint hold green palm god the father resplendent with majesty who with a sign send to earth angel with wing of fire to carry she away in they arm \* \* \* \* \* this splendid vision dwelt in she memory as the most beautiful thing that it be possible to dream so that now she strive to recall she sensation that still last however but in a less exclusive fashion and with a deeper sweetness she soul tortured by pride at length find rest in christian humility and tasting the joy of weakness she see within herself the destruction of she will that must have leave a wide entrance for the inroad of heavenly grace there exist then in the place of happiness still greater joy -- another love beyond all love without pause and without end one that would grow eternally she see amid the illusion of she hope a state of purity float above the earth mingle with heaven to which she aspire she want to become a saint she buy chaplet and wear amulet she wish to have in she room by the side of she bed a reliquary set in emerald that she might kiss it every evening here be some of he religious sentiment and if you wish to pause a moment to consider the author 's thought i will ask you to turn the page and read the first three line of the second paragraph : she grow provoke at the doctrine of religion the arrogance of the polemic writings displeased she by they inveteracy in attack people she do not know and the secular story relieve with religion seem to she write in such ignorance of the world that they insensibly estrange she from the truth for whose proof she be look this be the language of m flaubert now if you please we come to another scene that of the extreme unction oh mr government attorney how you have deceive yourself when stop at the first word you accuse my client of mingle the sacred with the profane when he have be content to translate the beautiful formula of extreme unction at the moment when the priest touch the organ of sense at the moment where accord to the ritual he say : _ per istam unctionem et suam piissimam misericordiam indulgeat tibus dominus quid-quid deliquistus _ you say it be not necessary to touch upon holy thing with what right do you misinterpret these holy word : may god in he holy pity pardon you for all the sin that you have commit through sight taste hearing etc wait i be go to read the condemn passage and that will be all my vengeance i dare say vengeance because the author have need of be avenge yes it be necessary for m flaubert to go out of here not only acquit but avenge you will see from what kind of read he have be nourish the condemn passage be on page 271 of the December 15th number and run thus : pale as a statue and with eye red as fire charle not weep stand opposite she at the foot of the bed while the priest bend one knee be mutter word in a low voice this whole picture be magnificent and the wording of it irresistible but be quiet and i will not prolong it beyond measure now here be the condemnation she turn she face slowly and seem fill with joy on see suddenly the violet steal no doubt finding again in the midst of a temporary lull in she pain the lose voluptuousness of she first mystical transport with the vision of eternal beatitude that be begin the priest rise to take the crucifix : then she stretch forward she neck as one who be athirst and glue she lip to the body of the man-god she press upon it with all she expire strength the fullest kiss of love that she have ever give the extreme unction have not yet begin but we be reproach for this kiss i be not go to search in the history of saint theresa whom you perhaps know but the memory of whom be too far away i be not go to seek in fénelon for the mysticism of madame guyon nor in more modern mysticism in which i find much reason i only wish to ask of those school which you designate as belong to sensual christianity the explanation of this kiss it be bossuet bossuet himself of whom i would ask it : obey and strive finally to enter into the disposition of jesus in commune which be the disposition of harmony joy and love the whole gospel proclaim it jesus wish that we may be with he he wish to rejoice and he wish we to rejoice with he : he have give himself etc i continue the reading of the condemn passage : then he recite the _ misereatur _ and the _ indulgentiam _ dip he right thumb in the oil and begin to give extreme unction first upon the eye that have so coveted all worldly pomp then upon the nostril greedy for warm breeze and amorous perfume then upon the mouth that have utter lie that curl with pride and cry out in lewdness then upon the hand that have delight in sensual touch and finally upon the sole of foot so swift of yore when she be run to satisfy she desire and that now would walk no more the curé wipe he finger throw the bit of cotton dip in oil into the fire and come and sit down by the die woman to tell she that she must now blend she suffering with those of jesus christ and abandon herself to the divine mercy finish he exhortation he try to place in she hand a bless candle symbol of the celestial glory with which she be soon to be surround emma too weak could not close she finger and the taper but for monsieur bournisien would have fall to the ground however she be not quite so pale and she face have a expression of serenity as if the sacrament have cure she the priest do not fail to point this out he even explain to bovary that the lord sometimes prolong the life of person when he think it meet for they salvation and charle remember the day when so near death she have receive the communion perhaps there be no need to despair he think now when a woman die and the priest go to give she extreme unction if one portray that mystic scene and translate for we the sacramental word with scrupulous fidelity they say that he have touch upon holy thing that he have put a rash hand on sacred matter because to the _ deliquistus per oculo per os per aurem per manus et per pedes _ he have add the sin which each of the organ have commit but we be not the first to walk in this path m sainte-beuve in a book which you know have also a scene of extreme unction and here be how he express it : oh yes upon the eye first as the most noble and most alive of the sens upon those eye for what they have see and regard too tenderly or that which be too perfidious in other ' eye or too mortal for what they have read and re-read of endearment that be too dear for what they have pour out in vain tear over fragile goods and faithless creature for the sleep which they have too often forget think only of the evening upon the ear also for what they have hear and allow themselves to hear that be too sweet too flattering and intoxicating for that sound which the ear steal from deceptive word for what it drink in from steal honey then the smell for the too subtle and voluptuous perfume of evening and the springtime in the depth of the wood for flower receive in the morning and all through the day and breathe in with so much pleasure upon the lip for what they have pronounce that be too confused or too open for what they do not reply at certain moment or what they have not reveal to certain person for what they have sing in solitude that be too melodious and too full of tear for they inarticulate murmur and for they silence upon the neck in the place of on the breast for the ardor of desire accord to the consecrate expression -lrb- _ propter ardorem libidini _ -rrb- yes for the grief in affection and the rivalry for too much anguish in human tenderness for the tear which be suffocate in a voiceless throat for all that go to wind the heart and break it upon the hand also for have seize a hand which be not bind to holiness for have receive too burn tear perhaps for have begin to write and for finish a response not lawful upon the foot for not have flee for not have be satisfy with long solitary walk for not have be weary soon enough in the midst of temptation which be ever begin anew you do not prosecute that here be two man who each in he own sphere have take the same thing and who have accord to he own idea add the sin the fault can it be that you make a indictment for simply translate the formulum of the ritual : _ quidquid deliquistus per oculo per aurem _ etc m flaubert have do just what m sainte-beuve do without plagiarize he have make use of a right which belong to any writer to add to what another have say and complete the subject the last scene of the romance of _ madame bovary _ have be make a complete study of this kind from religious document m flaubert have take the scene of the extreme unction from a book which a venerable ecclesiastic one of he friend lend to he this same friend have read the scene and be move to tear not imagine that the majesty of religion be in any way offend the book be entitle : _ a historic dogmatic moral liturgical and canonical explanation of the catechism with a answer to the objection

of tour of bordeaux of cologne etc vol iii print at man by charle monnoyer 1851 now you shall see in this book as you see just now in bossuet 's the principle and in a certain way the text of the passage which the government have condemn it be no longer m sainte-beuve a artist a literary rhapsodist whom i be quote we now listen to the church itself : extreme unction can give back health to the body if it be useful to the glory of god and the priest say that this often happen now here be the extreme unction : the priest address the sick with a short exhortation if he be in a state to hear it in order to dispose he worthily to receive the sacrament which be to be administer to he the priest then pass the unction upon the sick person with the stiletto or the extremity of he right thumb which he dip each time in the oil this unction should be make especially upon the five part of the body which nature have give to man as the organ of sensation namely : the eye the ear the nostril the mouth and the hand as the priest make the unction -lrb- we have follow from point to point the ritual which we have copy -rrb- he pronounce the word which correspond to they _ to the eye upon the closed eyeball _ : through this holy unction and he divine pity may god pardon all the sin that you have commit through sight the sick person should at this moment have a new hatred of all the sin commit through sight : such as indiscreet look criminal curiosity and read what have cause to be bear in he a host of thought contrary to faith or moral what have m flaubert do he have put in the mouth of the priest by unite the two part what should be in he thought and also those of the sick person he have copy purely and simply _ to the ear _ : through this holy unction and through he divine pity may god pardon all the sin that you have commit through the sense of hear the sick person should at this moment detest anew all the error of which he be guilty from listen with pleasure to slander calumny propose dishonesty and obscene song _ to the nostril _ : through this holy unction and he divine pity may the lord pardon all the sin that you have commit through the sense of smell at this moment the sick person should detest anew all the sin that he have commit through the sense of smell he refined and voluptuous search for perfume all he sensibility all that he have breathe in of

it within _ upon the foot _ : through this holy unction and he great pity may god pardon all the sin that you have commit in you walk the sick man ought at this moment to detest anew all the step that he have take in the path of iniquity such as scandalous walk and criminal interview the unction of the foot be make upon the top or on the sole accord to the convenience of the sick person and accord to the custom of the diocese where it take place the most common practice seem to be to make it on the sole of the foot and finally upon the breast -lrb- m sainte-beuve have copy this we have not because it be concern with the breast of a woman -rrb- _ propter ardorem libidini _ etc _ on the breast _ : through this holy unction and he great pity may the lord pardon all the sin which have be commit from the ardor of the passion the sick man ought at this moment to detest anew all the bad thought to which he have abandon himself all sentiment of hatred or vengeance that he have nourish in he heart and follow the ritual we could have speak of something more than the breast but god know what holy anger would have be arouse in the public attorney 's office if we have speak of the loin _ to the loin _ : through this holy unction and he great pity may the lord pardon all the sin that you have commit by irregular impulse of the flesh if we have say that what a thunderbolt you would have have with which to attempt to crush we mr attorney and nevertheless the ritual add : the sick man ought at this moment to detest anew all illicit pleasure carnal delight etc this be the ritual and you have see the condemn article it have nothing of raillery in it but be serious and earnest and i repeat to you that he who lend my client this book and see my client make the use of it that he have have take he by the hand with tear in he eye you see then mr government attorney how rash -- not to use a expression which in order to be exact be not too severe -- be you accusation of we touch upon holy thing you see now that we have not mingle the profane with the sacred when at each sense we indicate the sin commit by that sense since it be the language of the church itself i insist now upon mention the other detail of the charge of outrage against religion the public minister say to I : it be no longer religion but the moral of all time that you have outrage you have insult death how have we insult death because at the moment when this woman die there pass in the street a man whom she have meet more than once to whom she have give alms from she carriage as she be go to she adulterous meeting a blind man whom she be accustom to see who sing he song walk along slowly by the side of she carriage to whom she throw a piece of money but whose countenance make she shiver this man be pass in the street and at the moment when divine pity pardon or promise pardon to the unfortunate woman who be expiate the fault of she life by a frightful death human raillery appear to she in the form of the song under she window great heaven you find a outrage in this but m flaubert have only do what shakespeare and goethe have do who at the supreme moment of death have not fail to make hear some chant or perhaps plaint or it might be raillery which recall to he who be pass to eternity some pleasure which he will never more enjoy or some fault to be atone let we read : in fact she look around she slowly as one awaken from a dream then in a distinct voice she ask for she looking-glass and remain some time bend over it until the big tear fall from she eye then she turn away she head with a sigh and fall back upon the pillow i could not read it i be like lamartine : the punishment seem to I to go beyond truth i should not consider that i be do a bad deed mr attorney in read these page to my married daughter honest girl who have have a good example and good teaching and who would never never go away from the straight path for indiscretion or away from thing that could and ought to be understand it be impossible for I to continue this reading and i shall hold myself rigorously to the condemn passage : as the death-rattle become stronger -lrb- charle be by she side the man whom you do not see but who be admirable -rrb- the priest pray faster he prayer mingle with bovary 's stifled sob and sometimes all seem lose in the muffle murmur of the latin syllable that toll like a pass bell suddenly on the pavement be hear a loud noise of clog and the clattering of a stick and a voice a raucous voice sing : ` maid in the warmth of a summer day dream of love and of love alway the wind be strong this summer day she petticoat be blow away ' emma raise herself like a galvanized corpse she hair undo she eye fix stare where the sickle blade have be nannette gathering ear of corn pass bend down my queen to the earth where they be bear ` the blind man she cry and emma begin to laugh a atrocious frantic despairing laugh think she see the hideous face of the poor wretch that stand out against the eternal night like a menace she fall back upon the mattress in a convulsion they all draw near she be dead you see gentleman in this supreme moment a recall of she sin and with it remorse and all that go with it of poignancy and fear it be not alone the whim of a artist wish only to make a contrast without a purpose or a moral she hear the blind man in the street singing the frightful song he have sing when she be return all in a perspiration and hideous from a adulterous meeting it be the same blind man whom she see at each of those meeting the blind man who pursue she with he song and he importunity it be he who come now to personify human rage at the instant when divine pity come to she and follow she to the supreme moment of death and this be call a outrage against public moral but i say on the contrary that it be a homage to public moral that there be nothing more moral than this i say that in this book the vice of education be awake that it be take from the true from the living flesh of we society and that at each stroke the author place before we this question : have you do what you ought for the education of you daughter be the religion you have give they such as will sustain they in the tempest of life or be it only a mass of carnal superstition which leave they without support when the storm rage have you teach they that life be not the realization of chimerical dream that it be something prosaic to which it be necessary to accommodate oneself have you teach they that have you do what you ought for they happiness have you say to they : poor child outside the route i have point out to you in the pleasure you may pursue only disgust await you trouble disorder dilapidation convulsion and execution and you will see that if anything be lack in the picture the sheriff 's officer be there there too be the jew who have seize and sell she furniture to satisfy the caprice of this woman and the husband be still ignorant of this nothing remain for the unfortunate woman except death but say the public minister she death be voluntary this woman die in she own time but how could she live be she not condemn have she not drunk to the last dregs she shame and baseness yes upon we stage we show woman who have stray -lrb- and i can not say what they have do -rrb- as happy charming and smile _ questam corpore facerant _ i limit myself to this remark : when they show they to we happy charming envelop in muslin present a gracious hand to count marquis and duke often respond themselves to the name of countess or duchess you call that respect public moral but the man who depict the adulterous woman die a shameful death commit a outrage against public moral now i do not wish to say it be not you opinion that you have express since you have express it but you have yield to a prejudice no it can not be you the husband the father of a family the man who be there it be not you that be not possible without the prejudice of the speech of the prosecution and a preconceived idea you would never say that m flaubert be the author of a bad book surely leave to you inspiration you appreciation would be the same as mine i do not speak from a literary point of view but from a moral and religious standard as you understand it and i understand it you and i could not differ they have say furthermore that we have bring upon the scene a materialistic curate we take the curate as we take the husband he be not a eminent ecclesiastic but a ordinary priest a country curate and as we have insult no one express no thought or sentiment that could be injurious to a husband so we have insult no ecclesiastic i have only a word to say beyond this do you wish to read book in which ecclesiastic play a deplorable rôle take _ gil bla _ _ the canon _ -lrb- of balzac -rrb- _ nôtre-dame de paris _ of victor hugo if you wish to read of priest who be the shame of the clergy seek they elsewhere for you will not find they in _ madame bovary _ what have we show a country curate who in he function of country curate be like m bovary a ordinary man have i represent he as a gourmand a libertine or a drunkard i have not say a word of that kind i have represent he fulfil he ministry not with elevated intelligence but as he nature allow he to fulfill it i have put in contact with he and in a almost continual state of discussion a type which live -- as the creature of m prudhomme live -- as all other creation of we time will live who be take from truth and which it be not possible for one to forget and that be the country pharmacist the voltairean the sceptic the incredulous man who be in a perpetual quarrel with the curate but in these quarrel who be it that be beat buffet and ridicule it be homai to he be the most comic rôle give because he be the most true because he best paint we sceptical epoch a fury whom we call a priest-hater permit I still to read to you page 206 it be the good woman of the inn who offer something to she curate : ` what can i do for you monsieur le curé ' ask the landlady as she reach down from the chimney one of the copper candlestick place with they candle in a row ` will you take something a thimbleful of _ cassis _ a glass of wine ' the priest decline very politely he have come for he umbrella that he have forget the other day at the ernemont convent and after ask madame lefrançois to have it send to he at the presbytery in the evening he leave for the church from which the angelus be ring when the chemist no longer hear the noise of he boot along the square he think the priest 's behavior just now very unbecoming this refusal to take any refreshment seem to he the most odious hypocrisy all priest tipple on the sly and be try to bring back the day of the tithe the landlady take up the defense of she curé ` besides he could double up four man like you over he knee last year he help we people to bring in the straw he carry as many as six truss at once he be so strong ' ` bravo ' say the chemist ` now just send you daughter to confess to fellow with such a temperament i if i be the government i would have the priest bleed once a month yes madame lefrançois every month -- a good phlebotomy in the interest of the police and moral ' ` be quiet monsieur homai you be a infidel you have no religion ' the chemist answer : ' i have a religion my religion and i even have more than all these other with they mummery and they juggling i adore god on the contrary i believe in the supreme be in a creator whatever he may be i care little who have place we here below to fulfill we duty as citizen and father of family but i do not need to go to church to kiss silver plate and fatten out of my pocket a lot of good-for-nothing who live better than we do for one can know he as well in a wood in a field or even contemplate the eternal vault like the ancient my god mine be the god of socrate of franklin of voltaire and béranger i be for the profession of faith of the ` savoyard vicar ' and the immortal principle of '89 and i can not admit of a old boy of a god who take walk in he garden with a cane in he hand who lodge he friend in the belly of whale die utter a cry and rise again at the end of three day thing absurd in themselves and completely oppose moreover to all physical law which prove to we by the way that priest have always wallow in torpid ignorance in which they would fain engulf the people with they ' he cease look round for a audience for in he bubble over the chemist have for a moment fancy himself in the midst of the town council but the landlady no longer heed he she be listen to a distant roll what be this a dialogue a scene such as occur each time that homai have occasion to speak of priest there be something better in the last passage of page 271 : public attention be distract by the appearance of monsieur bournisien who be go across the market with the holy oil homai as we due to he principle compare priest to raven attract by the odour of death the sight of a ecclesiastic be personally disagreeable to he for the cassock make he think of the shroud and he detest the one from some fear of the other we old friend he who lend we the catechism be very happy over this phrase he say to we : it be a true hit it be indeed the portrait of a _ priestophobe _ whom the cassock make think of a shroud and who hold one in execration from a little fear of the other he be impious and he profane the cassock a little through impiety perhaps but much more because he be make to think of a shroud permit I to make a _ résumé _ of all this i be defend a man who if he have meet a literary criticism upon the form of he book or upon certain expression or on too much detail upon one point or another would have accept that literary criticism with the best heart in the world but to find himself accuse of a outrage against moral and religion m flaubert have not recover from it and he protest here before you with all the astonishment and all the energy of which he be capable against such a accusation you be not of the sort to condemn book upon certain line you be of the sort to judge after reflection to judge of the way of put a work and you will put this question with which i begin my plea and with which i shall end it : do the reading of such a book give a love of vice or inspire a horror of it do not a punishment so terrible drive one to virtue and encourage it the reading of this book can not produce upon you a impression other than it have produce upon we namely : that the work be excellent as a whole and that the detail in it be irreproachable all classic literature authorize the painting of scene like these we be pass upon with this understanding we might have take one for a model which we have not do we have impose upon ourselves a sobriety which we ask you to take into account if as be possible m flaubert have overstep the bind he place for himself in one word or another i have only to remind you that this be a first work but i should then have to tell you that he error be simply one of self-deception and be without damage to public moral and in make he come into court -- he whom you know a little now by he book he whom you already love a little and will love more i be sure when you know he better -- be enough of a punishment a punishment already too cruel and now it be for you to decide you have already judge the book as a whole and in its detail it be not possible for you to hesitate \* \* \* \* \* the decision the court have give audience for a part of the last week to the debate of the suit bring against mm léon laurent-pichat and auguste-alexis pillet the first the director the second the printer of a periodical publication call the _ revue de paris _ and m

isolatedly present effectively either expression or image or picture which good taste reprove and which be of a nature to make a attack upon legitimate and honorable susceptibility _ be it known _ that the same observation can justly be apply to other passage not define by the ordinance of dismissal and which in the first place seem to present a exposition of theory which would at least be contrary to the good custom and institution which be the basis of we society as well as to a respect for the most August ceremony of divine worship _ be it known _ that from these diverse title the work bring before the court merit severe blame since the mission of literature should be to ornament and recreate the mind by raise the intelligence and purify manners rather than by show the disgust of vice in offer a picture of disorder which may exist in we society _ be it known _ that the defendant and particularly gustave flaubert energetically deny the charge bring against they set forth that the romance submit to the judgment of the court have a eminently moral aim that the author have principally in view the expose of danger which result from a education not appropriate to the sphere in which one life and that pursuant to this idea he have show the woman the principal personage in the romance aspire towards the world and a society for which she be not make unhappy in she modest condition where she be place by fate forget first she duty as a mother afterward lack in she duty as a wife introduce successively into she house adultery and ruin and end miserably by suicide after pass through all degree of the most complete degradation have even descend to theft _ be it known _ that this datum moral without doubt in principle must be complete in its development by a certain severity of language and by a reserve direct especially towards that which touch the exposition of the picture and situation which the author have employ in place it before the eye of the public _ be it known _ that it be not allow under pretext of painting character or local color to reproduce the fact word and gesture of the digression of the personage which a writer give himself the mission to paint that a like system apply to work of the mind as well as to production of the fine art would lead to a realism which would be the reverse of the beautiful and the good and which bring forth work equally offensive to the eye and to the mind would commit a continual outrage against public moral and good manners _ be it known _ that there be limit which literature even the lightest should not pass and of which gustave flaubert and the co-indicted have not take sufficient account _ be it known _ that the work of which flaubert be the author be a work which appear to be long and seriously elaborate from a literary point of view and as a study of character that the passage come under the ordinance for dismissal as reprehensible as they may be be few in number as compare with the extent of the work that these passage either in the idea they expose or in the situation they represent bring out as a whole the character which the author wish to paint although exaggerated and impregnate with a vulgar realism often shocking _ be it known _ that gustave flaubert affirm he respect for good manners and all that attach itself to religious moral that it do not appear that he book have be write like certain other book with the sole aim of give satisfaction to the sensual passion to a spirit of license and debauch or of ridicule thing which should be hold in the respect of all that he have do wrong only in lose sight of the rule which every writer who respect himself ought never to lose sight of or forget : that literature like art in order to accomplish the good which
