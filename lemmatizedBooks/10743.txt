mile from the sea on the right or west bank of the fleet stream this rivulet which be so narrow as it pass the house that i have know a good jumper clear it without a pole broaden out into salt marsh below the village and lose itself at last in a lake of brackish water the lake be good for nothing except sea-fowl heron and oyster and form such a place as they call in the indy a lagoon be shut off from the open channel by a monstrous great beach or dike of pebble of which i shall speak more hereafter when i be a child i think that this place be call moonfleet because on a still night whether in summer or in winter frost the moon shine very brightly on the lagoon but learn afterwards that 'twa but short for ` mohune-fleet ' from the mohune a great family who be once lord of all these part my name be john trenchard and i be fifteen year of age when this story begin my father and mother have both be dead for year and i board with my aunt miss arnold who be kind to I in she own fashion but too strict and precise ever to make I love she i shall first speak of one evening in the fall of the year 1757 it must have be late in October though i have forget the exact date and i sit in the little front parlor reading after tea my aunt have few book a bible a common prayer and some volume of sermon be all that i can recollect now but the reverend mr glennie who teach we village child have lend I a story-book full of interest and adventure call the _ arabian night entertainment _ at last the light begin to fail and i be nothing loth to leave off read for several reason as first the parlor be a chilly room with horse-hair chair and sofa and only a coloured-paper screen in the grate for my aunt do not allow a fire till the first of November second there be a rank smell of molten tallow in the house for my aunt be dip winter candle on frame in the back kitchen third i have reach a part in the _ arabian night _ which tighten my breath and make I wish to leave off read for very anxiousness of expectation it be that point in the story of the ` wonderful lamp ' where the false uncle let fall a stone that seal the mouth of the underground chamber and immure the boy aladdin in the darkness because he would not give up the lamp till he stand safe on the surface again this scene remind I of one of those dreadful nightmare where we dream we be shut in a little room the wall of which be close in upon we and so impressed I that the memory of it serve as a warning in a adventure that befall I later on so i give up reading and step out into the street it be a poor street at best though once no doubt it have be finer now there be not two hundred soul in moonfleet and yet the house that hold they straggle sadly over half a mile lie at interval along either side of the road nothing be ever make new in the village if a house want repair badly it be pull down and so there be toothless gap in the street and overrun garden with broken-down wall and many of the house that yet stand look as though they could stand but little longer the sun have set indeed it be already so dusk that the lower or sea-end of the street be lose from sight there be a little fog or smoke-wreath in the air with a odour of burn weed and that first frosty feeling of the autumn that make we think of glowing fire and the comfort of long winter evening to come all be very still but i could hear the tap of a hammer farther down the street and walk to see what be do for we have no trade in moonfleet save that of fishing it be ratsey the sexton at work in a shed which open on the street letter a tombstone with a mallet and graver he have be mason before he become fisherman and be handy with he tool so that if anyone want a headstone set up in the churchyard he go to ratsey to get it do i lend over the half-door and watch he a minute chip away with the graver in a bad light from a lantern then he look up and see I say : ` here john if you have nothing to do come in and hold the lantern for I ` tis but a half-hour 's job to get all finish ' ratsey be always kind to I and have lend I a chisel many a time to make boat so i step in and hold the lantern watch he chink out the bit of portland stone with a graver and blinking the while when they come too near my eye the inscription stand complete but he be put the finish touch to a little sea-piece carve at the top of the stone which show a schooner board a cutter i think it fine work at the time but know now that it be rough enough indeed you may see it for yourself in moonfleet churchyard to this day and read the inscription too though it be yellow with lichen and not so plain as it be that night this be how it run : sacred to the memory of david block aged 15 who be kill by a shot fire from the _ elector _ schooner 21 June 1757 of life bereft -lrb- by fall design -rrb- i mingle with my fellow clay on god 's protection i recline to save I in the judgement day there too must you cruel man appear repent ere it be all too late or else a dreadful sentence fear for god will sure revenge my fate the reverend mr glennie write the verse and i know they by heart for he have give I a copy indeed the whole village have ring with the tale of david 's death and it be yet in every mouth he be only child to elzevir block who keep the why not inn at the bottom of the village and be with the contrabandier when they ketch be board that June night by the government schooner people say that it be magistrate maskew of moonfleet manor who have put the revenue man on the track and anyway he be on board the _ elector _ as she overhaul the ketch there be some show of fight when the vessel first come alongside of one another and maskew draw a pistol and fire it off in young david 's face with only the two gunwale between they in the afternoon of midsummer 's day the _ elector _ bring the ketch into moonfleet and there be a posse of constable to march the smuggler off to dorchester jail the prisoner trudge up through the village iron two and two together while people stand at they door or follow they the man greet they with a kindly word for we know most of they as ringstave and monkbury man and the woman sorrow for they wife but they leave david 's body in the ketch so the boy pay dear for he night 's frolic ` ay 'twas a cruel cruel thing to fire on so young a lad ' ratsey say as he step back a pace to study the effect of a flag that he be chisel on the revenue schooner ` and trouble be likely to come to the other poor fellow take for lawyer empson say three of they will surely hang at next assize i recollect ' he go on ` thirty year ago when there be a bit of a scuffle between the _ royal sophy _ and the _ marnhull _ they hang four of the contrabandier and my old father catch he death of cold what with go to see the poor chap turn off at dorchester and stand up to he knee in the river frome to get a sight of they for all the countryside be there and such a press there be no place on land there that be enough ' he say turn again to the gravestone ` on Monday i 'll line the port in black and get a brush of red to pick out the flag and now my son you have help with the lantern so come down to the why not and there i 'll have a word with elzevir who sadly need the talk of kindly friend to cheer he and we 'll find you a glass of holland to keep out autumn chill ' i be but a lad and think it a vast honor to be ask to the why not -- for do not such a invitation raise I at once to the dignity of manhood ah sweet boyhood how eager be we as boy to be quit of thee with what regret do we look back on thee before we man 's race be half-way run yet be not my pleasure without alloy for i fear even to think of what aunt jane would say if she know that i have be at the why not -- and beside that i stand in awe of grim old elzevir block grimmer and sadder a thousand time since david 's death the why not be not the real name of the inn it be properly the mohune arm the mohune have once own as i have say the whole of the village but they fortune fall and with they fall the fortune of moonfleet the ruin of they mansion show gray on the hillside above the village they almshouse stand half-way down the street with the quadrangle desert and overgrow the mohune image and superscription be on everything from the church to the inn and everything that bear it be stamp also with the superscription of decay and here it be necessary that i say a few word as to this family badge for as you will see i be to bear it all my life and shall carry its impress with I to the grave the mohune shield be plain white or silver and bear nothing upon it except a great black ' y i call it a ` y ' though the reverend mr glennie once explain to I that it be not a ` y ' at all but what herald call a _ cross-pall cross-pall _ or no _ cross-pall _ it look for all the world like a black ` y ' with a broad arm end in each of the top corner of the shield and the tail come down into the bottom you might see that cognizance carve on the manor and on the stonework and woodwork of the church and on a score of house in the village and it hang on the signboard over the door of the inn everyone know the mohune ` y ' for mile around and a former landlord have call the inn the why not in jest the name have stick to it ever since more than once on winter evening when man be drink in the why not i have stand outside and listen to they singing ` ducky-stone ' or ` keg bob one two three ' or some of the other tune that sailor sing in the west such song have neither begin nor end and very little sense to catch hold of in the middle one man would crone the air and the other would crone a solemn chorus but there be little hard drinking for elzevir block never get drunk himself and do not like he guest to get drunk either on singing night the room grow hot and the steam stand so thick on the glass inside that one could not see in but at other time when there be no company i have peep through the red curtain and watch elzevir block and ratsey playing backgammon at the trestle-table by the fire it be on the trestle-table that block have afterwards lay out he son 's dead body and some say they have look through the window at night and see the father try to wash the blood-mat out of the boy 's yellow hair and hear he groan and talk to the lifeless clay as if it could understand anyhow there have be little drinking in the inn since that time for block grow more and more silent and morose he have never court customer and now he scowl on any that come so that man look on the why not as a blighted spot and go to drink at the three chough at ringstave my heart be in my mouth when ratsey lift the latch and lead I into the inn parlor it be a low sanded room with no light except a fire of seawood on the hearth burning clear and lambent with blue salt flame there be table at each end of the room and wooden-seated chair round the wall and at the trestle table by the chimney sit elzevir block smoking a long pipe and look at the fire he be a man of fifty with a shock of grizzled hair a broad but not unkindly face of regular feature bushy eyebrow and the finest forehead that i ever see he frame be thick-set and still immensely strong indeed the countryside be full of tale of he strange prowess or endurance block have be landlord at the why not father and son for year but elzevir 's mother come from the low country and that be how he get he outland name and could speak dutch few man know much of he and folk often wonder how it be he keep the why not on so little custom as go that way yet he never seem to lack for money and if people love to tell story of he strength they would speak also of widow help and sick comfort with unknown gift and hint that some of they come from elzevir block for all he be so grim and silent he turn round and get up as we come in and my fear lead I to think that he face darken when he see I ` what do this boy want ' he say to ratsey sharply ` he want the same as i want and that be a glass of ararat milk to keep out autumn chill ' the sexton answer draw another chair up to the trestle-table ` cow ' milk be best for child such as he ' be elzevir 's answer as he take two shine brass candlestick from the mantel-board set they on the table and light the candle with a burn chip from the hearth ` john be no child he be the same age as david and come from help I to finish david 's headstone ` tis finish now bar the paint upon the ship and please god by Monday night we will have it set fair and square in the churchyard and then the poor lad may rest in peace know he have above he master ratsey 's best handiwork and the parson 's verse to set forth how shamefully he come to he end ' i think that elzevir soften a little as ratsey speak of he son and he say ` ay david rest in peace ` tis they that bring he to he end that shall not rest in peace when they time come and it may come sooner than they think ' he add speak more to himself than to we i know that he mean mr maskew and recollect that some have warn the magistrate that he have better keep out of elzevir 's way for there be no know what a desperate man might do and yet the two have meet since in the village street and nothing worse come of it than a scowling look from block ` tush man ' break in the sexton ` it be the foulest deed ever man do but let not thy mind brood on it nor think how thou mayest get thyself avenge leave that to providence for he whose wisdom let such thing be do will surely see they meet they due reward vengeance be mine i will repay saith the lord ' and he take he hat off and hang it on a peg block do not answer but set three glass on the table and then take out from a cupboard a little round long-necked bottle from which he pour out a glass for ratsey and himself then he half-fill the third and push it along the table to I say ` there take it lad if thou wilt ` twill do thee no good but may do thee no harm ' ratsey raise he glass almost before it be fill he sniff the liquor and smack he lip ' o rare milk of ararat ' he say ` it be sweet and strong and set the heart at ease and now get the backgammon-board john and set it for we on the table ' so they fall to the game and i take a sly sip at the liquor but nearly choke myself not be use to strong water and find it heady and burning in the throat neither man speak and there be no sound except the constant rattle of the dice and the rubbing of the piece be move across the board now and then one of the player stop to light he pipe and at the end of a game they score they total on the table with a bit of chalk so i watch they for a hour know the game myself and be interested at see elzevir 's backgammon-board which i have hear talk of before it have form part of the furniture of the why not for generation of landlord and serve perhaps to pass time for cavalier of the civil war all be of oak black and polished board dice-box and man but round the edge run a latin inscription inlay in light wood which i read on that first evening but do not understand till mr glennie translate it to I i have cause to remember it afterwards so i shall set it down here in latin for those who know that tongue _ ita in vita ut in lusu alae pessima jactura arte corrigenda est _ and in english as mr glennie translate it _ as in life so in a game of hazard skill will make something of the worst of throw _ at last elzevir look up and speak to I not unkindly ` lad it be time for you to go home man say that blackboard walk on the first night of winter and some have meet he face to face betwixt this house and yours ' i see he want to be rid of I so bid they both good night and be off home run all the way thither though not from any fear of blackbeard for ratsey have often tell I that there be no chance of meet he unless one pass the churchyard by night blackbeard be one of the mohune who have die a century back and be bury in the vault under the church with other of he family but could not rest there whether as some say because he be always look for a lose treasure or as other because of he exceed wickedness in life if this last be the true reason he must have be bad indeed for mohune have die before and since he day wicked enough to bear anyone company in they vault or elsewhere man would have it that on dark winter night blackbeard might be see with a old-fashioned lanthorn digging for treasure in the graveyard and those who profess to know say he be the tallest of man with full black beard coppery face and such evil eye that any who once meet they gaze must die within a year however that might be there be few in moonfleet who would not rather walk ten mile round than go near the churchyard after dark and once when cracky jone a poor doited body be find there one summer morning lie dead on the grass it be think that he have meet blackbeard in the night mr glennie who know more about such thing than anyone else tell I that blackbeard be none other than a certain colonel john mohune deceased about one hundred year ago he would have it that colonel mohune in the dreadful war against king charle the first have desert the allegiance of he house and support the cause of the rebel so be make governor of carisbrooke castle for the parliament he become there the king 's jailer but be false to he trust for the king carry constantly hide about he person a great diamond which have once be give he by he brother king of france mohune get wind of this jewel and promise that if it be give he he would wink at he majesty 's escape then this wicked man have take the bribe play traitor again come with a file of soldier at the hour appoint for the king 's flight find he majesty escape through a window have he away to a stricter ward and report to the parliament that the king 's escape be only prevent by colonel mohune 's watchfulness but how true as mr glennie say that we should not be envious against the ungodly against the man that walketh after evil counsel suspicion fall on colonel mohune he be remove from he governorship and come back to he home at moonfleet there he live in seclusion despise by both party in the state until he die about the time of the happy restoration of king charle the second but even after he death he could not get rest for man say that he have hide somewhere that treasure give he to permit the king 's escape and that not daring to reclaim it have let the secret die with he and so must need come out of he grave to try to get at it again mr glennie would never say whether he believe the tale or not point out that apparition both of good and evil spirit be relate in holy scripture but that the churchyard be a unlikely spot for colonel mohune to seek he treasure in for have it be bury there he would have have a hundred chance to have it up in he lifetime however this may be though i be brave as a lion by day and use indeed to frequent the churchyard because there be the widest view of the sea to be obtain from it yet no reward would have take I thither at night nor be i myself without some witness to the tale for have to walk to ringstave for dr hawkin on the night my aunt break she leg i take the path along the down which overlook the churchyard at a mile off and thence most certainly see a light move to and fro about the church where no honest man could be at two o'clock in the morning chapter 2 the flood then bank come down with ruin and rout then beat spray fly round about then all the mighty flood be out and all the world be in the sea _ -- jean ingelow _ on the third of November a few day after this visit to the why not the wind which have be blow from the south-west begin about four in the afternoon to rise in sudden strong gust the rook have be pitch-falling all the morning so we know that bad weather be due and when we come out from the schooling that mr glennie give we in the hall of the old almshouse there be wisp of thatch and even stray tile fly from the roof and the child sing : blow wind rise storm ship ashore before morn it be heathenish rhyme that have come down out of other and worse time for though i do not say but that a wreck on moonfleet beach be look upon sometimes as little short of a godsend yet i hope none of we be so wicked as to _ wish _ a vessel to be wreck that we might share in the plunder indeed i have know the man of moonfleet risk they own life a hundred time to save those of shipwrecked mariner as when the _ darius _ east indiaman come ashore nay even poor nameless corpse wash up be sure of christian burial or perhaps of one of master ratsey 's headstone to set forth sex and date as may be see in the churchyard to this day we village lie near the center of moonfleet bay a great bight twenty mile across and a death-trap to up-channel sailor in a south-westerly gale for with that wind blow strong from south if you can not double the snout you must most surely come ashore and many a good ship fail to round that point have beat up and down the bay all day but come to beach in the evening and once on the beach the sea have little mercy for the water be deep right in and the wave curl over full on the pebble with a weight no timber can withstand then if poor fellow try to save themselves there be a deadly under-tow or rush back of the water which suck they off they leg and carry they again under the thunder wave it be that back-suck of the pebble that you may hear for mile inland even at dorchester on still night long after the wind that cause it have sink and which make people turn in they bed and thank god they be not fight with the sea on moonfleet beach but on this third of November there be no wreck only such a wind as i have never know before and only once since all night long the tempest grow fiercer and i think no one in moonfleet go to bed for there be such a breaking of tile and glass such a banging of doon and rattle of shutter that no sleep be possible and we be afraid besides lest the chimney should fall and crush we the wind blow fiercest about five in the morning and then some run up the street call out a new danger -- that the sea be break over the beach and that all the place be like to be flood some of the woman be for flit forthwith and climb the down but master ratsey who be go round with other to comfort people soon show we that the upper part of the village stand so high that if the water be to get thither there be no know if it would not cover ridgedown itself but what with its be a spring-tide and the sea break clean over the great outer beach of pebble -- a thing that have not happen for fifty year -- there be so much water pile up in the lagoon that it pass its bound and flood all the sea meadow and even the lower end of the street so when day break there be the churchyard flood though 'twa on rise ground and the church itself stand up like a steep little island and the water over the door-sill of the why not though elzevir block would not budge say he do not care if the sea sweep he away it be but a nine-hours ' wonder for the wind fall very suddenly the water begin to go back the sun shine bright and before noon people come out to the door to see the flood and talk over the storm most say that never have be so fierce a wind but some of the oldest speak of one in the second year of queen anne and would have it as bad or worse but whether worse or not this storm be a weighty matter enough for I and turn the course of my life as you shall hear i have say that the water come up so high that the church stand out like a island but they go back quickly and mr glennie be able to hold service on the next Sunday morning few enough folk come to moonfleet church at any time but fewer still come that morning for the meadow between the village and the churchyard be wet and miry from the water there be streamer of seaweed tangle about the very tombstone and against the outside of the churchyard wall be pile up a great bank of it from which come a salt rancid smell like a guillemot 's egg that be always in the air after a south-westerly gale have strew the shore with wrack this church be as large as any other i have see and divide into two part with a stone screen across the middle perhaps moonfleet be once a large place and then likely enough there be people to fill such a church but never since i know it do anyone worship in that part call the nave this western portion be quite empty beyond a few old tomb and a royal arm of queen anne the pavement too be damp and mossy and there be green patch down the white wall where the rain have get in so the handful of people that come to church be glad enough to get the other side of the screen in the chancel where at least the pew floor be board over and the panelling of oak-work keep off the draught now this Sunday morning there be only three or four i think beside mr glennie and ratsey and the half-dozen of we boy who cross the swampy meadow strew with drowned shrew-mouse and mole even my aunt be not at church be prevent by a migraine but a surprise wait those who do go for there in a pew by himself sit elzevir block the people stare at he as they come in for no one have ever know he go to church before some say in the village that he be a catholic and other a infidel however that may be there he be this day wish perhaps to show a favor to the parson who have write the verse for david 's headstone he take no notice of anyone nor exchange greeting with those that come in as be the fashion in moonfleet church but keep he eye fix on a prayer-book which he hold in he hand though he could not be follow the minister for he never turn the leaf the church be so damp from the flood that master ratsey have put a fire in the brazier which stand at the back but be not commonly light till the winter have fairly begin we boy sit as close to the brazier as we could for the wet cold strike up from the flag and besides that we be so far from the clergyman and so well screen by the oak back that we could bake a apple or roast a chestnut without much fear of be catch but that morning there be something else to take off we thought for before the service be well begin we become aware of a strange noise under the church the first time it come be just as mr glennie be finish ` dearly beloved ' and we hear it again before the second lesson it be not a loud noise but rather like that which a boat make jostle against another at sea only there be something deeper and more hollow about it we boy look at each other for we know what be under the church and that the sound could only come from the mohune vault no one at moonfleet have ever see the inside of that vault but ratsey be tell by he father who be clerk before he that it underlie half the chancel and that there be more than a score of mohune lie there it have not be open for over forty year since gerald mohune who burst a blood-vessel drinking at weymouth race be bury there but there be a tale that one Sunday afternoon many year back there have come from the vault so horrible and unearthly a cry that parson and people get up and flee from the church and would not worship there for week afterwards we think of these story and huddle up closer to the brazier be frighten at the noise and uncertain whether we should not turn tail and run from the church for it be certain that something be move in the mohune vault to which there be no entrance except by a ringed stone in the chancel floor that have not be lift for forty year however we think better of it and do not budge though i could see when stand up and look over the top of the seat that other beside ourselves be ill at ease for granny tucker give such start when she hear the sound that twice she spectacles fall off she nose into she lap and master ratsey seem to be try to mask the one noise by make another himself whether by shuffling with he foot or by thump down he prayer-book but the thing that most surprised I be that even elzevir block who care man say for neither god nor devil look unquiet and give a quick glance at ratsey every time the sound come so we sit till mr glennie be well on with the sermon he discourse interested I though i be only a boy for he liken life to the letter ` y ' say that ` in each man 's life must come a point where two road part like the arm of a y and that everyone must choose for himself whether he will follow the broad and sloping path on the left or the steep and narrow path on the right for ' say he ` if you will look in you book you will see that the letter y be not like the mohune 's with both arm equal but have the arm on the left broader and more sloping than the arm on the right hence ancient philosopher hold that this arm on the left represent the easy downward road to destruction and the arm on the right the narrow upward path of life ' when we hear that we all fall to search we prayer-book for a capital ` y ' and granny tucker who know not a from b make much ado in fumble with she book for she would have people think that she could read then just at that moment come a noise from below louder than those before hollow and grate like the cry of a old man in pain with that up jump granny tucker call out loud in church to mr glennie -- ' o master however can ` ee bide there preach when the moon be rise from they grave ' and out from the church that be too much for the other and all flee mr vine cry ` lordsake we shall all be throttle like cracky jone ' so in a minute there be none leave in the church save and except mr glennie with I ratsey and elzevir block i do not run : first not wish to show myself coward before the man second because i think if blackbeard come he would fall on the man rather than on a boy and third that if it come to blow block be strong enough to give account even of a mohune mr glennie go on with he sermon make as though he neither hear any noise nor see the people leave the church and when he have finish elzevir walk out but i stop to see what the minister would say to ratsey about the noise in the vault the sexton help mr glennie off with he gown and then see I stand by and listen say -- ` the lord have send evil angel among we ` tis a terrible thing master glennie to hear the dead man move under we foot ' ` tut tut ' answer the minister ` it be only they own fear that make such noise terrible to the vulgar as for blackbeard i be not here to say whether guilty spirit sometimes can not rest and be see wander by man but for these noise they be certainly nature 's work as be the noise of wave upon the beach the flood have fill the vault with water and so the coffin get afloat move in some eddy that we know not of and jostle one another then be hollow they give forth those sound you hear and these be you evil angel ` tis very true the dead do move beneath we foot but ` tis because they can not help themselves be carry hither and thither by the water fie ratsey man you should know better than to fright a boy with silly talk of spirit when the truth be bad enough ' the parson 's word have the ring of truth in they to I and i never doubt that he be right so this mystery be explain and yet it be a dreadful thing and make I shiver to think of the mohune all adrift in they coffin and jostle one another in the dark i picture they to myself the many generation old man and child man and maid all bone now each afloat in he little box of rot wood and blackbeard himself in a great coffin bigger than all the rest come crash into the weaker one as a ship in a heavy sea come crash down sometimes in the trough on a small boat that be try to board she and then there be the outer darkness of the vault itself to think of and the close air and the black putrid water nearly up to the roof on which such sorry ship be sail ratsey look a little crestfallen at what mr glennie say but put a good face on it and answer -- ` well master i be but a plain man and know nothing about flood and these eddy and hidden workings of nature of which you speak but save you presence i hold it a fond thing to make light of such warning as be give we ` tis always say when the moon move then moonfleet mourn and i have hear my father tell that the last time they stir be in queen anne 's second year when the great storm blow man 's home about they head and as for frighting child ` tis well that heady boy should learn to stand in awe and not pry into what do not concern they -- or they may come to harm ' he add the last word with what i feel sure be a nod of warn to myself though i do not then understand what he mean so he walk off in a huff with elzevir who be wait for he outside and i go with mr glennie and carry he gown for he back to he lodging in the village mr glennie be always very friendly make much of I and talk to I as though i be he equal which be due i think to there be no one of he own knowledge in the neighborhood and so he have as lief talk to a ignorant boy as to a ignorant man after we have pass the churchyard turnstile and be cross the sludgy meadow i ask he again what he know of blackbeard and he lose treasure ` my son ' he answer ` all that i have be able to gather be that this colonel john mohune -lrb- foolishly call blackbeard -rrb- be the first to impair the family fortune by he excess and even let the almshouse fall to ruin and turn the poor away unless report strangely belie he he be a evil man and besides numberless lesser crime have on he hand the blood of a faithful servant whom he make away with because chance have bring to the man 's ear some guilty secret of the master then at the end of he life be fill with fear and remorse -lrb- as must always happen with evil liver at the last -rrb- he send for rector kindersley of dorchester to confess he though a protestant and wish to make amends by leave that treasure so ill-gotten from king charle -lrb- which be all that he have to leave -rrb- for the repair and support of the almshouse he make a last will which i have see to this effect but without describe the treasure further than to call it a diamond nor say where it be to be find doubtless he mean to get it himself sell it and afterwards apply the profit to he good purpose but before he could do so death call he suddenly to he account so man say that he can not rest in he grave not have make even so tardy a reparation and never will rest unless the treasure be find and spend upon the poor ' i think much over what mr glennie have say and fall to wonder where blackbeard could have hide he diamond and whether i might not find it some day and make myself a rich man now as i consider that noise we have hear under the church and parson glennie 's explanation of it i be more and more perplexed for the noise have as i have say something deep and hollow-booming in it and how be that to be make by decayed coffin i have more than once see ratsey in digging a grave turn up piece of coffin and sometimes a tarnish name-plate would show that they have not be so very long underground and yet the wood be quite decayed and rotten and grant that such be in the earth and so might more easily perish yet when the top be take off old guy 's brick grave to put he widow beside he master ratsey give I a peep in and old guy 's coffin have crack and warp in it and look as if a sound blow would send it to piece yet here be the mohune coffin that have be put away for generation and must be rotten as tinder tap against each other with a sound like a drum as if they be still sound and air-tight still mr glennie must be right for if it be not the coffin what should it be that make the noise so on the next day after we hear the sound in church be the Monday as soon as morning school be over off i run down street and across meadow to the churchyard mean to listen outside the church if the mohune be still move i say outside the church for i know ratsey would not lend I the key to go in after what he have say about boy prying into thing that do not concern they and besides that i do not know that i should care to have venture inside alone even if i have the key when i reach the church not a little out of breath i listen first on the side nearest the village that be the north side put my ear against the wall and afterwards lie down on the ground though the grass be long and wet so that i might the better catch any sound that come but i could hear nothing and so conclude that the mohune have come to rest again yet think i would walk round the church and listen too on the south or sea side for that they worship might have drift over to that side and be there rub shoulder with one another so i go round and be glad to get out of the cold shade into the sun on the south but here be a surprise for when i come round a great buttress which jut out from the wall what should i see but two man and these two be ratsey and elzevir block i come upon they unawares and lo and behold there be master ratsey lie also on the ground with he ear to the wall while elzevir sit back against the inside of the buttress with a spy-glass in he hand smoking and look out to sea now i have as much right to be in the churchyard as ratsey or elzevir and yet i feel a sudden shame as if i have be catch in some bad act and know the blood be run to my cheek at first i have it in my mind to turn tail and make off but conclude to stand my ground since they have see I and so bid they ` good morning ' master ratsey jump to he foot as nimbly as a cat and if he have not be a man i should have think he be blush too for he face be very red though that come perhaps from lie on the ground i could see he be a little put about and out of countenance though he try to say ` good morning john ' in a easy tone as if it be a common thing for he to be lie in the churchyard with he ear to the wall on a winter 's morning ` good morning john ' he say ` and what might you be do in the churchyard this fine day ' i answer that i be come to listen if the mohune be still move ` well that i can not tell you ' return ratsey ` not wish to waste think on such idle matter and have to examine this wall whether the flood have not so damage it as to need under-pinning so if you have time to gad about of a morning get you back to my workshop and fetch I a plasterer 's hammer which i have leave behind so that i can try this mortar ' i know that he be make excuse about underpin for the wall be sound as a rock but be glad enough to take he at he word and beat a retreat from where i be not wanted indeed i soon see how he be mock I for the man do not even wait for I to come back with the hammer but i meet they return in the first meadow master ratsey make another excuse that he do not need the hammer now as he have find out that all that be want be a little point with new mortar ` but if you have such time to waste john ' he add ` you can come tomorrow and help I to get new thwart in the _ petrel _ which she badly want ' so we three come back to the village together but look up at elzevir once while master ratsey be make these pretence i see he eye twinkle under they heavy brow as if he be amuse at the other 's embarrassment the next Sunday when we go to church all be quiet as usual there be no elzevir and no more noise and i never hear the mohune move again chapter 3 a discovery some bold adventurer disdain the limit of they little reign and unknown region dare descry still as they run they look behind they hear a voice in every wind and snatch a fearful joy -- _ gray _ i have say that i use often in the daytime when not at school to go to the churchyard because be on a little rise there be the best view of the sea to be have from it and on a fine day you could watch the french privateer creep along the cliff under the snout and lie in wait for a indiaman or up-channel trader there be at moonfleet few boy of my own age and none that i care to make my companion so i be give to muse alone and do so for the most part in the open air all the more because my aunt do not like to see a idle boy with muddy boot about she house for a few week indeed after the day that i have surprise elzevir and ratsey i keep away from the church fear to meet they there again but a little later resume my visit and see no more of they now my favorite seat in the churchyard be the flat top of a raise stone tomb which stand on the south-east of the church i have hear mr glennie call it a altar-tomb and in its day it have be a fine monument be carve round with festoon of fruit and flower but have suffer so much from the weather that i never be able to read the letter on it or to find out who have be bury beneath here i choose most to sit not only because it have a flat and convenient top but because it be screen from the wind by a thick clump of yew-tree these yew have once i think completely surround it but have either die or be cut down on the south side so that anyone sit on the grave-top be snug from the weather and yet possess a fine prospect over the sea on the other three side the yew grow close and thick embower the tomb like the high back of a fireside chair and many time in autumn i have see the stone slab crimson with the fall waxy berry and take some home to my aunt who like to taste they with a glass of sloe-gin after she Sunday dinner other beside I no doubt find this tomb a comfortable seat and look-out for there be quite a path wear to it on the south side though all the time i have visit it i have never see anyone there so it come about that on a certain afternoon in the beginning of February in the year 1758 i be sit on this tomb look out to sea though it be so early in the year the air be soft and warm as a may day and so still that i could hear the drum of turnip that gaffer george be fling into a cart on the hillside near half a mile away ever since the flood of which i have speak the weather have be open but with high wind and little or no rain thus as the land dry after the flood there begin to open crack in the heavy clay soil on which moonfleet be build such as be usually only see with we in the height of summer there be crack by the side of the path in the sea-meadow between the village and the church and crack in the churchyard itself and one run right up to this very tomb it must have be past four o'clock in the afternoon and i be for return to tea at my aunt 's when underneath the stone on which i sit i hear a rumble and crumble and on jump off saw that the crack in the ground have still further widen just where it come up to the tomb and that the dry earth have so shrink and settle that there be a hole in the ground a foot or more across now this hole reach under the big stone that form one side of the tomb and fall on my hand and knee and look down it i perceive that there be under the monument a larger cavity into which the hole open i believe there never be boy yet who see a hole in the ground or a cave in a hill or much more a underground passage but long incontinently to be into it and discover whither it lead so it be with I and see that the earth have fall enough into the hole to open a way under the stone i slip myself in foot foremost drop down on to a heap of fall mould and find that i could stand upright under the monument itself now this be what i have expect for i think that there have be below this grave a vault the roof of which have give way and let the earth fall in but as soon as my eye be use to the dimmer light i see that it be no such thing but that the hole into which i have creep be only the mouth of a passage which slope gently down in the direction of the church my heart fall to thump with eagerness and surprise for i think i have make a wonderful discovery and that this hidden way would certainly lead to great thing perhaps even to blackbeard 's hoard for ever since mr glennie 's tale i have constantly before my eye a vision of the diamond and the wealth it be to bring I the passage be two pace broad as high as a tall man and cut through the soil without brick or any other lining and what surprise I most be that it do not seem desert nor mouldy and cob-webbed as one would expect such a place to be but rather a well-used thoroughfare for i could see the soft clay floor be trodden with the print of many boot and mark with a trail as if some heavy thing have be drag over it so i set out down the passage reach out my hand before I lest i should run against anything in the dark and slide my foot slowly to avoid pitfall in the floor but before i have go half a dozen pace the darkness grow so black that i be frightened and so far from go on be glad to turn sharp about and see the glimmer of light that come in through the hole under the tomb then a horror of the darkness seize I and before i well know what i be about i find myself wriggle my body up under the tombstone on to the churchyard grass and be once more in the low evening sunlight and the soft sweet air home i run to my aunt 's for it be past tea-time and beside that i know i must fetch a candle if i be ever to search out the passage and to search it i have well make up my mind no matter how much i be scare for this moment my aunt give I but a sorry greet when i come into the kitchen for i be late and hot she never say much when displeased but have a way of say nothing which be much worse and would only reply yes or no and that after a interval to anything that be ask of she so the meal be silent enough for she have finish before i arrive and i eat but little myself be too much occupy with the thought of my strange discovery and finding beside the tea lukewarm and the victuals not entice you may guess that i say nothing of what i have see but make up my mind that as soon as my aunt 's back be turn i would get a candle and tinder-box and return to the churchyard the sun be down before aunt jane give thanks for what we have receive and then turn to I she say in a cold and measured voice : ` john i have observe that you be often out and about of night sometimes as late as half past seven or eight now it be not seemly for young folk to be abroad after dark and i do not choose that my nephew should be call a gadabout what be breed in the bone will come out in the flesh and 'twa with such loaf that you father begin he wild way and afterwards lead my poor sister such a life as never be till the mercy of providence take he away ' aunt jane often speak thus of my father whom i never remembered but believe he to have be a honest man and good fellow to boot if something give to roaming and to the contraband ` so understand ' she go on ` that i will not have you out again this evening no nor any other evening after dusk bed be the place for youth when night fall but if this seem to you too early you can sit with I for a hour in the parlor and i will read you a discourse of doctor sherlock that will banish vain thought and leave you in a fit frame for quiet sleep ' so she lead the way into the parlor take the book from the shelf put it on the table within the little circle of light cast by a shaded candle and begin it be dull enough though i have bear such tribulation before and the drone of my aunt 's voice would have send I to sleep as it have do at other time even in a straight-backed chair have i not be so full of my discovery and chafe at this delay thus all the time my aunt read of spirituality and save grace i have my mind on diamond and all kind of mammon for i never doubt that blackbeard 's treasure would be find at the end of that secret passage the sermon finish at last and my aunt close the book with a stiff ` good night ' for I i be for give she my formal kiss but she make as if she do not see I and turn away so we go upstairs each to we own room and i never kiss aunt jane again there be a moon three-quarter full already in the sky and on moonlight night i be allow no candle to show I to bed but on that night i need none for i never take off my clothes have resolve to wait till my aunt be asleep and then ghost or no ghost to make my way back to the churchyard i do not dare to put off that visit even till the morning lest some chance passer-by should light upon the hole and so forestall I with blackbeard 's treasure thus i lay wide awake on my bed watch the shadow of the tester-post against the whitewashed wall and note how it have move by degree as the moon go farther round at last just as it touch the picture of the good shepherd which hang over the mantelpiece i hear my aunt snore in she room and know that i be free yet i wait a few minute so that she might get well on with she first sleep and then take off my boot and in stockinged foot slip past she room and down the stair how stair handrail and landing creak that night and how my foot and body strike noisily against thing see quite well but misjudge in the effort not to misjudge they and yet there be the note of safety still sound for the snore never cease and the sleeper wake not though she waking then might have change all my life so i come safely to the kitchen and there put in my pocket one of the best winter candle and the tinder-box and as i creep out of the room hear suddenly how loud the old clock be tick and look up see the bright brass band mark half past ten on the dial out in the street i keep in the shadow of the house as far as i might though all be silent as the grave indeed i think that when the moon be bright a great hush fall always upon nature as though she be take up in wonder at she own beauty everyone be fast asleep in moonfleet and there be no light in any window only when i come opposite the why not i see from the red glow behind the curtain that the bottom room be light up so elzevir be not yet go to bed it be strange for the why not have be shut up early for many a long night past and i cross over cautiously to see if i could make out what be go forward but that be not to be do for the pane be thickly steam over and this surprised I more as show that there be a good company inside moreover as i stand and listen i could hear a mutter of deep voice inside not as of roisterer but of sober man talk low eagerness would not let I wait long and i be off across the meadow towards the church though not without sad misgiving as soon as the last house be left well behind I at the churchyard wall my courage have wane somewhat : it seem a shameless thing to come to rifle blackbeard 's treasure just in the very place and hour that blackbeard loved and as i pass the turnstile i half-expect that a tall figure hairy and evil-eyed would spring out from the shadow on the north side of the church but nothing stir and the frosty grass sound crisp under my foot as i make across the churchyard step over the grave and keep always out of the shadow towards the black clump of yew-tree on the far side when i get round the yew there be the tomb stand out white against they and at the foot of the tomb be the hole like a patch of black velvet spread upon the ground it be so dark then for a moment i think that blackbeard might be lie in wait in the bottom of the hole and i stand uncertain whether to go on or back i could catch the rustle of the water on the beach -- not of any wave for the bay be smooth as glass but just a lipper at the fringe and wish to put off with any excuse the descent into the passage though i have quite resolve to make it i settle with myself that i would count the water wash twenty time and at the twentieth would let myself down into the hole only seven wavelet have come in when i forget to count for there right in the middle of the moon 's path across the water lay a lugger moor broadside to the beach she be about half a mile out but there be no mistake for though she sail be lower she mast and hull stand out black against the moonlight here be a fresh reason for delay for surely one must consider what this craft could be and what have bring she here she be too small for a privateer too large for a fishing-smack and could not be a revenue boat by she low freeboard in the waist and 'twa a strange thing for a boat to cast anchor in the midst of moonfleet bay even on a night so fine as this then while i watch i see a blue flare in the bow only for a moment as if a man have light a squib and fling it overboard but i know from it she be a contrabandier and signalling either to the shore or to a mate in the offing with that courage come back and i resolve to make this flare my signal for get down into the hole screw my heart up with the thought that if blackbeard be really wait for I there ` twould be little good to turn tail now for he would be after I and could certainly run much faster than i then i take one last look round and down into the hole forthwith the same way as i have get down earlier in the day so on that February night john trenchard find himself stand in the heap of loose fall mould at the bottom of the hole with a mixture of courage and cowardice in he heart but overrule all a great desire to get at blackbeard 's diamond out come tinder-box and candle and i be glad indeed when the light burn up bright enough to show that no one at any rate be stand by my side but then there be the passage and who could say what might be lurk there yet i do not falter but set out on this adventurous journey walk very slowly indeed -- but that be from fear of pitfall -- and nerve myself with the thought of the great diamond which surely would be find at the end of the passage what should i not be able to do with such wealth i would buy a nag for mr glennie a new boat for ratsey and a silk gown for aunt jane in spite of she be so hard with I as on this night and thus i would make myself the greatest man in moonfleet richer even than mr maskew and build a stone house in the sea-meadow with a good prospect of the sea and marry grace maskew and live happily and fish i walk on down the passage reach out the candle as far as might be in front of I and whistle to keep myself company yet see neither blackbeard nor anyone else all the way there be footprint on the floor and the roof be black as with smoke of torch and this make I fear lest some of those who have be there before might have make away with the diamond now though i have speak of this journey down the passage as though it be a mile long and though it verily seem so to I that night yet i afterwards find it be not more than twenty yard or thereabout and then i come upon a stone wall which have once block the road but be now break through so as to make a ragged doorway into a chamber beyond there i stand on the rough sill of the door hold my breath and reach out my candle arm 's - length into the darkness to see what sort of a place this be before i put foot into it and before the light have well time to fall on thing i know that i be underneath the church and that this chamber be none other than the mohune vault it be a large room much larger i think than the schoolroom where mr glennie teach we but not near so high be only some nine foot from floor to roof i say floor though in reality there be none but only a bottom of soft wet sand and when i step down on to it my heart beat very fiercely for i remember what manner of place i be enter and the dreadful sound which have issue from it that Sunday morning so short a time before i satisfied myself that there be nothing evil lurk in the dark corner or nothing visible at least and then begin to look round and note what be to be see wall and roof be stone and at one end be a staircase close by a great flat stone at top -- that same stone which i have often see with a ring in it in the floor of the church above all round the side be stone shelf with division between they like great bookcase but instead of book there be the coffin of the mohune yet these lay only at the side and in the middle of the room be something very different for here be stack score of cask keg and runlet from a storage butt that might hold thirty gallon down to a breaker that hold only one they be mark all of they in white paint on the end with figure and letter that doubtless set forth the quality to those that understand here indeed be a discovery and instead of pick up at the end of the passage a little brass or silver casket which have only to be open to show blackbeard 's diamond gleam inside i have stumble on the mohune 's vault and find it to be nothing but a cellar of gentleman of the contraband for surely good liquor would never be store in so shy a place if it ever have pay the excise as i walk round this stack of cask my foot strike sharply on the edge of a butt which must have be near empty and straightway come from it the same hollow booming sound -lrb- only fainter -rrb- which have so frightened we in church that Sunday morning so it be the cask and not the coffin that have be knock one against another and i be please with myself remember how i have reason that coffin-wood could never give that booming sound it be plain enough that the whole place have be under water : the floor be still muddy and the green and sweating wall show the flood-mark within two foot of the roof there be a wisp or two of fine seaweed that have somehow get in and a small crab be still alive and scuttle across the corner yet the coffin be but little disturbed they lay on the shelf in row one above the other and number twenty-three in all : most be in lead and so could never float but of those in wood some be turn slantway in they niche and one have float right away and be leave on the floor upside down in a corner when the water go back first i fall to wonder as to whose cellar this be and how so much liquor could have be bring in with secrecy and how it be i have never see anything of the contraband-men though it be clear that they have make this flat tomb the entrance to they storehouse as i have make it my seat and then i remember how ratsey have try to scare I with talk of blackbeard and how elzevir who have never be see at church before be there the Sunday of the noise and how he have look ill at ease whenever the noise come though he be bold as a lion and how i have trip upon he and ratsey in the churchyard and how master ratsey lay with he ear to the wall : and put all these thing together and cast they up i think that elzevir and ratsey know as much as any about this hiding-place these reflection give I more courage for i consider that the tale of blackbeard walking or digging among the grave have be set afloat to keep those that be not want from the place and guess now that when i see the light move in the churchyard that night i go to fetch dr hawkin it be no corpse-candle but a lantern of smuggler run a cargo then have settle these important matter i begin to turn over in my mind how to get at the treasure and herein be much cast down for in this place be neither casket nor diamond but only coffin and double-holland so it be that have no better plan i set to work to see whether i could learn anything from the coffin themselves but with little success for the lead coffin have no name upon they and on such of the wooden coffin as bear plate i find the write to be latin and so rust over that i could make nothing of it soon i wish i have not come at all consider that the diamond have vanish into air and it be a sad thing to be cabine with so many dead man it move I too to see piece of banner and funeral shield and even shred of wreath that dear heart have put there a century ago now all ruin and rotten -- some still clinging water-sodden to the coffin and some trample in the sand of the floor i have spend some time in this bootless search and be resolve to give up further inquiry and foot it home when the clock in the tower strike midnight surely never be ghostly hour sound in more ghostly place moonfleet peal be know over half the county and the finest part of it be the clock bell 'twa say that in time past -lrb- when perhaps the chime be ring more often than now -rrb- the voice of this bell have lead safe home boat that be lose in the fog and this night its clangor mellow and profound reach even to the vault bim-bom it go bim-bom twelve heavy thud that shake the wall twelve resonant echo that follow and then a purr and vibration of the air so that the ear could not tell when it end i be work up perhaps by the strangeness of the hour and place and my hearing quicker than at other time but before the tremor of the bell be quite pass away i know there be some other sound in the air and that the awful stillness of the vault be break at first i could not tell what this new sound be nor whence it come and now it seem a little noise close by and now a great noise in the distance and then it grow nearer and more define and in a moment i know it be the sound of voice talk they must have be a long way off at first and for a minute that seem as a age they come no nearer what a minute be that to I even now so many year after i can recall the anguish of it and how i stand with ear prick up eye start and a clammy sweat upon my face wait for those speaker to come it be the anguish of the rabbit at the end of he burrow with the ferret 's eye gleam in the dark and gun and lurcher wait at the mouth of the hole i be catch in a trap and know beside that contraband-man have a way of seal prying eye and still babble tongue and i remember poor cracky jone find dead in the churchyard and how man _ say _ he have meet blackbeard in the night these be but the thought of a second but the voice be nearer and i hear a dull thud far up the passage and know that a man have jump down from the churchyard into the hole so i take a last stare round agonizing to see if there be any way of escape but the stone wall and roof be solid enough to crush I and the stack of cask too closely packed to hide more than a rat there be a man speak now from the bottom of the hole to other in the churchyard and then my eye be lead as by a loadstone to a great wooden coffin that lay by itself on the top shelf a full six foot from the ground when i see the coffin i know that i be respite for as i judge there be space between it and the wall behind enough to contain my little carcass and in a second i have put out the candle scramble up the shelf half-stunned my sens with dash my head against the roof and squeeze my body betwixt wall and coffin there i lay on one side with a thin and rotten plank between the dead man and I daze with the blow to my head and breathing hard while the glow of torch as they come down the passage reddened and flicker on the roof above chapter 4 in the vault let we hob and nob with death -- _ tennyson _ though nothing of the vault except the roof be visible from where i lay and so i could not see these visitor yet i hear every word speak and soon make out one voice as be master ratsey 's this discovery give I no surprise but much solace for i think that if the worst happen and i be discover i should find one friend with whom i could plead for life ` it be well the earth give way ' the sexton be say ` on a night when we be here to find it i be in the graveyard myself after midday and all be snug and tight then ` twould have be awkward enough to have the hole stand open through the day for any passer-by to light on ' there be four or five man in the vault already and i could hear more come down the passage and guess from they heavy footstep that they be carry burden there be a sound too of dump keg down on the ground with a swish of liquor inside they and then the noise of cask be move ' i think we should have a fall there ere long ' ratsey go on ` what with this drought parch the ground and the trample at the edge when we move out the side stone to get in but there be no mischief do beyond what can be easily make good a gravestone or two and a few spade of earth will make all sound again leave that to I ' ` be careful what you do ' rejoin another man 's voice that i do not know ` lest someone see you digging and scent we out ' ` make you mind easy ' ratsey say ' i have dig too often in this graveyard for any to wonder if they see I with a spade ' then the conversation break off and there be little more talk only a noise of man go backwards and forwards and of put down of keg and the hollow gurgle of good liquor be pour from breaker into the cask by and by fume of brandy begin to fill the air and climb to where i lay overcome the mouldy smell of decayed wood and the dampness of the green wall it may have be that these fume mount to my head and give I courage not my own but so it be that i lose something of the stifle fear that have grip I and could listen with more ease to what be go forward there be a pause in the carry to and fro they be talk again now and someone say -- ' i be in dorchester three day ago and hear man say it will go hard with the poor chap who have the brush with the _ elector _ last summer judge barentyne come on assize next week and that old fox maskew have drive down to taunton to get at he before and coach he back make out to he that the law 's arm be weak in these part against the contraband and must be strengthen by some wholesome hanging ' ` they be a cruel pair ' another put in ` and we shall have new gibbet on ridgedown for lead light once i get even with maskew the other may go hang ay and they may hang I too ' ` the devil send he to meet I one dark night on the down alone ' say someone else ` and i will give he a pistol 's mouth to look down and spoil he face for he ' ` no thou wilt not ' say a deep voice and then i know that elzevir be there too ` none shall lay hand on maskew but i so mark that lad that when he day of reckoning come ` tis _ i _ will reckon with he ' then for a few minute i do not pay much heed to what be say be terribly straitened for room and cramp with pain from lie so long in one place the thick smoke from the pitch torch too come curl across the roof and down upon I make I sick and giddy with its evil smell and taste and though all be very dim i could see my hand be black with oily smut at last i be able to wriggle myself over without make too much noise and feel a great relief in change side but give such a start as make the coffin creak again at hear my own name ` there be a boy of trenchard 's ' say a voice that i thought be parmiter 's who live at the bottom of the village -- ` there be a boy of trenchard 's that i mistrust he be for ever wander in the graveyard and i have see he a score of time sit on this tomb and look out to sea this very night when the wind fall at sundown and we be hang up with sail flap three mile out and wait for the dark to get the sweep i take my glass to scan the coast-line and lo here on the tomb-top sit master trenchard i could not see he face but know he by he cut and fear the boy sit there to play the spy and then tell maskew ' ` you be right ' say greening of ringstave for i know he slow drawl ` and many a time when i have sit in the wood and watch the manor to see maskew safe at home before we run a cargo i have see this boy too go round about the place with a hangdog look scanning the house as if he life depend o not ' 'twa very true what greening say for of a summer evening i would take the path that lead up weatherbeech hill behind the manor both because 'twa a walk that have a good prospect in itself and also a sweet charm for I namely the hope of see grace maskew and there i often sit upon the stile that end the path and open on the down and watch the old half-ruined house below and sometimes see white-frocked gracie walk on the terrace in the evening sun and sometimes in return pass she window near enough to wave a greet and once when she have the fever and dr hawkin come twice a day to see she i have no heart for school but sit on that stile the livelong day look at the gabled house where she be lie ill and mr glennie never rate I for play truant nor tell aunt jane guess as i think afterwards the cause and have once be young himself 'twa but boy 's love yet serious for I and on the day she lay near death i make so bold as to stop dr hawkin on he horse and ask he how she do and he bear with I for the eagerness that he read in my face bent down over he saddle and smile and say my playmate would come back to I again so it be quite true that i have watch the house but not as a spy and would not have bear tale to old maskew for anything that could be offer then ratsey speak up for I and say -- '' tis a false scent the boy be well enough and simple and have tell I many a time he seek the churchyard because there be a fine view to be have there of the sea and ` tis the sea he love a month ago when the high tide set and this vault be so full of water that we could not get in i come with elzevir to make out if the flood be go down inside or what eddy 'twa that set the cask tap one against another so as i lay on the ground with my ear glue close against the wall who should march round the church but john trenchard esquire not tread delicately like king agag or spy but just come on a voyage of discovery for himself for in the church on Sunday when we hear the tap in the vault below my young gentleman be scare enough but afterwards be tell by parson glennie -- who should know better -- that such noise be not make by ghost but by the mohune at sea in they coffin he pluck up heart and come down on the Monday to see if they be still afloat so there he catch I lie like a zany on the ground you may guess i stand at attention soon enough but tell he i be look at the found to see if they want underpin from the flood and so i set he mind at ease for ` tis a simple child and pack he off to get my dub hammer and i think the boy will not be here so often now to frighten honest parmiter for i have weave he some pretty tale of blackbeard and he have a wholesome scare of meet the colonel but after dark i pledge my life that neither he nor any other in the town would pass the churchyard wall no not for a thousand pound ' i hear he chuckle to himself and the other laugh loudly too when he be tell how he palm I off but ` he laugh loudest who laugh last ' think i and should have chuckle too be it not for make the coffin creak and then to my surprise elzevir speak : ` the lad be a brave lad i would he be my son he be david 's age and will make a good sailor later on ' they be simple word yet please to I for elzevir speak as if he mean they and i have get to like he a little in spite of all he grimness and beside that be sorry for he grief over he son i be so move by what he say that for a moment i be for jump up and call out to he that i lay here and like he well but then think better of it and so keep still the carrying be over and i fancy they be all sit on the end of keg or lean up against the pile but could not see and be still much trouble with the torch smoke though now and then i catch through it a whiff of tobacco which show that some be smoking then greening who have a singing voice for all he drawl strike up with -- say the cap'n to the crew we have slipt the revenue but ratsey stop he with a sharp ` no more of that the word be not to we taste tonight but come as wry as if the parson call _ old hundred _ and i tune up with _ venus _ ' i know he mean the last verse with a hang touch in it but greening be for go on with the song until some other break in too and he see that the company would have none of it ` not but what the labourer be worthy of he hire ' go on master ratsey ` so spile that little breaker of schiedam and send a rummer round to keep off midnight chill ' he love a glass of the good liquor well and with he 'twa always the same reasoning namely to keep off chill though he chop the word to suit the season and now 'twa autumn now winter now spring or summer chill they must have find glass though i could not remember to have see any in the vault for a minute later fugleman ratsey speak again -- ` now lad glass full and bumper for a toast and here be to blackbeard to father blackbeard who watch over we treasure better than he do over he own for be it not the fear of he that keep off idle foot and prying eye we should have the gauger in and we store ransack twenty time ' so he speak and it seem there be a little halt at first as of man not like to take blackbeard 's name in blackbeard 's place or raise the devil by mock at he but then some of the bolder shout ` blackbeard ' and so the more timid chime in and in a minute there be a score of voice call ` blackbeard blackbeard ' till the place ring again then elzevir cry out angrily ` silence be you mad or have the liquor master you be you revenue-men that you dare shout and roister or contrabandier with the lugger in the offing and you life in you hand you make noise enough to wake folk in moonfleet from they bed ' ` tut man ' retort ratsey testily ` and if they wake they would but pull the blanket tight about they ear and say 'twa blackbeard pipe he crew of lose mohune to help he dig for treasure ' yet for all that 'twa plain that block rule the roost for there be silence for a minute and then one say ` ay master elzevir be right let we away the night be far spend and we have nothing but the sweep to take the lugger out of sight by dawn ' so the meeting break up and the torchlight grow dimmer and die away as it have come in a red flicker on the roof and the footstep sound fainter as they go up the passage until the vault be leave to the dead man and I yet for a very long time -- it seem hour -- after all have go i could hear a murmur of distant voice and know that some be talk at the end of the passage and perhaps consider how the landslip might best be restore so while i hear they thus converse i dare not descend from my perch lest someone might turn back to the vault though i be glad enough to sit up and ease my ache back and limb yet in the awful blackness of the place even the echo of these human voice seem a kindly and bless thing and a certain shrink loneliness fall on I when they cease at last and all be silent then i resolve i would be off at once and get back to the moonlight bed that i have leave hour ago have no stomach for more treasure-hunting and be glad indeed to be still leave with the treasure of life thus sit where i be i light my candle once more and then clamber across that great coffin which for two hour or more have be a mid-wall of partition between I and danger but to get out of the niche be harder than to get in for now that i have a candle to light I i see that the coffin though sound enough to outer view be worm through and through and little better than a rotten shell so it be that i have some ado to get over it not daring either to kneel upon it or to bring much weight to bear with my hand lest it should go through and now have get safely across i sit for a instant on that narrow ledge of the stone shelf which project beyond the coffin on the vault side and make ready to jump forward on to the floor below and how it happen i know not but there i lose my balance and as i slip the candle fly out of my grasp then i clutch at the coffin to save myself but my hand go clean through it and so i come to the ground in a cloud of dust and splinter have only get hold of a wisp of seaweed or a handful of those draggled funeral trappings which be strew about this place the floor of the vault be sandy and so though i fall crookedly i take but little harm beyond a shake and soon pull myself together set to strike my flint and blow the match into a flame to search for the fall candle yet all the time i keep in my finger this handful of light stuff and when the flame burn up again i hold the thing against the light and see that it be no wisp of seaweed but something black and wiry for a moment i could not gather what i have hold of but then give a start that nearly send the candle out and perhaps a cry and let it drop as if it be red-hot iron for i know that it be a man 's beard now when i see that i feel a sort of throttle fright as though one have catch hold of my heartstrings and so many and such strange thought rise in I that the blood go pound round and round in my head as it do once afterwards when i be fight with the sea and near drowned surely to have in hand the beard of any dead man in any place be bad enough but worse a thousand time in such a place as this and to know on whose face it have grow for almost before i fully see what it be i know it be that black beard which have give colonel john mohune he nickname and this be he great coffin i have hide behind i have lie therefore all that time cheek by jowl with blackbeard himself with only a thin shell of tinder wood to keep he from I and now have thrust my hand into he coffin and pluck away he beard so that if ever wicked man have power to show themselves after death and still to work evil one would guess that he would show himself now and fall upon I thus a sick dread get hold of I and have i be a woman or a girl i think i should have swoon but be only a boy and not know how to swoon do the next best thing which be to put myself as far as might be from the beard and make for the outlet yet have i scarce set foot in the passage when i stop remember how once already this same evening i have play the coward and run home scare with my own fear so i be bring up for very shame and beside that think how i have come to this place to look for blackbeard 's treasure and might have go away without know even so much as where he lay have not chance first lead I to be down by he side and afterwards place my hand upon he beard and surely this could not be chance alone but must rather be the finger of providence guide I to that which i desire to find this consideration somewhat restore my courage and after several feint to return advance stopping and panic i be in the vault again walk carefully round the stack of barrel and fear to see the glimmer of the candle fall upon that beard there it be upon the sand and hold the candle nearer to it with a certain caution as though it would spring up and bite I i see it be a great full black beard more than a foot long but go gray at the tip and have at the back keep it together a thin tissue of dry skin like the false parting which aunt jane wear under she cap on sunday this i could see as it lay before I for i do not handle or lift it but only peer into it with the candle on all side busy myself the while with thought of the man of whom it have once be part in return to the vault i have no very sure purpose in mind only a vague surmise that this finding of blackbeard 's coffin would somehow lead to the finding of he treasure but as i look at the beard and ponder i begin to see that if anything be to be do it must be by search in the coffin itself and the clearer this become to I the greater be my dislike to set about such a task so i put off the evil hour by feign to myself that it be necessary to make a careful scrutiny of the beard and thus waste at least ten minute but at length see that the candle be burn low and could certainly last little more than half a hour and consider that it must now be get near dawn i buckle to the distasteful work of rummage the coffin nor have i any need to climb up on to the top shelf again but stand on the one beneath find my head and arm well on a level with the search and beside that the task be not so difficult as i have think for in my fall i have break off the head-end of the lid and bring away the whole of that side that face the vault now any lad of my age and perhaps some man too might well have be frighten to set about such a matter as to search in a coffin and if any have say a few hour before that i should ever have courage to do this by night in the mohune vault i would not have believe he yet here i be and have advance along the path of terror so gradually and as it be foot by foot in the past night that when i come to this final step i be not near so scared as when i first feel my way into the vault it be not the first time either that i have look on death but have indeed always a lean to such sight and matter and have see corpse wash up from the _ darius _ and other wreck and besides that have help ratsey to case some poor body that have die in they bed the coffin be as i have say of great length and the side be remove i could see the whole outline of the skeleton that lay in it i say the outline for the form be wrap in a woollen or flannel shroud so that the bone themselves be not visible the man that lay in it be little short of a giant measuring as i guess a full six and a half foot and the flannel have sink in over the belly the end of the breast-bone the hip knee and toe be very easy to be make out the head be swathe in linen band that have be white but be now stain and discolor with damp but of this i shall not speak more and beneath the chin-cloth the beard have once escape the clutch which i have make to save myself in fall have tear away this chin-band and let the lower jaw drop on the breast but little else be disturbed and there be colonel john mohune rest as he have be lay out a century ago i lift that portion of the lid which have be leave behind and reach over to see if there be anything hide on the other side of the body but have scarce let the light fall in the coffin when my heart give a great bind and all fear left I in the flush of success for there i see what i have come to seek on the breast of this silent and swathe figure lay a locket attach to the neck by a thin chain which pass inside the linen bandage a whiter portion of the flannel show how far the beard have extend but locket and chain be quite black though i judge that they be make of silver the shape of this locket be not unlike a crown-piece only three time as thick and as soon as i set eye upon it i never doubt but that inside would be find the diamond it be then that a great pity come over I for this thin shadow of man thinking rather what a fine tall gentleman colonel mohune have once be and a good soldier no doubt besides than that he have waste a noble estate and play traitor to the king and then i reflect that it be all for the bit of flash stone which lay as i hope within the locket that he have sell he honor and wish that the jewel might bring I better fortune than have fall to he or at any rate that it might not lead I into such miry path yet such thought do not delay my purpose and i possess myself of the locket easily enough find a hasp in the chain and so draw it out from the linen fold i have expect as i move the locket to hear the jewel rattle in the inside but there be no sound and then i think that the diamond might cleave to the side with damp or perhaps be wrap in wool scarcely be the locket well in my hand before i have it undo find a thumb-nick whereby after a little persuasion the back though rust could be open on a hinge my breath come very fast and i shake so that i have a difficulty to keep my thumbnail in the nick yet hardly be it open before exalted expectation give place to deepest disappointment for there lay all the secret of the locket disclose and there be no diamond no nor any other jewel and nothing at all except a little piece of fold paper then i feel like a man who have play away all he property and stake he last crown -- heavy-hearted yet hope against hope that luck may turn and that with this piece be may win back all he money so it be with I for i hope that this paper might have write on it direction for the finding of the jewel and that i might yet rise from the table a winner it be but a frail hope and quickly dash for when i have smooth the crease and spread out the piece of paper in the candle-light there be nothing to be see except a few verse from the psalm of david the paper be yellow and show a lattice of fold where it have be press into the locket but the handwriting though small be clear and neat and there be no mistake a word of what be there set down 'twa so short i could read it at once : the day of we age be threescore year and ten and though man be so strong that they come to fourscore year yet be they strength then but labor and sorrow so soon passeth it away and we be go -- psalm 90 21 and as for I my foot be almost go my treading be wellnigh slip -- 73 6 but let not the waterflood drown I neither let the deep swallow I up -- 69 11 so go through the vale of misery i shall use it for a well till the pool be fill with water -- 84 14 for thou hast make the north and the south : tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name -- 89 6 so here be a end to great hope and i be after all to leave the vault no richer than i have enter it for look at it as i might i could not see that these verse could ever lead to any diamond and though i might otherwise have think of cipher or secret writing yet remember what mr glennie have say that blackbeard after he wicked life desire to make a good end and send for a parson to confess he i guess that such pious word have be hang round he neck as a charm to keep the spirit of evil away from he tomb i be disappoint enough but before i leave pick up the beard from the floor though it send a shiver through I to touch it and put it back in its place on the dead man 's breast i restore also such piece of the coffin as i could get at but could not make much of it so leave thing as they be trust that those who come there next would think the wood have fall to piece by natural decay but the locket i keep and hang about my neck under my shirt both as be a curious thing in itself and because i think that if the good word inside it be strong enough to keep off bad spirit from blackbeard they would be also strong enough to keep blackbeard from I when this be do the candle have burn so low that i could no longer hold it in my finger and be force to stick it on a piece of the broken wood and so carry it before I but after all i be not to escape from blackbeard 's clutch so easily for when i come to the end of the passage and be prepare to climb up into the churchyard i find that the hole be stop and that there be no exit i understand now how it be that i have hear talk so long after the company have leave the vault for it be clear that ratsey have be as good as he word and that the fall in of the ground have be repair before the contraband-men go home that night at first i make light of the matter think i should soon be able to dislodge this new work and so find a way out but when i look more narrowly into the business i do not feel so sure for they have make a sound job of it put one very heavy burial slab at the side to pile earth against till the hole be full and then cover it with another these be both of slate and i know whence they come for there be a dozen or more of such disused and weather-worn cover lay up against the north side of the church and every one of they a good burden for four man yet i hope by grout at the earth below it to be able to dislodge the stone at the side but while i be consider how best to begin the candle flicker the wick give a sudden lurch to one side and i be leave in darkness thus my plight be evil indeed for i have nothing now to burn to give I light and know that 'twa no use set to grout till i could see to go about it moreover the darkness be of that black kind that be never find beneath the open sky no not even on the darkest night but lurk in close and covered place and strain the eye in try to see into it yet i do not give way but settle to wait for the dawn which must i know be now at hand for then i think enough light would come through the chink of the tomb above to show I how to set to work nor be i even much scare as one who have be in peril of life from the contraband-man for a spy and in peril from evil ghost for rifle blackbeard 's tomb deem it a light thing to be leave in the dark to wait a hour till morning so i sit down on the floor of the passage which if damp be at least soft and be tire with what i have go through and not use to miss a night 's rest fall straightway asleep how long i sleep i can not tell for i have nothing to guide I to the time but wake at length and find myself still in darkness i stand up and stretch my limb but do not feel as one refresh by wholesome sleep but sick and tired with pain in back arm and leg as if beat or bruise i have say i be still in darkness yet it be not the blackness of the last night and look up into the inside of the tomb above i could see the faintest line of light at one corner which show the sun be up for this line of light be the sunlight filter slowly through a crevice at the join of the stone but the side of the tomb have be fit much closer than i reckon for and it be plain there would never be light in the place enough to guide I to my work all this i consider as i rest on the ground for i have sit down again feel too tired to stand but as i keep my eye on the narrow streak of light i be much startle for i look at the south-west corner of the tomb and yet be look towards the sun this i gather from the tone of the light and although there be no direct outlet to the air and only a glimmer come in as i have say yet i know certainly that the sun be low in the west and fall full upon this stone here be a surprise and a sad one for I for i perceive that i have sleep away a day and that the sun be set for another night and yet it matter little for night or daytime there be no light to help I in this horrible place and though my eye have grow accustomed to the gloom i could make out nothing to show I where to work so i take out my tinder-box mean to fan the match into a flame and to get at least one moment 's look at the place and then to set to digging with my hand but as i lay asleep the top have be press off the box and the tinder get loose in my pocket and though i pick the tinder out easily enough and get it in the box again yet the salt damp of the place have sodden it in the night and spark by spark fall idle from the flint and then it be that i first perceive the danger in which i stand for there be no hope of kindle a light and i doubt now whether even in the light i could ever have do much to dislodge the great slab of slate i begin also to feel very hungry as not have eat for twenty-four hour and worse than that there be a parching thirst and dryness in my throat and nothing with which to quench it yet there be no time to be lose if i be ever to get out alive and so i grope with my hand against the side of the grave until i make out the bottom edge of the slab and then fall to grub beneath it with my finger but the earth which the day before have look light and loamy to the eye be stiff and hard enough when one come to tackle it with naked hand and in a hour 's time i have do little more than further weary myself and bruise my finger then i be force to rest and sit down on the ground see that the glimmering streak of light have fade and that the awful blackness of the previous night be creep up again and now i have no heart to face it be cow with hunger thirst and weariness and so flung myself upon my face that i might not see how dark it be and groan for very lowness of spirit thus i lay for a long time but afterwards stand up and cry aloud and shriek if anyone should haply hear I call to mr glennie and ratsey and even elzevir by name to save I from this awful place but there come no answer except the echo of my own voice sound hollow and far off down in the vault so in despair i turn back to the earth wall below the slab and scrabble at it with my finger till my nail be break and the blood run out have all the while a sure knowledge like a cord twist round my head that no effort of mine could ever dislodge the great stone and thus the hour pass and i shall not say more here for the remembrance of that time be still terrible and besides no word could ever set forth the anguish i then suffer yet do slumber come sometimes to my help for even while i be work at the earth sheer weariness would overtake I and i sink on to the ground and fall asleep and still the hour pass and at last i know by the glimmer of light in the tomb above that the sun have rise again and a maddening thirst have hold of I and then i thought of all the barrel pile up in the vault and of the liquor that they hold and stick not because 'twa spirit for i would scarce have pause to sate that thirst even with molten lead so i feel my way down the passage back to the vault and reck not of the darkness nor of blackbeard and he crew if only i could lay my lip to liquor thus i groped about the barrel till near the top of the stack my hand strike on the spile of a keg and draw it i get my mouth to the hold what the liquor be i do not know but it be not so strong but that i could swallow it in great gulp and find it less burning than my burning throat but when i turn to get back to the passage i could not find the outlet and fumble round and round until my brain be dizzy and i fall senseless to the ground chapter 5 the rescue shades of the dead have i not hear you voice rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale -- _ byron _ when i come to myself i be lie not in the outer blackness of the mohune vault not on a floor of sand but in a bed of sweet clean linen and in a little whitewashed room through the window of which the spring sunlight stream oh the bless sunshine and how i praise god for the light at first i think i be in my own bed at my aunt 's house and have dream of the vault and the smuggler and that my be prison in the darkness be but the horror of a nightmare i be for get up but fall back on my pillow in the effort to rise with a weakness and sick languor which i have never know before and as i sink down i feel something swing about my neck and put up my hand find 'twa colonel john mohune 's black locket and so know that part at least of this adventure be no dream then the door open and to my wander think it seem that i be back again in the vault for in come elzevir block then i hold up my hand and cry -- ' o elzevir save I save I i be not come to spy ' but he with a kind look on he face put he hand on my shoulder and push I gently back say -- ` lie still lad there be none here will hurt thee and drink this ' he hold out to I a bowl of steam broth that fill the room with a savor sweeter ten thousand time to I than every rose and lily of the world yet would not let I drink it at a gulp but make I sip it with a spoon like any baby thus while i drink he tell I where i be namely in a attic at the why not but would not say more then bid I get to sleep again and i should know all afterwards and so it be ten day or more before youth and health have they way and i be strong again and all that time elzevir block sit by my bed and nurse I tenderly as a woman so piece by piece i learn the story of how they find I 'twa mr glennie who first move to seek I for when the second day come that i be not at school he think that i be ill and go to my aunt 's to ask how i do as be he wont when any ail but aunt jane answer he stiffly that she could not say how i do ` for ' say she ` he be run off i know not where but as he make he bed must he lie o not and if he run away for he pleasure may stay away for mine i have be pester with this lot too long and only bear with he for poor sister martha 's sake but ` tis after he father that the graceless lad take and thus reward I ' with that she bang the door in the parson 's face and off he go to ratsey but can learn nothing there and so conclude that i have run away to sea and be seek ship at poole or weymouth but that same day come sam tewkesbury to the why not about nightfall and beg a glass of rum be as he say ` all of a shake ' and tell a tale of how he pass the churchyard wall on he return from work and in the dusk hear scream and wail voice and know 'twa blackbeard pipe he lose mohune to hunt for treasure so though he see nothing he turn tail and never stop run till he stand at the inn door then forthwith elzevir leaf sam to drink at the why not alone and himself set off run up the street to call for master ratsey and they two make straight across the sea-meadow in the dark ` for as soon as i hear tewkesbury tell of scream and wailing in the air and no one to be see ' say elzevir ' i guess that some poor soul have get shut in the vault and be there cry for he life and to this i be not guide by mother wit but by a surer and a sadder token thou wilt have hear how thirteen year ago a daft body we call cracky jone be find one morning in the churchyard dead he be go miss for a week before and twice within that week i have sit through the night upon the hill behind the church watch to warn the lugger with a flare she could not put in for the surf upon the beach and on those night the air be still though a heavy swell be run i hear thrice or more a throttle scream come shiver across the meadow from the graveyard yet beyond turn my blood cold for a moment it give I little trouble for evil tale have hang about the church and though i do not set much store by the old yarn of blackbeard piping up he crew yet i think strange thing might well go on among the grave at night and so i never budge nor stir hand or foot to save a fellow-creature in he agony ` but when the surf fall enough for the boat to get ashore and greening hold a lantern for I to jump down into the passage after we have get the side out of the tomb the first thing the light fall on at the bottom be a white face turn skyward i have not forget that lad for 'twa cracky jone lay there with he face thin and shrink yet all the doited look go out of it we try to force some brandy in he mouth but he be stark and dead with knee draw up towards he head so stiff we have to lift he double as he be and lay he by the churchyard wall for some of we to find next day we never know how he get there but guess that he have hang about the lander some night when they run a cargo and slip in when the watchman 's back be turn thus when sam tewkesbury speak of scream and waiting and no one to be see i know what 'twa but never guess who might be shut in there not know thou wert go amiss so run to ratsey to get he help to slip the side stone off for by myself i can not stir it now though once i do when i be younger and from he learn that thou wert lose and know whom we should find before we get there ' i shudder while elzevir talk for i think how cracky jone have perhaps hide behind the self-same coffin that sheltered I and how narrowly i have escape he fate and that old story come back into my mind how year ago there once arise so terrible a cry from the vault at service-time that parson and people flee from the church and i doubt not now that some other poor soul have get shut in that awful place and be then call for help to those whose fear would not let they listen ` there we find thee ' elzevir go on ` stretch out on the sand senseless and far go and there be something in thy face that make I think of david when he lay stretch out in he last sleep and so i put thee on my shoulder and bare thee back and here thou art in david 's room and shalt find board and bed with I as long as thou hast mind to ' we speak much together during the day when i be get stronger and i grow to like elzevir well find he grimness be but on the outside and that never be a kinder man indeed i think that my be with he do he good for he feel that there be once more someone to love he and he heart go out to I as to he son david never once do he ask I to keep my counsel as to the vault and what i have see there know perhaps he have no need for i would have die rather than tell the secret to any only one day master ratsey who often come to see I say -- ` john there be only elzevir and i who know that you have see the inside of we bond-cellar and ` tis well for if some of the lander guess they might have ugly way to stop all chance of prate so keep we secret tight and we 'll keep yours for he that refraineth he lip be wise ' i wonder how master ratsey could quote scripture so pat and yet cheat the revenue though in truth 'twa think little sin at moonfleet to run a cargo and perhaps he guess what i be think for he add -- ` not that a christian man have aught to be ashamed of in landing a cask of good liquor for we read that when israel come out of egypt the choose people be bid trick they oppressor out of jewel of silver and jewel of gold and among those cruel taskmaster some of the wont must certainly have be the tax-gatherer ' \* \* \* \* \* the first walk i take when i grow stronger and be able to get about be up to aunt jane 's notwithstanding she have never so much as be to ask after I all these day she know indeed where i be for ratsey have tell she i lay at the why not explain that elzevir have find I one night on the ground famished and half-dead yet not say where but my aunt greet I with hard word which i need not repeat here for perhaps she mean they not unkindly but only to bring I back again to the right way she do not let I cross the threshold hold the door ajar in she hand and say she would have no tavern-lounger in she house but that if i like the why not so well i could go back there again for she i have be for beg she pardon for play truant but when i hear such scurvy word feel the devil rise in my heart and only laugh though bitter tear be in my eye so i turn my back upon the only home that i have ever know and saunter off down the village feeling very lone and be not sure i be not cry before i come again to the why not then elzevir saw that my face be downcast and ask what ail I and so i tell he how my aunt have turn I away and that i have no home to go to but he seem pleased rather than sorry and say that i must come now and live with he for he have plenty for both and that since chance have lead he to save my life i should be to he a son in david 's place so i go to keep house with he at the why not and my aunt send down my bag of clothes and would have make over to elzevir the pittance that my father leave for my keep but he say it be not needful and he would have none of it chapter 6 a assault surely after all the noblest answer unto such be perfect stillness when they brawl -- _ tennyson _ i have more than once bring up the name of mr maskew and as i shall have other thing to tell of he later on i may as well relate here what manner of man he be he stature be but medium not exceed five foot four inch i think and to make the most of it he fling he head far back and give himself a little strut in walk he have a thin face with a sharp nose that look as if it would peck you and gray eye that could pierce a millstone if there be a guinea on the far side of it he hair for he wear he own have be red though it be now grizzle and the color of it be set down in moonfleet to he be a scotchman for we think all scotchman be red-headed he be a lawyer by profession and have make money in edinburgh have go so far south as moonfleet to get quit as be say of the memory of rascally deed it be about four year since he buy a parcel of the mohune estate which have be break up and sell piecemeal for a generation and on he land stand the manor house or so much of it as be leave of the mansion i have speak before it be a very long house of two storey with a project gable and doorway in the middle and at each end gable wing run out crosswise the maskew live in one of these wing and that be the only habitable portion of the place for as to the rest the glass be out of the window and in some place the roof have fall in mr maskew make no attempt to repair house or grounds and the bough of the great cedar which the snow have bring down in '49 still block the drive the entrance to the house be through the porchway in the middle but more than one tumble-down corridor have to be thread before one reach the inhabit wing while fowl and pig and squirrel have possession of the terrace lawn in front it be not for want of money that maskew let thing remain thus for man say that he be rich enough only that he mood be miserly and perhaps also it be the lack of woman 's company that make he think so little of neatness and order for he wife be dead and though he have a daughter she be young and have not yet weight enough to make she father do thing that he do not choose till maskew come there have be none living in the manor house for a generation so the village child use the terrace for a playground and pick primrose in the wood and the man think they have a right to snare a rabbit or shoot a pheasant in the chase but the new owner change all this hide gin and spring-gun in the covert and nail up board on the tree to say he would have the law of any that trespass so he soon make enemy for himself and before long have everyone 's hand against he yet he prefer he neighbor 's enmity to they goodwill and go about to make it more bitter by get himself post for magistrate and give out that he would put down the contraband thereabout for no one round moonfleet be for the excise but farmer love a glass of schnapps that have never be gauge and they wife a piece of fine lace from france and then come the affair between the _ elector _ and the ketch with david block 's death and after that they say it be not safe for maskew to walk at large and that he would be find some day dead on the down but he give no heed to it and go on as if he have be a pay exciseman rather than a magistrate when i be a little boy the manor wood be my delight and many a sunny afternoon have i sit on the terrace edge look down over the village and munch red quarantine from the ruin fruit garden and though this be now forbid yet the manor have still a sweeter attraction to I than apple or bird-batting and that be grace maskew she be a only child and about my own age or little better at the time of which i be speak i know she because she go every day to the old almshouse to be teach by the reverend mr glennie from whom i also receive my schooling she be tall for she age and slim with a thin face and a tumble of tawny hair which fly about she in a wind or when she run she frock be wash and patch and fade and show more of she arm and leg than the dressmaker have ever intend for she be a grow girl and have none to look after she clothes she be a favorite playfellow with all and a early choice for game of ` prisoner 's base ' and she could beat most of we boy at speed thus though we all hate she father and have for he many jeer title among ourselves yet we never use a evil nickname nor a railing word against he when she be by because we like she well there be a half-dozen of we boy and as many girl whom mr glennie use to teach and that you may see what sort of man maskew be i will tell you what happen one day in school between he and the parson mr glennie teach we in the almshouse for though there be now no bedesman and the house themselves be fall to decay yet the little hall in which the inmate have once dine be still maintain and serve for we schoolroom it be a long and lofty room with a high wainscot all round it a carve oak screen at one end and a broad window at the other a very heavy table polish by use and sadly besmirch with ink run down the middle of the hall with bench on either side of it for we to use and a high desk for mr glennie stand under the window at the end of the room thus we be sit one morning with we summing-slate and grammar before we when the door in the screen open and mr maskew enter i have tell you already of the verse which mr glennie write for david block 's grave and when the flood have go down ratsey set up the headstone with the poetry carve on it but maskew through not go to church never see the stone for week until one morning walk through the churchyard he light on it and know the verse for mr glennie 's so 'twas to have it out with the parson that he have come to school this day and though we do not know so much then yet guess from he presence that something be in the wind and could read in he face that he be very angry now for all that we hate maskew yet be we glad enough to see he there as hope for something strange to vary the sameness of school and scent a disturbance in the air only grace be ill at ease for fear she father should say something unseemly and keep she head down with shock of hair fall over she book though i could see she blushing between they so in vapor maskew and with a angry glance about he make straight for the desk where we master sit at the top of the room for a moment mr glennie be shortsighted do not see who 'twa but as he visitor draw near rise courteously to greet he ` good day to you mister maskew ' say he hold out he hand but maskew put he arm behind he back and bubble out ` hold not out you hand to I lest i spit on it ` tis like you snivel cant to write sweet psalm for smuggling rogue and try to frighten honest man with you judgement ' at first mr glennie do not know what the other would be at and afterwards understanding turn very pale but say as a minister he would never be backward in reprove those whom he consider in the wrong whether from the pulpit or from the gravestone then maskew fly into a great passion and pour out many vile and insolent word say mr glennie be in league with the smuggler and fatten on they crime that the poetry be a libel and that he maskew will have the law of he for calumny after that he take grace by the arm and bid she get hat and cape and come with he ` for ' say he ' i will not have thee teach any more by a psalm-singing hypocrite that call thy father murderer ' and all the while he keep draw up closer to mr glennie until the two stand very near each other there be a great difference between they the one short and bluster with a red face turn up the other tall and crane down ill-clad ill-fed and pale maskew have in he left hand a basket with which he go marketing of morning for he make he own purchase and like fish as be cheaper than meat he have be chaffer with the fishwife this very day and be bring back he provend with he when he visit we school then he say to mr glennie : ` now sir parson the law have give into you fool 's hand a power over this churchyard and ` tis you trade to stop unseemly headline from be set up within its wall or once set up to turn they out forthwith so i give you a week 's grace and if tomorrow sennight yon stone be not go i will have it up and fling in piece outside the wall ' mr glennie answer he in a low voice but quite clear so that we could hear where we sit : ' i can neither turn the stone out myself nor stop you from turn it out if you so mind but if you do this thing and dishonor the graveyard there be one stronger than either you or i that must be reckon with ' i know afterwards that he mean the almighty but think then that 'twa of elzevir he speak and so perhaps do mr maskew for he fall into a worse rage thrust he hand in the basket whip out a great sole he have there and in a twinkling dash it in mr glennie 's face with a ` then take that for a unmannerly parson for i would not foul my fist with you mealy chop ' but to see that stir my choler for mr glennie be weak as wax and would never have hold up he hand to stop a blow even be he strong as goliath so i be for set on maskew and be a stout lad for my age could have have he on the floor as easy as a baby but as i rise from my seat i see he hold grace by the hand and so hang back for a moment and before i get my thought together he be go and i see the tail of grace 's cape whisk round the screen door a sole be at the best a ugly thing to have in one 's face and this sole be larger than most for maskew take care to get what he could for he money so it go with a loud smack on mr glennie 's cheek and then fall with another smack on the floor at this we all laugh as child will and mr glennie do not check we but go back and sit very quiet at he desk and soon i be sorry i have laugh for he look sad with he face sand and a great red patch on one side and beside that the fin have scratch he and make a blood-drop trickle down he cheek a few minute later the thin voice of the almshouse clock say twelve and away walk mr glennie without he usual ` good day child ' and there be the sole leave lie on the dusty floor in front of he desk it seem a shame so fine a fish should be waste so i pick it up and slip it in my desk send fred burt to get he mother 's gridiron that we might grill it on the schoolroom fire while he be go i go out to the court to play and have not be there five minute when back come maskew through we playground without grace and go into the schoolroom but in the screen at the end of the room be a chink against which we use to hold we finger on bright day for the sun to shine through and show the blood pink so up i slip and fix my eye to the hole want to know what he be at he have he basket with he and i soon see he have come back for the sole not have the heart to leave so good a bit of fish but look where he would he could not find it for he never search my desk and have to go off with a sour countenance but fred burt and i cook the sole and find it well flavor for all it have give so much pain to mr glennie after that grace come no more to school both because she father have say she should not and because she be herself ashamed to go back after what maskew have do to mr glennie and then it be that i take to wander much in the manor wood have no fear of man-trap for i know they place as soon as they be put down but often catch sight of grace and sometimes find occasion to talk with she thus time pass and i live with elzevir at the why not still go to school of morning but spend the afternoon in fishing or in help he in the garden or with the boat as soon as i get to know he well i begged he to let I help run the cargo but he refuse say i be yet too young and must not come into mischief yet later yield to my importunity he consent and more than one dark night i be in the landing-boat that unburden the lugger though i could never bring myself to enter the mohune vault again but would stand as sentry at the passage-mouth and all the while i have round my neck colonel john mohune 's locket and at first wear it next myself but find it black the skin put it between shirt and body-jacket and there by dint of wear it grow less black and show a little of the metal underneath and at last i take to polish it at odd time until it come out quite white and shiny like the pure silver that it be elzevir have see this locket when he put I to bed the first time i come to the why not and afterwards i tell he whence i get it but though we have it out more than once of a evening we could never come at any hidden meaning indeed we scarce try to judge it to be certainly a sacred charm to keep evil spirit from blackbeard 's body chapter 7 a auction what if my house be trouble with a rat and i be please to give ten thousand ducat to have it ban -- _ shakespeare _ one evening in march when the day be lengthen fast there come a messenger from dorchester and bring print notice for fix to the shutter of the why not and to the church door which say that in a week 's time the bailiff of the duchy of cornwall would visit moonfleet this bailiff be a important person and he visit stand as event in village history once in five year he make a perambulation or journey through the whole duchy inspect all the royal property and arrange for new lease he visit to moonfleet be generally short enough for owe to the mohune own all the land the only duchy estate there be the why not and the only duty of the bailiff to renew that five-year lease under which block have hold the inn father and son for generation but for all that the business be not perform without ceremony for there be a solemn show of put up the lease of the inn to the highest bidder though it be well understand that no one except elzevir would make a offer so one morning a week later i go up to the top end of the village to watch for the bailiff 's postchaise and about eleven of the forenoon see it come down the hill with four horse and two postillion presently it come past and i see there be two man in it -- a clerk sit with he back to the horse and in the seat opposite a little man in a periwig whom i take for the bailiff then i run down to my aunt 's house for elzevir have ask I to beg one of she best winter candle for a purpose which i will explain presently i have not see aunt jane except in church since the day that she dismiss I but she be no stiffer than usual and give I the candle readily enough ` there ' she say ` take it and i wish it may bring light into you dark heart and show you what a wicked thing it be to leave you own kith and kin and go to dwell in a tavern ' i be for say that it be kith and kin that leave I and not i they and as for live in a tavern it be better to live there than nowhere at all as she would wish I to do in turn I out of she house but do not and only thank she for the candle and be off when i come to the inn there be the postchaise in front of the door the horse be lead away to bait and a little group of villager stand round for though the auction of the why not be in itself a trite thing with a foregone conclusion yet the bailiff 's visit always stir some show of interest there be a few child with they nose flatten against the window of the parlor and inside be mr bailiff and mr clerk hard at work on they dinner mr bailiff who be as i guess the little man in the periwig sit at the top of the table and mr clerk sit at the bottom and on chair be place they hat and travelling-cloak and bundle of papers tie together with green tape you may be sure that elzevir have a good dinner for they with hot rabbit pie and cold round of brawn and a piece of blue vinny which mr bailiff eat heartily but he clerk would not touch say he have as lief chew soap there be also a bottle of ararat milk and a flagon of ale for we be afraid to set french wine before they lest they should fall to wonder how they be come by elzevir take the candle chide I a little for be late and set it in a brass candlestick in the middle of the table then mr clerk take a little rule from he pocket measure a inch down on the candle stick into the grease at that point a scarf-pin with a onyx head that elzevir lend he and light the wick now the reason of this be that the custom run in moonfleet when either land or lease be put up to bidding to stick a pin in a candle and so long as the pin hold firm it be open to any to make a better offer but when the flame burn down and the pin fall out then land or lease fall to the last bidder so after dinner be over and the table clear mr clerk take out a roll of papers and read a legal description of the why not call it the mohune arm a excellent messuage or tenement now use as a tavern and speaking of the convenient paddock or parcel of grazing land at the back of it call moon ' - lease amount to sixteen acre more or less then he invite the company to make a offer of rent for such a desirable property under a five year ' lease and as elzevir and i be the only company present the bidding be soon do for elzevir offer a rent of 12 a year which have always be the value of the why not the clerk make a note of this but the business be not over yet for we must wait till the pin drop out of the candle before the lease be finally make out so the man fall to smoking to pass the time till there could not have be more than ten minute ' candle to burn and mr bailiff with a glass of ararat milk in he hand be say ` tis a curious and fine tap of holland you keep here master block ' when in walk mr maskew a thunderbolt would not have astonish I so much as do he appearance and elzevir 's face grow black as night but the bailiff and clerk show no surprise not know the term on which person in we village stand to one another and think it natural that someone should come in to see the pin drop and the end of a ancient custom indeed maskew seem to know the bailiff for he pass the time of day with he and be then for sit down at the table without take any notice of elzevir or I but just as he begin to seat himself block shout out ` you be no welcome visitor in my house and i would sooner see you back than see you face but sit at this table you shall not ' i know what he mean for on that table they have lay out david 's body and with that he strike he fist upon the board so smart as to make the bailiff jump and nearly bring the pin out of the candle ` heyday sir ' say mr bailiff astonish ` let we have no brawling here the more so as this worshipful gentleman be a magistrate and something of a friend of mine ' yet maskew refrain from sit but stand by the bailiff 's chair turn white and not red as he do with mr glennie and mutter something that he have as lief stand as sit and that it should soon be block 's turn to ask sitting-room of _ he _ i be wonder what possibly could have bring maskew there when the bailiff who be ill at ease say -- ` come mr clerk the pin have but another minute 's hold rehearse what have be do for i must get this lease deliver and off to bridport where much business wait ' so the clerk read in a singsong voice that the property of the duchy of cornwall call the mohune arm a inn or tavern with all its land tenement and appurtenance situate in the parish of st sebastian moonfleet have be offer on lease for five year would be let to elzevir block at a rent of 12 per annum unless anyone offer a higher rent before the pin fall from the candle there be no one to make another offer and the bailiff say to elzevir ` tell they to have the horse round the pin will be out in a minute and ` twill save time ' so elzevir give the order and then we all stand round in silence wait for the pin to fall the grease have burn down to the mark or almost below it as it appear but just where the pin stick in there be a little lump of harder tallow that hold bravely out refuse to be melt the bailiff give a stamp of impatience with he foot under the table as though he hope thus to shake out the pin and then a little dry voice come from maskew say -- ' i offer 13 a year for the inn ' this fall upon we with so much surprise that all look round seek as it be some other speaker and never think that it could be maskew elzevir be the first i believe to fully understand 'twa he and without turn to look at bailiff or maskew but have he elbow on the table he face between he hand and look straight out to sea say in a sturdy voice ' i offer 20 ' the word be scarce out of he mouth when maskew cap they with 21 and so in less than a minute the rent of the why not be near double then the bailiff look from one to the other not know what to make of it all nor whether 'twa comedy or serious and say -- ` kind sir i warn ye not to trifle i have no time to waste in April fooling and he who make offer in sport will have to stand to they in earnest ' but there be no lack of earnest in one at least of the man that he have before he and the voice with which elzevir say 30 be still sturdy maskew call 31 and 41 and elzevir 40 and 50 and then i look at the candle and see that the head of the pin be no longer level it have sink a little -- a very little the clerk awake from he indifference and be make note of the bid with a squeak quill the bailiff frown as be puzzle and think that none have a right to puzzle he as for I i could not sit still but get on my foot if so i might better bear the suspense for i understand now that maskew have make up he mind to turn elzevir out and that elzevir be fight for he home _ he _ home and have he not make it my home too and be we both to be make outcast to please the spite of this mean little man there be some more bid and then i know that maskew be say 91 and see the head of the pin be lower the hard lump of tallow in aunt jane 's candle be thaw the bailiff strike in : ` be ye mad sir and you master block save you breath and spare you money and if this worshipful gentleman must become innkeeper at any price let he have the place in the devil 's name and i will give thee the mermaid at bridport with a snug parlor and ten time the trade of this ' elzevir seem not to hear what he say but only call out 100 with he face still look out to sea and the same sturdiness in he voice then maskew try a spring and go to 120 and elzevir cap he with 130 and 140150160170 follow quick my breath come so fast that i be almost giddy and i have to clench my hand to remind myself of where i be and what be go on the bidder too be breathe hard elzevir have take he head from he hand and the eye of all be on the pin the lump of tallow be wear down now it be hard to say why the pin do not fall maskew gulp out 180 and elzevir say 190 and then the pin give a lurch and i think the why not be save though at the price of ruin no the pin have not fall there be a film that hold it by the point one second only one second elzevir 's breath which be ready to outbid whatever maskew say catch in he throat with the catch pin and maskew sigh out 200 before the pin patter on the bottom of the brass candlestick the clerk forget he master 's presence and shut he notebook with a bang ` congratulate you sir ' say he quite pert to maskew ` you be the landlord of the poorest pothouse in the duchy at 200 a year ' the bailiff pay no heed to what he man do but take he periwig off and wipe he head ` well i be hang ' he say and so the why not be lose just as the last bid be give elzevir half-rose from he chair and for a moment i expect to see he spring like a wild beast on maskew but he say nothing and sit down again with the same stolid look on he face and indeed it be perhaps well that he thus think better of it for maskew stick he hand into he bosom as the other rise and though he withdraw it again when elzevir get back to he chair yet the front of he waistcoat be a little bulged and look sideways i see the silver-shod butt of a pistol nestle far down against he white shirt the bailiff be vex i think that he have be betray into such strong word for he try at once to put on as indifferent a air as might be say in dry tone ` well gentleman there seem to be here some personal matter into which i shall not attempt to spy two hundred pound more or less be but a flea-bite to the duchy and if you sir ' turn to maskew ` wish later on to change you mind and be quit of the bargain i shall not be the man to stand in you way in any case i imagine ` twill be time enough to seal the lease if i send it from london ' i know he say this and hint at delay as wish to do elzevir a good turn for he clerk have the lease already make out pat and it only want the name and rent fill in to be seal and sign but ` no ' say maskew ` business be business mr bailiff and the post uncertain to part so distant from the capital as these so i 'll thank you to make out the lease to I now and on may day place I in possession ' ` so be it then ' say the bailiff a little testily ` but blame I not for drive hard bargain for the duchy whose servant i be ' and he raise he hat ` be no daughter of the horse-leech fill in the figure mr scrutton and let we away ' so mr scrutton for that be mr clerk 's name scratch a bit with he quill on the parchment sheet to fill in the money and then maskew scratch he name and mr bailiff scratch he name and mr clerk scratch again to witness mr bailiff 's name and then mr bailiff take from he mail a little shagreen case and out from the case come sealing-wax and the travel seal of the duchy there be my aunt 's best winter-candle still burn away in the daylight for no one have take any think to put it out and mr bailiff melt the wax at it till a drop of sealing-wax fall into the grease and make a gutter down one side and then there be a sweating of the parchment under the hot wax and at last on go the seal ` sign sealed and deliver ' say mr clerk roll up the sheet and hand it to maskew and maskew take and thrust it into he bosom underneath he waistcoat front -- all cheek by jowl with that silver-hafted pistol whose butt i have see before the postchaise stand before the door the horse be stamp on the cobble-stone and the harness jingle mr clerk have carry out he mail but mr bailiff stop for a moment as he fling the travel cloak about he shoulder to say to elzevir ` tut man take thing not too hardly thou shalt have the mermaid at 20 a year which will be worth ten time as much to thee as this dreary place and canst send thy son to bryson 's school where they will make a scholar of he for he be a brave lad ' and he touch my shoulder and give I a kindly look as he pass ' i thank you worship ' say elzevir ` for all you goodness but when i quit this place i shall not set up my staff again at any inn door ' mr bailiff seem nettle to see he offer make so little of and leave the room with a sniff ` then i wish you good day ' maskew have slip out before he and the child 's nose leave the window-pane as the great man walk down the step there be a little group to see the start but it quickly melt and before the clatter of hoof die away the report spread through the village that maskew have turn elzevir out of the why not for a long time after all have go elzevir sit at the table with he head between he hand and i keep quiet also both because i be myself sorry that we be to be send adrift and because i wish to show elzevir that i feel for he in he trouble but the young can not enter fully into they elder ' sorrow however much they may wish to and after a time the silence pall upon I it be get dusk and the candle which bear itself so bravely through auction and lease-sealing burnt low in the socket a minute later the light give some flickering flash failing and sputter and then the wick totter and out pop the flame leave we with the chilly gray of a march evening creep up in the corner of the room i could bear the gloom no longer but make up the fire till the light dance ruddy across pewter and porcelain on the dresser ` come master block ' i say ` there be time enough before may day to think what we shall do so let we take a cup of tea and after that i will play you a game of backgammon ' but he still remain cast down and would say nothing and as chance would have it though i wish to let he win at backgammon that so perhaps he might get cheer yet do what i would that night i could not lose so as he luck grow worse he moodiness increase and at last he shut the board with a bang say in reference to that motto that run round its edge ` life be like a game of hazard and surely none ever fling worse throw or make so little of they as i ' chapter 8 the landing let my lamp at midnight hour be see in some high lonely tower -- _ milton _ maskew get ugly look from the man and sour word from the wife as he go up through the village that afternoon for all know what he have do and for many day after the auction he dare not show he face abroad yet damen of ringstave and some other of the lander ' man who make it they business to keep a eye upon he say that he have be twice to weymouth of evening and hold converse there with mr luckham of the excise and with captain henning who command the trooper then in quarter on the nothe and by degree it get about but how i do not know that he have persuade the revenue to strike hard at the smuggler and that a strong posse be to be hold in readiness to take the lander in the act the next time they should try to run a cargo why maskew should so put himself about to help the revenue i can not tell nor do anyone ever certainly find out but some say 'twa out of sheer wantonness and a desire to hurt he neighbor and other that he see what a apt place this be for landing cargo and wish first to make a brave show of zeal for the excise and afterwards to get the whole of the contraband trade into he own hand however that may be i think he be certainly in league with the revenue man and more than once i see he on the manor terrace with a spy glass in he hand and guess that he be look for the lugger in the offing now word be mostly give to the lander by safe hand of the night on which a cargo should be run and then in the morning or afternoon the lugger would come just near enough the land to be make out with glass and afterwards lie off again out of sight till nightfall the night choose for such work be without moon but as still as might be so long as there be wind enough to fill the sail and often the lugger could be make out from the beach but sometimes 'twa necessary to signal with flare though they be use as little as might be yet after there have be a long spell of rough weather and a cargo have to be run at all hazard i have know the boat come in even on the bright moonlight and take they risk for 'twa say the excise sleep sounder round we than anywhere in all the channel these tale of maskew 's doings fail not to reach elzevir and for some day he think best not to move though there be a cargo on the other side that want landing badly but one evening when he have win at backgammon and be in a open mood he take I into confidence set down the dice box on the table and say -- ` there be word come from the shipper that we must take a cargo for that they can not keep the stuff by they longer at st malo now with this devil at the manor prowl round i dare not risk the job on moonfleet beach nor yet stow the liquor in the vault so i have tell the _ bonaventure _ to put she nose into this bay tomorrow afternoon that maskew may see she well and then to lie out again to sea as she have do a hundred time before but instead of wait in the offing she will make straight off up channel to a little strip of shingle underneath hoar head ' i nod to show i know the place and he go on -- ` man use to choose that spot in good old time to beach a cargo before the passage to the vault be dig and there be a worked-out quarry they call pyegrove 's hole not too far off up the down and choke with bramble where we can find shelter for a hundred keg so we 'll be under hoar head at five tomorrow morn with the pack-horse i wish we could be earlier for the sun rise thereabout but the tide will not serve before ' it be at that moment that i feel a cold touch on my shoulder as of the fresh air from outside and think beside i have a whiff of salt seaweed from the beach so round i look to see if door or window stand ajar the window be tight enough and shutter to boot but the door be not to be see plainly for a wooden screen which part it from the parlor and be mean to keep off draught yet i could just see a top corner of the door above the screen and think it be not fast so up i get to shut it for the night be cold but coming round the corner of the screen find that 'twa close and yet i could have swear i see the latch fall to its place as i walk towards it then i dash forward and in a trice have the door open and be in the street but the night be moonless and black and i neither see nor hear aught stir save the gentle sea-wash on moonfleet beach beyond the salt meadow elzevir look at I uneasily as i come back ` what ail thee boy ' say he ' i think i hear someone at the door ' i answer ` do you not feel a cold wind as if it be open ' ` it be but the night be sharp the spring set in very chill slip the bolt and sit down again ' and he fling a fresh log on the fire that send a cloud of spark crackle up the chimney and out into the room ` elzevir ' i say ' i think there be one listen at the door and there may be other in the house so before we sit again let we take candle and go through the room to make sure none be prying on we ' he laugh and say '' twa but the wind that blow the door open ' but that i might do as i please so i light another candle and be for start on my search but he cry ` nay thou shalt not go alone ' and so we go all round the house together and find not so much as a mouse stir he laugh the more when we come back to the parlor '' tis the cold have chill thy heart and make thee timid of that skulk rascal of the manor fill I a glass of ararat milk and one for thyself and let we to bed ' i have learn by this not to be afraid of the good liquor and while we sit sip it elzevir go on -- ` there be a fortnight yet to run and then you and i shall be cut adrift from we mooring it be a cruel thing to see the door of this house close on I where i and mine have live a century or more but i must see it yet let we not be too cast down but try to make something even of this worst of throw ' i be glad enough to hear he speak in this firmer strain for i have see what a sore thought it have be for these day past that he must leave the why not and how it often make he moody and downcast ` we will have no more of innkeep ' he say ' i have be sick and tired of it this many a day and care not now to see man abuse good liquor and addle they silly pate to fill my purse and i have something boy put snug away in dorchester town that will give we bread to eat and beer to drink even if the throw run still deuce-ace but we must seek a roof to shelter we when the why not be shut and ` tis best we leave this moonfleet of ours for a season till maskew find a rope 's end long enough to hang himself withal so when we work be do tomorrow night we will walk out along the cliff to worth and take a look at a cottage there that daman speak about with a walled orchard at the back and fuchsia hedge in front -- ` tis near the lobster inn and have a fine prospect of the sea and if we live there we will leave the vault alone awhile and use this pyegrove 's hole for storehouse till the watch be relax ' i do not answer have my thought on other thing and he toss off he liquor say ` thou ` rt tire so let 's to bed for we shall get little sleep tomorrow night ' it be true that i be tired and yet i could not get to sleep but toss and turn in my bed for thinking of many thing and be vex that we be to leave moonfleet yet mine be a selfish sorrow for i have little thought for elzevir and the pain that it must be to he to quit the why not : nor yet be it the grief of leave moonfleet that so trouble I although that be the only place i ever have know and seem to I then -- as now -- the only spot on earth fit to be live in but the real care and canker be that i be go away from grace maskew for since she have leave school i have grow fonder of she and now that it be difficult to see she i take the more pain to accomplish it and meet she sometimes in manor wood and more than once when maskew be away have walk with she on weatherbeech hill so we breed up a boy-and-girl affection and must need pledge ourselves to be true to one another not know what such silly word might mean and i tell grace all my secret not even except the doings of the contraband and the mohune vault and blackbeard 's locket for i know all be as safe with she as with I and that she father could never rack aught from she nay more she bedroom be at the top of the gabled wing of the manor house and look right out to sea and one clear night when we boat be come late from fishing i see she candle burn there and next day tell she of it and then she say that she would set a candle to burn before the pane on winter night and be a lead light for boat at sea and so she do and other beside I see and use it call it ` maskew 's match ' and say that it be the attorney sit up all night to pore over ledger and add up he fortune so this night as i lay awake i vexed and vex myself for thinking of she and at last resolve to go up next morning to the manor wood and lie in wait for grace to tell she what be up and that we be go away to worth next day the 16th of April -- a day i have have cause to remember all my life -- i play truant from mr glennie and by ten in the forenoon find myself in the wood there be a little dimple on the hillside above the house green with burdock in summer and fill with dry leaf in winter -- just big enough to hold one lie flat and not so deep but that i could look over the lip of it and see the house without be see thither i go that day and lay down in the dry leaf to wait and watch for grace the morning be bright enough the chill of the night before have give way to sunlight that seem warm as summer and yet have with it the soft freshness of spring there be scarce a breath move in the wood though i could see the cloud of white dust stalk up the road that climb ridge down and the tree be green with bud yet without leafage to keep the sunbeam from light up the ground below which glow with yellow king-cup so i lay there for a long long while and to make time pass quicker take from my bosom the silver locket and open it read again the parchment which i have read time out of mind before and know indeed by heart ` the day of we age be threescore year and ten ' and the rest now whenever i handle the locket my thought be turn to mohune 's treasure and it be natural that it should be so for the locket remind I of my first journey to the vault and i laugh at myself remember how simple i have be and have hope to find the place litter with diamond and to see the gold lie pack in heap and thus for the hundredth time i come to rack my brain to know where the diamond could be hide and think at last it must be bury in the churchyard because of the talk of blackbeard be see on wild night digging there for he treasure but then i reason that very like it be the contrabandier whom man have see with spade when they be digging out the passage from the tomb to the vault and set they down for ghost because they work at night and while i be busy with such thought the door open in the house below I and out come grace with a hood on she head and a basket for wild flower in she hand i watch to see which way she would walk and as soon as she take the path that lead up weatherbeech make off through the dry brushwood to meet she for we have settle she should never go that road except when maskew be away so there we meet and spend a hour together on the hill though i shall not write here what we say because it be mostly silly stuff she speak much of the auction and of elzevir leave the why not and though she never say a word against she father let I know what pain he do give she but most she grieve that we be leave moonfleet and show she grief in such pretty way as make I almost glad to see she sorry and from she i learn that maskew be indeed absent from home have be call away suddenly last night the evening be so fine he say -lrb- and this surprised I remember how dark and cold it be with we -rrb- that he must need walk round the policy but about nine o'clock come back and tell she he have get a sudden call to business which would take he to weymouth then and there so to saddle and off he go on he mare bidding grace not to look for he for two night to come i know not why it be but what she say of maskew make I thoughtful and silent and she too must be back home lest the old servant that keep house for they should say she have be too long away and so we part then off i go through the wood and down the village street but as i pass my old home see aunt jane standing on the doorstep i bade she ` good day ' and be for run on to the why not for i be late enough already but she call I to she seeming in a milder mood and say she have something for I in the house so leave I stand while she go off to get it and back she come and thrust into my hand a little prayer-book which i have often see about the parlor in past day say ` here be a common prayer which i have mean to send thee with thy clothes it be thy poor mother 's and i pray may some day be as precious a balm to thee as it once be to that godly woman ' with that she give I the ` good day ' and i pocket the little red leather book which do indeed afterwards prove precious to I though not in the way she mean and run down street to the why not \* \* \* \* \* that same evening elzevir and i leave the why not go up through the village climb the down and be at the brow by sunset we have start earlier than we fix the night before because word have come to elzevir that morning that the tide call gulder would serve for the beaching of the _ bonaventure _ at three instead of five ` tis a strange thing the gulder and not even sailor can count closely with it for on the dorset coast the tide make four time a day twice with the common flow and twice with the gulder and this last be shifty and uncertain as to time fling out many a sea-reckoning it be about seven o'clock when we be at the top of the hill and there be fifteen good mile to cover to get to hoar head dusk be upon we before we have walk half a hour but when the night fall it be not black as on the last evening but a deep sort of blue and the heat of the day do not die with the sun but leave the air still warm and balmy we trudge on in silence and be glad enough when we see by a white stone here and there at the side of the path that we be near the cliff for the preventive man mark all the footpath on the cliff with whitewashed stone so that one can pick up the way without risk on a dark night a few minute more and we reach a broad piece of open sward which i know for the top of hoar head hoar head be the highest of that line of cliff which stretch twenty mile from weymouth to st alban 's head and it stand up eighty fathom or more above the water the seaward side be a great sheer of chalk but fall not straight into the sea for three part down there be a lower ledge or terrace call the under-cliff 'twa to this ledge that we be bind and though we be now straight above i know we have a mile or more to go before we could get down to it so on we go again and find the bridle-path that slope down through a deep dip in the cliff line and when we reach this under-ledge i look up at the sky the night be clear and guess by the star that 'twa past midnight i know the place from have once be there for blackberry for the bramble on the under-cliff be sheltered every way but south and open to the sun grow the finest in all those part we be not alone for i could make out a score of man some standing in group some rest on the ground and the dark shape of the pack-horse show larger in the dimness there be a few word of greet mutter in deep voice and then all be still so that one hear the browse horse try to crop something off the turf it be not the first cargo i have help to run and i know most of the man but do not speak with they be tire and wish to rest till i be want so cast myself down on the turf but have not lie there long when i see someone come to I through the bramble and master ratsey say ` well jack so thou and elzevir be leave moonfleet and i fain would flit myself but then who would be leave to lead the old folk to they last home for dead do not bury they dead in these day ' i be half-asleep and take little heed of what he say put he off with ` that need not keep you master they will find other to fill you place ' yet he would not let I be but go on talk for the pleasure of hear he own voice ` nay child you know not what you say they may find man to dig a grave and perhaps to fill it but who shall toss the mould when parson glennie give the earth to earth it take a mort of knowledge to make it rattle kindly on the coffin-lid ' i feel sleep heavy on my eyelid and be for beg he to let I rest when there come a whistle from below and in a moment all be on they foot the driver go to the packhorse ' head and so we walk down to the strand a silent move group of man and horse mixed and before we come to the bottom hear the first boat 's nose grind on the beach and the foot of the seaman crunch in the pebble then all fall to the business of landing and a strange enough scene it be what with the medley of man the lanthorn swing and a frothy upper from the sea run up till sometimes it be over we boot and all the time there be a patter of french and dutch for most of the _ bonaventure 's _ man be foreigner but i shall not speak more of this for after all one landing be very like another and keg come ashore in much the same way whether they be to pay excise or not it must have be three o'clock before the lugger 's boat be off again to sea and by that time the horse be well laden and most of the man have a keg or two to carry beside then elzevir who be in command give the word and we begin to file away from the beach up to the under-cliff now what with the cargo be heavy we be longer than usual in get away and though there be no sign of sunrise yet the night be greyer and not so blue as it have be we reach the under-cliff and be move across it to address ourselves to the bridle-path and so wind sideways up the steep when i see something move behind one of the plumb of bramble with which the place be beset it be only a glimpse of motion that i have perceive and could not say whether 'twa man or animal or even frightened bird behind the bush but other have see it as well there be some shout half a dozen fling down they keg and start in pursuit all eye be turn to the bridle-path and in a twinkling hunter and hunt be in view the greyhound be damen and garrett with some other and the hare be a older man who leap and bound forward faster than i should have think any but a youth could run but then he know what man be after he and that 'twa a race for life for though it be but a moment before all be lose in the night yet this be long enough to show I that the man be none other than maskew and i know that he life be not worth ten minute ' purchase now i hate this man and have myself suffer something at he hand besides see he put much grievous suffering on other but i wish then with all my heart he might escape and have a horrible dread of what be to come yet i know all the time escape be impossible for though maskew run desperately the way be steep and stony and he have behind he some of the fleetest foot along that coast we have all stop with one accord as not wish to move a step forward till we have see the issue of the chase and i be near enough to look into elzevir 's face but see there neither passion nor bloodthirstiness but only a calm resolve as if he have to deal with something well expect we have not long to wait for very soon we hear a rolling of stone and trampling of foot come down the path and from the darkness issue a group of man have maskew in the middle of they they be hustle he along fast two have hold of he by the arm and a third by the neck of he shirt behind the sight give I a sick qualm like a overdose of tobacco for it be the first time i have ever see a man man-handle and a fellow-creature abused he cap be lose and he thin hair tangle over he forehead he coat be tear off so that he stand in he waistcoat alone he be pale and gasp terribly whether from the sharp run or from violence or fear or all combine there be a babel of voice when they come up of desperate man who have a bitterest enemy in they clutch and some shout ` club he ' ` shoot he ' ` hang he ' while other be for throw he over the cliff then someone see under the flap of he waistcoat that same silver-hafted pistol that lay so lately next the lease of the why not and snatch it from he fling it on the grass at block 's foot but elzevir 's deep voice master they contention -- ` lad ye remember how i say when this man 's reckoning day should come 'twa i would reckon with he and have you promise to it nor be it right that any should lay hand on he but i for be he not seal to I with my son 's blood so touch he not but bind he hand and foot and leave he here with I and go you way there be no time to lose for the light grow apace ' there be a little muttered murmuring but elzevir 's will overbear they here as it have do in the vault and they yield the more easily because every man know in he heart that he would never see maskew again alive so within ten minute all be wind up the bridle-path horse and man all except three for there be leave upon the brambly greensward of the under-cliff maskew and elzevir and i and the pistol lay at elzevir 's foot chapter 9 a judgement let they fight it out friend thing have go too far god must judge the couple : leave they as they be -- _ brown _ i make as if i would follow the other not wish to see what i must see if i stay behind and know that i be powerless to bend elzevir from he purpose but he call I back and bid I wait with he for that i might be useful by and by so i wait but be only able to make a dreadful guess at how i might be of use and fear the worst maskew sit on the sward with he hand lash tight behind he back and he foot tie in front they have set he with he shoulder against a great block of weather-worn stone that be half-buried and half-stuck up out of the turf there he sit keep he eye on the ground and be breathe less painfully than when he be first bring but still very pale elzevir stand with the lanthorn in he hand look at maskew with a fix gaze and we could hear the hoof of the heavy-laden horse beat up the path till they turn a corner and all be still the silence be break by maskew : ` unloose I villain and let I go i be a magistrate of the county and if you do not i will have you gibbet on this cliff-top ' they be brave word enough yet seem to I but bad play-acting and bring to my remembrance how when i be a little fellow mr glennie once make I recite a battle-piece of mr dryden before my betters and how i could scarce get out the bloody threat for shyness and rise tear so it be with maskew 's word for he have much ado to gather breath to say they and they come in a thin voice that have no sting of wrath or passion in it then elzevir speak to he not roughly but resolve and yet with melancholy like a judge sentence a prisoner : ` talk not to I of gibbet for thou wilt neither hang nor see man hang again a month ago thou satst under my roof watch the flame burn down till the pin drop and give thee right to turn I out from my old home and now this morning thou shalt watch that flame again for i will give thee one inch more of candle and when the pin drop will put this thine own pistol to thy head and kill thee with as little thought as i would kill a stoat or other vermin ' then he open the lanthorn slide take out from he neckcloth that same pin with the onyx head which he have use in the why not and fix it in the tallow a short inch from the top set the lanthorn down upon the sward in front of maskew as for I i be dismayed beyond tell at these word and make giddy with the revulsion of feeling for whereas but a few minute ago i would have think nothing too bad for maskew now i be turn round to wish he might come off with he life and to look with terror upon elzevir it have grow much lighter but not yet with the rosy flush of sunrise only the star have fade out and the deep blue of the night give way to a misty gray the light be strong enough to let all thing be see but not to call the due tint back to they so i could see cliff and ground bush and stone and sea and all be of one pearly gray color or rather they be colourless but the most colourless and greyest thing of all be maskew 's face he hair have get awry and he head show much balder than when it be well trim he face too be draw with heavy line and there be ring under he eye beside all that he have get a ugly fall in try to escape and one cheek be muddy and down it trickle a blood-drop where a stone have cut he he be a sorry sight enough and look at he i remember that day in the schoolroom when this very man have strike the parson and how we master have sit patient under it with a blood-drop trickle down he cheek too maskew keep he eye fix for a long time on the ground but raise they at last and look at I with a vacant yet pity-seeking look now till that moment i have never see a trace of grace in he feature nor of he in hers and yet as he gaze at I then there be something of she present in he face even batter as it be so that it seem as if she look at I behind he eye and that make I the sorrier for he and at last i feel i could not stand by and see he do to death when elzevir have stick the pin into the candle he never shut the slide again and though no wind blow there be a light breath move in the morning off the sea that get inside the lanthorn and set the flame askew and so the candle gutter down one side till but little tallow be leave above the pin for though the flame grow pale and paler to the view in the grow morning light yet it burnt freely all the time so at last there be leave as i judge but a quarter of a hour to run before the pin should fall and i see that maskew know this as well as i for he eye be fix on the lanthorn at last he speak again but the brave word be go and the thin voice be thinner he have drop threat and be beg piteously for he life ` spare I ' he say ` spare I mr block : i have a only daughter a young girl with none but I to guard she would you rob a young girl of she only help and cast she on the world would you have they find I dead upon the cliff and bring I back to she a bloody corpse ' then elzevir answer : ` and have i not a only son and be he not bring back to I a bloody corpse whose pistol be it that flash in he face and take he life away do you not know it be this very same that shall flash in yours so make what peace you may with god for you have little time to make it ' with that he take the pistol from the ground where it have lie and turn he back on maskew walk slowly to and fro among the bramble-plump though maskew 's word about he daughter seem but to feed elzevir 's anger by lead he to think of david they sink deep in my heart and if it have seem a fearful thing before to stand by and see a fellow-creature butcher it seem now ten thousand time more fearful and when i thought of grace and what such a deed would mean to she my pulse beat so fierce that i must need spring to my foot and run to reason with elzevir and tell he this must not be he be still walk among the bush when i find he and let I say my say till i be out of breath and bear with I if i talk fast and if my tongue outrun my judgement ` thou hast a warm heart lad ' he say ` and ` tis for that i like thee and if thou hast a chief place in thy heart for I i can not grumble if thou find a little room there even for we enemy would i could set thy soul at ease and do all that thou askest in the first flush of wrath when he be take plot against we life it seem a little thing enough to take he evil life but now these morning air have cool I and it go against my will to shoot a cower hound tie hand and foot even though he have murder twenty son of mine i have think if there be any way to spare he life and leave this hour 's agony to read a lesson not to be unlearned until the grave for such poltroon dread death and in one hour they die a hundred time but there be no way out : he life lie in the scale against the life of all we man yes and thy life too they leave he in my hand well know i should take account of he and be i now to play they false and turn he loose again to hang they all it can not be ' still i plead hard for maskew 's life hanging on elzevir 's arm and use every argument that i could think of to soften he purpose but he push I off and though i see that he be loth to do it i have a terrible conviction that he be not a man to be turn back from he resolve and would go through with it to the end we come back together from the bramble to the piece of sward and there sit maskew where we have leave he with he back against the stone only while we be away he have manage to wriggle he watch out of the fob and it lay beside he on the turf tie to he with a black silk riband the face of it be turn upward and as i pass i see the hand point to five sunrise be very near for though the cliff shut out the east from we the west over portland be all aglow with copper-red and gold and the candle burnt low the head of the pin be droop though very slightly but as i see it droop a month before and i know that the final act be not far off maskew know it too for he make he last appeal use such passionate word as i can not now relate and wriggle with he body as if to get he hand from behind he back and hold they up in supplication he offer money a thousand five thousand ten thousand pound to be set free he would give back the why not he would leave moonfleet and all the while the sweat run down he furrowed face and at last he voice be choke with sob for he be cry for he life in craven fear he might have speak to a deaf man for all he move he judge and elzevir 's answer be to cock the pistol and prime the powder in the pan then i stick my finger in my ear and shut my eye that i might neither see nor hear what follow but in a second changed my mind and open they again for i have make a great resolve to stop this matter come what might maskew be make a dreadful sound between a moan and strangle cry it almost seem as if he think that there be other by he beside elzevir and I and be shout to they for help the sun have rise and he first ray blaze on a window far away in the west on top of portland island and then there be a tinkle in the inside of the lanthorn and the pin fall elzevir look full at maskew and raise he pistol but before he have time to take aim i dash upon he like a wild cat spring on he right arm and cry to he to stop it be a unequal struggle a lad though full-grown and lusty against one of the powerfullest of man but indignation nerve my arm and he be weak because he doubt of he right so 'twa with some effort that he shake I off and in the struggle the pistol be fire into the air then i let go of he and stumble for a moment tire with that bout but pleased withal because i see what peace even so short a respite have bring to maskew for at the pistol shot 'twa as if a mask of horror have fall from he face and leave he he old countenance again and then i see he turn he eye towards the cliff-top and think that he be look up in thankfulness to heaven but now a new thing happen for before the echo of that pistol-shot have die on the keen morning air i think i hear a noise of distant shouting and look about to see whence it could come elzevir look round too but maskew forget to upbraid I for make he miss he aim still keep he face turn up towards the cliff then the voice come nearer and there be a mingled sound as of man shout to one another and gathering in from different place 'twa from the cliff-top that the voice come and thither elzevir and i look up and there too maskew keep he eye fix and in a moment there be a score of man stand on the cliff 's edge high above we head the sky behind they be pink flush with the keenest light of the young day and they stand out against it sharp cut and black as the silhouette of my mother that use to hang up by the parlor chimney they be soldier and i know the tall mitre-cap of the 13th and see the shaft of light from the sunrise come flash round they body and glance off the barrel of they matchlock i know it all now it be the posse who have lie in ambush elzevir see it too and then all shout at once ` yield at the king 's command : you be we prisoner ' call the voice of one of those black silhouette far up on the cliff-top ` we be lose ' cry elzevir ` it be the posse but if we die this traitor shall go before we ' and he make towards maskew to brain he with the pistol ` shoot shoot in the devil 's name ' scream maskew ` or i be a dead man ' then there come a flash of fire along the black line of silhouette with a crackle like a near peal of thunder and a fut fut fut of bullet in the turf and before elzevir could get at he maskew have fall over on the sward with a groan and with a little red hole in the middle of he forehead ` run for the cliff-side ' cry elzevir to I ` get close in and they can not touch thee ' and he make for the chalk wall but i have fall on my knee like a bullock fell by a pole-axe and have a scorching pain in my left foot elzevir look back ` what have they hit thee too ' he say and run and pick I up like a child and then there be another flash and fut fut in the turf but the shot find no billet this time and we be lie close against the cliff panting but safe chapter 10 the escape how fearful and dizzy ` tis to cast one 's eye so low ill look no more lest my brain turn -- _ shakespeare _ the while chalk be a bulwark between we and the foe and though one or two of they loose off they matchlock try to get at we sideways they could not even see they quarry and 'twa only shoot at a venture we be safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldier not to come down to take we safe with a discharge pistol in we grasp and a shot man lie at we foot elzevir be the first to speak : ` can you stand john be the bone broken ' ' i can not stand ' i say ` there be something go in my leg and i feel blood run down into my boot ' he kneel and roll down the leg of my stock but though he only move my foot ever so little it cause I sharp pain for feeling be come back after the first numbness of the shot ` they have break the leg though it bleed little ' elzevir say ` we have no time to splice it here but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do ' i nod bite my lip hard to conceal the pain he give I and he go on : ` we have a quarter of a hour before the posse can get down to we but come they will and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty or life with that carrion lie by we ' -- and he jerk he thumb at maskew -- ` though i be glad 'twa not my hand that send he to he reckoning and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make I waste a charge in air so one thing we can do be to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of they before they shoot I down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg and they will take thee alive and then there be a dance on air at dorchester jail ' i feel sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i be like to come so soon to such a vile end so only give a sigh wish heartily that maskew be not dead and that my leg be not break but that i be back again at the why not or even hear one of dr sherlock 's sermon in my aunt 's parlor elzevir look down at I when i sigh and see i suppose that i be sorrowful try to put a better face on a bad business ` forgive I lad ' he say ` if i have speak too roughly there be yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two whole leg i would have try it but now ` tis little short of madness and yet if thou fear ` st not i will still try it just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle-path lead down but not a hundred yard from where we stand there be a sheep-track lead up the cliff it start where the under-cliff die back again into the chalk face and climb by slant and elbow-turn up to the top the shepherd call it the zigzag and even sheep lose they footing on it and of man i never hear but one have climb it and that be lander jordan when the excise be on he heel half a century back but he that try it stake all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there be no room to carry thou must down on hand and knee and trail thy foot ' it be a desperate chance enough but come as welcome as a patch of blue through lower sky ` yes ' i say ` dear master elzevir let we get to it quickly and if we fall ` tis better far to die upon the rock below than to wait here for they to hale we off to jail ' and with that i try to stand think i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg but 'twa no use and down i sink with a groan then elzevir catch I up hold I in he arm with my head look over he back and make off for the zigzag and as we slink along close to the cliff-side i see between the bramble maskew lie with he face turn up to the morning sky and there be the little red hole in the middle of he forehead and a thread of blood that well up from it and trickle off on to the sward it be a sight to stagger any man and would have make I swoon perhaps but that there be no time for we be at the end of the under-cliff and elzevir set I down for a minute before he buckle to he task and 'twa a task that might cow the bravest and when i look upon the zigzag it seem better to stay where we be and fall into the hand of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rock below for the zigzag start off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few pace narrow down till it be but a whiter thread against the grey-white cliff-face and afterwards turn sharply back cross a hundred foot direct above we head and then i smell a evil stench and look about see the blown-out carcass of a rot sheep lie close at hand ` faugh ' say elzevir ` tis a poor beast have lose he foothold ' it be a ill omen enough and i say as much beseech he to make he own way up the zigzag and leave I where i be for that they might have mercy on a boy ` tush ' he cry ` it be thy heart that fail thee and ` tis too late now to change counsel we have fifteen minute yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff-top in that time we shall have a hour 's start or more for they will take all that to search the under-cliff and maskew too will keep they in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit they cunning so shut thy eye and keep they tight until i bid thee open they ' with that he catch I up again and i shut my eye firm rebuke myself for my faint-heartedness and not tell he how much my foot hurt I in a minute i know from elzevir 's step that he have leave the turf and be upon the chalk now i do not believe that there be half a dozen man beside in england who would have venture up that path even free and untrammelled and not a man in all the world to do it with a full-grown lad in he arm yet elzevir make no bone of it nor speak a single word only he go very slow and i feel he scuffle with he foot as he set it forward to make sure he be put it down firm i say nothing not wish to distract he from he terrible task and hold my breath when i could so that i might lie quieter in he arm thus he go on for a time that seem without end and yet be really but a minute or two and by degree i feel the wind that we could scarce perceive at all on the under-cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff-side and then the path grow steeper and steeper and elzevir go slower and slower till at last he speak : ` john i be go to stop but open not thy eye till i have set thee down and bid thee ' i do as bidden and he lower I gently set I on all-fours upon the path and speaking again : ` the path be too narrow here for I to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hand and knee but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff for there be no room to dance hornpipe here and hold thy eye fix on the chalk-wall look neither down nor seaward ' 'twa well he tell I what to do and well i do it for when i open my eye even without move they from the cliff-side i see that the ledge be little more than a foot wide and that ever so little a lean of the body would dash I on the rock below so i creep on but spend much time that be so precious in travel those ten yard to take I round the first elbow of the path for my foot be heavy and give I fierce pain to drag though i try to mask it from elzevir and he forget what i suffer cry out ` quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time be short ' now so frail be man 's temper that though he be do more than any ever do to save another 's life and be all i have to trust to in the world yet because he forget my pain and bid I quicken my choler rise and i nearly give he back a angry word but think better of it and keep it in then he tell I to stop for that the way grow wider and he would pick I up again but here be another difficulty for the path be still so narrow and the cliff-wall so close that he could not take I up in he arm so i lay flat on my face and he step over I set he foot between my shoulder to do it and then while he kneel down upon the path i climb up from behind upon he put my arm round he neck and so he bear I ` pickaback ' i shut my eye firm again and thus we move along another spell mount still and feel the wind still freshen at length he say that we be come to the last turn of the path and he must set I down once more so down upon he knee and hand he go and i slide off behind on to the ledge both be on all-fours now elzevir first and i follow but as i creep along i relax care for a moment and my eye wander from the cliff-side and look down and far below i see the blue sea twinkle like a dazzling mirror and the gull wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that have fall from this very spot perhaps and in a instant feel a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and know that i be giddy and must fall then i call out to elzevir and he guess what have come over I cry to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff and how he do it in such a narrow strait i know not but he turn round and lie down himself thrust he hand firmly in my back press I closer to the cliff yet it be none too soon for if he have not hold I tight i should have fling myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness ` keep thine eye shut john ' he say ` and count up number loud to I that i may know thou art not turn faint ' so i give out ` one two three ' and while i go on count hear he repeat to himself though he word seem thin and far off : ` we must have take ten minute to get here and in five more they will be on the under-cliff and if we ever reach the top who know but they have leave a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man know of the zigzag and if they know they would not guess that we should try it we have but fifty yard to go to win and now this cursed giddy fit have come upon the child and he will fall and drag I with he or they will see we from below and pick we off like sit guillemot against the cliff-face ' so he talk to himself and all the while i would have give a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that have hold of I thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir push firmly in my back and the thing that frighten I most be that there be nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for have there be a piece of string or even a thread of cotton stretch along to give a semblance of support i think i could have do it but there be only the cliff-wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind be blow in fresh puff and though i do not open my eye i know that it be move the little tuft of bent grass and the chide cry of the gull seem to invite I to be do with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rock below then elzevir speak ` john ' he say ` there be no time to play the woman another minute of this and we be lose pluck up thy courage keep thy eye to the cliff and forward ' yet i could not but answer : ' i can not i can not if i open my eye or move hand or foot i shall fall on the rock below ' he wait a second and then say : ` nay move thou must and ` tis better to risk fall now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on ' and with that he shift he hand from my back and fix it in my coat-collar move backwards himself and set to drag I after he now i be so besotted with fright that i would not budge a inch fear to fall over if i open my eye and elzevir for all he be so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path so he give it up leave go hold on I with a groan and at that moment there rise from the under-cliff below a sound of voice and shout ` zound they be down already ' cry elzevir ` and have find maskew 's body it be all up another minute and they will see we ' but so strange be the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i hear those voice from below all fright of fall leave I in a moment and i could open my eye without a trace of giddiness so i begin to move forward again on hand and knee and elzevir see I think for a moment i have go mad and be drag myself over the cliff but then see how it be and move backwards himself before I say in a low voice ` brave lad once creep round this turn and i will pick thee up again there be but fifty yard to go and we shall foil these devil yet ' then we hear the voice again but farther off and not so loud and know that we pursuer have leave the under-cliff and turn down on to the beach think that we be hide by the sea five minute later elzevir step on to the cliff-top with I upon he back ` we have make something of this throw ' he say ` and be safe for another hour though i think thy giddy head have ruin we ' then he put I gently upon the springy turf and lay down himself upon he back stretch he arm out straight on either side and breathing hard to recover from the task he have perform \* \* \* \* \* the day be still young and far below we be stretch the move floor of the channel with a silver-grey film of night-mist not yet lift in the offing a hummocky up-and-down line of cliff all projection dent bay and hollow trend southward till it end in the great bluff of st alban 's head ten mile away the cliff-face be gleam white the sea tawny inshore but purest blue outside with the straight sunpath across it spangle and gleam like a mackerel 's back the relief of be once more on firm ground and the exultation of a escape from immediate danger remove my pain and make I forget that my leg be break so i lay for a moment bask in the sun and the wind which a few minute before threaten to blow I from that narrow ledge seem now but the gentlest of breeze fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this be only for a moment for the anguish come back and grow apace and i fall to think dismally of the plight we be in how thing have be against we in these last day first there be lose the why not and that be bad enough second there be the be know by the excise for smuggler and perhaps for murderer third and last there be the breaking of my leg which make escape so difficult but most of all there come before my eye that gray face turn up against the morning sun and i think of all it mean for grace and would have give my own life to call back that of we worst enemy then elzevir sit up stretch himself like one wake out of sleep and say : ` we must be go they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for we hereabouts but that we can not risk and must get clear away this leg of thine will keep we tie for week and we must find some place where we can lie hide and tend it now i know such a hiding-hole in purbeck which they call joseph 's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there for it be seven mile off and i be older than i be and thou too heavy a babe to carry over lightly ' i do not know the pit he speak of but be glad to hear of some place however far off where i could lie still and get ease from the pain and so he take I in he arm again and start off across the field i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wish for the pain go to my head and fill I with such a drowsy anguish that i know nothing except when some unlooked-for movement give I a sharper twinge and make I cry out at first elzevir walk briskly but as the day wear on go slower and be fain more than once to put I down and rest till at last he could only carry I a hundred yard at a time it be after noon for the sun be past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country begin to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkle with tiny white snail-shell the ground be brashy with flat stone and divide up into tillage field it be a bleak wide-bitten place enough look as if ` twould never pay for turn and instead of hedge there be dreary wall build of dry stone without mortar behind one of these wall break down in place but hold together with straggle ivy and buttress here and there with a bramble-bush elzevir put I down at length and say ' i be beat and can carry thee no farther for this present though there be not now much farther to go we have pass purbeck gate and these wall will screen we from prying eye if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldier they be not like to come this way so soon and if they come i can not help it for weariness and the sun 's heat have make my foot like lead a score of year ago i would have laugh at such a task but now ` tis different and i must take a little sleep and rest till the air be cooler so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both way then if thou see aught move wake I up -- i wish i have a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound ' -- and he take maskew 's silver-butted pistol again from he bosom and handle it lovingly -- ` tis like my evil luck to carry fire-arm thirty year and leave they at home at a pinch like this ' with that he fling himself down where there be a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i know from he heavy breathing that he be asleep the wind have freshen much and be blow strong from the west and now that i be under the lee of the wall i begin to perceive that drowsiness creep upon I which overtake a man who have be tousle for a hour or two by the wind and get at length into shelter moreover though i be not tire by grievous toil like elzevir i have pass a night without sleep and feel besides the weariness of pain to lull I to slumber so it be that before a quarter of a hour be past i have much ado to keep awake for all i know that i be leave on guard then i seek something to fix my thought and look on that side of the wall where the sward be fall to count the mole-hill that be cast up in number thereabout and when i have exhaust they and reckon up thirty little heap of dry and powdery brown earth that lay at random on the green turf i turn my eye to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and see the inch-high blade of corn come up between the stone then i fall to count the blade feel glad to have discover a reckoning that would not be exhaust at thirty but would go on for million and million and million and before i have reach ten in so heroic a numeration be fast asleep a sharp noise wake I with a start that set the pain tingle in my leg and though i could see nothing i know that a shot have be fire very near we i be for wake elzevir but he be already full awake and put a finger on he lip to show i should not speak then he creep a few pace down the wall to where a ivy bush over-topped it enough for he to look through the leaf without be see he drop down again with a look of relief and say '' ti but a lad scare rook with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he make this way ' a minute later he say : ` the boy be come straight for the wall we shall have to show ourselves ' and while he speak there be a rattle of fall stone where the boy be partly climb and partly pull down the dry wall and so elzevir stand up the boy look frightened and make as if he would run off but elzevir pass he the time of day in a civil voice and he stop and give it back ` what be you do here son ' block ask ` scare rook for farmer topp ' be the answer ` have you get a charge of powder to spare ' say elzevir show he pistol ' i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have drop my flask maybe you have see a flask in walk through the furrow ' he whisper to I to lie still so that it might not be perceive my leg be break and the boy reply : ` no i have see no flask but very like have not come the same way as you be send out here from lowermoigne and as for powder i have little left and must save that for the rook or shall get a beating for my pain ' ` come ' say elzevir ` give I a charge or two and there be half a crown for thee ' and he take the coin out of he pocket and show it the boy 's eye twinkle and so would mine at so valuable a piece and he take out from he pocket a battered cowskin flask ` give flask and all ' say elzevir ` and thou shalt have a crown ' and he show he the larger coin no time be waste in word elzevir have the flask in he pocket and the boy be bite the crown ` what shot have you ' say elzevir ` what have you drop you shot-flask too ' ask the boy and he voice have something of surprise in it ` nay but my shot be over small if thou hast a slug or two i would take they ' ' i have a dozen goose-slug no 2 ' say the boy ` but thou must pay a shilling for they my master say i never be to use they except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over : i shall get a sound beating for my pain and to be beat be worth a shill ' ` if thou art beat be beat for something more ' say elzevir the tempter ` give I that firelock that thou carriest and take a guinea ' ` nay i know not ' say the boy ` there be queer tale afloat at lowermoigne how that a posse meet the contraband this morning and shot be fire and a gauger get a overdose of lead -- maybe of goose slug no 2 the smuggler get off clear but they say the hue and cry be up already and that a head-price will be fix of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling-piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon I as well as my master ' the surprise in he voice be change to suspicion for while he speak i see that he eye have fall on my foot though i try to keep it in the shadow and that he see the boot clot with blood and the kerchief tie round my leg '' ti for that very reason ' say elzevir ` that i want the firelock these smuggler be roam loose and a pistol be a poor thing to stop such wicked rascal on a lone hill-side come come _ thou _ dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy ' he have the guinea between he finger and thumb and the gleam of the gold be too strong to be withstand so we gain a sorry matchlock slug and powder and the boy walk off over the furrow whistle with he hand in he pocket and a guinea and a crown-piece in he hand he whistle sound innocent enough yet i mistrust he have catch he eye when he be look at my bloody foot and so i say as much to elzevir who only laugh say the boy be simple and harmless but from where i sit i could peep out through the bramble in the open gap and see without be see -- and there be my young gentleman walk carelessly enough and whistle like any bird so long as elzevir 's head be above the wall but when elzevir sit down the boy give a careful look round and see no one watch any more drop he whistle and make off as fast as heel would carry he then i know that he have guess who we be and be off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir be on he foot again the boy be out of sight over the hill-brow ` let we move on ' say block ` tis but a little distance now to go and the heat be past already we must have sleep three hour or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john ` tis when the sentry sleep that the enemy laugh and for thee the posse might have have we both like daylight owl ' with that he take I on he back and make off with a lusty stride keep as much as possible under the brow of the hill and in the shelter of the wall we have sleep longer than we think for the sun be wester fast and though the rest have refresh I my leg have grow stiff and hurt the more in dangle when we start again elzevir be still walk strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carry and in less than half a hour i know though i have never be there before we be in the land of the old marble quarry at the back of anvil point although i know little of these quarry and certainly be in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learn much about they out of such excavation come that black purbeck marble which you see in old church in we country and i be tell in other part of england as well and the way of make a marble quarry be to sink a tunnel slant very steeply down into the earth like a well turn askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred foot deep then from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passage or tunnel mostly six foot high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble be dig these quarry be make by man century ago some say by the roman themselves and though some be still work in other part of purbeck those at the back of anvil point have be disuse beyond the memory of man we have leave the stony village field and the face of the country be cover once more with the closest sward which be just put on the brighter green of spring this turf be not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heap of worthless stone and marble draw out of the quarry age ago which the green vestment have cover for the most part though it leave sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peer out at the top of a mound there be many tumble-down wall and low gable leave of the cottage of the old quarryman grass-covered ridge mark out the little garden-fold and here and there still stand a forlorn gooseberry-bush or a stunt plum-or apple-tree with its branch all sweep eastward by the up-channel gale as for the quarry shaft themselves they too be cover round the tip with the green turf and down they lead a narrow flight of steep-cut step with a slide of soap-stone at the side on which the marble block be once haul up by wooden winch down these step no foot ever walk now for not only be suffocating gas say to beset the bottom of the shaft but man would have it that in the narrow passage below lurk evil spirit and demon one who ought to know about such thing tell I that when st aldhelm first come to purbeck he bind the old pagan god under a ban deep in these passage but that the worst of all the crew be a certain demon call the mandrive who watch over the best of the black marble and that be why such marble might only be use in church or for grave for if it be not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hew it it be by the side of one of these old shaft that elzevir lay I down at last the light be very low show all the little unevenness of the turf and the sward creep over the edge of the hole and every crack and crevice in step and slide be green with fern the green fern shroud the wall of the hole and ruddy brown bramble overgrow the step till all be lose in the gloom that hang at the bottom of the pit elzevir draw a deep breath or two of the cool evening air like a man who have come through a difficult trial ` there ' he say ` this be joseph 's pit and here we must lie hide until thy foot be sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry and at the king 's crown itself they can not search all the quarry and be not like to search any of they for they be coward at the best and hang much on tale of the mandrive ay and such tale be true enough for there lurk gas at the bottom of most of the shaft like devil to strangle any that go down and if they do come down this joseph 's pit we still have nineteen chance in a score they can not thread the workings but last if they come down and thread the path there be this pistol and a rusty matchlock and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell we life so dear they will not care to buy they ' we wait a few minute and then he take I in he arm and begin to descend the step back first as one go down a hatchway the sun be set in a heavy bank of cloud just as we begin to go down and i could not help remember how i have see it set over peaceful moonfleet only twenty-four hour ago and how far off we be now and how long it be likely to be before i see that dear village and grace again the stair be still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir pay great care to he foot lest he should slip on the fern and moss with which they be overgrow when we reach the bramble he meet they with he back and though i hear the thorn tear in he coat he shove they aside with he broad shoulder and screen my dangling leg from get catch thus he come safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we get there all be dark but he step off into a narrow opening on the right hand and walk on as if he know the way i could see nothing but perceive that we be pass through endless gallery cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walk upright but sometimes so low as to force he to bend down and carry I in a very constrain attitude only twice do he set I down at a turn while he take out he tinder-box and light a match but at length the darkness become less dark and i see that we be in a large cave or room into which the light come through some opening at the far end at the same time i feel a colder breath and fresh salt smell in the air that tell I we be very near the sea chapter 11 the sea-cave the dull loneness the black shade that these hang vault have make : the strange music of the wave beat on these hollow cave -- _ wither _ he set I down in one corner where be some loose dry silver-sand upon the floor which other have perhaps use for a resting-place before ` thou must lie here for a month or two lad ' he say ` tis a mean bed but i have know many worse and will get straw tomorrow if i can to better it ' i have eat nothing all day nor have elzevir yet i feel no hunger only a giddiness and burning thirst like that which come upon I when i be shut in the mohune vault so 'twa very music to I to hear a pat and splash of water drop from the roof into a little pool upon the floor and elzevir make a cup out of my hat and give a full drink of it that be icy-cool and more delicious than any smuggled wine of france and after that i know little that happen for ten day or more for fever have hold of I and as i learn afterwards i talk wild and could scarce be restrain from jump up and loose the binding that elzevir have put upon my leg and all that time he nurse I as tenderly as any mother could she child and never leave the cave except when he be force to seek food but after the fever pass it leave I very thin as i could see from hand and arm and weaker than a baby and i use to lie the whole day not think much nor troubling about anything but eat what be give I and draw a quiet pleasure from the knowledge that strength be gradually return elzevir have find a battered sea-chest up on peveril point and from the side of it make splint to set my leg -- use he own shirt for bandage the sand-bed too be make more soft and easy with some armful of straw and in one corner of the cave be a little pile of driftwood and a iron cooking-pot and all these thing have elzevir get by forage of night use great care that none should see he and take only what would not be much miss or think about but soon he contrived to give ratsey word of where we be and after that the sexton fend for we there be none even of the lander know what be become of we save only ratsey and he never come down the quarry but would leave what he bring in one of the ruin cottage a half-mile from the shaft and all the while there be strict search be make for we and mount excisemen scour the country for though at first the posse take back maskew 's dead body and say we must have fall over the cliff for there be nothing to be find of we yet afterwards a farm-boy bring a tale of how he have come suddenly on man lurk under a wall and how one have a bloody foot and leg and how the other spring upon he and after a fierce struggle wrench he master 's rook-piece from he hand rifle he pocket of a powder-horn and make off with they like a hare towards corfe and as to maskew some of the soldier say that elzevir have shoot he and other that he die by misadventure be kill by a stray bullet of one of he own man on the hill-top but for all that they put a head-price on elzevir of 50 and 20 for I so we have reason to lie close it must have be maskew that listen that night at the door when elzevir tell I the hour at which the cargo be to be run for the posse have be order to be at hoar head at four in the morning so all the gang would have be take have it not be for the gulder make earlier and the soldier be delay by tipple at the lobster all this elzevir learn from ratsey and tell I to pass the time though in truth i have as lief not hear it for ` tis no pleasant thing to see one 's head write down so low as 20 and what i want most to know namely how grace fare and how she take the bad news of she father 's death i could not hear for elzevir say nothing and i be shy to ask he now when i come entirely to myself and be able to take stock of thing i find that the place in which i lay be a cave some eight yard square and three in height whose straight-cut wall show that man have once hew stone therefrom on one side be that passage through which we have come in and on the other open a sort of door which give on to a stone ledge eight fathom above high-water mark for the cave be cut out just inside that iron cliff-face which lie between st alban 's head and swanage but the cliff here be different from those on the other side of the head be neither so high as hoar head nor of chalk but stand for the most part only a hundred or a hundred and fifty foot above the sea and show towards it a stern face of solid rock but though they rise not so high above the water they go down a long way below it so that there be fifty fathom right up to the cliff and many a good craft out of reckoning in fog or on a pitch-dark night have run full against that frown wall and perish ship and crew without a soul to hear they cry yet though the rock look hard as adamant the eternal wash of the wave have wear it out below and even with the slightest swell there be a dull and distant booming of the surge in those cavernous deep and when the wind blow fresh each roller smite the cliff like a thunder-clap till even the living rock tremble again it be on a ledge of that rock-face that we cave open and sometimes on a fine day elzevir would carry I out thither so that i might sun myself and see all the move channel without myself be see for this ledge be carve out something like a balcony so that when the quarry be in work they could lower the stone by pulley to boat lie underneath and perhaps haul up a keg or two by the way of ballast as might be guess by the stanchion still rusting in the rock such be this gallery and as for the inside of the cave 'twa a great empty room with a white floor make up of broken stone-dust trodden hard of old till one would say it be plaster and dry without those sweaty damp so often see in such place -- save only in one corner a land-spring drop from the roof trickle down over spiky rock-icicle and fall into a little hollow in the floor this basin have be scoop out of set purpose with a gutter seaward for the overflow and round it and on the wet patch of the roof above grow a garden of fern and other clinging plant the week move on until we be in the middle of may when even the night be no longer cold as the sun gather power and with the warmer day my strength too increase and though i dare not yet stand my leg have cease to pain I except for some sharp twinge now and then which elzevir say be cause by the bone setting and then he would put a poultice make of grass upon the place and once walk almost as far as chaldron to pluck sorrel for a soothing mash now though he have go out and in so many time in safety yet i be always ill at ease when he be away lest he might fall into some ambush and never come back nor be it any thought of what would come to I if he be catch that grieve I but only care for he for i have come to lean in everything upon this grim and grizzled giant and love he like a father so when he be away i take to read to beguile my thought but find little choice of matter have only my aunt 's red prayer-book that i thrust into my bosom the afternoon that i leave moonfleet and blackbeard 's locket for that locket hang always round my neck and i often have the parchment out and read it not that i do not know it now by heart but because read it seem to bring grace to my thought for the last time i have read it be when i see she in the manor wood elzevir and i have often talk over what be to be do when my leg should be sound again and resolve to take passage to st malo in the _ bonaventure _ and there lie hide till the pursuit against we should have cease for though 'twa wartime french and english be as brother in the contraband and the shipper would give we bit and sup and glad to as long as we have need of they but of this i need not say more because 'twa but a project which other event come in to overturn yet 'twa this very errand namely to fix with the _ bonaventure _ 's man the time to take we over to the other side that elzevir have go out on the day of which i shall now speak he be to go to poole and leave we cave in the afternoon think it safe to keep along the cliff-edge even in the daylight and to strike across country when dusk come on the wind have blow fresh all the morning from south-west and after elzevir have leave strengthen to a gale my leg be now so strong that i could walk across the cave with the help of a stout blackthorn that elzevir have cut I : and so i go out that afternoon on to the ledge to watch the grow sea there i sit down with my back against a protect rock in such a place that i could see up-channel and yet shelter from the rush wind the sky be overcast and the long wall of rock show gray with orange-brown patch and a darker line of sea-weed at the base like the under strake of a boat 's belly for the tide be but begin to make there be a mist half-fog half-spray scud before the wind and through it i could see the white-backed roller lift over peveril point while all along the cliff-face the sea-bird throng the ledge and sit huddle in snowy line know the mischief that be brewing in the element it be a melancholy scene and breed melancholy in my heart and about sun-down the wind southe a point or two set the sea more against the cliff so that the spray begin to fly even over my ledge and drive I back into the cave the night come on much sooner than usual and before long i be lie on my straw bed in perfect darkness the wind have go still more to south and be scream through the opening of the cave the cavern down below bellowed and rumble every now and then a giant roller strike the rock such a blow as make the cave tremble and then a second later there would fall splatter on the ledge outside the heavy spray that have be lift by the impact i have say that i be melancholy but worse follow for i grow timid and fearful of the wild night and the loneliness and the darkness and all sort of evil tale come to my mind and i think much of baleful heathen god that st aldhelm have banish to these underground cellar and of the mandrive who leap on people in the dark and strangle they and then fancy play another trick on I and i seem to see a man lie on the cave-floor with a draw white face upturn and a red hole in the forehead and at last could bear the dark no longer but get up with my lame leg and grope round till i find a candle for we have two or three in store 'twa only with much ado i get it light and set up in the corner of the cave and then i sit down close by try to screen it with my coat but do what i would the wind come gust round the corner blow the flame to one side and make the candle gutter as another candle gutter on that black day at the why not and so think whisk round till i see maskew 's face wear a look of evil triumph when the pin fall at the auction and again he face grow deadly pale and there be the bullet-mark on he brow surely there be evil spirit in this place to lead my thought so much astray and then there come to my mind that locket on my neck which man have once hung round blackbeard 's to scare evil spirit from he tomb if it could frighten they from he might it not rout they now and make they fly from I and with that thought i take the parchment out and open it before the flickering light although i know all word for word con it over again and read it out aloud it be a relief to hear a human voice even though 'twa nothing but my own and i take to shout the word have much ado even so to make they hear for the rage of the storm : ` the day of we age be threescore year and ten and though man be so strong that they come to fourscore year : yet be they strength then but labor and sorrow so soon passeth it away and we be go ` and as for I my foot be almost ' at the ` almost ' i stop be bring up suddenly with a fierce beat of blood through my vein and a jump fit to burst they for i have hear a scuffle noise in the passage that lead to the cave as if someone have stumble against a loose stone in the dark i do not know then but have learn since that where there be a loud noise such as the roaring of a cascade the churning of a mill or as here the rage and bluster of a storm -- if there arise some different sound even though it be as slight as the whistle of a bird ` twill strike the ear clear above the general din and so it be this night for i catch that stumble tread even when the gale blow loudest and sit motionless and breathless in my eagerness of listen and then the gale lull a instant and i hear the slow beat of footstep as of one grope he way down the passage in the dark i know it be not elzevir for first he could not be back from poole for many hour yet and second he always whistle in a certain way to show 'twa he come and give besides a pass-word yet if not elzevir who could it be i blow out the light for i do not want to guide the aim of some unknown marksman shooting at I from the dark and then i thought of that gaunt strangler that spring on marbleworker in the gloom yet it could not be the mandrive for surely he would know he own passage better than to stumble in they in the dark it be more likely to be one of the hue and cry who have smell we out and hope perhaps to be able to reconnoitre without be perceive on so awful a night whenever elzevir go out forage he carry with he that silver-butted pistol which have once be maskew 's but leave behind the old rook-piece we have plenty of powder and slug now have obtain a store of both from ratsey and elzevir have bid I keep the matchlock charge and use it or not after my own judgement if any come to the cave but give as he counsel that it be better to die fighting than to swing at dorchester for that we should most certainly do if take we have agree moreover on a pass-word which be _ prosper the bonaventure _ so that i might challenge betime any that i hear come and if they give not back this countersign might know it be not elzevir so now i reach out for the piece which lay beside I on the floor and scramble to my foot lift the deckle in the darkness and feeling with my finger in the pan to see 'twa full of powder the lull in the storm still last and i hear the footstep advance though with uncertain slowness and once after a heavy stumble i think i catch a muttereth oath as if someone have strike he foot against a stone then i shout out clear in the darkness a ` who go there ' that ring again through the stone roof the footstep stop but there be no answer ` who go there ' i repeat ` answer or i fire ' ' _ prosper the bonaventure _ ' come back out of the darkness and i know that i be safe ` the devil take thee for a hot-blooded young bantam to shoot thy best friend with powder and ball that he be fool enough to give thee ' and by this time i have guess 'twas master ratsey and recognize he voice ' i would have let thee hear soon enough that 'twa i if i have know i be so near thy lair but ` tis more than a man 's life be worth to creep down molehole in the dark and on a night like this and why i could not get out the gibberish about the _ bonaventure _ sooner be because i match my shin to break a stone and lose the wager and my breath together and when my wind return ` tis very like that i be trap into a oath which be sad enough for I who be sexton and so to say in small order of the church of england as by law establish ' by the time i have put down the gun and coax the candle again to light ratsey step into the cave he wear a sou ` wester and be drip with wet but seem glad to see I and shake I by the hand he be welcome enough to I also for he banish the dreadful loneliness and he come be a bit out of my old pleasant life that lay so far away and seem to bring I once more within reach of some that be dearest chapter 12 a funeral how he lie in he rights of a man death have do all death can -- _ brown _ we stand for a moment hold one another 's hand then ratsey speak ` john these two month have change thee from boy to man thou wast a child when i turn that morning as we go up hoar head with the pack-horse and look back on thee and elzevir below and maskew lie on the ground 'twa a sorry business and have break up the finest gang that ever run a cargo besides drive thee and elzevir to hide in cave and den of the earth thou shouldst have come with we that morn not have stay behind the work be too rough for boy : the skipper should have pipe the reefing-hand ' it be true enough or seem to I true then for i feel much cast down but only say ` nay master ratsey where master block stay there i must stay too and where he go i follow ' then i sit down upon the bed in the corner feeling my leg begin to ache and the storm which have lull for a few minute come up again all the fiercer with wilder gust and shower of spray and rain drive into the cave from seaward so i be scarce sit down when in come a roar blast fill even we corner with cold wet air that quench the weakling candle flame ` god save we what a night ' ratsey cry ` god save poor soul at sea ' say i ` aman to that ' say he ` and would that every aman i have say have come as truly from my heart there will be sea enough on moonfleet beach this night to lift a schooner to the top of it and launch she down into the field behind i have as lief be in the mohune vault as in this fearsome place and liefer too if half the tale man tell be true of face that may meet one here for god 's sake let we light a fire for i catch sight of a store of driftwood before that sickly candle go out ' it be some time before we get a fire alight and even after the flame have catch well hold the rush of the wind would every now and again blow the smoke into we eye or send a shower of spark dancing through the cave but by degree the log begin to glow clear white and such a cheerful warmth come out as be in itself a solace and remedy for man 's affliction ` ah ' say ratsey ' i be shramm with wet and cold and half-dead with this baffling wind it be a bless thing a fire ' and he unbutton he pilot-coat ` and needful now if ever my soul be very low lad for this place have strange memory for I and i recollect forty year ago -lrb- when i be just a boy like thee -rrb- old lander jordan 's gang and i among they be in this very cave on such another night i be new to the trade then as thou might be and could not sleep for noise of wind and sea and in the small hour of a autumn morning as i lay here just where we lie now i hear such wail cry above the storm ay and such shriek of woman as make my blood run cold and have not yet forget they and so i wake the gang who be all deep asleep as seasoned contrabandier should be but though we know that there be fellow-creature fight for they life in the seething flood beneath we we could not stir hand or foot to save they for nothing could be see for rain and spray and 'twa not till next morning that we learn the _ florida _ have founder just below with every soul on board ay ` tis a queer life and you and block be in a queer strait now and that be what i come to tell you see here ' and he take out of he pocket a oblong strip of print paper : \* \* \* \* \* gr whitehall 15 may 1758 whereas it have be humbly represent to the king that on Friday the night of the 16th of April last thoma maskew a justice of the peace be most inhumanly murder at hoar head a lone place in the parish of chaldron in the county of dorset by one elzevir block and one john trenchard both of the parish of moonfleet in the aforesaid county : he majesty for the better discover and bring to justice these person be please to promise he most gracious pardon to any of the person concerned therein except the person who actually commit the say murder and as a further encouragement a reward of fifty pound to any person who shall furnish such information as shall lead to the apprehension of the say elzevir block and a reward of twenty pound to any person who shall furnish such information as shall lead to the apprehension of the say john trenchard such information to be give to I or to the governor of he majesty 's gaol in dorchester holdernesse \* \* \* \* \* ` there -- that be the bill ' he say ` and a vastly fine piece it be and yet i wish that 'twa play with other actor now in moonfleet there be none that know you hiding-place and not a man nor woman either that would tell if they know it ten time over but fifty pound for elzevir and twenty pound for a empty pumpkin-top like thine be a fair round sum and there be vagabond about this countryside scurvy enough to try to earn it and some of these have set the exciseman on _ my _ track with tale of how it be i that know where you lie hide and bring you meat and drink so it be that i can not stir abroad now no not even to the church o ' sunday without have some rogue lurk at my heel to watch my movement and that be why i choose such a night to come hither know these knave like dry skin but never think that the wind would blow like this i be come to tell block that ` tis not safe for I to be so much in purbeck and that i dare no longer bring food or what not or these man-hound will scent you out you leg be sound again and ` tis best to be flit while you may and there be the _ peron d'or _ and chauvelai to give you welcome on the other side ' i tell he how elzevir be go this very night to poole to settle with the _ bonaventure _ when she should come to take we off and at that ratsey seem pleased there be many thing i wish to learn of he and especially how grace do but feel a shyness and durst not ask he and he say no more for a minute seem low-hearted and crouching over the fire so we sit huddle in the corner by the glowing log the red light flicker on the cave roof and show the line on ratsey 's face while the steam rise from he dry clothes the gale blow as fiercely as ever but the tide have fall and there be not so much spray come into the cave then ratsey speak again -- ` my heart be very heavy john tonight to think how all the good old time be go and how that master block can never again go back to moonfleet it be as fine a lander 's crew as ever stand together not even except captain jordan 's and now must all be break up for this mess of maskew 's have make the place too hot to hold we and ` twill be many a long day before another cargo 's run on moonfleet beach but how to get the liquor out of mohune 's vault i know not and that remind I i have something in my pouch for elzevir a ' thee ' and with that he draw forth either lapel a great wicker-bound flask he put one to he lip tilt it and drinking long and deep and then pass it to I with a sigh of satisfaction ` ah that have the right smack here take it child and warm thy heart ` tis the true milk of ararat and the last thou ` lt taste this side the channel ' then i drink too but lightly for the good liquor be no stranger to I though it be only so few month ago that i have taste it for the first time in the why not and in a minute it tingle in my fingertip soon a grateful sense of warmth and comfort steal over I and we state seem not so desperate nor even the night so wild ratsey too wear a more cheerful air and the line in he face be not so deeply mark the golden sparkling influence of the flask have loose he tongue and he be talk now of what i most want to hear ` yes yes it be a sad break-up and what will happen to the old why not i can not tell none have pass the threshold since you leave only the duchy man come and seal the door make it felony to force they and even these lawyer chap know not where the right stand for maskew never pay a rent and die before he take possession and master block 's term be long expire and now he be in hide and a outlaw ` but i be sorriest for maskew 's girl who grow thin and pale as any lily for when the soldier bring the body back the man stand at they door and curse the clay and some of the fishwife spit at it and old mother veitch who keep house for he swear he have never pay she a penny of wages and that she be afear 'd to stop under the same roof with such a evil corpse so out she go from the manor house leave that poor child alone in it with she dead father and there be not want some to say it be all a judgement and call to mind how elzevir have be once leave alone with he dead son at the why not but in the village there be not a man that doubt that 'twa block have send maskew to he account nor do i doubt it either till a tale get abroad that he be kill by a stray shot fire by the posse from the cliff and when they take the hue-and-cry papers to the manor house for he lass as next of kin to sign the requisition she would not set she name to it say that block have never lift he hand against she father when they meet at moonfleet or on the road and that she never would believe he be the man to let he anger sleep so long and then attack a enemy in cold blood and as for thee she know thee for a trusty lad who would not do such thing himself nor yet stand by whilst other do they ' now what ratsey say be sweeter than any music in my ear and i feel myself a better man as anyone must of whom a true woman speak well and that i must live uprightly to deserve such praise then i resolve that come what might i would make my way once more to moonfleet before we flee from england and see grace so that i might tell she all that happen about she father 's death save only that elzevir have mean himself to put maskew away for it be no use to tell she this when she have say that he could never think to do such a thing and besides for all i know he never do mean to shoot but only to frighten he though i thus resolve i say nothing of it to master ratsey but only nod and he go on -- ` well see there be no one save this poor girl to look to put maskew under ground i must need take it in hand myself rough together a sound coffin and digging as fair a grave for he as could be make for any lord except that lord have always vault to sleep in then i get mother nutting 's fish-cart to carry the body down for there be not a man in moonfleet would lay hand to the coffin to bear it and off we start down the street i lead the wall-eyed pony and the coffin follow on the trolley there be no mourner to see he home except he daughter and she without a bit of black upon she for she have no time to get she crape and yet she need none have grief writ plain enough upon she face ` when we get to the churchyard a crowd be gather there man and woman and child not only from moonfleet but from ringstave and monkbury they be not come to mourn but to make gibe to show how much they hate he and many of the child have old pot and pan for rough music parson glennie be wait in the church and there he wait for the cart could not pass the gate and we have no bearer to lift the coffin then i look round to see if there be any that would help to lift but when i try to meet a man 's eye he look away and all i could see be the bitter scowling face of the woman and all the while the girl stand by the trolley look on the ground she have a little kerchief over she head that let the hair fall about she shoulder and she face be very white with eye red and swollen through weep but when she know that all that crowd be there to mock she father and that there be not a man would raise hand to lift he she lay she head upon the coffin hide she face in she hand and sob bitterly ' ratsey stop for a moment and drink again deep at the flask and as for I i still say nothing feel a great lump in my throat and reflect how hatred and passion have power to turn man to brute ' i be a rough man ' ratsey resume ` but tender-like withal and when i see she weep i run off to the church to tell the parson how it be and beg he to come out and try if we two could lift the coffin so out he come just as he be with surplice on he back and book in hand but when the man know what he be come for and look upon that tall fair girl bow down over she father 's coffin they heart be move and first tom tewkesbury step out with a sheepish air and then garrett and then four other so now we have six fine bearer and 'twa only woman that could still look hard and scowling and even they say no word and not a boy beat on he pan ` then mr glennie see he be not want for bearer change to parson and strike up with i be the resurrection and the life ` tis a great text john and though i have hear it score and score of time it never sound sweeter than on that day for 'twa a fine afternoon and what with they be no wind but the sun bright and the sea still and blue there be a calm on everything that seem to say rest in peace rest in peace and be not the spring with we and the whole land preaching of resurrection the bird singing tree and flower wake from they winter sleep and cowslip yellow on the very grave then surely ` tis a fond thing to push we enmity beyond the grave and perhaps even _ he _ be not so bad as we hold he but might have trick himself into think he do right to hunt down the contraband i know not how it be but something like this come into my mind and do perhaps to other for we get he under without a sign or word from any that stand there there be not one sound hear inside the church or out except mr glennie 's reading and my amen and now and then a sob from the poor child but when 'twa all over and the coffin safe lower up she walk to tom tewkesbury say through she tear i thank you sir for you kindness and hold out she hand so he take it look askew and afterwards the five other bearer and then she walk away by herself and no one move till she have leave the churchyard gate let she pass out like a queen ' ` and so she be a queen ' i say not be able to keep from speak for very pride to hear how she have bear herself and because she have always show kindness to I ` so she be and fairer than any queen to boot ' ratsey give I a question look and i could see a little smile upon he face in the firelight ` ay she be fair enough ' say he as though reflect to himself ` but white and thin mayhap she would make a match for thee -- if ye be man and woman and not boy and girl if she be not rich and thou not poor and a outlaw and -- if she would have thee ' it vex I to hear he banter and to think how i have let my secret out so i do not answer and we sit by the ember for a while without speak while the wind still blow through the cave like a funnel ratsey speak first ` john pass I the flask i can hear voice mount the cliff of those poor soul of the _ florida _ ' with that he take another heavy pull and fling a log on the fire till spark fly about as in a smithy and the flame that have slumber wake again and leap out white blue and green from the salt wood now as the light dance and flicker i see a piece of parchment lie at ratsey 's foot : and this be none other than the write out of blackbeard 's locket which i have be read when i first hear footstep in the passage and have drop in my alarm of hostile visitor ratsey see it too and stretch out he hand to pick it up i would have conceal it if i could because i have never tell he how i have rifle blackbeard 's coffin and do not want to be question as to how i have come by the writing but to try to stop he get hold of it would only have spur he curiosity and so i say nothing when he take it in he hand ` what be this son ' ask he ` it be only scripture verse ' i answer ` which i get some time ago ` tis say they be a spell against spirit of evil and i be read they to keep off the loneliness of this place when you come in and make I drop they ' i be afraid lest he should ask whence i have get they but he do not think perhaps that my aunt have give they to I the heat of the flame have curl the parchment a little and he spread it out on he knee con it in the firelight '' tis well write ' he say ` and good verse enough but he who put they together for a spell know little how to keep off evil spirit for this would not keep a flea from a black cat i could do ten time better myself be not without some little understanding of such thing ' and he nod seriously ` and though i never yet meet any from the other world they would not take I unprepared if they should come for i have spend half my life in graveyard or church and ` twould be as foolish to move about such place and have no word to meet a evil visitor withal as to bear money on a lonely road without a pistol so one day after parson glennie have preach from habakkuk how that the vision be for a appoint time but at the end it shall speak and not lie : though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry i talk with he on these matter and get from he three or four rousing text such as spectre fear more than a burn child do the fire i will learn they all to thee some day but for the moment take this latin which i get by heart : _ abite a I in ignem etemum qui paratus est diabolo at angelis ejus _ english it mean : depart from I into eternal fire prepare for the devil and he angel but have at least double that power in latin so get that after I by heart and use it freely if thou art lead to think that there be evil presence near and in such lonely place as this cave ' i humor he by do as he desire and that the rather because i hope he thought would thus be turn away from the writing but as soon as i have the spell by rote he turn back to the parchment say ` he be but a poor divine who write this for beside choose ill-fitting verse he can not even give right number to they for see here the day of we age be three-score year and ten and though man be so strong that they come to four-score year yet be they strength then but labor and sorrow so soon passeth it away and we be go and he write psalm 9021 now i have say that psalm with parson verse and verse about for every sleeper we have lay to rest in churchyard mould for thirty year and know it have not twenty verse in it all tell and this same verse be the clerk 's verse and cometh tenth and yet he call it twenty-first i wish i have here a common prayer and i would prove my word ' he stop and fling I back the parchment scornfully but i fold it and slip it in my pocket brood all the while over a strange thought that he last word have bring to I nor do i tell he that i have by I my aunt 's prayer-book wish to examine for myself more closely whether he be right after he should have go ' i must be away ' he say at last ` though loath to leave this good fire and liquor i would fain wait till elzevir be back and fainer till this gale be spend but it may not be the night be short and i must be out of purbeck before sunrise so tell block what i say that he and thou must flit and pass the flask for i have fifteen mile to walk against the wind and must keep off these midnight chill ' he drink again and then rise to he foot shake himself like a dog and walk briskly across the cave twice or thrice to make sure as i think that the ararat milk have not confuse he step then he shake my hand warmly and disappear in the deep shadow of the passage-mouth the wind be blow more fitfully than before and there be some sign of a lull between the gust i stand at the opening of the passage and listen till the echo of ratsey 's footstep die away and then return to the corner fling more wood on the fire and light the candle after that i take out again the parchment and also my aunt 's red prayer-book and sit down to study they first i look out in the book that text about the ` day of we life ' and find that it be indeed in the ninetieth psalm but the tenth verse just as ratsey say and not the twenty-first as it be writ on the parchment and then i take the second text and here again the psalm be give correct but the verse be two and not six as my scribe have it it be just the same with the other three -- the number of the psalm be right but the verse wrong so here be a discovery for all be painfully write smooth and clean without a blot and yet in every verse a error but if the second number do not stand for the verse what else should it mean i have scarce form the question to myself before i have the answer and know that it must be the number of the word choose in each text to make a secret meaning i be in as great a fever and excitement now as when i find the locket in the mohune vault and could scarce count with tremble finger as far as twenty-one in the first verse for hurry and amaze it be ` fourscore ' that the number fall on in the first text ` foot ' in the second ` deep ' in the third ` well ' in the fourth ` north ' in the fifth fourscore -- foot -- deep -- well -- north there be the cipher read and what a easy trick and yet i have not light on it all this while nor ever should have but for sexton ratsey and he burial verse it be a cunning plan of blackbeard but other folk be quite as cunning as he and here be all he treasure at we foot i chuckle over that to myself rub my hand and read it through again : fourscore -- foot -- deep -- well -- north 'twa all so simple and the word in the fourth verse ` well ' and not ` vale ' or ` pool ' as i have stick at so often in try to unriddle it how be it i have not guess as much before and here be something to tell elzevir when he come back that the clue be find to the cipher and the secret out i would not reveal it all at once but tease he by make he guess and at last tell he everything and we would set to work at once to make ourselves rich man and then i think once more of grace and how the laugh would be on my side now for all master ratsey 's banter about she be rich and I be poor fourscore -- feet-deep -- well -- north i read it again and somehow it be this time a little less dear and i fall to think what it be exactly that i should tell elzevir and how we be to get to work to find the treasure 'twa hide in a _ well _ -- that be plain enough but in what well -- and what do ` north ' mean be it the _ north well _ or to _ north of the well _ -- or be it fourscore foot _ north _ of the _ deep well _ i stare at the verse as if the ink would change color and show some other sense and then a veil seem draw across the writing and the meaning to slip away and be as far as ever from my grasp _ fourscore -- foot -- deep -- well -- north _ : and by degree exult gladness give way to bewilderment and disquiet of spirit and in the gust of wind i hear blackbeard himself laugh and mock I for think i have find he treasure still i read and re-read it juggle with the word and turn they about to squeeze new meaning from they ` fourscore foot deep _ in the north well _ ' -- ` fourscore foot deep in the well _ to north _ ' -- ` fourscore foot _ north of the deep well _ ' -- so the word go round and round in my head till i be tired and giddy and fall unawares asleep it be daylight when i awake and the wind have fall though i could still hear the thunder of the swell against the rock-face down below the fire be yet burn and by it sit elzevir cooking something in the pot he look fresh and keen like a man rise from a long night 's sleep rather than one who have spend the hour of darkness in struggle against a gale and must afterwards remain watch because forsooth the sentinel sleep he speak as soon as he see that i be awake laughing and say : ` how go the night watchman this be the second time that i have catch thee nap and didst sleep so sound it might have take a cold pistol 's lip against thy forehead to awake thee ' i be too full of my story even to beg he pardon but begin at once to tell he what have happen and how by follow the hint that ratsey drop i have make out as i think a secret meaning in these verse elzevir hear I patiently and with more show of interest towards the end and then take the parchment in he hand read it carefully and check the error of numbering by the help of the red prayer-book ' i believe thou art right ' he say at length ` for why should the figure all be false if there be no hidden trickery in it if ' t have be one or two be wrong i would have say some priest have copy they in error for priest be thriftless folk and have as lief set a thing down wrong as right but with all wrong there be no room for chance so if he mean it let we see what ` tis he mean first he say ` tis in a well but what well and the depth he give of fourscore foot be over-deep for any well near moonfleet ' i be for say it must be the well at the manor house but before the word leave my mouth remember there be no well at the manor at all for the house be water by a runnel brook that break out from the wood above and jump down from stone to stone run through the manor garden and empty itself into the fleet below ` and now i come to think on it ' elzevir go on '' ti more likely that the well he speak of be not in these part at all for see here this blackboard be a spendthrift squander all he have and would most surely have squander the jewel too could he have lay he hand on it and yet ` tis say he do not therefore i think he must have stow it safe in some place where afterwards he could not get at it for if ' t have be near moonfleet he would have have it up a hundred time but thou hast often talk of blackbeard and he end with parson glennie so speak up lad and let we hear all that thou know ` st of these tale maybe ` twill help we to come to some judgement ' so i tell he all that mr glennie have tell I how that colonel john mohune whom man call blackbeard be a wastrel from he youth and squander all he substance in riotous living thus be at he last turn he change from royalist to rebel and be set to guard the king in the castle of carisbrooke but there he stoop to a bribe and take from he royal prisoner a splendid diamond of the crown to let he go then with the jewel in he pocket turn traitor again and show a file of soldier into the room where the king be stick between the window bar escape but no one trust blackbeard after that and so he lose he post and come back in he age a broken man to moonfleet there he rust out he life but when he near he end be fill with fear and send for a clergyman to give he consolation and 'twa at the parson 's instance that he make a will and bequeath the diamond which be the only thing he have leave to the mohune almshouse at moonfleet these be the very house that he have rob and let go to ruin and they never benefit by he testament for when it be open there be the bequest plain enough but not a word to say where be the jewel some say that it be all a mockery and that blackbeard never have the jewel other that the jewel be in he hand when he die but carry off by some that stand by but most think and hand down the tale that be take suddenly he die before he could reveal the safe place of the jewel and that in he last throe he struggle hard to speak as if he have some secret to unburden all this i tell elzevir and he listen close as though some of it be new to he when i be speak of blackbeard be at carisbrooke he make a little quick move as though to speak but do not wait till i have finish the tale then he break out with : ` john the diamond be yet at carisbrooke i wonder i have not think of carisbrooke before you speak and there he can get fourscore foot and twice and thrice fourscore if he list and none to stop he ` tis carisbrooke i have hear of that well from childhood and once see it when a boy it be dig in the castle keep and go down fifty fathom or more into the bowels of the chalk below it be so deep no man can draw the bucket on a winch but they must have a ass inside a tread-wheel to hoist they up now why this colonel john mohune whom we call blackbeard should have choose a well at all to hide he jewel in i can not say but give he choose a well 'twas odds he would choose carisbrooke ` tis a known place and i have hear that people come as far as from london to see the castle and this well ' he speak quick and with more fire than i have know he use before and i feel he be right it seem indeed natural enough that if blackbeard be to hide the diamond in a well it would be in the well of that very castle where he have earn it so evilly ` when he say the well north ' continue elzevir '' ti clear he mean to take a compass and mark north by needle and at eighty foot in the well-side below that point will lie the treasure i fix yesterday with the _ bonaventure 's _ man that they should lie underneath this ledge tomorrow sennight if the sea be smooth and take we off on the spring-tide at midnight be they hour and i say eight day on to give thy leg a week wherewith to strengthen i think to make for st malo and leave thee at the _ peron d'or _ with old chauvelai where thou couldst learn to patter french until these evil time have blow by but now if thou art set to hunt this treasure up and hast a mind to run thy head into a noose why i be not so old but that i too can play the fool and we will let st malo be and make for carisbrooke i know the castle it be not two mile distant from newport and at newport we can lie at the bugle which be a inn addict to the contraband the king 's writ run but lamely in the channel isle and wight and if we wear some other kit than this maybe we shall find newport as safe as st malo ' this be just what i want and so we settle there and then that we would get the _ bonaventure _ to land we in the isle of wight instead of at st malo since man first walk upon this earth a tale of bury treasure must have have a master-power to stir he blood and mine be hotly stir even elzevir though he do not show it be move i think at heart and we chafe in we cave prison and those eight day go wearily enough yet 'twa not time lose for every day my leg grow stronger and like a wolf which i see once in a cage at dorchester fair i spend hour in march round the cave to kill the time and put more vigor in my step ratsey do not visit we again but in spite of what he say meet elzevir more than once and get money for he from dorchester and many other thing he need it be after meet ratsey that elzevir come back one night bring a long whip in one hand and in the other a bundle which hold clothes to mask we in the next scene there be a carter 's smock for he white and quilt over with needlework such as carter wear on the down farm and for I a smaller one and hat and leather leggings all to match we try they on and be for all the world carter and carter 's boy and i laugh long to see elzevir stand there and practice how to crack he whip and cry ` who-ho ' as carter do to horse and for all he be so grave there be a smile on he face too and he show I how to twist a wisp of straw out of the bed to bind above my ankle at the bottom of the leggings he have cut off he beard and yet lose nothing of he look for he jaw and deep chin show firm and powerful and as for I we make a broth of young walnut leave and twig and tan my hand and face with it a ruddy brown so that i look a different lad chapter 13 a interview no human creature stir to go or come no face look forth from shut or open casement no chimney smoke there be no sign of home from parapet to basement -- _ hood _ and so the day go on until there come to be but two night more before we be to leave we cave now i have say that the delay chafe we because we be impatient to get at the treasure but there be something else that vex I and make I more unquiet with every day that pass and this be that i have resolve to see grace before i leave these part and yet know not how to tell it to elzevir but on this evening see the time be grow so short i know that i must speak or drop my purpose and so speak we be sit like the sea-bird on the ledge outside we cave look towards st alban 's head and watch the last glow of sunset the evening vapor begin to sweep down channel and elzevir shrug he shoulder ` the night turn chill ' he say and get up to go back to the cave so then i think my time be come and follow he inside say : ` dear master elzevir you have watch over I all this while and tend I kinder than any father could he son and ` tis to you i owe my life and that my leg be strong again yet i be restless this night and beg that you will give I leave to climb the shaft and walk abroad it be two month and more that i have be in the cave and see nothing but stone wall and i would gladly tread once more upon the down ' ` say not that i have save thy life ' elzevir break in '' twas i who bring thy life in danger and but for I thou mightst even now be lie snug abe at moonfleet instead of hide in the chamber of these rock so speak not of that but if thou hast a mind to air thyself a hour i see little harm in it these wayward fancy fall on man as they get better of sickness and i must go tonight to that ruin house of which i speak to thee to fetch a pocket compass master ratsey be to put there so thou canst come with I and smell the night air on the down ' he have agree more readily than i look for and so i push the matter say : ` nay master grant I leave to go yet a little farther afield you know that i be bear in moonfleet and have be breed there all my life and love the tree and stream and very stone of it and i have set my heart on see it once more before we leave these part for good and all so give I leave to walk along the down and look on moonfleet but this once and in this ploughboy guise i shall be safe enough and will come back to you tomorrow night ' he look at I a moment without speak and all the while i feel he see I through and through and yet he be not angry but i turn red and cast my eye upon the ground and then he speak : ` lad i have know man risk they life for many thing : for gold and love and hate but never one would play with death that he might see a tree or stream or stone and when man say they love a place or town thou mayst be sure ` tis not the place they love but some that live there or that they love some in the past and so would see the spot again to kindle memory withal thus when thou speakest of moonfleet i may guess that thou hast someone there to see -- or hope to see it can not be thine aunt for there be no love lose between ye and besides no man ever perill he life to bid adieu to a aunt so have no secret from I john but tell I straight and i will judge whether this second treasure that thou seekest be true gold enough to fling thy life into the scale against it ' then i tell he all keep nothing back but try to make he see that there be little danger in my visit moonfleet for none would know I in a carter 's dress and that my knowledge of the place would let I use a hedge or wall or wood for cover and finally if i be see my leg be now sound and there be few could beat I in a run match upon the down so i talk on not so much in the hope of convince he as to keep say something for i durst not look up and fear to hear a angry word from he when i should stop but at last i have speak all i could and cease because i have no more yet he do not break out as i have think but there be silence and after a moment i look up and saw by he face that he thought be wander when he speak there be no anger in he voice but only something sad ` thou art a foolish lad ' he say ` yet i be young once myself and my way have be too dark to make I wish to darken other or try to chill young blood now thine own life have get a shadow o not already that i have help to cast so take the brightness of it while thou mayst and get thee go but for this girl i know she for a comely lass and good-hearted and have wonder often how she come to have _ he _ for she father i be glad now i have not he blood on my hand and never would have go to take it then for all the evil he have bring on I but that the life of every mother 's son hang on he life so make thy mind at ease and get thee go and see these stream and tree and stone thou talkest of yet if thou ` rt shot upon the down or take off to jail blame thine own folly and not I and i will walk with thee to purbeck gate tonight and then come back and wait but if thou art not here again by midnight tomorrow i shall believe that thou art take in some snare and come out to seek thee ' i take he hand and thank he with what word i could that he have let I go and then get on the smock put some bread and meat in my pocket as i be likely to find little to eat on my journey it be dark before we leave the cave for there be little dusk with we and the division between day and night sharper than in more northern part elzevir take I by the hand and lead I through the darkness of the workings tell I where i should stoop and when the way be uneven thus we come to the bottom of the shaft and look up through fern and bramble i could see the deep blue of the sky overhead and a great star gaze down full at we we climb the step with the soap-stone slide at one side and then walk on briskly over the springy turf through the hillock of the coveted quarry-heap and the ruin of the desert cottage there be a heavy dew which get through my boot before we have go half a mile and though there be no moon the sky be very clear and i could see the veil of gossamer spread silvery white over the grass neither of we speak partly because it be safer not to speak for the voice carry far in a still night on the downs and partly i think because the beauty of the starry heaven have take hold upon we both rule we heart with thought too big for word we soon reach that ruin cottage of which elzevir have speak and in what have once be a oven find the compass safe enough as ratsey have promise then on again over the solitary hill not speak ourselves and neither see light in window nor hearing dog stir until we reach that strange defile which man call the gate of purbeck here be a natural road nick the highest summit of the hill with wall as sharp as if the hand of man have cut they through which have walk for age all the few traveller in this lonely place shepherd and sailor soldier and exciseman and although as i suppose no cart have be through it for century there be rut in the chalk floor as wide and deep as if the car of giant use it in past time so here elzevir stop and draw from he bosom that silver-butted pistol of which i have speak thrust it in my hand ` here take it child ' he say ` but use it not till thou art closely press and then if thou _ must _ shoot shoot low -- it fling ' i take it and grip he hand and so we part he go back to purbeck and i make along the top of the ridge at the back of hoar head it must have be near three when i reach a great grass-grown mound call culliford tree that mark the resting-place of some old warrior of the past the top be plant with a clump of tree that cut the skyline and there i sit awhile to rest but not for long for look back towards purbeck i could see the faint hint of dawn low on the sea-line behind st alban 's head and so press forward know i have a full ten mile to cover yet thus i travel on and soon come to the first sign of man namely a flock of lamb be feed with turnip on a summer fallow the sun be well up now and flush all with a rosy glow show the sheep and the root they eat white against the brown earth still i see no shepherd nor even dog and about seven o'clock stand safe on weatherbeech hill that look down over moonfleet there at my foot lay the manor wood and the old house and lower down the white road and the straggle cottage and farther still the why not and the glassy fleet and beyond that the open sea i can not say how sad yet sweet the sight be : it seem like the mirage of the desert of which i have be tell -- so beautiful but never to be reach again by I the air be still and the blue smoke of the morning wood-fire rise straight up but none from the why not or manor house the sun be already very hot and i drop at once from the hill-top digging my heel into the brown-burned turf and keep as much as might be among the furze champ so i be soon in the wood and make straight for the little dell and lay down there bury myself in the wild rhubarb and burdock yet so that i could see the doorway of the manor house over the lip of the hill then i reflect what i be to do or how i should get to speak with grace : and think i would first wait a hour or two and see whether she come out and afterwards if she do not would go down boldly and knock at the door this seem not very dangerous for it be likely from what ratsey have say that there be no one with she in the house and if there be it would be but a old woman to whom i could pass as a stranger in my disguise and ask my way to some house in the village so i lay still and munch a piece of bread and hear the clock in the church tower strike eight and afterwards nine but see no one move in the house the wood be all alive with singing-bird and with the calling of cuckoo and wood-pigeon there be deep patch of green shade and lighter patch of yellow sunlight in which the iris leave gleam with a sheeny white and a shimmering blue sea of ground-ivy spread all through the wood it strike ten and as the heat increase the bird sing less and the drone of the bee grow more distinct and at last i get up shake myself smooth my smock and make a turn come out on the road that lead to the house though my disguise be good i fear i make but a indifferent bad ploughboy when walk and find a difficulty in deal with my hand not know how ploughboy be wont to carry they so i come round in front of the house and give a rat-tat on the door while my pulse beat as loud inside of I as ever do the knocker without the sound run round the building and backwards among the walk and all be silent as before i wait a minute and be for knock again think there might be no one in the house and then hear a light footstep come along the corridor yet dare not look through the window to see who it be in pass as i might have do but keep myself close to the door the bolt be be draw and a girl 's voice ask ` who be there ' i give a jump to hear that voice know it well for grace 's and have a mind to shout out my name but then i remember there might be some in the house with she besides and that i must remain disguised moreover laugh be so mixed with cry in we world and trifling thing with serious that even in this pass i believe i be secretly pleased to have to play a trick on she and test whether she would find I out in this dress or not so i speak out in we round dorset speech such as they talk it out in the vale say ' a poor boy who be out of he way ' then she open one leaf of the door and ask I whither i would go look at I as one might at a stranger and not know who it be i answer that i be a farm lad who have walk from purbeck and seek a inn call the why not keep by one master block when she hear that she give a little start and look I over again yet could make nothing of it but say : ` good lad if you will step on to this terrace i can show you the why not inn but ` tis shut these two month or more and master block away ' with that she turn towards the terrace i follow but when we be outside of ear-shot from the door i speak in my own voice quick but low : ` grace it be i john trenchard who be come to say goodbye before i leave these part and have much to tell that you would wish to hear be there any beside in the house with you ' now many girl who have suffer as she have and be thus surprise would have scream or perhaps swoon but she do neither only flush a little and say also quick and low ` let we go back to the house i be alone ' so we go back and after the door be bolt take both hand and stand up face to face in the passage look into one another 's eye i be tire with a long walk and sleepless night and so full of joy to see she again that my head swam and all seem a sweet dream then she squeeze my hand and i know 'twa real and be for kiss she for very love but she guess what i would be at perhaps and cast my hand loose draw back a little as if to see I better and say ` john you have grow a man in these two month ' so i do not kiss she but if it be true that i be grow a man it be truer still that she be grow a woman and as tall as i and these recent suffering have take from she something of light and frolic girlhood and leave she with a manner more staid and sober she be dress in black with longer skirt and she hair catch up behind and perhaps it be the mourning frock that make she look pale and thin as ratsey say so while i look at she she look at I and could not choose but smile to see my carter 's smock and as for my brown face and hand think i have be hide in some country underneath the sun until i tell she of the walnut-juice then before we fall to talk she say it be better we should sit in the garden for that a woman might come in to help she with the house and anyway it be safer so that i might get out at the back in case of need so she lead the way down the corridor and through the living-part of the house and we pass several room and one little parlor line with shelf and musty book the blind be pull but let enough light in to show a high-backed horsehair chair that stand at the table in front of it lay a open volume and a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles that i have often see on maskew 's nose so i know it be he study and that nothing have be move since last he sit there even now i tremble to think in whose house i be and half-expect the old attorney to step in and hale I off to jail till i remember how all my trouble have come about and how i last have see he with he face turn up against the morning sun thus we come to the garden where i have never be before it be a great square shut in with a brick wall of twelve or fifteen foot big enough to suit a palace but then ill keep and sorely overgrown i could spend long in speaking of that plot how the flower and fruit-tree pot-herb spice and simple run all wild and intermix the pink brick wall catch every ray of sun that fall and that morning there be a hushed close heat in it and a warm breath rise from the strawberry bed for they be then in full bearing i be glad enough to get out of the sun when grace lead the way into a walk of medlar-tree and quince where the bough interlaced and form a alley to a brick summer-house this summer-house stand in the angle of the south wall and by it two fig-tree whose top you can see from the outside they be well know for the biggest and the earliest bearing of all that part and grace show I how if danger threaten i might climb up they bough and scale the wall we sit in the summer-house and i tell she all that have happen at she father 's death only conceal that elzevir have mean to do the deed himself because it be no use to tell she that and besides for all i know he never do mean to shoot but only to frighten she weep again while i speak but afterwards dry she tear and must need look at my leg to see the bullet-wound and if it be all soundly heal then i tell she of the secret sense that master ratsey 's word put into the text write on the parchment i have show she the locket before but we have it out again now and she read and read again the write while i point out how the word fall and tell she i be go away to get the diamond and come back the richest man in all the countryside then she say ` ah john set not you heart too much upon this diamond if what they say be true 'twa evilly come by and will bring evil with it even this wicked man dare not spend it for himself but mean to give it to the poor so if indeed you ever find it keep it not for yourself but set he soul at rest by do with it what he mean to do or it will bring a curse upon you ' i only smile at what she say take it to be a girlish fancy and do not tell she why i want so much to be rich -- namely to marry she one day then have talk long about my own concern as selfishly as a man always do i think to ask after herself and what she be go to do she tell I that a month past lawyer have come to moonfleet and press she to leave the place and they would give she in charge to a lady in london because say they she father have die without a will and so she must be make a ward of chancery but she have beg they to let she be for she could never live anywhere else than in moonfleet and that the air and commodity of the place suit she well so they go off say that they must take direction of the court to know whether she might stay here or not and here she yet be this make I sad for all i know of chancery be that whatever it put hand on fall to ruin as witness the chancery mill at cerne or the chancery wharf at wareham and certainly it would take little enough to ruin the manor house for it be three part in decay already thus we talk and after that she put on a calico bonnet and pick I a dish of strawberry stay to pull the finest although the sun be beat down from mid-heaven and bring I bread and meat from the house then she roll up a shawl to make I a pillow and bid I lie down on the seat that run round the summer-house and get to sleep for i have tell she that i have walk all night and must be back again at the cave come midnight she go back to the house and that be the most sweet and peaceful sleep that ever i know for i be very tired and have this think to soothe I as i fall asleep -- that i have see grace and that she be so kind to I she be sit beside I when i awake and knit a piece of work the heat of the day be somewhat less and she tell I that it be past five o'clock by the sun-dial so i know that i must go she make I take a packet of victuals and a bottle of milk and as she put it into my pocket the bottle strike on the butt of maskew 's pistol which i have in my bosom ` what have you there ' she say but i do not tell she fear to call up bitter memory we stand hand in hand again as we have do in the morning and she say : ` john you will wander on the sea and may perhaps put into moonfleet though you have not be here of late i have keep a candle burning at the window every night as in the past so if you come to beach on any night you will see that light and know grace remember you and if you see it not then know that i be dead or go for i will think of you every night till you come back again ' i have nothing to say for my heart be too full with she sweet word and with the sorrow of parting but only draw she close to I and kiss she and this time she do not step back but kiss I again then i climb up the fig-tree think it safer so to get out over the wall than to go back to the front of the house and as i sit on the wall ready to drop the other side turn to she and say good-bye ` good-bye ' cry she ` and have a care how you touch the treasure it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it ' ` good-bye good-bye ' i say and drop on to the soft leafy bottom of the wood chapter 14 the well-house for those thou mayest not look upon be gather fast round the yawning stone -- _ scott _ it want yet half a hour of midnight when i find myself at the shaft of the marble quarry and before i have well set foot on the step to descend hear elzevir 's voice challenge out of the darkness below i give back ' _ prosper the bonaventure ' _ and so come home again to sleep the last time in we cave the next night be well suit to flight there be a spring-tide with full moon and a light breeze set off the land which leave the water smooth under the cliff we see the _ bonaventure _ cruise in the channel before sundown and after the darkness fall she lay close in and take we off in she boat there be several man on board of she that i know and they greet we kindly and make much of we i be indeed glad to be among they again and yet feel a pang at leave we dear dorset coast and the old cave that have be hospital and home to I for two month the wind set we up-channel and by daybreak they put we ashore at cowe so we walk to newport and come there before many be stir such as we see in the street pay no heed to we but take we doubtless for some carter and he boy who have bring corn in from the country for the southampton packet and be about early to lead the team home again ` tis a little place enough this newport and we soon find the bugle but elzevir make so good a carter that the landlord do not know he though he have he acquaintance before so they fence a little with one another ` have you bed and victuals for a plain country man and he boy ' say elzevir ` nay that i have not ' say the landlord look he up and down and not like to take in stranger who might use they eye inside and perhaps get on the trail of the contraband '' ti near the summer statute and the place over full already i can not move my gentleman and would bid you try the wheatsheaf which be a good house and not so full as this ' ` ay ` tis a busy time and ` tis these fair that make thing _ prosper _ ' and elzevir marked the last word a little as he say it the man look harder at he and ask ` prosper what ' as if he be hard of hear ' _ prosper the bonaventure _ ' be the answer and then the landlord catch elzevir by the hand shake it hard and say ` why you be master block and i expect you this morn and never know you ' he laugh as he stare at we again and elzevir smile too then the landlord lead we in ` and this be ' he say look at I ` this be a well-licked whelp ' reply elzevir ` who get a bullet in the leg two month ago in that touch under hoar head and be worth more than he look for they have put twenty golden guinea on he head -- so have a care of such a precious top-knot ' so long as we stop at the bugle we have the best of lodging and the choicest meat and drink and all the while the landlord treat elzevir as though he be a prince and so he be indeed a prince among the contrabandier and hold as i find out long afterwards for captain of all lander between start and solent at first the landlord would take no money of we say that he be in we debt and have receive many a good turn from master block in the past but elzevir have get gold from dorchester before we leave the cave and force he to take payment i be glad enough to lie between clean sweet sheet at night instead of on a heap of sand and sit once more knife and fork in hand before a well-filled trencher 'twa think best i should show myself as little as possible so i be content to pass my time in a room at the back of the house whilst elzevir go abroad to make inquiry how we could find entrance to the castle at carisbrooke nor do the time hang heavy on my hand for i find some old book in the bugle and among they several to my taste especially a _ history of corfe castle _ which set forth how there be a secret passage from the ruin to some of the old marble quarry and perhaps to that very one that sheltered we elzevir be out most of the day so that i see he only at breakfast and supper he have be several time to carisbrooke and tell I that the castle be use as a jail for person take in the war and be now full of french prisoner he have meet several of the turnkey or jailer drink with they in the inn there and make out that he be himself a carter who wait at newport till a wind-bound ship should bring grindstone from lyme regi thus he be able at last to enter the castle and to see well-house and well and spend some day in try to devise a plan whereby we might get at the well without make the man who have charge of it privy to we full design but in this do not succeed there be a slip of garden at the back of the bugle which run down to a little stream and one evening when i be take the air there after dark elzevir return and say the time be come for we to put blackbeard 's cipher to the proof ' i have try every way ' he say ` to see if we could work this secretly but ` tis not to be do without the privity of the man who keep the well and even with he help it be not easy he be a man i do not trust but have be force to tell he there be treasure hide in the well yet without say where it lie or how to get it he promise to let we search the well take one-third the value of all we find for he share for i say not that thou and i be one at heart but only that there be a boy who have the key and claim a equal third with both of we tomorrow we must be up betime and at the castle gate by six o'clock for he to let we in and thou shalt not be carter any more but mason 's boy and i a mason for i have get coat in the house brush and trowel and lime-bucket and we be go to carisbrooke to plaster up a weak patch in this same well-side ' elzevir have think carefully over this plan and when we leave the bugle next morning we be better mason in we splashed clothes than ever we have be farm servant i carry a bucket and a brush and elzevir a plasterer 's hammer and a coil of stout twine over he arm it be a wet morning and have be rain all night the sky be stagnant and one-coloured without wind and the heavy drop fall straight down out of a gray veil that cover everything the air strike cold when we first come out but trudge over the heavy road soon make we remember that it be July and we be very hot and soak wet when we stand at the gateway of carisbrooke castle here be two flanking tower and a stout gate-house reach by a stone bridge cross the moat and when i see it i remember that 'twa here colonel mohune have earn the wages of he unrighteousness and think how many time he must have pass these gate elzevir knock as one that have a right and we be evidently expect for a wicket in the heavy door be open at once the man who let we in be tall and stout but have a puffy face and too much flesh on he to be very strong though he be not i think more than thirty year of age he give elzevir a smile and pass the time of day civilly enough nodding also to I but i do not like he oily black hair and a shifty eye that turn away uneasily when one meet it ` good-morning master well-wright ' he say to elzevir ` you have bring ugly weather with you and be drown wet will you take a sup of ale before you get to work ' elzevir thank he kindly but would not drink so the man lead on and we follow he we cross a bailey or outer court where the rain have make the gravel very miry and come on the other side to a door which lead by step into a large hall this building have once be a banquet-room i think for there be a inscription over it very plain in lead : _ he lead I into he banquet hall and he banner over I be love _ i have time to read this while the turnkey unlock the door with one of a heavy bunch of key that he carry at he girdle but when we enter what a disappointment -- for there be no banquet now no banner no love but the whole place gut and turn into a barrack for french prisoner the air be very close as where man have sleep all night and a thick steam on the window most of the prisoner be still asleep and lay stretch out on straw palliass round the wall but some be sit up and make model of ship out of fish-bone or build up crucifix inside bottle as sailor love to do in they spare time they pay little heed to we as we pass though the sleepy guard who be lounge on they matchlock nod to we conductor and thus we go right through that evil-smelling white-washed room we leave it at the other end go down three step into the open air again cross another small court and so come to a square building of stone with a high roof like the large dovecot that you may see in old stackyard here we guide take another key and while the door be be open elzevir whisper to I ` it be the well-house ' and my pulse beat quick to think we be so near we goal the building be open to the roof and the first thing to be see in it be that tread-wheel of which elzevir have speak it be a great open wheel of wood ten or twelve foot across and very like a mill-wheel only the space between the rim be board flat but have tread nail on it to give foothold to a donkey the patient beast be lie loose stable on some straw in a corner of the room and as soon as we come in stand up and stretch himself know that the day 's work be to begin ` he be here long before my time ' the turnkey say ` and know the place so well that he go into the wheel and set to work by himself ' at the side of the wheel be the well-mouth a dark round opening with a low parapet round it rise two foot from the floor we be so near we goal yet be we near it at all how do we know mohune have mean to tell the place of hide for the diamond in those word they might have mean a dozen thing beside and if it be of the diamond they speak then how do we know the well be this one there be a hundred well beside these thought come to I make hope less sure and perhaps it be the steamy overcast morning and the rain or a scant breakfast that beat my spirit down -- for i have know man 's mood change much with weather and with food but sure it be that now we stand so near to put it to the touch i like we business less and less as soon as we be enter the turnkey lock the door from the inside and when he let the key drop to its place and it jangle with the other on he belt it seem to I he have we as he prisoner in a trap i try to catch he eye to see if it look bad or good but could not for he keep he shifty face turn always somewhere else and then it come to my mind that if the treasure be really fraught with evil this coarse dark-haired man who could not look one straight be to become a minister of ruin to bring the curse home to we but if i be weak and timid elzevir have no misgiving he have take the coil of twine off he arm and be undoing it ` we will let a end of this down the well ' he say ` and i have make a knot in it at eighty foot this lad think the treasure be in the well wall eighty foot below we so when the knot be on well lip we shall know we have the right depth ' i try again to see what look the turnkey wear when he hear where the treasure be but could not and so fall to examine the well a spindle run from the axle of the wheel across the well and on the spindle be a drum to take the rope there be some clutch or fastening which could be fix or loose at will to make the drum turn with the tread-wheel or let it run free and a footbreak to lower the bucket fast or slow or stop it altogether ' i will get into the bucket ' elzevir say turn to I ` and this good man will lower I gently by the break until i reach the string-end down below then i will shout and so fix you the wheel and give I time to search ' this be not what i look for have think that it be i should go and though i like go down the well little enough yet somehow now i feel i would rather do that than have master elzevir down the hole and I leave lock alone with this villainous fellow up above so i say ` no master that can not be ` tis my place to go be smaller and a lighter weight than thou and thou shalt stop here and help this gentleman to lower I down ' elzevir speak a few word to try to change my purpose but soon give in know it be certainly the better plan and have only think to go himself because he doubt if i have the heart to do it but the turnkey show much ill-humour at the change and strove to let the plan stand as it be and for elzevir to go down the well thing that be settle he say should remain settled he be not one for change it be a man 's task this and no child 's play a boy would not have he sens about he and might overlook the place i fix my eye on elzevir to let he know what i thought and master turnkey 's word fall lightly on he ear as water on a duck 's back then this ill-eyed man try to work upon my fear say that the well be deep and the bucket small i shall get giddy and be overbalanced i do not say that these foreboding be without effect on I but i have make up my mind that bad as it might be to go down it be yet worse to have master elzevir prison in the well and i remain above thus the turnkey perceive at last that he be speak to deaf ear and turn to the business yet there be one fear that still hold I for thinking of what i have hear of the quarry shaft in purbeck how man have go down to explore and there be take with a sudden giddiness and never live to tell what they have see and so i say to master elzevir ` art sure the well be clean and that no deadly gas lurk below ' ` thou mayst be sure i know the well be sweet before i let thee talk of go down ' he answer ` for yesterday we lower a candle to the water and the flame burn bright and steady and where the candle live there man live too but thou art right : these gas change from day to day and we will try the thing again so bring the candle master jailer ' the jailer bring a candle fix on a wooden triangle which he be wont to show stranger who come to see the well and lower it on a string it be not till then i know what a task i have before I for look over the parapet and take care not to lose my balance because the parapet be low and the floor round it green and slippery with water-splashing i watch the candle sink into that cavernous depth and from a bright flame turn into a little twinkling star and then to a mere point of light at last it rest on the water and there be a shimmer where the wood frame have set ripple move we watch it twinkle for a little while and the jailer raise the candle from the water and drop down a stone from some he keep there for that purpose this stone strike the wall half-way down and go from side to side crash and whir till it meet the water with a booming plunge and there rise a groan and moan from the eddy like those dreadful sound of the surge that i hear on lonely night in the sea-cavern underneath we hiding-place in purbeck the jailer look at I then for the first time and he eye have a ugly meaning as if he say ` there -- that be how you will sound when you fall from you perch ' but it be no use to frighten for i have make up my mind they pull the candle up forthwith and put it in my hand and i flung the plasterer 's hammer into the bucket where it hang above the well and then get in myself the turnkey stand at the break-wheel and elzevir lean over the parapet to steady the rope ` art sure that thou canst do it lad ' he say speaking low and put he hand kindly on my shoulder ` be head and heart sure thou art my diamond and i would rather lose all other diamond in the world than aught should come to thee so if thou doubtest let I go or let not any go at all ' ` never doubt master ' i say touch by tenderness and wring he hand ` my head be sure i have no broken leg to turn it silly now ' -- for i guess he be think of hoar head and how i have go giddy on the zigzag chapter 15 the well the grave doth gape and doting death be near -- _ shakespeare _ the bucket be large for all that the turnkey have try to frighten I into think it small and i could crouch in it low enough to feel safe of not fall out moreover such a venture be not entirely new to I for i have once be over gad cliff in a basket to get two peregrine ' egg yet none the less i feel ill at ease and fearful when the bucket begin to sink into that dreadful depth and the air to grow chilly as i go down they lower I gently enough so that i be able to take stock of the way the wall be make and find that for the most part it be cut through solid chalk but here and there where the chalk fail or be break away they have line the wall with brick patch they now on this side now on that and now all round by degree the light which be dim even overground that rainy day die out in the well till all be black as night but for my candle and far overhead i could see the well-mouth white and round like a lustreless full-moon i keep a eye all the time on elzevir 's cord that hang down the well-side and when i see it be come to a finish shout to they to stop and they bring the bucket up near level with the end of it so i know i be about eighty foot deep then i raise myself stand up in the bucket and holding by the rope and begin to look round know not all the while what i look for but think to see a hole in the wall or perhaps the diamond itself shine out of a cranny but i could perceive nothing and what make it more difficult be that the wall here be line completely with small flat brick and look much the same all round i examine these brick as closely as i might and take course by course look first at the north side where the plumb-line hung and afterwards turn round in the bucket till i be afraid of get giddy but to little purpose they could see my candle move round and round from the well-top and know no doubt what i be at but master turnkey grow impatient and shout down ` what be you do have you find nothing can you see no treasure ' ` no ' i call back ' i can see nothing ' and then ` be you sure master block that you have measure the plummet true to eighty foot ' i hear they talk together but could not make out what they say for the bim-bom and echo in the well till elzevir shout again ` they say this floor have be raise you must try lower ' then the bucket begin to move lower slowly and i crouch down in it again not wish to look too much into the unfathomable dark abyss below and all the while there rise groaning and moaning from eddy in the bottom of the well as if the spirit that keep watch over I jewel be yammer together that one should be so near it and clear above they all i hear grace 's voice sweet and grave ` have a care have a care how you touch the treasure it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it ' but i have set foot on this way now and must go through with it so when the bucket stop some six foot lower down i fall again to diligently examine the wall they be still build of the shallow brick and scan they course by course as before i could at first see nothing but as i move my eye downward they be bring up by a mark scratch on a brick close to the hang plummet-line now however lightly a man may glance through a book yet if he own name or even only one nice it should be print on the page he eye will instantly be stop by it so too if he name be mention by other in they speech though it should be whisper never so low he ear will catch it thus it be with this mark for though it be very slight so that i think not one in a thousand would ever have notice it at all yet it stop my eye and bring up my thought suddenly because i know by instinct that it have something to do with I and what i seek the side of this well be not moist green or clammy like the side of some other where damp and noxious exhalation abound but dry and clean for it be say that there be below hidden entrance and exit for the water which keep it always move so these brick be also dry and clean and this mark as sharp as if make yesterday though the issue show that 'twa put there a very long time ago now the mark be not deeply or regularly graven but roughly scratch as i have know boy score they name or alphabet letter or a date on the alabaster figure that lie in moonfleet church and here too be score a letter of the alphabet a plain ` y ' and would have pass for nothing more perhaps to any not bear in moonfleet but to I it be the _ cross-pall _ or black ` y ' of the mohune under whose shadow we be all bring up so as soon as i see that i know i be near what i seek and that colonel john mohune have put this sign there a century ago either by he own hand or by those of a servant and then i thought of mr glennie 's story that the colonel 's conscience be always unquiet because of a servant whom he have put away and now i seem to understand something more of it my heart throb fiercely as many another 's heart have throb when he have come near the fulfilment of a great desire whether lawful or guilty and i try to get at the brick but though by hold on to the rope with my left hand i could reach over far enough to touch the brick with my right 'twa as much as i could do and so i shout up the well that they must bring I nearer in to the side they understand what i would be at and slip a noose over the well-rope and so draw it in to the side and make it fast till i should give the word to loose again thus i be bring close to the well-wall and the marked brick near about the level of my face when i stand up in the bucket there be nothing to show that this brick have be tamper with nor do it sound hollow when tap though when i come to look closely at the joint it seem as though there be more cement than usual about the edge but i never doubt that what we seek be to be find behind it and so get to work at once fix the wooden frame of the candle in the fastening of the chain and chip out the mortar setting with the plasterer 's hammer when they see above that first i be to be pull in to the side and afterwards fall to work on the wall of the well they guess no doubt how matter be and i have scarce begin chip when i hear the turnkey 's voice again sharp and greedy ` what be you do have you find nothing ' it chafe I that this grasp fellow should be always shout to I while elzevir be content to stay quiet so i cry back that i have find nothing and that he should know what i be do in good time soon i have the mortar out of the joint and the brick loose enough to prise it forward by put the edge of the hammer in the crack i lift it clean out and put it in the bucket to see later on in case of need if there be a hollow for anything to be hide in but never have occasion to look at it again for there behind the brick be a little hole in the wall and in the hole what i seek i have my finger in the wall too quick for word and bring out a little parchment bag for all the world like those dry fish-egg cast up on the beach that child call shepherd ' purse now shepherd ' purse be crisp and crackle to the touch and sometimes i have know a pebble get inside one and rattle like a pea in a drum and this little bag that i pull out be dry too and crackle and have something of the size of a small pebble that rattle in the inside of it only i know well that this be no pebble and set to work to get it out but though the little bag be parch and dry 'twa not so easily tear and at last i strike off the corner of it with the sharp edge of my hammer against the bucket then i shake it carefully and out into my hand there drop a pure crystal as big as a walnut i have never in my life see a diamond either large or small -- yet even if i have not know that blackbeard have bury a diamond and if we have not come hither of set purpose to find it i should not have doubt that what i have in my hand be a diamond and this of matchless size and brilliance it be cut into many facet and though there be little or no light in the well save my candle there seem to be in this stone the light of a thousand fire that flash out sparkling red and blue and green as i turn it between my finger at first i could think of nothing else neither how it get there nor how i have come to find it but only of it the diamond and that with such a prize elzevir and i could live happily ever afterwards and that i should be a rich man and able to go back to moonfleet so i crouch down in the bottom of the bucket be fill entirely with such thought and turn it over and over again wonder continually more and more to see the fiery light fly out of it i be as it be daze by its brilliance and by the possibility of wealth that it contain and have perhaps a desire to keep it to myself as long as might be so that i think nothing of the two who be wait for I at the well-mouth till i be suddenly call back by the harsh voice of the turnkey cry as before -- ` what be you do have you find nothing ' ` yes ' i shout back ' i have find the treasure you can pull I up ' the word be scarcely out of my mouth before the bucket begin to move and i go up a great deal faster than i have go down yet in that short journey other thought come to my mind and i hear grace 's voice again sweet and grave ` have a care have a care how you touch the treasure it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it ' at the same time i remember how i have be lead to the discovery of this jewel -- first by mr glennie 's story second by my find the locket and third by ratsey give I the hint that the writing be a cipher and so have come to the hiding-place without a swerve or stumble and it seem to I that i could not have reach it so straight without a lead hand but whether good or evil who should say as i near the top i hear the turnkey urge the donkey to trot faster in the wheel so that the bucket might rise the quicker but just before my head be level with the ground he set the break on and fix I where i be i be glad to see the light again and elzevir 's face look kindly on I but vex to be bring up thus suddenly just when i be expect to set foot on _ terra firma _ the turnkey have stop I through he covetous eagerness so that he might get sooner at the jewel and now he crane over the low parapet and reach out he hand to I cry -- ` where be the treasure where be the treasure give I the treasure ' i hold the diamond between finger and thumb of my right hand and wave it for elzevir to see by stretch out my arm i could have place it in the turnkey 's hand and be just go to do so when i catch he eye for the second time that day and something in they make I stop there be a look in he face that bring back to I the memory of a autumn evening when i sit in my aunt 's parlor read the book call the _ arabian night _ and how in the story of the _ wonderful lamp _ aladdin 's wicked uncle stand at the top of the stair when the boy be come up out of the underground cavern and will not let he out unless he first give up the treasure but aladdin refuse to give up he lamp until he should stand safe on the ground again because he guess that if he do he uncle would shut he up in the cavern and leave he to die there and the look in the turnkey 's eye make I refuse to hand he the jewel till i be safe out of the well for a horrible fear seize I that as soon as he have take it from I he mean to let I fall down and drown below so when he reach down he hand and say ` give I the treasure ' i answer ` pull I up then i can not show it you in the bucket ' ` nay lad ' he say cozen I ` tis safer to give it I now and have both hand free to help you get out these stone be wet and greasy and you may chance to slip and have no hand to save you fall back in the well ' but i be not to be cheat and say again sturdily ` no you must pull I up first ' then he take to scowl and cry in a angry tone ` give I the treasure i say or it will be the worse for you ' but elzevir would not let he speak to I that way and break in roughly ` let the boy up he be sure-footed and will not slip ` tis he treasure and he shall do with it as he like : only that thou shalt have a third of it when we have sell it ' then he : '' ti not he treasure -- no nor yours either but mine for it be in my well and i have let you get it yet i will give you a half-share in it but as for this boy what have he to do with it we will give he a golden guinea and he will be richly pay for he pain ' ` tush ' cry elzevir ` let we have no more fooling this boy shall have he share or i will know the reason why ' ` ay you shall know the reason fair enough ' answer the turnkey ` and ` tis because you name be block and there be a price of 50 upon you head and 20 upon this boy 's you think to outwit I and be yourself outwit and here i have you in a trap and neither leave this room except with hand tie and bind for the gallows unless i first have the jewel safe in my purse ' on that i whip the diamond back quick into the little parchment bag and thrust both down snug into my breeches-pocket mean to have a fight for it anyway before i let it go and look up again i see the turnkey 's hand on the butt of he pistol and cry ` beware beware he draw on you ' but before the word be out of my mouth the turn-key have he weapon up and level full at elzevir ` surrender ' he cry ` or i shoot you dead and the 50 be mine ' and never give time for answer fire elzevir stand on the other side of the well-mouth and it seem the other could not miss he at such a distance but as i blink my eye at the flash i feel the bullet strike the iron chain to which i be hold and see that elzevir be safe the turnkey see it too and fling away he pistol spring round the well and be at elzevir 's throat before he know whether he be hit or not i have say that the turnkey be a tall strong man and twenty year the younger of the two so doubtless when he make for elzevir he think he would easily have he break down and handcuff and then turn to I but he reckon without he host for though elzevir be the shorter and older man he be wonderfully strong and seasoned as a salted thong then they hug one another and begin a terrible struggle : for elzevir know that he be wrestle for life and i daresay the turnkey guess that the stake be much the same for he too as soon as i see what they be at and that the bucket be safe fix i lay hold of the well-chain and climb up by it swing myself on to the top of the parapet be eager to help elzevir and get the turnkey gag and bind while we make we escape but before i be well on the firm ground again i see that little help of mine be need for the turnkey be flagging and there be a look of anguish and desperate surprise upon he face to find that the man he have think to master so lightly be strong as a giant they be sway to and fro and the jailer 's grip be slacken for he muscle be overwrought and tired but elzevir hold he firm as a vice and i see from he eye and the bearing of he body that he be gather himself up to give he enemy a fall now i guess that the fall he would use would be the compton toss for though i have never see he give it yet he be well know for a wrestler in he younger day and the compton toss for he most certain fall i shall not explain the method of it but those who have see it use will know that ` tis a deadly fall and he who let himself get throw that way even upon grass be seldom fit to wrestle another bout the same day still ` tis a difficult fall to use and perhaps elzevir would never have be able to give it have not the other at that moment take one hand off the waist and try to make a clutch with it at the throat but the only way of avoid that fall and indeed most other be to keep both hand firm between hip and shoulder-blade and the moment elzevir feel one hand off he back he have the jailer off he foot and give he compton 's toss i do not know whether elzevir have be so tax by the fierce struggle that he could not put he fullest force into the throw or whether the other be a very strong and heavy man need more to fling he but so it be that instead of the turnkey go down straight as he should with the back of he head on the floor -lrb- for that be the real damage of the toss -rrb- he must need stagger backwards a pace or two try to regain he footing before he go over it be those few staggering pace that ruin he for with the last he come upon the stone close to the well-mouth that have be make wet and slippery by continual spilling there of water then up fly he heel and he fall backwards with all he weight as soon as i see how near the well-mouth he be get i shout out and run to save he but elzevir see it quicker than i and spring forward seize he by the belt just when he turn over the parapet wall be very low and catch the turnkey behind the knee as he stagger trip he over into the well-mouth he give a bitter cry and there be a wrench on he face when he know where he be come and 'twa then elzevir catch he by the belt for a moment i think he be save see elzevir set he body low back with heel press firm against the parapet wall to stand the strain then the belt give way at the fastening and elzevir fall sprawl on the floor but the other go backwards down the well i get to the parapet just as he fall head first into that black abyss there be a second of silence then a dreadful noise like a coconut be break on a pavement -- for we once have coconut in plenty at moonfleet when the _ bataviaman _ come on the beach then a deep echo blow where he rebound and strike the wall again and last of all the thud and thunder splash when he reach the water at the bottom i hold my breath for sheer horror and listen to see if he would cry though i know at heart he would never cry again after that first sickening smash but there be no sound or voice except the moan voice of the water eddy that i have hear before elzevir sling himself into the bucket ` you can handle the break ' he say to I ` let I down quick into the well ' i take the break-lever lower he as quickly as i durst till i hear the bucket touch water at the bottom and then stand by and listen all be still and yet i start once and could not help look round over my shoulder for it seem as if i be not alone in the well-house and though i could see no one yet i have a fancy of a tall black-bearded man with coppery face chase another round and round the well-mouth both vanish from my fancy just as the pursuer have he hand on the pursued but mr glennie 's story come back again to my mind how that colonel mohune 's conscience be always unquiet because of a servant he have put away and i guess now that the turnkey be not the first man these wall have see go headlong down the well elzevir have be in the well so long that i begin to fear something have happen to he when he shout to I to bring he up so i fix the clutch and set the donkey go in the tread-wheel and the patient drudge start on he round reck nothing whether it be a bucket of water he bring up or a live man or a dead man while i look over the parapet and wait with a cramping suspense to see whether elzevir would be alone or have something with he but when the bucket come in sight there be only elzevir in it so i know the turnkey have never come to the top of the water again and indeed there be but little chance he should after that first knock elzevir say nothing to I till i speak : ` let we fling the jewel down the well after he master block it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it ' he hesitate for a moment while i half-hoped yet half-feared he be go to do as i ask but then say : ` no no thou art not fit to keep so precious a thing give it I it be thy treasure and i will never touch penny of it but fling it down the well thou shalt not for this man have lose he life for it and we have risk ours for it -- ay and may lose they for it too perhaps ' so i give he the jewel chapter 16 the jewel all that glister be not gold -- _ shakespeare _ there be the turnkey 's belt lie on the floor with the key and manacle fix to it just as it have fail and come off he at the fatal moment elzevir pick it up try the key till he find the right one and unlock the door of the well-house ` there be other lock to open before we get out ' i say ` ay ' he answer ` but it be more than we life be worth to be see with these key so send they down the well after they master ' i take they back and fling they belt and key and handcuffs clank down against the side into the blackness and the hidden water at the bottom then we take pail and hammer brush and rope and turn we back upon that hateful place there be the little court to cross before we come to the door of the banquet-hall they be lock but we knock until a guard open they he know we for the plasterer-man who have pass a hour before and only ask ` where be ephraim ' mean the turnkey ` he be stop behind in the well-house ' elzevir say and so we pass on through the hall where the prisoner be make what breakfast they might of odds and end with a savoury smell of cooking and a great patter of french at the outer gate be another guard to be pass but they open for we without question cursing ephraim under they breath that he do not take the pain to let he own man out then the wicket of the great gate swung-to behind we and we go into the open again as soon as we be out of sight we quicken we pace and the weather have much better and a fresh breeze spring up we come back to the bugle about ten in the forenoon i believe that neither of we speak a word during that walk and though elzevir have not yet see the diamond he never even take the pain to draw it out of the little parchment bag in which it still lay hide in he pocket yet if i do not speak i think and my thought be sad enough for here be we a second time fly for we life and if we have not the full guilt of blood upon we hand yet blood be surely there so this flight be very bitter to I because the scene of death of which i have be witness this morning seem to take I farther still away from all my old happy life and to stand like another dreadful obstacle between grace and I in the family bible lie on the table in my aunt 's best parlor be a picture of cain which i have often look at with fear on wet Sunday afternoon it show cain stride along in the midst of a boundless desert with he son and they wife stride behind he and they little child carry sling on pole there be a quick swinging motion in the body of all as though they must need always stride as fast as they might and never rest and they face be set hard and thin with eternal wander and disquiet but the thinnest and most restless-looking and hardest face be cain 's and on the middle of he forehead there be a dark spot which god have set to show that none might touch he because he be the first murderer and curse for ever this have always be to I a dreadful picture though i could not choose but look at it and be sorry indeed for cain for all he be so wicked because it seem so hard to have to wander up and down the world all he life long and never be able to come to mooring and yet this very thing have come upon I now for here we be with the blood of two man on we hand wanderer on the face of the earth who dare never go home and if the mark of cain be not on my forehead already i feel it might come out there at any minute when we reach the bugle i go upstairs and fling myself upon the bed to try to rest a little and think but elzevir shut himself in with the landlord and i could hear they talk earnestly in the room under I after a while he come up and say that he have consider with the landlord how we could best get away tell he that we must be off at once but let he suppose that we be eager to leave the place because some of the excise have get wind of we whereabouts he have say nothing to we host about the turnkey wish as few person as possible to know of that matter but doubt not that we should by all means hasten we departure from the island for that as soon as the turnkey be miss inquiry would certainly be make for the plasterer with whom he be last see yet in this thing at least fortune favor we for there be now lie at cowe and ready to sail that night a dutch couper that have run a cargo of holland on the other side of the island and be go back to scheveningen freight with wool we landlord know the dutch captain well have often do business for he and so could give we letter of recommendation which would ensure we a passage to the low country thus in the afternoon we be on the road make we way from newport to cowe in a new disguise for we have change we clothes again and now wear the common sailor dress of blue the cloud have return after the rain and the afternoon be wet and worse than the morning so i shall not say anything of another weary and silent walk we arrive on cowe quay by eight in the evening and find the couper ready to make sail and wait only for the tide to set out she name be the _ gouden droom _ and she be a little larger than the _ bonaventure _ but have a smaller crew and be not near so well find elzevir exchange a few word with the captain and give he the landlord 's letter and after that they let we come on board but say nothing to we we judge that we be best out of the way so go below and find she laden deep and even the cabin full of bale of wool fling ourselves on they to rest i be so tired and heavy with sleep that my eye close almost before i be lie down and never open till the next morning be well advanced i shall not say anything about we voyage nor how we come safe to scheveningen because it have little to do with this story elzevir have settle that we should go to holland not only because the couper be wait to sail thither for we might doubtless have find other boat before long to take we elsewhere -- but also because he have learn at newport that the hague be the first market in the world for diamond this he tell I after we be safe house in a little tavern in the town which be frequent by seaman but those of the better class such as mate and skipper of small vessel here we lay for several day while elzevir make such inquiry as he could without wake suspicion as to who be the best dealer in precious stone and the most able to pay a good price for a valuable jewel it be lucky too for we that elzevir could speak the dutch language -- not well indeed but enough to make himself understand and to understand other when i ask where he have learn it he tell I that he come of dutch blood on he mother 's side and so get he name of elzevir and that he could once speak in dutch as readily as in english only that he mother die when he be yet a boy he lose something of the facility as the day pass the memory of that dreadful morning at carisbrooke become dimmer to I and my mind more cheerful or compose i get the diamond back from elzevir and have it out many time both by day and by night and every time it seem more brilliant and wonderful than the last often of night after all the house be go to rest i would lock the door of the room and sit with a candle burning on the table and turn the diamond over in my hand it be as i have say as big as a pigeon 's egg or walnut delicately cut and facet all over perfect and flawless without speck or stain and yet for all it be so clear and colourless there fly out from the depth of it such flash and sparkle of red blue and green as make one wonder whence these tint could come thus while i sit and watch it i would tell elzevir story from the _ arabian night _ of wondrous jewel though i believe there never be a stone that the eagle bring up from the valley of diamond no nor any in the caliph 's crown itself that could excel this gem of ours you may be sure that at such time we talk much of the value that be to be put upon the stone and what be likely to be get for it but never could settle not have any experience of such thing only i be sure that it must be worth thousand of pound and so sit and rub my hand say that though life be like a game of hazard and we throw have hitherto be bad enough yet we have make something of this last but all the while a strange change be come over we both and we part seem turn about for whereas a few day before it be i who wish to fling the diamond away feel overwrought and heavy-hearted in that awful well-house and elzevir who hold I from it now it be he that seem to set little store by it and i to whom it be all in all he seldom care to look much at the jewel and one night when i be praise it to he speak out : ` set not thy heart too much upon this stone it be thine and thine to deal with never a penny will i touch that we may get for it yet be i thou and reach great wealth with it and so come back one day to moonfleet i would not spend it all on my own end but put aside a part to build the poor-house again as man say blackbeard mean to do with it ' i do not know what make he speak like this and be not willing even in fancy to agree to what he counsel for with that gem before I lustrous and all the brighter for lie on a rough deal table i could only think of the wealth it be to bring to we and how i would most certainly go back one day to moonfleet and marry grace so i never answer elzevir but take the diamond and slip it back in the silver locket which still hang round my neck for that be the safest place for it that we could think of we spend some day in wander round the town make inquiry and learn that most of the diamond-buyer live near one another in a certain little street whose name i have forget but that the richest and best know of they be one krispijn aldobrand he be a jew by birth but have live all he life in the hague and besides have buy and sell some of the finest stone be say to ask few question and to trouble little whence stone come so they be but good thus after much thought and many change of purpose we choose this aldobrand and settle we would put the matter to the touch with he we take a evening in late summer for we venture and come to aldobrand 's house about a hour before sundown i remember the place well though i have not see it for so long and be certainly never like to see it again it be a low house of two story stand back a little from the street with some wooden paling and a grass plot before it and a stone-flagged path lead up to the door the front of it be whitewash with green shutter and have a shiny-leaved magnolia train round about the window these jeweller have no shop though sometimes they set a single necklace or bracelet in a bottom window but put up notice proclaim they trade thus there be over aldobrand 's door a board stick out to say that he buy and sell jewel and would lend money on diamond or other valuable a sturdy serving-man open the door and when he hear we business be to sell a jewel leave we in a stone-floored hall or lobby while he go upstairs to ask whether he master would see we a few minute later the stair creak and aldobrand himself come down he be a little wizened man with yellow skin and deep wrinkle not less than seventy year old and i see he wear shoe of polished leather silver-buckled and tilted-heeled to add to he stature he begin speak to we from the landing not come down into the hall but lean over the handrail : ` well my son what would you with I i hear you have a jewel to sell but you must know i do not purchase sailor ' flotsam so if ` tis a moonstone or catseye or some pin-head diamond keep they to make brooch for you sweetheart for aldobrand buy no toy like that ' he have a thin and squeaky voice and speak to we in we own tongue guess no doubt that we be english from we face 'twa true he handle the language badly enough yet i be glad he use it for so i could follow all that be say ` no toy like that ' he say again repeat he last word and elzevir answer : ` may it please you worship we be sailor from over sea and this boy have a diamond that he would sell ' i have the gem in my hand all ready and when the old man squeak peevishly ` out with it then let 's see let 's see ' i reach it out to he he stretch down over the banister and take it hold out he palm hollow as if 'twa some little paltry stone that might otherwise fall and be lose it nettle I to have he thus underrate we treasure even though he have never see it and so i plumped it down into he hand as if it be as big as a pumpkin now the hall be a dim place be light only by a half-circle of glass over the door and so i could not see very well yet in reach down he bring he head near mine and i could swear he face change when he feel the size of the stone in he hand and turn from impatience and contempt to wonder and delight he take the jewel quickly from he palm and hold it up between finger and thumb and when he speak again he voice be change as well as he face and have lose most of the sharp impatience ` there be not light enough to see in this dark place -- follow I ' and he turn back and go upstairs rapidly hold the stone in he hand and we close at he heel be anxious not to lose sight of he now that he have we diamond for all he be so rich and well know a man thus we come to another landing and there he fling open the door of a room which look out west and have the light of the setting sun streaming in full flood through the window the change from the dimness of the stair to this level red blaze be so quick that for a minute i could make out nothing but turn my back to the window see presently that the room be panel all through with paint wood with a bed let into the wall on one side and shelf round the other on which be many small coffer and strong-box of iron the jeweller be sit at a table with he face to the sun hold the diamond up against the light and gaze into it closely so that i could see every working of he face the hard and cunning look have come back to it and he turn suddenly upon I and ask quite sharply ` what be you name boy whence do you come ' now i be not use to walk under false name and he take I unaware so i must need blurt out ` my name be john trenchard sir and i come from moonfleet in dorset ' a second later i could have bite off my tongue for have say as much and see elzevir frowning at I to make I hold my peace but 'twa too late then for the merchant be write down my answer in a parchment ledger and though it would seem to most but a little thing that he should thus take down my name and birthplace and only vex we at the time because we would not have it know at all whence we come yet in the overruling of providence it be order that this note in mr aldobrand 's book should hereafter change the issue of my life ` from moonfleet in dorset ' he repeat to himself as he finish write my answer ` and how do john trenchard come by this ' and he tap the diamond as it lay on the table before he then elzevir break in quickly fear no doubt lest i should be betray into say more : ` nay sir we be not come to play at question and answer but to know whether you worship will buy this diamond and at what price we have no time to tell long history and so must only say that we be english sailor and that the stone be fairly come by ' and he let he finger play with the diamond on the table as if he fear it might slip away from he ` softly softly ' say the old man ` all stone be fairly come by but have you tell I whence you get this i might have spare myself some tedious test which now i must crave pardon for make ' he open a cupboard in the panelling and take out from it a little pair of scale some crystal a blackstone and a bottle full of a green liquid then he sit down again draw the diamond gently from elzevir 's finger which be loth to part with it and begin use he scale balance the diamond carefully now against a crystal now against some small brass weight i stand with my back to the sunset watch the red light fall upon this old man as he weigh the diamond rub it on the black-stone or let fall on it a drop of the liquor and so could see the wonder and emotion fade away from he face and only hard craftiness leave in it i watch he meddle till i could bear to watch no longer feel a fierce feverish suspense as to what he might say and my pulse beat so quick that i could scarce stand still for be not the decisive moment very nigh when we should know from these parched-up lip the value of the jewel and whether it be worth risk life for whether the fabric of we hope be build on sure foundation or on slippery sand so i turn my back on the diamond merchant and look out of the window wait all the while to catch the slightest word that might come from he lip i have find then and at other time that in such moment though the mind be occupy entirely by one overwhelming thought yet the eye take in as it be unwittingly all that lie before they so that we can afterwards recall a face or landscape of which at the time we take no note thus it be with I that night for though i be think of nothing but the jewel yet i note everything that could be see through the window and the recollection be of use to I later on the window be make in the french style reach down to the floor and open like a door with two leave it lead on to a little balcony and now stand open -lrb- for the day be still very hot -rrb- and on the wall below be train a pear-tree which half-embower the balcony with its green leave the window could be well protect in case of need have lattice wooden blind inside and heavy shutter shoe with iron on the outer wall and there be besides strong bolt and socket from which run certain wire whose use i do not know below the balcony be a square garden-plot shut in with a brick wall and keep very neat and trim there be hollyhock round the wall and many-coloured poppy with many other shrub and flower my eye fall on one especially a tall red-blossomed rushy kind of flower that i have never see before and that seem indeed to be something out of the common for it stand in the middle of a little earth-plot and have the whole bed nearly to itself i be look at this flower not think of it but wonder all the while whether mr aldobrand would say the diamond be worth ten thousand pound or fifty or a hundred thousand when i hear he speak and turn round quick ` my son and you especially son john ' he say and turn to I : ` this stone that you have bring I be no stone at all but glass -- or rather paste for so we call it not but what it be good paste and perhaps the best that i have see and so i have to try it to make sure but against high chymic test no sham can stand and first it be too light in weight and second when rub on this basanus or black-stone trace no line of white as any diamond must but third and last i have try it with the hermeneutic proof and dip it in this most costly lembic and the liquor remain pure green and clear not turbid orange a diamond leave it ' as he speak the room spin round and i feel the sickness and heart-sinking that come with the sudden destruction of long-cherished hope so it be all a sham a bit of glass for which we have risk we life blackbeard have only mock we even in he death and from rich man we be become the poorest outcast and all the other bright fancy that have be build on this worthless thing fall down at once like a house of card there be no money now with which to go back rich to moonfleet no money to cloak past offence no money to marry grace and with that i give a sigh and my knee fail should have fall have not elzevir hold I ` nay son john ' squeak the old man see i be so put about ` take it not hardly for though this be but paste i say not it be worthless it be as fine work as ever i have see and i will offer you ten silver crown for it which be a goodly sum for a sailor-lad to have in hand and more than all the other buyer in this town would bid you for it ' ` tush tush ' cry elzevir and i could hear the bitterness and disappointment in he voice however much he try to hide it ` we be not come to beg for silver crown so keep they in you purse and the devil take this shine sham we be well quit of it there be a curse upon the thing ' and with that he catch up the stone and fling it away out of the window in he anger this bring the diamond-buyer to he foot in a moment ` you fool you cursed fool ' he shriek ` be you come here to beard I and when i say the thing be worth ten silver crown do you fling it to the wind ' i have spring forward with a half thought of catch elzevir 's arm but it be too late -- the stone fly up in the air catch the low ray of the setting sun for a moment and then fall among the flower i could not see it as it fall yet follow with my eye the line in which it should have fall and think i see a glimmer where it touch the earth it be only a flash or sparkle for a instant just at the stem of that same rushy red-flowered plant and then nothing more to be see but as i face round i see the little man 's eye turn that way too and perhaps he see the flash as well as i ` there be for you ten crown ' say elzevir ` let we be go lad ' and he take I by the arm and march I out of the room and down the stair ` go and a blight on you ' say mr aldobrand he voice be not so high as when he cry out last but in he usual squeak and then he repeat ' a blight on you ' just for a parting shot as we go through the door we pass two more waiting-man on the stair but they say nothing to we and so we come to the street we walk along together for some time without a word and then elzevir say ` cheer up lad cheer up thou saidst thyself thou fearedst there be a curse on the thing so now it be go maybe we be well quit of it ' yet i could not say anything be too much disappointed to find the diamond be a sham and bitterly cast down at the loss of all we hope it be all very well to think there be a curse upon the stone so long as we have it and to feign that we be ready to part with it but now it be go i know that at heart i never wish to part with it at all and would have risk any curse to have it back again there be supper wait for we when we get back but i have no stomach for victuals and sit moodily while elzevir eat and he not much but when i sit and brood over what have happen a new thought come to my mind and i jump up and cry ` elzevir we be fool the stone be no sham ` tis a real diamond ' he put down he knife and fork and look at I not say anything but wait for I to say more and yet do not show so much surprise as i expect then i remind he how the old merchant 's face be full of wonder and delight when first he see the stone which show he think it be real then and how afterwards though he school he voice to bring out long word to deceive we he be ready enough to spring to he foot and shriek out loud when elzevir throw the stone into the garden i speak fast and in talk to he convinced myself so when i stop for want of breath i be quite sure that the stone be indeed a diamond and that aldobrand have dupe we still elzevir show little eagerness and only say -- '' ti like enough that what you say be true but what would you have we do the stone be fling away ' ` yes ' i answer ` but i see where it fall and know the very place let we go back now at once and get it ' ` do you not think that aldobrand see the place too ' ask elzevir and then i remember how when i turn back to the room after see the stone fall i catch the eye of the old merchant look the same way and how he speak more quietly after that and not with the bitter cry he use when elzevir toss the jewel out of the window ' i do not know ' i say doubtfully ` let we go back and see it fall just by the stem of a red flower that i marked well what ' i add see he still hesitate and draw back ` do you doubt shall we not go and get it ' still he do not answer for a minute and then speak slowly as if weigh he word ' i can not tell i think that all you say be true and that this stone be real nay i be half of that mind when i throw it away and yet i would not say we be not best without it 'twa you who first speak of a curse upon the jewel and i laugh at that as be a childish tale but now i can not tell for ever since we first scented this treasure luck have run against we john yes run against we very strong and here we be fly from home call outlaw and with blood upon we hand not that blood frighten I for i have stand face to face with man in fair fight and never feel a death-blow give so weigh on my soul but these two man come to a tricksy kind of end and yet i could not help it ` tis true that all my life i have serve the contraband but no man ever know I do a foul action and now i do not like that man should call I felon and like it less that they should call thee felon too perhaps there may be after all some curse that hang about this stone and lead to ruin those that handle it i can not say for i be not a parson glennie in these thing but blackbeard in a evil mood may have tie the treasure up to be a curse to any that use it for themselves what do we want with this thing at all i have get money to be touch at need we may lie quiet this side the channel where thou shalt learn a honest trade and when the mischief have blow over we will go back to moonfleet so let the jewel be john shall we not let the jewel be ' he speak earnestly and most earnestly at the end take I by the hand and look I full in the face but i could not look he back again and turn my eye away for i be wilful and would not bring myself to let the diamond go yet all the while i think that what he say be true and i remember that sermon that mr glennie preach say that life be like a ` y ' and that to each come a time when two way part and where he must choose whether he will take the broad and sloping road or the steep and narrow path so now i guess that long ago i have choose the broad road and now be but walk farther down it in seek after this evil treasure and still i could not bear to give all up and persuade myself that it be a child 's folly to madly fling away so fine a stone so instead of listen to good advice from one so much older than I i set to work to talk he over and persuade he that if we get the diamond again and ever could sell it we would give the money to build up the mohune almshouse know well in my heart that i never mean to do any such thing thus at the last elzevir who be the stubbornest of man and never yield be overborne by he great love to I and yield here it be ten o'clock before we set out together to go again to aldobrand 's meaning to climb the garden wall and get the stone i walk quickly enough and talk all the time to silence my own misgiving but elzevir hang back a little and say nothing for it be sorely against he judgement that he come at all but as we near the place i cease my chatter and so we go on in silence each busy with he own thought we do not come in front of aldobrand 's house but turn out of the main street down a side lane which we guess would skirt the garden wall there be few people move even in the street and in this little lane there be not a soul to meet as we creep along in the shadow of the high wall we be not mistake for soon we come to what we judge be the outside of aldobrand 's garden here we pause for a minute and i believe elzevir be for make a last remonstrance but i give he no chance for i have find a place where some brick be loosen in the wall-face and set myself to climb it be easy enough to scale for we and in a minute we both drop down in a bed of soft mould on the other side we push through some gooseberry-bush that catch the clothes and distinguish the outline of the house make that way till in a few step we stand on the _ pelouse _ or turf which i have see from the balcony three hour before i know the twirl of the walk and the pattern of the bed the rank of hollyhock that stand up all along the wall and the poppy breathe out a faint sickly odour in the night a utter silence hold all the garden and the night be very clear there be still enough light to show the color of the flower when one look close at they though the green of the leaf be turn to gray we keep in the shadow of the wall and look expectantly at the house but no murmur come from it it might have be a house of the dead for any noise the living make there nor be there light in any window except in one behind the balcony to which we eye be turn first in that room there be someone not yet go to rest for we could see a lattice of light where a lamp shone through the open work of the wooden blind ` he be up still ' i whisper ` and the outside shutter be not close ' elzevir nod and then i make straight for the bed where the red flower grow i have no need of any light to see the bell of that great rushy thing for it be different from any of the rest and besides that be plant by itself i point it out to elzevir ` the stone lie by the stalk of that flower ' i say ` on the side nearest to the house ' and then i stay he with my hand upon he arm that he should stand where he be at the bed 's edge while i step on and get the stone my foot sink in the soft earth as i pass through the fringe of poppy circle the outside of the bed and so i stand beside the tall rushy flower the scarlet of its bell be almost black but there be no mistake it and i stoop to pick the diamond up be it possible be there nothing for my outstretched hand to finger except the soft rich loam and on the darkness of the ground no guide sparkle i knelt down to make more sure and look all round the plant and still find nothing though it be light enough to see a pebble much more to catch the gleam and flash of the great diamond i know so well it be not there and yet i know that i have see it fall beyond all room for doubt ` it be go elzevir it be go ' i cry out in my anguish but only hear a ` hush ' from he to bid I not to speak so loud then i fall on my knee again and sift the mould through my finger to make sure the stone have not sink in and be overlook but it be all to no purpose and at last i step back to where elzevir be and beg he to light a piece of match in the shelter of the hollyhock and i would screen it with my hand so that the light should fall upon the ground and not be see from the house and so search round the flower he do as i ask not because he think that i should find anything but rather to humor I and as he put the light match into my hand say speaking low ` let the stone be lad let it be for either thou didst fail to mark the place right or other have be here before thee ` tis rule we should not touch the stone again and so ` tis best let be let be let we get home ' he put he hand upon my shoulder gently and speak with such a earnestness and plead in he voice that one would have think it be a woman rather than a great rough giant and yet i would not hear and break away shelter the match in my hollowed hand and make back to the red flower but this time just as i step upon the mould come to the bed from the house side the light fall on the ground and there i see something that bring I up short it be but a dint or impress on the soft brown loam and yet before my eye be well upon it i know it for the print of a sharp heel -- a sharp deep heel have just in front of it the outline of a little foot there be a story every boy be give to read when i be young of crusoe wreck upon a desert isle who walk one day on the shore be stagger by a single footprint in the sand because he learn thus that there be savage in that sad place where he think he stand alone yet i believe even that footprint in the sand be never greater blow to he than be this impress in the garden mould to I for i remember well the little shoe of polished leather with they silver buckle and high-tilted heel he _ have _ be here before we i find another footprint and another lead towards the middle of the bed and then i flung the match away trample the fire out in the soil it be no use search farther now for i know well there be no diamond here for we i step back to the lawn and catch elzevir by the arm ` aldobrand have be here before we and steal away the jewel ' i whisper sharp and look wildly round in the still night see the lattice of lamplight shine through the wooden blind of the balcony window ` well there be a end of it ' say he ` and we be save further question ` tis go so let we cry good riddance to it and be off ' so he turn to go back and there be one more chance for I to choose the better way and go with he but still i could not give the jewel up and must go farther on the other path which lead to ruin for we both for i have my eye fix on the light come through the blind of that window and see how thick and strong the bough of the pear-tree be train against the wall about the balcony ` elzevir ' i say swallow the bitter disappointment which rise in my throat ' i can not go till i have see what be do in that room above i will climb to the balcony and look in through the chink ' perhaps he be not there perhaps he have leave we diamond there and we may get it back again ' so i go straight to the house not give he time to raise a word to stop I for there be something in I drive I on and i be not to be stop by anyone from that purpose there be no need to fear any see we for all the window except that one be tight shutter and though we footstep on the soft lawn wake no sound i know that elzevir be follow I it be no easy task to climb the pear-tree for all that the bough look so strong for they lay close against the wall and give little hold for hand or foot twice or more a unripe pear be break off and fall rustling down through the leaf to earth and i pause and wait to hear if anyone be disturb in the room above but all be deathly still and at last i get my hand upon the parapet and so come safe to the balcony i be pant from the hard climb yet do not wait to get my breath but make straight for the window to see what be go on inside the outer shutter be still fling back as they have be in the afternoon and there be no difficulty in look in for i find a opening in the lattice-blind just level with my eye and could see all the room inside it be well light as for a marriage feast and i think there be a score of candle or more burning in holder on the table or in sconce on the wall at the table on the farther side of it from I and face the window sit aldobrand just as he sit when he tell we the stone be a sham he face be turn towards the window and as i look full at he it seem impossible but that he should know that i be there in front of he on the table lay the diamond -- we diamond my diamond for i know it be a diamond now and not false it be not alone but have a dozen more cut gem lay beside it on the table each a little apart from the other yet there be no mistaking mine which be thrice as big as any of the rest and if it surpass they in size how much more do it excel in fierceness and sparkle all the candle in the room be mirror in it and as the splendor flash from every line and facet that i know so well it seem to call to I ` be i not queen of all diamond of the world be i not you diamond will you not take I to yourself again will you save I from this sorry trickster ' i have my eye fix but still know that elzevir be beside I he would not let I risk myself in any hazard alone without he stand by I himself to help in case of need and yet he faithfulness but gall I now and i ask myself with a sneer be i never to stir hand or foot without this man to dog I the merchant sit still for a minute as though think and then he take one of the diamond that lay on the table and then another and set they close beside the great stone pit they as it be with it yet how could any match with that -- for it outshine they all as the sun outshine the star in heaven then the old man take the stone and weigh it in the scale which stand on the table before he balance it carefully and a dozen time against some little weight of brass and then he write with pen and ink in a sheepskin book and afterwards on a sheet of paper as though cast up number what would i not have give to see the figure that he write for be he not cast up the value of the jewel and sum out the profit he would make after that he take the stone between finger and thumb hold it up before he eye and place it now this way now that so that the light might best fall on it i could have curse he for the wonder love of that fair jewel that overspread he face and curse he ten time more for the smile upon he lip because i guess he laugh to think how he have dupe two simple sailor that very afternoon there be the diamond in he hand -- we diamond my diamond -- in he hand and i but two yard from my own only a flimsy veil of wood and glass to keep I from the treasure he have basely steal from we then i feel elzevir 's hand upon my shoulder ` let we be go ' he say ' a minute more and he may come to put these shutter to and find we here let we be go diamond be not for simple folk like we this be a evil stone and bring a curse with it let we be go john ' but i shake off the kind hand roughly forget how he have save my life and nurse I for many weary week and stand by I through bad and worse for just now the man at the table rise and take out a little iron box from a cupboard at the back of the room i know that he be go to lock my treasure into it and that i should see it no more but the great jewel lie lonely on the table flash and sparkle in the light of twenty candle and call to I ` be i not queen of all diamond of the world be i not you diamond save I from the hand of this scurvy robber ' then i hurl myself forward with all my weight full on the join of the window frame and in a second crash through the glass and through the wooden blind into the room behind the noise of splintered wood and glass have not die away before there be a sound as of bell ring all over the house and the wire i have see in the afternoon dangle loose in front of my face but i care neither for bell nor wire for there lay the great jewel flash before I the merchant have turn sharp round at the crash and dart for the diamond cry ` thief thief thief ' he be nearer to it than i and as i dash forward we hand meet across the table with he underneath upon the stone but i grip he by the wrist and though he struggle he be but a weak old man and in a few seconds i have it twist from he grasp in a few seconds -- but before they be past the diamond be well in my hand -- the door burst open and in rush six sturdy serving-man with stave and bludgeon elzevir have give a little groan when he see I force the window but follow I into the room and be now at my side ` thief thief thief ' scream the merchant fall back exhaust in he chair and point to we and then the knave fall on too quick for we to make for the window two set on I and four on elzevir and one man even a giant can not fight with four -- above all when they carry stave never have i see master block overborne or worst by any odds and fortune be kind to I at least in this that she let I not see the issue then for a staff catch I so round a knock on the head as make the diamond drop out of my hand and lay I swoon on the floor chapter 17 at ymeguen as if a thief should steal a tainted vest some dead man 's spoil and sicken of he pest -- _ hood _ ` tis bitterer to I than wormwood the memory of what follow and i shall tell the story in the fewest word i may we be cast into prison and lay there for month in a stone cell with little light and only foul straw to lie on at first we be cut and bruise from that tussle and cudgelling in aldobrand 's house and it be long before we be recover of we wound for we have nothing but bread and water to live on and that so bad as barely to hold body and soul together afterwards the heavy fetter that be put about we ankle set up sore and gall we so that we scarce could move for pain and if the iron gall my flesh my spirit chafe ten time more within those damp and dismal wall yet all that time elzevir never breathe a word of reproach though it be my wilfulness have lead we into so terrible a strait at last come we jailer one morning and say that we must be bring up that day before the _ geregt _ which be they court of assize to be try for we crime so we be march off to the court-house in spite of sore and heavy iron and be glad enough to see the daylight once more and drink the open air even though it should be to we death that we be walk for the jailer say they be like to hang we for what we have do in the court-house we business be soon over because there be many to speak against we but none to plead we cause and all be do in the dutch language i understand nothing of it except what elzevir tell I afterwards there be mr aldobrand in he black gown and buckled shoe with tip-tilted heel stand at a table and give evidence : how that one afternoon in August come two evil-looking english sailor to he house under pretence of sell a diamond which turn out to be but a lump of glass : and that have take observation of all he dwelling and more particularly the approach to he business-room they go they way but later in the same day or rather night as he sit match together certain diamond for a coronet order by the most illustrious the holy roman emperor these same ill-favoured english sailor burst suddenly through shutter and window and make forcible entry into he business-room there they furiously attack he wrench the diamond from he hand and beat he within a ace of he life but by the good providence of god and he own foresight the window be fit with a certain alarm which ring bell in other part of the house thus he trusty servant be summon and after be themselves attack and nearly overborne succeed at last in master these scurvy ruffian and hand they over to the law from which mr aldobrand claim sovereign justice thus much elzevir explain to I afterwards but at that time when that pretender speak of the diamond as be he own elzevir cut in and say in open court that 'twa a lie and that this precious stone be none other than the one that we have offer in the afternoon when aldobrand have say 'twa glass then the diamond merchant laugh and take from he purse we great diamond which seem to fill the place with light and dazzle half the court he turn it over in he hand poise it in he palm like a great flourishing lamp of light and ask if 'twa likely that two common sailor-man should hawk a stone like that nay more that the court might know what daring rogue they have to deal with he pull out from he pocket the quittance give he by shalamof the jew of petersburg for this same jewel and show it to the judge whether 'twa a forge quittance or one for some other stone we know not but elzevir speak again say that the stone be ours and we have find it in england when mr aldobrand laugh again and hold the jewel up once more : be such pebble he ask find on the shore by every squalid fisherman and the great diamond flash as he put it back into he purse and cry to I ` be i not queen of all the diamond of the world must i house with this base rascal ' but i be powerless now to help after aldobrand the serving-men give witness tell how they have trap we in the act red-handed : and as for this jewel they have see they master handle it any time in these six month past but elzevir be gall to the quick with all they falsehood and burst out again that they be liar and the jewel ours till a jailer who stand by strike he on the mouth and cut he lip to silence he the process be soon finish and the judge in he red robe stand up and sentence we to the galley for life bidding we admire the mercy of the law to outlander for have we be but dutchmen we should sure have hang then they take and march we out of court as well as we could walk for fetter and elzevir with a bleeding mouth but as we pass the place where aldobrand sit he bow to I and say in english ` you servant mr trenchard i wish you a good day sir john trenchard -- of moonfleet in dorset ' the jailer pause a moment hearing aldobrand speak to we though not understand what he say so i have time to answer he : ` good day sir aldobrand liar and thief and may the diamond bring you evil in this present life and damnation in that which be to come ' so we part from he and at that same time depart from we liberty and from all joy of life we be fetter together with other prisoner in drove of six we wrist manacle to a long bar but i be put into a different gang from elzevir thus we march a ten day ' journey into the country to a place call ymeguen where a royal fortress be build that be a weary march for I for 'twa January with wet and miry road and i have little enough clothes upon my back to keep off rain and cold on either side ride guard on horseback with loaded flint-lock across the saddlebow and long whip in they hand with which they let fly at any laggard though 'twa hard enough for man to walk where the mud be over the horse ' fetlock i have no chance to speak to elzevir all the journey and indeed speak nothing at all for those to whom i be chained be brute beast rather than man and speak only in dutch to boot there be but little of the building of the fortress begin when we reach ymeguen and the task that we be set to be the digging of the trench and other earthwork i believe that there be five hundred man employ in this way and all of they condemn like we to galley-work for life we be divide into squad of twenty-five but elzevir be draft to another squad and a different part of the workings so i see he no more except at odd time now and again when we gang meet and we could exchange a word or two in pass thus i have no solace of any company but my own and be drive to think and to occupy my mind with the recollection of the past and at first the life of my boyhood now lose for ever be constantly present even in my dream and i would wake up think that i be at school again under mr glennie or talk in the summer-house with grace or climb weatherbeech hill with the salt channel breeze singing through the tree but alas these thing fade when i open my eye and know the foul-smelling wood-hut and floor of fetid straw where fifty of we lay in fetter every night i say i dream these thing at first but by degree remembrance grow blunt and the image less clear and even these sweet sad vision of the night come to I less often thus life become a weary round in which month follow month season follow season year follow year and bring always the same eternal profitless-work and yet the work be merciful for it dull the biting edge of thought and the unchanging evenness of life give wing to time in all the year the locust eat for I at ymeguen there be but one thing i need speak of here i have be there a week when i be loose one morning from my iron and take from work into a little hut apart where there stand a half-dozen of the guard and in the midst a stout wooden chair with clamp and band a fire burn on the floor and there be a fume and smoke that fill the air with a smell of burn meat my heart misgave I when i see that chair and fire and smell that sickly smell for i guess this be a torture room and these the torturer wait they force I into the chair and bind I there with lashing and a cramp about the head and then one take a red-iron from the fire upon the floor and try it a little way from he hand to prove the heat i have screw up my heart to bear the pain as best i might but when i see that iron sigh for sheer relief because i know it for only a branding tool and not the torture and so they brand I on the left cheek set the iron between the nose and cheek-bone where 'twa plainest to be see i take the pain and scorching light enough see that i have look for much worse and should not have make mention of the thing here at all be it not for the brand mark they use now this mark be a ` y ' be the first letter of ymeguen and set on all the prisoner that work there as i find afterwards but to I 'twa much more than a mere letter and nothing less than the black ` y ' itself or _ cross-pall _ of the mohune thus as a sheep be mark with he owner 's keel and can be claim wherever he may be so here be i branded with the keel of the mohune and marked for theirs in life or death whithersoever i should wander 'twa three month after that and the mark heal and well set that i see elzevir again and as we pass each other in the trench and call a greet i see that he too bear the _ cross-pall _ full on he left cheek thus year go on and i be grow from boy to man and that no weak one either : for though they give we but scant food and bad the air be fresh and strong because ymeguen be mean for palace as well as fortress and they choose a healthful site and by degree the moat be dig and rampart build and stone by stone the castle rise till 'twa near the finish and so we labor be not wanted every day squad of we fellow-prisoner march away and my gang be leave till nearly last be engage in make good a culvert that heavy rain have break down it be in the tenth year of we captivity and in the twenty-sixth of my age that one morning instead of the guard march we to work they hand we over to a party of mount soldier from whose matchlock and long whip i know that we be go to leave ymeguen before we leave another gang join we and how my heart go out when i see elzevir among they it be two year or more since we have meet even to pass a greet for i work outside the fortress and he on the great tower inside and i take note he hair be whiter and a sadder look upon he face and as for the _ cross-pall _ on he cheek i never think of it at all for we be all so well use to the mark that if one bear it not stamp upon he face we should have stare at he as on a man bear with but one eye but though he look be sad yet elzevir have a kind smile and hearty greet for I as he pass and on the march when they serve out we food we get a chance to speak a word or two together yet how could we find room for much gladness for even the pleasure of meeting be mar because we be force thus to take note as it be of each other 's misery and to know that the one have nothing for he old age but to break in prison and the other nothing but the prison to eat away the strength of he prime before long all know whither we be bind for it leak out we be to march to the hague and thence to scheveningen to take ship to the settlement of java where they use transport felon on the sugar farm be this the end of young hope and lofty aim -- to live and die a slave in the dutch plantation hope of grace hope of see moonfleet again be dead long long ago and now be there to be no hope of liberty or even wholesome air this side the grave but only burn sun and steam swamp and the crack of the slave-driver 's whip till the end come could it be so could it be so and yet what help be there or what release have i not watch ten year for any gleam or loophole of relief and never find it if we be shut in cell or dungeon in the deepest rock we might have scheme escape but here in the open fetter up in-drove what could we do they be bitter thought enough that fill my heart as i trudged along the rough road fetter by my wrist to the long bar and see elzevir 's white hair and bow shoulder trudge in front of I remember when that head have scarce a grizzle on it and the back be straight as the massive stubborn pillar in old moonfleet church what be it have bring we to this pitch and then i call to mind a July evening year ago the twilight summer-house and a sweet grave voice that say ` have a care how you touch the treasure : it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it ' ay 'twa the diamond have do it all and bring a blight upon my life since that first night i spend in moonfleet vault and i curse the stone and blackbeard and he lose mohune and trudge on bear they cognizance brand on my face we march back to the hague and through that very street where aldobrand dwelt only the house be shut and the board that bear he name take away so it seem that he have leave the place or else be dead thus we reach the quay at last and though i know that i be leave europe and leave all hope behind yet 'twa a delight to smell the sea again and fill my nostril with the keen salt air chapter 18 in the bay let broad league dissever he from yonder foam o god to think man ever come too near he home -- _ hood _ the ship that be to carry we swing at the buoy a quarter of a mile offshore and there be row-boat wait to take we to she she be a brig of some 120 ton burthen and as we come under the stern i see she name be the _ aurungzebe _ 'twa with regret unspeakable i take my last look at europe and cast my eye round see the smoke of the town dark against the darken sky yet know that neither smoke nor sky be half as black as be the prospect of my life they send we down to the orlop or lowest deck a foul place where be no air nor light and shut the hatch down on top of we there be thirty of we all tell hustle and drive like pig into this deck which be to be we pigsty for six month or more here be just light enough when they have the hatch off to show we what sort of place it be namely as foul as it smell with never table seat nor anything but roughest plank and balk and there they change we bond take away the bar and put a tight bracelet round one wrist with a padlocked chain run through a loop on it thus we be still iron six together but have a greater freedom and more scope to move and more than this the man who shift the chain whether through caprice or perhaps because he really wish to show we what pity he might padlock I on to the same chain with elzevir say we be english swine and might sink or swim together then the hatch be put on and there they leave we in the dark to think or sleep or curse the time away the weariness of ymeguen be bad indeed and yet it be a heaven to this night of hell where all we have to look for be twice a day the moving of the hatch and half a hour 's glimmer of a ship 's lantern while they serve we out the broken victuals that the dutch crew would not eat i shall say nothing of the foulness of this place because 'twa too foul to be write on paper and if 'twa foul at start 'twa ten time worse when we reach open sea for of all the prisoner only elzevir and i be sailor and the rest take the motion unkindly from the first we make bad weather of it for though we be below and could see nothing yet 'twa easy enough to tell there be a heavy head-sea run almost as soon as we be well out of harbor although elzevir and i have not have any chance of talk freely for so long and be now able to speak as we like be link so close together we say but little and this not because we do not value very greatly one another 's company but because we have nothing to talk of except memory of the past and those be too bitter and come too readily to we mind to need any to summon they there be too the banishment from europe from all and everything we love and the awful certainty of slavery that lay continuously on we like a weight of lead thus we say little we have be out a week i think -- for time be difficult enough to measure where there be neither clock nor sun nor star -- when the weather which have moderate a little begin to grow much worse the ship plunge and labor heavily and this add much to we discomfort because there be nothing to hold on by and unless we lay flat on the filthy deck we run a risk of be fling to the side whenever there come a more violent lurch or roll though we be so deep down yet the roaring of wind and wave be loud enough to reach we and there be such a noise when the ship go about such grind of rope with creak and groan of timber as would make a landsman fear the brig be go to piece and this some of we fellow-prisoner fear indeed and fall to cry or kneel chained together as they be upon the sloping deck while they try to remember long-forgotten prayer for my own part i wonder why these poor wretch should pray to be deliver from the sea when all that be before they be lifelong slavery but i be perhaps able to look more calmly on the matter myself as have be at sea and not think that the vessel be go to founder because of the noise yet the storm rise till 'twa very plain that we be in a rage sea and the stream which begin to trickle through the joining of the hatch show that water have get below ' i have know better ship go under for less than this ' elzevir say to I ` and if we skipper have not a tight craft and stout hand to work she there will soon be two score slave the less to cut the cane in java i can not guess where we be now -- may be off ushant may be not so far for this sea be too short for the bay but the saint send we sea-room for we have be wear these three hour ' 'twa true enough that we have go to wear as one might tell from the heavier roll or wallow when we go round instead of the plunging of a tack but there be no chance of get at we whereabouts the only thing we have to reckon time withal be the take off of the hatch twice a day for food and even this poor clock keep not the hour too well for often there be such gap and interval as make we belly pine and at this present we have wait so long that i craved even that filthy broken meat they feed we with so we be glad enough to hear a noise at the hatch just as elzevir have do speaking and the cover be fling off let in a splash of salt water and a little dim and dusky light but instead of the guard with they musket and lantern and the tub of broken victuals there be only one man and that the jailer who have padlock we into gang at the beginning of the voyage he bent down for a moment over the hatch hold on to the comb to steady himself in the sea-way and fling a key on a chain down into the orlop right among we ` take it ' he shout in dutch ` and make the most of it god help the brave and the devil take the hindmost ' that say he stay not one moment but turn about quick and be go for a instant none know what this play portend and there be the key lie on the deck and the hatch leave open then elzevir see what it all mean and seize the key ` john ' cry he speak to I in english ` the ship be founder and they be give we a chance to save we life and not drown like rat in a trap ' with that he try the key on the padlock which hold we chain and it fit so well that in a trice we gang be free off fall the chain clank on the floor and nothing left of we bond but a iron bracelet clamp round the left wrist you may be sure the other be quick enough to make use of the key when they know what 'twa but we wait not to see more but make for the ladder now elzevir and i be use to the sea be first through the hatchway above and oh the strength and sweet coolness of the sea air instead of the warm fetid reek of the orlop below there be a good deal of water sousing about on the main deck but nothing to show the ship be sink yet none of the crew be to be see we stay there not a second but move to the companion as fast as we could for the heavy pitching of the ship and so come on deck the dusk of a winter 's evening be set in yet with ample light to see near at hand and the first thing i perceive be that the deck be empty there be not a living soul but we upon it the brig be broach to with she bow against the heaviest sea i ever see and the wave sweep she fore and aft so we make for the tail of the deck-house and there take stock but before we get there i know why 'twa the crew be go and why they let we loose for elzevir point to something whither we be drift and shout in my ear so that i hear it above all the rage of the tempest -- ` we be on a lee shore ' we be lie head to sea and never a bit of canvas leave except one storm-staysail there be tattered riband flutter on the yard to show where the sail have be blow away and every now and then the staysail would flap like a gun go off to show it want to follow they but for all we lay head to sea we be move backwards and each great wave as it pass carry we on stern first with a leap and swirl lift 'twa over the stern that elzevir point in the course that we be go and there be such a mist what with the wind and rain and spindrift that one could see but a little way and yet i see too far for in the mist to which we be make a sternboard i see a white line like a fringe or valance to the sea and then i look to starboard and there be the same white fringe and then to larboard and the white fringe be there too only those who know the sea know how terrible be elzevir 's word utter in such a place a moment before i be exalt with the keen salt wind and with a hope and freedom that have be stranger for long but now 'twa all dash and death that be so far off to the young have move nearer by fifty year -- be move a year nearer every minute ` we be on a lee shore ' elzevir shout and i look and know what the white fringe be and that we should be in the breaker in half a hour what a whirl of wind and wave and sea what a whirl of thought and wild conjecture what be that land to which we be drift be it cliff with deep water and iron face where a good ship be shatter at a blow and death come like a thunder-clap or be it shelve sand where there be strand and the pound pound pound of the wave for howl before she go to piece and all be over we be in a bay for there be the long white crescent of surf reach far away on either side till it be lose in the dusk and the brig helpless in the midst of it elzevir have hold of my arm and grip it hard as he look to larboard i follow he eye and where one horn of the white crescent fade into the mist catch a dark shadow in the air and know it be high land loom behind and then the murk and driving rain lift ever so little and as it be only for that purpose and we see a misty bluff slope down into the sea like the long head of a bask alligator poise upon the water and stare into each other 's eye and cry together ` the snout ' it have vanish almost before it be see and yet we know there be no mistake it be the snout that be there loom behind the move rack and we be in moonfleet bay oh what a rush of thought then come daze I with its sweet bitterness to think that after all these weary year of prison and exile we have come back to moonfleet we be so near to all we love so near -- only a mile of broken water -- and yet so far for death lay between and we have come back to moonfleet to die there be a change come over elzevir 's feature when he see the snout he face have lose its sadness and wear a look of sober happiness he put he mouth close to my ear and say : ` there be some strange lead hand have bring we home at last and i have rather drown on moonfleet beach than live in prison any more and drown we must within a hour yet we will play the man and make a fight for life ' and then as if gathering together all he force : ` we have weather bad time together and who know but we shall weather this ' the other prisoner be on deck now and have find they way aft they be wild with fear be landsman and never have see a angry sea and indeed that sea might have fright sailor too so they stumble along drench with the wave and cluster round elzevir for they look on he as a leader because he know the way of the sea and be the only one leave calm in this dreadful strait it be plain that when the dutch crew find they be embay and that the ship must drift into the breaker they have take to the boat for gig and jolly-boat be go and only the pinnace leave amidship 'twa too heavy a boat perhaps for they to have get out in such a fearful sea but there it lay and it be to that the prisoner turn they eye some have hold of elzevir 's arm some fall upon the deck and catch he by the knee beseech he to show they how to get the pinnace out then he speak out shout to make they hear : ` friend any man that take to boat be lose i know this bay and know this beach and be indeed bear hereabouts but never know a boat come to land in such a sea save bottom uppermost so if you want my counsel there you have it namely to stick by the ship in half a hour we shall be in the breaker and i will put the helm up and try to head the brig bow on to the beach so every man will have a chance to fight for he own life and god have mercy on those that drown ' i know what he say be the truth and there be nothing for it but to stick to the ship though that be small chance enough but those poor fear-demented soul would have nothing of he advice now 'twa give and must need go for the boat then some come up from below who have be in the spirit-room and be full of drink and drink-courage and hearten on the rest say they would have the pinnace out and every soul should be save indeed fate seem to point they that road for a heavier sea than any come on board and clear away a great piece of larboard bulwark that have be work loose and make as it be a clear launching-way for the boat again do elzevir try to prevail with they to stand by the ship but they turn away and all make for the pinnace it lay amidship and be a heavy boat enough but with so many hand to help they get it to the broken bulwark then elzevir see they would have it out at any price show they how to take advantage of the sea and shift the helm a little till the _ aurungzebe _ fall off to larboard and put the gap in the bulwark on the lee so in a few minute there it lay at a rope 's - end on the sheltered side deep laden with thirty man who be ill find with oar and much worse find with skill to use they there be one or two before they leave shout to elzevir and I to try to make we follow they partly i think because they really like elzevir and partly that they might have a sailor in the boat to direct they but the other cast off and leave we with a curse say that we might go and drown for obstinate englishman so we two be leave alone on the brig which keep drift backwards slowly but the pinnace be soon lose to sight though we see that they be rowing wild as soon as she pass out of the shelter of the ship and that they have much ado to keep she head to the sea then elzevir go to the kicking-wheel and beckon I to help he and between we we put the helm hard up i see then that he have give up all hope of the wind shift and be try to run she dead for the beach she be broached-to with she bow in the wind but gradually pay off as the staysail fill and so she head straight for shore the November night have fall and it be very dark only the white fringe of the breaker could be see and grow plainer as we draw closer to it the wind be blow fiercer than ever and the wave break more fiercely nearer the shore they have lose they dirty yellow color when the light die and be roll after we like great black mountain with a comb white top that seem as if they must overwhelm we every minute twice they poop we and we be up to we waist in icy water but still hold to the wheel for we life the white line be nearer to we now and above all the rage of wind and sea i could hear the awful roar of the under-tow sucking back the pebble on the beach the last time i could remember hearing that roar be when i lay as a boy one summer 's night ` twixt sleep and waking in the little whitewashed bedroom at my aunt 's and i wonder now if any sit before they inland hearth this night and hearing that far distant roar would throw another log on the fire and thank god they be not fight for they life in moonfleet bay i could picture all that be go on this night on the beach -- how ratsey and the lander would have sight the _ aurungzebe _ perhaps at noon perhaps before and know she be embay and nothing could save she but the wind draw to east but the wind would hold pin in the south and they would see sail after sail blow off she and watch she wear and wear and every time come nearer in and the talk would run through the street that there be a ship could not weather the snout and must come ashore by sundown then half the village would be gather on the beach with the man ready to risk they life for ours and in no wise wish for the ship to be wreck yet anxious not to lose they chance of booty if providence should rule that wreck she must be and i know ratsey would be there and damen tewkesbury and laver and like enough parson glennie and perhaps -- and at that perhaps my thought come back to where we be for i hear elzevir speak to I : ` look ' he say ` there be a light ' 'twa but the faintest twinkle or not even that only something that tell there be a light behind drift and darkness it grow clearer as we look at it and again be lose in the mirk and then elzevir say ` maskew 's match ' it be a long-forgotten name that come to I from so far off down such long alley of the memory that i have as it be to grope and grapple with it to know what it should mean then it all come back and i be a boy again on the trawler creep shoreward in the light breeze of a August night and watch that friendly twinkle from the manor wood above the village have she not promise she would keep that lamp alight to guide all sailor every night till i come back again be she not wait still for I be i not come back to she now but what a come back no more a boy not on a August night but broken branded convict in the November gale 'twa well indeed there be between we that white fringe of death that she might never see what i have fall to 'twa likely elzevir have something of the same thought for he speak again forget perhaps that i be man now and no longer boy and use a name he have not use for year ` johnnie ' he say ' i be cold and sore downheart in ten minute we shall be in the surf go down to the spirit locker drink thyself and bring I up a bottle here we shall both need a young man 's strength and i have not get it any more ' i do as he bid I and find the locker though the cabin be all awash and have drunk myself take he the bottle back 'twas good holland enough be from the captain 's own store but nothing to the old ararat milk of the why not elzevir take a pull at it and then fling the bottle away ` tis sound liquor ' he laugh ` and good for autumn chill as ratsey would have say ' we be very near the white fringe now and the wave follow we higher and more curling then there be a sickly wan glow that spread itself through the watery air in front of we and i know that they be burn a blue light on the beach they would all be there wait for we though we could not see they and they do not know that there be only two man that they be signalling to and those two moonfleet bear they burn that light in moonfleet bay just where a little streak of clay crop out beneath the pebble and if a vessel can make that spot she get a softer bottom so we put the wheel over a bit and set she straight for the flare there be a deafening noise as we come near the shore the shrieking of the wind in the rig the crash of the comb sea and over all the awful grind roar of the under-tow suck down the pebble ` it be come now ' elzevir say and i could see dim figure move in the misty glare from the blue light and then just as the _ aurungzebe _ be make fair for the signal a monstrous comb sea poop she and wash we both from the wheel forward in a swirl flood we grasp at anything we could and so bring up bruised and half-drowned in the fore-chain but as the wheel run free another sea strike she and slew she round there be a second while the water seem over under and on every side and then the _ aurungzebe _ go broadside on moonfleet beach with a noise like thunder and a blow that stun we i have see ship come ashore in that same place before and since and bump on and off with every wave till the stout balk could stand the pound no more and part but 'twa not so with we poor brig for after that first fearful shock she never move again be fling so firm upon the beach by one great swamp wave that never another have power to uproot she only she careen over beachward turn herself away from the sea as a child bow he head to escape a cruel master 's ferule and then she mast break off first the fore and then the main with a splitting crash that make itself hear above all we be on the lee side underneath the shelter of the deckhouse cling to the shroud now up to we knee in water as the wave come on now leave high and dry when it go back the blue light be still burn but the ship be beach a little to the right of it and the dim group of fisherman have move up along the beach till they be opposite we thus we be but a hundred foot distant from they but 'twa the interval of death and life for between we and the shore be a maddened race of seething water white foam wave that leap up from all side against we broken bulwark or suck back the pebble with a grind roar till they leave the beach nearly dry we stand there for a minute hanging on and wait for resolution to come back to we after the shock of ground on the weather side the sea strike and curl over the brig with a noise like thunder and the force of countless ton they come over the top of the deck-house in a cataract of solid water and there be a crash crash crash of rend wood as plank after plank give way before that stern assault we could feel the deck-house itself quiver and shake again as we stand with we back against it and at last it move so much that we know it must soon be wash over on we the moment have come ` we must go after the next big wave run back ' elzevir shout ` jump when i give the word and get as far up the pebble as you can before the next come in : they will throw we a rope 's - end to catch so now good-bye john and god save we both ' i wrung he hand and take off my convict clothes keep my boot on to meet the pebble and be so cold that i almost long for the surf then we stand wait side by side till a great wave come in turn the space ` twixt ship and shore into a boiling caldron : a minute later 'twa all suck back again with a roar and we jump i fall on hand and foot where the water be a yard deep under the ship but get my footing and flounder through the slop in a desperate struggle to climb as high as might be on the beach before the next wave come in i see the string of man lash together and reach down as far as man might to save any that come through the surf and hear they shout to cheer we and mark a coil of rope fling out elzevir be by my side and see it too and we both keep we foot and plunge forward through the quiver slack water but then there come a awful thunder behind the crash of the sea over the wreck and we know that another mountain wave be on we heel it come in with a swish roar a rush and rise of furious water that sweep we like cork up the beach till we be within touch of the rope 's - end and the man shout again to hearten we as they fling it out elzevir seize it with he left hand and reach out he right to I we finger touch and in that very moment the wave fall instantly with a awful suck and i be sweep down the beach again yet the under-tow take I not back to sea for amid the float wreckage float the shatter maintop and in the truck of that great spar i catch and so be leave with it upon the beach thirty pace from the man and elzevir then he leave he own assure salvation namely the rope and stride down again into the very jaw of death to catch I by the hand and set I on my foot sight and breath be fail I i be numb with cold and half-dead from the buffeting of the sea yet he giant strength be powerful to save I then as it have save I before so when we hear once more the warning crash and thunder of the return wave we be but a fathom distant from the rope ` take heart lad ' he cry '' tis now or never ' and as the water reach we breast give I a fierce shove forward with he hand there be a roar of water in my ear with a great shouting of the man upon the beach and then i catch the rope chapter 19 on the beach toll for the brave the grave that be no more all sink beneath the wave fast by they native shore -- _ cowper _ the night be cold and i have nothing on I save breeches and boot and those drench with the sea and have be wrestle with the surf so long that there be little left in I yet once i clutch the rope i clung to it for very life and in a minute find myself in the midst of the beachman i hear they shout again and feel strong hand seize I but could not see they face for a mist that swim before my eye and could not speak because my throat and tongue be crack with the salt water and the voice would not come there be a crowd about I of man and some woman and i spread out my hand blindly to catch hold of they but my knee fail and let I down upon the beach and after that i remember only have coat fling over I and be carry off out of the wind and lay in warmest blanket before a fire i be numb with the cold my hair be mat with the salt and my flesh white and shrivel but they force liquor into my mouth and so i lay in drowsy content till utter weariness bind I in sleep it be a deep and dreamless sleep for hour and when it leave I gently and as it be inch by inch i find i be still lie wrap in blanket by the fire oh what a vast and infinite peace be that to lie there half-asleep yet wake enough to know that i have slip my prison and the pain of death and be a free man here in my native place at last i shift myself a little grow more awake and open my eye see i be not alone for two man sit at a table by I with glass and a bottle before they ` he be coming-to ' say one ` and may live yet to tell we who he be and from what port he craft sail ' ` there have be many a craft ' the other say ` have sail for many a port and make this beach she last and many a honest man have land on it and never one alive in such a sea nor would this one be live either if it have not be for that other brave heart to stand by and save he brave heart brave heart ' he say over to himself ` here pass I the bottle or i shall get the vapor ` tis good against these early chill and i have not be in this place for ten year past since poor elzevir be cut adrift ' i could not see the speaker 's face from where i lay upon the floor yet seem to know he voice and so be fumble in my weakened mind to put a name to it when he speak of elzevir and send my thought fly elsewhere ` elzevir ' i say ` where be elzevir ' and sit up to look round expect to see he lie near I and remember the wreck more clearly now and how he have save I with that last shove forward on the beach but he be not to be see and so i guess that he great strength have bring he round quicker than have my youth and that he be go back to the beach ` hush ' say one of the man at the table ` lie down and get to sleep again ' and then he add speak to he comrade : ` he brain be wander yet : do you see how he have catch up my word about elzevir ' ` no ' i strike in ` my head be clear enough i be speaking of elzevir block i pray you tell I where he be be he well again ' they get up and stare at one another and at I when i name elzevir block and then i know the one that speak for master ratsey only greyer than he be ` who be you ' he cry ` who talk of elzevir block ' ` do you not know I master ratsey ' and i look full in he face ' i be john trenchard who leave you so long ago i pray you tell I where be master block ' master ratsey look as if he have see a ghost and be strike dumb at first : but then run up and shake I by the hand so warmly that i fall back again on my pillow while he pour out question in a flood how have i fare where have i be whence have i come until i stop he say : ` softly kind friend and i will answer only tell I first where be master elzevir ' ` nay that i can not say ' he answer ` for never a soul have set eye on elzevir since that summer morning we put thee and he ashore at newport ' ` oh fool I not ' i cry out chafe at he excuse ' i be not wander now 'twa elzevir that save I in the surf last night 'twa he that land with I ' there be a look of sad amaze that come on ratsey 's face when i say that a look that wake in I a awful surmise ` what ' cry he ` be that master elzevir that drag thee through the surf ' ` ay 'twas he land with I 'twa he land with I ' i say try as it be to make true by repeat that which i fear be not the truth there be a minute 's silence and then ratsey speak very softly : ` there be none land with you there be no soul save from that ship alive save you ' he word fall one by one upon my ear as if they be drop of molten lead ` it be not true ' i cry ` he pull I up the beach himself and it be he that push I forward to the rope ' ` ay he save thee and then the under-tow get hold of he and sweep he down under the curl i could not see he face but might have know there never be a man save elzevir could fight the surf on moonfleet beach like that yet have we known 'twa he we could have do no more for many risk they life last night to save you both we could have do no more ' then i give a great groan for utter anguish to think that he have give up the safety he have win for himself and lay down he life there on the beach for I to think that he have die on the threshold of he home that i should never get a kind look from he again nor ever hear he kindly voice it be wearisome to other to talk of deep grief and beside that no word even of the wisest man can ever set it forth nor even if we be able could we memory bear to tell it so i shall not speak more of that terrible blow only to say that sorrow so far from cast my body down as one might have expect give it strength and i rise up from the mattress where i have be lie they try to stop I and even to hold I back but for all i be so weak i push they aside and must need fling a blanket round I and away back to the beach the morning be break as i leave the why not for 'twa in no other place but that i lay and the wind though still high have abate there be light cloud cross the heaven very swiftly and between they patch of clear sky where the star be grow paler before the dawn the star be grow paler but there be another star that shine out from the manor wood above the village although i could not see the house and tell I grace like the wise virgin keep she lamp alight all night yet even that light shone without lustre for I then for my heart be too full to think of anything but of he who have lay down he life for mine and of the strong kind heart that be still for ever 'twa well i know the way so sure of old from why not to beach for i take no heed to path or foot but plunge along in the morning dusk blind with sorrow and weariness of spirit there be a fire of driftwood burning at the back of the beach and round it crouch a group of man in reefing jacket and sou ` wester wait for morning to save what they might from the wreck but i give they a wide berth and so pass in the darkness without a word and come to the top of the beach there be light enough to make out what be do the sea be run very high but with the fall wind the wave come in more leisurely and with less of broken water curling over in a tawny sweep and regular thunderous beat all along the bay for mile there be no sign left of the hull of the _ aurungzebe _ but the beach be strew with so much wreckage as one would have think could never come from so small a ship there be barrel and keg grating and hatch-cover boom and piece of mast and truck and beside all that the heave water in-shore be cover with a float mask of broken match-wood and the wave as they curl over carry up and dash down on the pebble plank and beam beyond number there be a dozen or more of man on the seaward side of the beach with oilskin to keep the wet out prowl up and down the pebble to see what they could lay they hand on and now and then they would run down almost into the white fringe risk they life to save a keg as they have risk they to save they fellow last night -- as they have risk they life to save ours as elzevir have risk he life to save mine and lose it there in the white fringe i sit down at the top of the beach with elbow on knee head between hand and face set out to sea not know well why i be there or what i seek but only think that elzevir be float somewhere in that float skin of wreck-wood and that i must be at hand to meet he when he come ashore he would surely come in time for i have see other come ashore that way for when the _ bataviaman _ go on the beach i stand as near she as we rescuer have stand to we last night and there be some aboard who take the fatal leap from off she bow and try to battle through the surf i be so near they i could mark they feature and read the wild hope in they face at the first and then the under-tow take hold of they and never one that save he life that day and yet all come to beach at last and i know they by they dead face for the man i have see hope against hope ` twixt ship and shore some naked and some clothe some bruise and sorely beat by the pebble and the sea and some sound and untouched -- all come to beach at last so i sit and wait for he to come and none of the beach-walker say anything to I the moonfleet man think i come from ringstave and the langton man that i belong to moonfleet and both that i have mark some cask at sea for my own and be wait till it should come in only after a while master ratsey join I and sit down by I beg I to eat bread and meat that he have bring now i have little heart to eat but take what he give I to save myself from he importunity and have once taste be lead by nature to eat all and be much benefit thereby yet i could not talk with ratsey nor answer any of he question though another time i should have put a thousand to he myself and he see 'twa no good sit by I in silence use a spy-glass now and again to make out the thing float at sea as the day grow the man leave the fire at the back of the beach and come down to the sea-front where the wave be continually cast up fresh spoil and there all work with a will not each one for he own hand but all to make a common hoard which should be divide afterwards among the flotsam move outside the breaker i could see more than one dark ball like black buoy bob up and down and lift as the wave come by : and know they for the head of drowned man yet though i take ratsey 's glass and scan all carefully enough i could make nothing of they but see the pinnace float bottom up and farther out another boat desert and down to she gunwale in the water 'twa midday before the first body be cast up when the sky be break a little and a thin and watery sun try to get through and afterwards three other body follow they be part of the pinnace 's crew for all have the iron ring on the left wrist as ratsey tell I who go down to see they though he say nothing of the branded ` y ' and they be take up and put under some sheet at the back of the beach there to lie till a grave should be make ready for they then i feel something that tell I he be come and see a body roll over in the surf and know it for the one i seek 'twa nearest I he be fling up and i run down the beach caring nothing for the white foam nor for the under-tow and lay hold of he : for have he not leave the rescue-line last night and run down into the surf to save my worthless life ratsey be at my side and so between we we draw he up out of the run foam and then i wrung the water from he hair and wipe he face and kneel down there kiss he when they see that we have get a body other of the man come up and stare to see I handle he so tenderly but when they know at last i be a stranger and have the iron ring upon my wrist and a ` y ' burn upon my cheek they stare the more until the tale go round that i be he who have come through the surf last night alive and this poor body be my friend who have lay down he life for I then i see ratsey speak with one and another of the group and know that he be tell they we name and some that i have know come up and shake I by the hand not say anything because they see my heart be full and some bent down and look in elzevir 's face and touch he hand as if to greet he sea and stone have be merciful with he and he show neither bruise nor wound but he face wear a look of great peace and he eye and mouth be shut even i who know where 'twa could scarcely see the ` y ' mark on he cheek for the paleness of death have take out the color of the scar and leave he face as smooth and mellow-white as the alabaster figure in moonfleet church he body be naked from the waist up as he have strip for jump from the brig and we could see the great broad chest and swell muscle that have pull he out of many a desperate pass and only fail he for the first and last time so few hour ago they stand for a little while look in silence at the old lander who have run he last cargo on moonfleet beach and then they lay he arm down by he side and sling he in a sail and carry he away i walk beside and as we come down across the sea-meadow the sun break out and we meet little group of schoolchildren make they way down to the beach to see what be do with the wreck they stand aside to let we go by the boy pull they cap and the girl drop a curtsy when they know that it be a poor drowned body passing and as i see the child i think i see myself among they and i be no more a man but just come out from mr glennie 's teaching in the old almshouse hall thus we come to the why not and there set he down the inn have not be let as i learn afterwards since maskew die and they have put a fire in it last night for the first time know that the brig would be wreck and think that some might come off with they life and require tend the door stand open and they carry he into the parlor where the fire be still burn and lay he down on the trestle-table cover he face and body with the sail this do they all stand round a little while awkwardly enough as not know what to do and then slip away one by one because grief be a thing that only woman know how to handle and they want to be back on the beach to get what might be from the wreck last of all go master ratsey say he see that i would as lief be alone and that he would come back before dark so i be leave alone with my dead friend and with a host of bitterest thought the room have not be clean there be spider-web on the beam and the dust stand so thick on the window-pane as to shut out half the light the dust be on everything : on chair and table save on the trestle-table where he lay 'twa on this very trestle they have lay out david 's body 'twa in this very room that this still form who would never more know either joy or sorrow have bow down and weep over he son the room be just as we have leave it a April evening year ago and on the dresser lay the great backgammon board so dusty that one could not read the letter on it ` life be like a game of hazard the skilful player will make something of the worst of throw ' but what unskillful player we have be how bad we throw how little we have make of they 'twa with thought like this that i be busy while the short afternoon be spend and the story go up and down the village how that elzevir block and john trenchard who leave so long ago be come back to moonfleet and that the old lander be drowned save the young man 's life the dusk be creep up as i turn back the sail from off he face and take another look at my lose friend my only friend for who be there now to care a jot for I i might go and drown myself on moonfleet beach for anyone that would grieve over I what do it profit I to have break bond and to be free again what use be freedom to I now where be i to go what be i to do my friend be go so i go back and sit with my head in my hand look into the fire when i hear someone step into the room but do not turn think it be master ratsey come back and tread lightly so as not to disturb I then i feel a light touch on my shoulder and look up saw standing by I a tall and stately woman girl no longer but woman in the full strength and beauty of youth i know she in a moment for she have alter little except she oval face have something more of dignity and the tawny hair that use to fly about she back be now gather up she be look down at I and let she hand rest on my shoulder ` john ' she say ` have you forget I may i not share you sorrow do you not think to tell I you be come do you not see the light do you not know there be a friend that wait for you ' i say nothing not be able to speak but marvel how she have come just in the point of time to prove I wrong to think i have no friend and she go on : ` be it well for you to be here grieve not too sadly for none could have die nobler than he die and in these year that you have be away i have think much of he and find he good at heart and if he do aught wrong 'twa because other wrong he more ' and while she speak i think how elzevir have go to shoot she father and only fail of it by a hair 's - breadth and yet she speak so well i think he never really mean to shoot at all but only to scare the magistrate and what a whirligig of time be here that i should have save elzevir from have that blot on he conscience and then that he should save my life and now that maskew 's daughter should be the one to praise elzevir when he lay dead and still i could not speak and again she say : ` john have you no word for I have you forget do you not love I still have i no part in you sorrow ' then i take she hand in mine and raise it to my lip and say ` dear mistress grace i have forget nothing and honor you above all other : but of love i may not speak more to you -- nor you to I for we be no more boy and girl as in time past but you a noble lady and i a broken wretch ' and with that i tell how i have be ten year a prisoner and why and show she the iron ring upon my wrist and the brand upon my cheek at the brand she stare and say ` speak not of wealth ` tis not wealth make man and if you have come back no richer than you go you be come back no poorer nor poorer john in honor and i be rich and have more wealth than i can rightly use so speak not of these thing but be glad that you be poor and be not let to profit by that evil treasure but for this brand it be no prison name to I but the mohune ' badge to show that you be theirs and must do they bidding say i not to you have a care how you touch the treasure it be evilly come by and will bring a curse with it but now i pray you with a greater earnestness see you bear this mark upon you touch no penny of that treasure if it should some day come back to you but put it to such use as colonel mohune think would help he sinful soul ' with that she take she hand from mine and bid I ` good night ' leave I in the darkening room with the glow from the fire lighting up the sail and the outline of the body that lay under it after she be go i pondered long over what she have say and what that should mean when she speak of the treasure one day come back to I : but wonder much the most to find how constant be the love of woman and how she could still find a place in she heart for so poor a thing as i but as to what she say i be to learn she meaning this very night master ratsey have come in and go again not stop with I very long because there be much do on the beach but bidding I be of good cheer and have no fear of the law for that the ban against I and the head-price have be dead for many a year 'twa grace have make she lawyer move for this refusing herself to sign the hue and cry and say that the fatal shot be fire by misadventure and so a dread which be just wake be lay to rest for ever and when ratsey go i make up the fire and lay down in the blanket in front of it for i be dog-tired and long for sleep i be already doze but not asleep when there be a knock at the door and in walk mr glennie he be aged and stoop a little as i could see by the firelight but for all that i know he at once and sit up offer he what welcome i could he look at I curiously at first as take note of the bearded man that have grow out of the boy he remember but give I very kindly greet and sit down beside I on a bench first he lift the sail from the dead body and look at the sleep face then he take out a common prayer read the commendamus over the dead and give I spiritual comfort and lastly he fall to talk about the past from he i learn something of what have happen while i be away though for that matter nothing have happen at all except a few death for that be the only sort of change for which we look in moonfleet and among those who have pass away be miss arnold my aunt so that i be another friend the less if indeed i should count she a friend : for though she mean I well she show she care with too much strictness to let I love she and so in my great sorrow for elzevir i find no room to grieve for she whether from the spiritual solace mr glennie offer I or whether from he point out how much cause for thankfulness i have in be loose out of prison and save from imminent death certain it be i feel some assuagement of grief and take pleasure in he talk ` and though i may by some be reprehend ' he say ` for presume to refer to profane author after cite holy scripture yet i can not refrain from say that even the great poet homer counsel moderation in mourning for quickly say he cometh satiety of chilly grief ' after this i think he be go but he clear he throat in such a way that i guess he have something important to say and he draw a long fold blue paper from he pocket ` my son ' he say open it leisurely and smooth it out upon he knee ` we should never revile fortune and in speaking of fortune i only use that appellation in we poor human sense and do not imply that there be any chance at all but what be subject to a over-ruling providence we should never i say revile fortune for just at that moment when she appear to have desert we she may be only go away to seek some richest treasure to bring back with she and that this be so let what i be about to read to you prove so light a candle and set it by I for my eye can not follow the writing in this dancing firelight ' i take a end of candle which stand on the mantelpiece and do as he bid I and he go on : ' i shall read you this letter which i receive near eight year ago and of the weightiness of it you shall yourself judge ' i shall not here set down that letter in full although i have it by I but will put it shortly because it be from a lawyer trick with long-winded phrase and spin out as such letter be to afford cover afterwards for a heavier charge it be address to the reverend horace glennie perpetual curate of moonfleet in the county of dorset england and write in english by heer roosten attorney and signariat of the hague in the kingdom of holland it set forth that one krispijn aldobrand jeweller and dealer in precious stone at the hague have send for heer roosten to draw a will for he and that the say krispijn aldobrand be near he end have depose to the say heer roosten that he aldobrand be desirous to leave all he goods to one john trenchard of moonfleet dorset in the kingdom of england and that he be move to do this first by the consideration that he aldobrand have no child to whom to leave aught and second because he desire to make full and fitting restitution to john trenchard for that he have once obtain from the say john a diamond without pay the proper price for it which stone he aldobrand have sell and convert into money and have so do find afterwards both he fortune and he health decline so that although he have great riches before he become possess of the diamond these have forthwith melt through unfortunate venture and speculation till he have little remain to he but the money that this same diamond have bring he therefore leave to john trenchard everything of which he should die possess and be near death beg he forgiveness if he have wrong he in aught these be the instruction which heer roosten receive from mr aldobrand whose health sensibly decline until three month later he die it be well heer roosten add that the will have be draw in good time for as mr aldobrand grow weaker he become a prey to delusion say that john trenchard have lay a curse upon the diamond and profess even to relate the word of it namely that it should ` bring evil in this life and damnation in that which be to come ' nor be this all for he could get no sleep but wake up with a horrid dream in which so he inform heer roosten he see continually a tall man with a coppery face and black beard draw the bed-curtain and mock he thus he come at length to he end and after he death heer roosten endeavor to give effect to the provision of the will by write to john trenchard at moonfleet dorset to apprise he that he be leave sole heir that address indeed be all the indication that aldobrand have give though he constantly promise he attorney to let he have closer information as to trenchard 's whereabouts in good time this information be however always postpone perhaps because aldobrand hope he might get better and so repent of he repentance so all heer roosten have to do be to write to trenchard at moonfleet and in due course the letter be return to he with the information that trenchard have flee that place to escape the law and be then nowhere to be find after that heer roosten be advise to write to the minister of the parish and so address these line to mr glennie this be the gist of the letter which mr glennie read and you may easily guess how such news move I and how we sit far into the night talk and consider what step it be best to take for we fear lest so long a interval as eight year have elapse the lawyer might have make some other disposition of the money it be midnight when mr glennie leave the candle have long burn out but the fire be bright and he kneel a moment by the trestle-table before he go out ` he make a good end john ' he say rise from he knee ` and i pray that we end may be in as good cause when it come for with the best of we the hour of death be a awful hour and we may well pray as every Sunday to be deliver in it but there be another time which those who write this litany think no less perilous and bid we pray to be deliver in all time of we wealth so i pray that if after all this wealth come to you hand you may be lead to use it well for though i do not hold with foolish tale or think a curse hang on riches themselves yet if riches have be set apart for a good purpose even by evil man as colonel john mohune set apart this treasure it can not be but that we shall do grievous wrong in put they to other use so fare you well and remember that there be other treasure besides this and that a good woman 's love be worth far more than all the gold and jewel of the world -- as i once know ' and with that he leave I i guess that he have speak with grace that day and as i lay doze in front of the fire alone in this old room i know so well alone with that silent friend who have die to save I i mourn he none the less but yet sorrow not as one without hope \* \* \* \* \* what need to tell this tale at any more length since you may know by my tell it that all go well for what man would sit down to write a history that end in he own discomfiture all that great wealth come to my hand and if i do not say how great it be ` tis that i may not wake envy for it be far more than ever i could have think and of that money i never touch penny piece have learn a bitter lesson in the past but lay it out in good work with mr glennie and grace to help I first we rebuild and enlarged the almshouse beyond all that colonel john mohune could ever think of and so established they as to be a haven for ever for all worn-out sailor of that coast next we seek the guidance of the brethren of the trinity and build a lighthouse on the snout to be a channel beacon for sea-going ship as maskew 's match have be a light for we fishing-boat in the past lastly we beautify the church turn out the cumbrous seat of oak and neatly pew it with deal and baize that make it most commodious to sit in of the sabbath there be also much old glass which we remove and reglaze all the window tight against the wind so that what with a high pulpit reading-desk and seat for master clerk and new commandment board each side of the holy table there be not a church could vie with ours in the countryside but that great vault below it with its memory be set in order and then safely wall up and after that nothing be more ever hear of blackbeard and he lose mohune and as for the lander i can not say where they go and if a cargo be still run of a dark night upon the beach i know nothing of it be both lord of the manor and justice of the peace the village too renew itself with the new almshouse and church there be old house rebuilt and fresh one rear and all be ours except the why not which still remain the duchy inn and that be let again and man leave the chough at ringstave and come back to they old haunt and any shipwrecked or travel-worn sailor find board and welcome within its door and of the mohune hospital -- for that be what the alms-house be now call -- master glennie be first warden with fair room and a full library and master ratsey head of the bedesman there they spend happier day till they be gather in the fullness of they year and sleep on the sunny side of the church within sound of the sea by that great buttress where i once find master ratsey listen with he ear to ground and close beside they lie elzevir block most faithful and most love by I with a text on he tombstone : ` greater love have no man than this that a man lay down he life for he friend ' and some of mr glennie 's verse and of ourselves let I speak last the manor house be a stately home again with trim lawn and terraced balustrade where we can sit and see the thin blue smoke hang above the village on summer evening and in the manor wood my wife and i have see a little grace and a little john and little elzevir we firstborn play and now we daughter be grow up fair to we as the polished corner of the temple and we son be go out to serve king george on sea and land but as for we for grace and I we never leave this we happy moonfleet be well content to see the dawn tip the long cliff-line with gold and the night walk in dew across the meadow to watch the spring clothe the beech bough with green or the fig ripen on the southern wall : while behind all be spread as a curtain the eternal sea ever the same and ever change yet i love to see it best when it be lash to madness in the autumn gale and to hear the grind roar and churn of the pebble like a great organ play all the night ` tis then i turn in bed and thank god more from the heart perhaps than any other living man that i be not fight for my life on moonfleet beach and more than once i have stand rope in hand in that same awful place and try to save a struggle wretch but never see one come through the surf alive in such a night as he save I end of the project gutenberg ebook of moonfleet by j meade falkner
