and yet that isle remaineth a refuge for the free as when true-hearted macy behold it from the sea god bless the sea-beat island and grant for evermore that charity and freedom dwell as now upon the shore j g whittier gentle reader pause a little and let we for a few moment turn we thought toward that island of the sea upon which it be the fate of we heroine through the guidance of a divine providence to find a home in the bosom of those whose heart ' beating be of love for we unknown yea love ever encircleth purity properly this chapter descriptive of the island of nantucket should have be we first but have that be the case alas for the simple tale of natalie how many would have pass it by with but one thought and that think invariably -- nantucket pooh a fish story strikingly embellish with ignorance and you may indeed discover in the feebleness of my unpretending pen much that be food for critic yet give not a thought of ridicule to nantucket 's favored one for it be not for I to enlist under she banner of superiority of intellect to the many question which i know you have it in you heart to ask as touch the civilization etc of these islander i do not reply as i might be tempt under other circumstance to do that it would be advisable to procure a passport before landing on those shore lest one might stand in danger of be harpoon by the native but rather let I in as correct a light as i may set forth to those who have heretofore know but little of those who inhabit that triangular bit of land in the wide ocean which when we be six year old we pass over on we map with the thought i wonder if they have sunday there situate nearly one hundred mile in a south-easterly course from the city of boston and about thirty mile from the nearest point of main land nantucket lift she proud head from out the broad atlantic whose water even when lash to madness have be kind to she and now on this oppressive July morning let we throw aside we care and come out from we daily round of duty where we have be scale with we eye the tall brick barrier which shut out god 's beautiful blue sky and sunshine yes let we off anywhere to get one glimpse of nature on board the good steamer island home a two hour ' sail carry we over that distance which separate cape cod from nantucket if you have not pass most of you day among the connecticut hill you pay little attention to that green-eyed monster who consider it a part of he duty to prepare the uninitiated for the good time come arrive at the bar which stretch itself across the entrance to the harbor we first impression take to themselves the form of sundry venerable windmill church spire and tower represent various order of architecture but that which strike we most be the scarcity of shipping not more than a dozen vessel lie at the wharf in former time nantucket number as many whaleship belong to she port as do any town on we seaboard indeed she be build up from the produce of the ocean and carry the palm for year as be first among the american whale fishery but she number have dwindle away till not one-fourth of those homeward-bound ship be destine for the port of nantucket the town we find be situate on the northern shore of the island at the harbor 's head the house be compact and most of they build of wood with little regard to beauty though some few residence there be of modern style which do credit to they designer but the greater number speak only of antiquity with they shingled side and you will rarely see a house that have not a walk upon its roof with which they could by no means dispense as in case of ship-wreck near the island the roof of the whole town will be alive with man woman and child spyglass in hand besides the town there be but one or two small village polpi and the far-famed siaconset or sconset as it be usually term -- numbering some four dozen house this village be seven and one-half mile from the town afford a delightful place of recreation for family from town who as the summer holiday come round harness up old dobbin and prepare for a six week ' siesta if by reason of the great financial pressure you find you have not sufficient pocket-money to take you for a short tour to europe come to sconset it be a glorious place take a stroll along that grand old beach and watch the moon rise from out the ocean then go to you comfortable seven-by-nine lodgings which seem like a palace draw the comfortable rug about you and fall asleep with old ocean for a lullaby to dream -lrb- if you waking hour be fortunately of that bent -rrb- of some old desert castle salem witchcraft or a lone grace pool attendant within the attic 's most remote recess the face of the island be level so much so that the flat bare common resemble somewhat we western prairie and with the exception of the cliff at the north and sancoty head there be but few slight elevation owe to the peculiar shape of the island its two arm stretch far out on either side it do not appear to be as large as it really be -- be about sixteen mile long and four wide afford sufficient elbow room however for its eight thousand inhabitant the soil be sandy but be cultivate to some extent and though they can boast of no extensive forest yet you may occasionally meet with a old friend in the way of a noble elm or the pensive weep willow the culture of fruit tree also be receive much attention of later year and as widely as refinement must be separate from the islander to be in keep with you view they love for the sweet spring flower know no bound in you walk of curiosity about town you meet with a great many of the denomination term friend or quaker and as you pass they you can not refrain from give they the inside walk for they very garb be of humility and as you look into the placid face of some matron you feel like uncover yourself for you can see the innocence look out of she eye you be curious to know whither so many be wend they way and meet a sailor-boy he tell you it be fifth day and if you follow in the wake of the slick bonnet they will pilot you to they nearest light-house but precious little light you will get unless the spirit move some of they to pick up the wick you move on with the rest till you come to they house of worship which appear as humble as those who enter its door as you contrast the plainness on all side with the richly decorate edifice in which you have be accustom to worship you try to smile a smile of contempt at the scene but can not for you feel that the spirit of christ be in they midst and though not a word be speak during the hour and a half yet you feel that the silent worship which go up to heaven be hear by he who answer prayer as a signal for disperse the elder who occupy the rise seat arise and shake hand and you go you way with those silent one feel that they worship be acceptable to god the quaker of nantucket be rapidly diminish in number formerly two-third perhaps of the population be of the society of friend but now not one-third be of that denomination as they child come up they be not true to the faith as be they father and they put off the plain garb for the fashion of the day a quaker in nantucket will in time come to be a great curiosity they place will we fear be fill by none more upright heaven bless they nantucket of the present be not nantucket of the past she quaint old-timeness have give place to custom and manners more in accordance with thing common-place yet she originality have not entirely forsake she she have a character even now peculiar to herself the wild wave come tumble in they glad shout ring through the midnight stillness with the same zest as of yore and the same starry sky which look down on the fair maiden of a century ago still bend over she child 's child as they tread along life 's rugged way occasionally you may meet with one who have long since pass the meridian of life one perhaps who have never be off of the island of he birth and he will tell you of the nantucket of the past before she peaceful shore have be invade by the stranger when they might lay they down to sleep without thought of bolt or bar save old ocean 's faithful band you will learn of nantucket from the begin down to the present time then the island be big with prosperity she son be not oblige to leave they home for a five year ' voyage in search of the monster from which they gain they chief maintenance for there be then good fishing grounds near the shore and often the whale might be see from they little island spout off in the distance and they ship come proudly bear down to the bar laden heavily with the good sperm oil and all heart be make lighter and each purse heavier with every new arrival of good fortune as if they have be one great family each one smile on another 's prosperity but now -- and the face of the narrator be less joyous as he turn from _ then _ to _ now _ -- thing be not what they be we island be become like what they tell I the world at large be and the old man will re-light he pipe and with a sad smile he will give you the name of he ancestor from he great grand - ` ther down to more modern time when he fifth cousin obe be a large ship-owner ah treat such of other day with kindness for the style of that day will never come again they great heart of brotherly love be not of this generation yet they

the eye can reach water blue rolling water tinge with rise sunlight in its morning purity the night-bird fold she wing which she have lave in the white sea-foam soften the sigh of the breaker to the ear of those who slumber the white sail bow they head while the old tar wonder what make they so happy with these pleasant sunrise impression you go forth into the day with more lenient view towards the land of whale sniff the salt air with a real gusto glance up the street you descry a object in the distance which much resemble a travel dry-goods merchant with the many fancy streamer fly in the breeze but as it draw nearer you look around in astonishment for barnum fully persuade if that worthy be not on the ground he have mistake he call for once the object in question be no less than a common two-wheeled horse-cart such as be use to do we heavy cart except this be on spring and of a lighter build in the vehicle be some half dozen lady stand they only support be short rope attach to

mr grosvenor have earnestly hope that she husband would follow the sea no more know that they means be sufficient to supply all they want and since god in he providence have consign this little one to they care she have congratulate herself that there be one more tie to bind she husband to he home and indeed the child be as dear to he as if she have be he own flesh and blood and as those last seven year upon shore stand up before he now that he be about to leave all that be dear to he as have be spend more in keep with god 's law than in any previous part of he life he feel that he be a better man naturally of a noble generous disposition he have gain the respect of all who know he pleasant and gentlemanly in he manners he be no less firm in he duty on shipboard and he stern word of command be receive by he man with the same hearty aye aye as when he crack a joke with they over the club-room fire harry have keep he promise in regard to he wish to go with he father and when he look into he mother 's face and see how mournful be she smile he feel that it would indeed be cruel to think of leave she but when he hear the sailor say as he clamber up the rig that it be a pity such a sprightly little fellow could not go along with they he desire to ship for the voyage know no bound and seek he father in the cabin he have a long interview with he gain the promise that when he should return he would secure for he a good lay and that he might then commence the nautical career which the captain plainly see he inclination have mark out the day have arrive when the ship would sail every thing have be make ready for a long voyage should the captain not meet with he usual good fortune which be consider unnecessary by she owner so sanguine be they of she success such implicit faith do they place in the ability of she captain that in secure he service they look upon the voyage as tell ah who can tell if that proud ship may ever return be there not one who look upon she thus within that happy home now so desolate sit the wife of he who have just take he leave of she and the bitterness of that hour who can tell she only who have taste the same cup of sorrow she who have give to the mercy of the deep he whom she hold most dear on earth such a one can indeed realize what be the feeling of that wife as she sit at the window she eye fix upon the ship which be bear away he whom she might never see more the white sail be smaller and smaller until it appear but a speck and be finally lose in the distance and then what a sense of desolation oh might we all seek for strength in time of trouble of he who will not turn a deaf ear to the cry of he child who have say as thy day so shall thy strength be would that all might seek for comfort in the hour of trial as do that stricken one -- in prayer the sea-flower have with harry accompany she father in the ship as she be tow out by the steamer over the bar as they be about to cast off when the steamer should return

inanimate canvas as if it be indeed he dear mother and sister he tear himself away from home walk rapidly down the desert street without venture a look back he pass many a endear object the old white church where he have be accustom to worship Sunday after Sunday for many year hold high its head in the bright moonlight and the hand of the old town clock upon the tower seem to beckon he to return he falter it would seem as if the very door of the church would open and receive he throw down the bundle he kneel upon the door-stone and breathe a prayer to heaven to bless those who will enter therein when he shall be go press he lip to the cold stone where _ they _ have tread he rise when lo standing by he side with the package of clothes in he mouth be the old house dog nep and as the watch in the tower cry past eleven o'clock and all be well he look wistfully into he master 's face as if he would ask be all well what be to be do in less than half a hour the ship will be tow out into the stream there be no time to be lose but the dog will not think of leave he master for he experience of year tell he it be a new thing for the boy to be wander from home at this unseasonable hour in vain do harry attempt to drive the faithful creature from he for never have be a unwelcome companion before the dog do not understand he master 's threatening gesture yet he could understand that something be amiss and for that reason keep close upon he master 's heel to shield he from all danger arrive at the wharf the boy once more attempt to drive the dog from he when look around he espy a bit of rope with which he make he fast to a post and then clamber up the ship 's side poor nep keep he eye upon he master lay he quietly down until the line be cast off and the ship begin to recede from the shore o harry could you leave the companion of you infancy thus make fast to a yard rope to shiver in the night air it be he only alternative for in take neptune with he he well know would be rob the household of one more endearment no sooner have the ship start from she mooring and nep see that he master be be bear away than he give a piteous howl and with one bind part the line which hold he and plunge into the tide make vigorous attempt to reach the ship breaker on the larboard bow sing out the captain who stand laugh to see the labor of the poor animal who be become exhaust let 's see who 'll have the first harpoon and he hurl a billet at the dog 's head as he be go down for the second time harry see the action cry out save he who will save my poor nep and fall faint upon the deck fortunately the hard-hearted man have miss he mark for once and by the light of the moon the poor fellow be see just under the bow struggle feebly as if about to give up when a old tar who have hear harry 's cry for help spring with the rapidity of thought and seize a rope make it into a slip-noose throw it over the dog 's head nearly strangle he as he draw he out of the water together they lay motionless upon the deck harry and nep when the captain come along would have stumble over they have he not catch at a halliard near by what in the name of thing unheard of be all this exclaim he with a oath this indeed be a curious beginning for the little land-lubber i have the greatest mind to set he ashore to come to he sens at he leisure and if i be not greatly mistaken he be but a young runaway at best but we might as well keep he now he 'll do for test the strength of we cat and as for that other critter mr sampson you may hand he over to the steward and tell he i shall want a nice over-all when we get out where the ice make a inch a minute mr sampson who have ship as boat-steerer the same that have rescue old nep from drown lift harry in he arm and carry he below lay he in he own hammock where he also bring the dog who be apparently lifeless and lay he by he side it be a long time before harry be restore to consciousness and when he have gain strength sufficient to raise himself upon one arm he look around in the darkness perfectly bewildered but as the remembrance of he situation slowly come to he he call aloud in agony of spirit nep poor drowned neptune toss upon he hammock he arm come in contact with the creature 's shaggy coat could it be nep rescue from the inhuman treatment of the captain but he do not move be he alive harry spring from he bed and make he way in the darkness he know not whither finally find himself in the captain 's state-room which be unoccupied and seize a candle reach he hammock just as mr sampson return man alive where do you get that light ask sampson apparently much terrify o sir i take the first one i could find for i must see if my poor neptune be dead and he bent over he smooth he head call loudly neptune poor neptune sampson recognize the silver candlestick as belong in the captain 's state-room hasten to return it know well what the consequence would be if that dignitary discover that any one have dare to enter he room without order and give harry a few friendly hint as to what he liberty would be under they commander he draw out a mysterious look bottle from he jacket-sleeve and dilute a small quantity of its contents give it to harry to drink which in he weak condition do not come amiss turn to the dog the kind old tar commence rub he vigorously bathing he cold limb with the spirit glancing occasionally at the gangway to see who might darken the descent the dog at last give sign of life and to harry 's great joy he look up and recognize he master sampson assure he in he rough way that the old fellow would soon be as good as new it be the last watch in the morning and harry hearing loud voice on deck venture out it be a clear cold morning the moon have go down and venus be just rise in the east on every side be the blue rolling water they have leave nantucket mile behind sampson who be on duty see the boy look out as if he have come to the conclusion that the island have be submerge shake out a reef in the line which he be make fast that he might catch the boy 's ear and point to a dim light far down in the distant horizon he remark look well it be old sankoty i be think you 'll have see different day when you make she again halloo there aft call out the captain have that kitten get to mewing bear a hand there and square you mizzen topsail add he a tone of mockery the order have hardly leave he lip when harry with a hearty aye aye sir spring into the cross-tree and in a twinkling have reach the masthead call out in a voice which bring to the mind of each old tar that he have once a mother -- square away it be sir the captain could scarce believe he eye see by the smile upon the face of every man on deck that he have be decidedly sell he hail he again mast-head ahoy aye aye sir take you bearing from the fog bank to you leeward and tell I how she head the boy hesitate he see which way the wind blow and bethink himself of a small pocket compass which he have about he sing out east-south-east by east sir two point off the man at the wheel respond east-south-east by east two point off it would not do the captain see that he have mistake he man and call all hand to pipe down as mr sampson pass he he doff he tarpaulin remark i think sir the youngster will do very well for try the strength of we cat it be evident to harry before he have sail many day under captain jostler that he have one of the most tyrannical of master he have be a perfect stranger to he when he ship for the voyage be a native of canada and from the frozen condition of he heart no one would have doubt it have he be a nantucket man master harry would have find it more difficult in get away so privately as it be no inquiry be make of he how different be harry 's situation from what it would have be have he father procure for he a berth as it be he be doom to no common hardship for the captain have take a dislike to he from the first seem to take pleasure in make he as uncomfortable as possible and have it not be that he be a favorite with the crew he would have suffer many time from exposure many a cold stormy night have he be order to take he turn in the watch upon deck in spite of the petition of the man to fill he place and he would walk the deck for hour to keep from become benumb with the cold but as he mother have predict the hardship and danger to which he be expose do not serve to dampen he spirit and for that very reason do the captain shower upon he many abuse for in spite of he cruel treatment toward he he never have have the pleasure of see he look anything but cheerful at such time when the wind be howl fiercely and the salt spray come dash over the deck freezing upon the cheek of the youthful mariner but never penetrate that heart which be warm by the remembrance of other day the boy would think of home of he mother and as he utter the name of the sea-flower aloud those deep-toned voice of the sea would appear as if the wild rechoings of the tone and the low moaning of the wind through the shroud be of pity for that lone one on the deck of the outward bind could the boy have have old nep for a companion in he midnight watching he would have serve to while away the time but that pleasure be not allow he for captain jostler have threaten to throw the dog overboard if he come in contact with he in any of he walk consequently harry have doom he to a life in the hold seldom venture to visit he except to carry the food which he have save from he own short allowance and he often wonder how the poor fellow could keep alive on such short ration not know of the purloined bit which be bestow upon he from sampson 's commodious jacket-sleeve there she blow there she blow hail the look-out from the mast-head as a school of whale heave in sight about three mile astern one afternoon when they have be four month on the whaling grounds it be the first discovery that have be make they have be thus far unsuccessful all hand be immediately call up every man be at he post make ready for the coming scene of action not as a man-of-war in the charging of cannon the priming of musketry and the brandishing of sword a battle between man and man but the boat be lower the harpoon be get out and everything be make ready for a encounter with the monster of the ocean now be the time when the captain would exhibit he skill as a whaler all depend on he management as to they success he must be cool and collect work systematically for not only do it require great skill and caution in the capture of the whale but there be many danger attendant upon the encounter there she blow no sooner do captain jostler hear the report than it seem as if he would go beside himself every man be ready to do he duty and have they possess the right kind of commander might have do well but where there be no head nothing be accomplish everything be confusion the captain spring into the first boat bid he man follow leave beside harry but two worthless fellow who hardly know a skysail from a jib-sheet in charge of the ship harry keep he eye upon the boat for hour he perceive they be evidently have a hard time of it run aft to get a glass as they distance he he discover a fog have spring up and be shut in heavily on all side he return to mark the boat they be nowhere to be see he have lose they entirely nothing be to be see on all side but thick fog bank what be to be do where they be how far from the boat and in what direction they know not the boy be aware that they be all ignorant of the management of the ship and what be worse should the least breeze spring up they would be bear -- they know not whither a couple of hour pass and the fog do not lift night be come on and from the increase darkness together with a low rumble noise of the sea it be evident a storm be brew harry anxiously walk the quarter deck it would be certain destruction if they remain in that position till night should overtake they the boy call to the man ask what be to be do but they in terror could do nothing but lament they situation call out against the captain for leave they in such a state harry hesitate what be do must be do speedily to take in sail be he first thought then with the assistance of the clumsy seaman he roll out a small cannon-piece and for one long hour do he keep up a incessant fire the come storm be now plainly discernible the distant rolling of thunder be hear the sea be agitate and occasionally a flaw would shake the rattling they be in momentary expectation that the storm would burst upon they harry have leave he firing and ascend the hurricane deck stand with fold arm as if brace himself to meet the foe it be come in all its fury kind heaven the fog lift it roll itself away as it be a great scroll the ink-black heaven be fearfully majestic see in the lightning 's lurid glare a speck yes ' t be the boat do they see they once more the boy fly to the cannon not pause to see if they be near the ship he heart beat wildly ` tis they only chance for life the hurricane have burst upon they the enraged deep respond loudly to the deafening roar once again the feeble voice of the cannon be do its best to be hear when lo the flash mingle with the fork lightning which play in the rigging reveal the man as they come tumble over the ship 's side they be save save by that noble boy who do not know of they approach so intent be he upon he exertion until sampson clasp he in he arm and a god bless you be upon the lip of every man save the captain who have receive a slight wound from a harpoon and irritated by they bad luck utter a curse which vie in blackness with that dreadful night down you helm shout the captain hard down you helm the order be hardly give when they be throw on they beam end down down they go as if never to rise again completely engulf in the dark abyss the boy where be he down in the hold he arm make fast to the collar of old neptune that they may go down together he kneel he mother 's gift the bible in he hand calmly await he time nature seem terrify yet that boy know no fear crash succeed crash ah who can describe the scene he alone who have stand upon the frail plank which only separate he from death again a terrific crash -- they mast have go by the board it would seem that the enraged billow be bent upon they destruction still they stout bark be unwilling to give up and tremble from stem to stern she cling to life nobly resist the gigantic attack of the storm-king who have fight with terrific fierceness through the livelong night put on a less demon-like expression as he strength be well nigh spend and the gray dawn see no trace of the despoiler who perhaps have slay thousand save the swell surge which angrily gaze as if disappoint of they prey at the first dawn of day harry go on deck to learn they situation what a change have be work in a few hour they mast have be carry away the deck have be sweep clean and he learn that several poor fellow have lose they hold and be not see more well i 'll be d -- d if that son of a cannibal have not sneak away into some hole and keep he footing exclaim the captain as he see the boy appear above deck i be in hope he have find safe quarter in davy jone 's locker but there be no get rid of such scalawag captain jostler cry mr sampson raise he hat it be none of my business and you may knock I down the next minute if you please but god know there be not a man aboard but owe he life to that boy i have no mutinous design sir but at such a moment as this i will speak sir come what will and thank god the boy have sense enough to go below when he know he could be of no use here the captain look dagger he be about to seize sampson by the throat when a voice from the assemble crew be hear : three cheer and long life to the boy captain or no captain _ hurrah _ hurrah hurrah shout the grateful tar make the welkin ring if jostler have have the heart of a brave noble sea-captain he would have fight right and leave till the last ere he man should dare to show such insubordination set he authority at defiance but he be a coward and they be whole-hearted seaman who would not see the innocent trample upon consequently the villain have to swallow he wrath but he be determine to have he revenge and sampson notice that he cast a evil eye upon the boy upon examination it be find they have sustain no injury besides the loss of the mast except that a small leakage have be make near the bow and that be soon repair by the carpenter who proceed to rig jury-mast and it be not long before they be put in a condition capable of run into the island for repair about sunrise signal of distress be hear and by the glass a dismasted ship be make out a long way astern apparently in a sink condition the captain appear to take little notice of she and as the mate venture to inquire if they should ` bout ship he answer thunder no we be safe let they run they own chance harry hear he reply be shock could the man turn a deaf ear to those repeat sound of distress when it be in he power to save they ah boy it be even so but he be not a man harry could endure the thought no longer as fainter and fainter grow the report as they bear away from they he beg sampson to implore the captain to return sampson tell he it be of no use that it would not do to cross he again then i will go myself to he he can not have the heart to leave they to perish rash boy you life will be the penalty you must not do it i will do my duty though i should die for it there be the least possibility of he hearing I and what be one life compare with it may be a hundred stay mad boy cry sampson but he have go reach the quarter-deck upon he knee he implore the captain to return think if it be you father brother or a son in that hopeless condition would you not render they all the assistance in you power i have three brother and a father upon the ocean vociferate the demon for aught i know it may be one of they but be they all aboard that hulk yonder i would not return but who be you sirrah that dare to usurp my power now upstart you shall know you place and he seize he by the collar bear he aft lash he to a spar call for the cat and lift it high in air -- it fall but the cursed invention of man 's cruelty fall wide of its mark ere its descent have scar that fair brow a rush be hear from the main gangway and old neptune with a fierce growl have fasten he tooth in the monster 's flesh quick as think he master call he off and every man stand tremble as they observe the captain feeling for he pistol but he strength fail he the dog have meet he tooth in the wound receive by the mismanagement of the harpoon tear the flesh nearly from off he limb it really be a pitiable sight to behold faint from the loss of blood he be carry below where he wound be dress by one of the man have no regular surgeon aboard consequently its fatality be not realize the groan and writhing of the sufferer be heart-rending all day long do he rave implore sampson who attend he to take the fiend away that he be be devour alive and thus do he toss upon he bed till toward evening when a change for the worse come over he sampson saw that the seal of death be stamp upon he feature and at set of sun with a imprecation upon he die lip he have breathe he last o how fearful to enter that spirit land thus unprepared to come before we judge with a soul stain in the deepest sin tremble with its burden of guilt lord grant that we be not thus

shine object float near they he draw it from the water it be a block of wood in the form of a octagon highly polished inlay with bit of pearl form grotesque figure and thickly stud with some bright mineral represent star which give it a very handsome appearance well if the youngster be not pick up moonshine remark sampson examine the curiosity some poor fellow design that for he sweetheart likely but i suppose it will make but little difference with she if she hear he be among the miss she can just as well set she color for another these bright-winged butterfly go upon the principle that ` there be as good fish in the sea as ever be catch ' o ho sampson cry the jolly face mate who have now take the captain 's berth you be incline to give the fair one no quarter i should not

spect he know anyte ` bout poor black man day and month pass on as the lonely day of sorrow do come and go and come again but as the lengthen shades of the summer solstice have again become less another cloud have arise in the firmament of mingled joy and sorrow threaten to encompass even the bright ray of hope within its gloom mr grosvenor have write she husband of the conduct of they truant son as harry have wish and have in reply receive he full forgiveness for the boy captain grosvenor have write that he much regret not have take harry along with he for say he a second thought would have convince I that the boy have too much of the spirit of he father to remain contentedly on shore he have but follow in my footstep for i never shall forget the night i steal away from my father 's house when i be but ten year old and go to sea yes tell my boy that i forgive he yet it annoy I very much that you and we dear natalie be leave alone my wife but at the rate we have be do it will not be long before we shall be homeward bind nearly a twelvemonth have pass since this letter have be receive not a word have be hear of the tantalizer for a long time several ship have return which have leave since she have sail but they have bring no tiding of she over a year have pass since she be last report and she owner begin to look doubtful in regard to she fate and there be rumor that the tantalizer be count among the miss vessel yet no one dare to breathe the thought to the still hope family while there be the least possibility that she might be hear from again and who would wish to be the first to pronounce that gentle wife a widow darker and still deeper grow the overshadow cloud and the hope of the trust one less mrs grosvenor would sit for whole day brood over she sorrow cling to the last ray of hope with almost the insanity of hope but the last spark finally go out never again to be rekindle the untiring wheel of time still go they round and everything move on as if there be no heart beat in discordant measure to the joyous song of nature sympathize friend pity the afflict and the world read -- a noble ship lose at sea all on board suppose to have perish ship and cargo value at thirty thousand dollar no insurance and they exclaim -- ah the sailor 's life be indeed hard but they dwell upon the latter clause of the paragraph with as much real pity the word fall upon they ear convey as much of real sadness to they mind as that many family have be call to mourn the loss of one of they member the sea-flower could hardly become reconcile to the thought that she would never see she father more yet for she mother 's sake she suppress she grief endeavor to soothe she weary spirit by those refreshing promise of he who dry the mourner 's tear -- bind up the wound of the broken-hearted dear mother we be call upon to bear a heavy trial this be indeed a bitter bitter draught yet we must not forget ` tis we father hold the cup you have teach I to smile upon he chastening rod but in this dark hour of trial truly the flesh be weak yet we will rest upon the strength of he arm he will not forsake we and mother he way indeed be higher than we way how tenderly have he deal with we inasmuch as he have so order that we dear harry should be spare to we for as i look upon the past i can see nothing but the kindly interference of he will that my brother do not share the same grave with he father my darling you precious word shed light over my weary pathway i fear that i have sin in thus murmur at god 's will for i would not see he loving kindness in spare to I my boy but it be so very hard -- so dreadful -- that in that hour when he spirit wing its way to that better land we might not pause from we worldly pursuit turn we eye heavenward craving strength to bear we cross but you word of love my child remind I of that be who be the fountain-head of loveliness and i thank god for he gift of you if i be a comfort to you mother it be through you influence for you have teach I to walk in the path of virtue true i have point out to you the way of righteousness but when you look upon that bright river of life i observe that its water be no less tranquil and mirror upon its bosom be one more shine star and it have be increase in magnitude till now its radiance illume even the bright river itself so do the sea-flower gather together the broken thread of this family weave they closer with that golden thread of tender remembrance of he who have go to await they for a little in that happier home above this family of which she have never the slightest suspicion but that they be of she own flesh and blood and as she sit with she hand clasp within that of she mother 's reading from that bless book come unto I all ye that be weary mr grosvenor could not but notice the striking resemblance which she bear to those lovely feature of the miniature which be find within the golden band the child be grow to resemble she unknown mother and be there any who have ever know the parent to see they child they could not but have discover she descent as the thought come to mr grosvenor 's mind she shudder and she ask herself if it could ever be that she darling should be tear from she if another cloud would arise hide one more cherish one from she sight but why should she tremble at the thought she well know there could be nothing not even the discovery of relative which could lessen she daughter 's love for she mother not a word have ever be say to the child in regard to she mysterious parentage captain grosvenor have think it best not to reveal the fact until she should have become of a suitable age to fully realize she situation those who have know the circumstance of she discovery have gradually come to look upon she as the child of those who treasured she as if she have be they own and the playmate of she childhood day have never mistrust there be a mystery hang about she romantic name -- sea-flower harry indeed have never forget he delight at have a new sister and as they have grow up together he have often look into she dreamy eye and think how unlike she be to any one else she be too good to be my sister and as the reality come to he he have banish the remembrance ere it have take to itself a form the original vingo have never lose sight of that commentful day as he term it not a day pass but he make some allusion to dat wee gem among de sea-weeds and the sea-flower would open wide she eye as from he wild laugh she catch he broken sentence and would wonder why the negro 's word should meet with such a response within she own bosom the child 's dress together with the ornament which have be find upon she have be lay carefully away reserve until she should have become familiar with she history but mr grosvenor since the loss of she husband have weigh the question in she mind whether she should still keep the secret from she for the child 's mind be much beyond she year and she question whether it would be for the best to permit she to grow to maturer year thus undeceived but she reflect that such have be the design of she husband and therefore for the present the subject be dismiss from she mind it be the close of the third year in which harry have be from home mr grosvenor have receive four letter from he in that time he last have state they be do well that he be under one of the kindest of captain and all that be want to make he perfectly happy be to see he dear mother and the rest of the family once more poor boy he little think that there be one of its member whom he would never see again until he have pass over that sea from which no navigator ever return harry have never write he mother of the brutal treatment which he have receive from he first captain but he have say that neptune have be the means of save he life and that the old fellow be get to be quite a sailor inasmuch as he could take a turn on the quarter-deck with as much dignity as the captain himself it have be some time since harry 's last letter have be receive and now mr grosvenor be anxiously look for news from he with a state of mind prepare for receive almost anything so fraught with sad event have be the last few year when one day vingo be see far down the street coax he time-wearied limb into a run and burst into the room he stand panting in the middle of the floor grin with delight and hold at arm 's length a letter which mr grosvenor recognize as come from she son the sea-flower read the letter aloud and when vingo learn that massa harry be homeward bind he could contain himself no longer it seem as if he would go beside himself at the thought of have he young massa home once more for everything have appear so different since he go away there have be so many change that the fellow have really have he fear that it might be he turn next to be take off and he have often have vision of he old slave massa in nearer proximity than be at all consistent with he idea of liberty de good lord be praise exclaim the negro as sea-flower cease reading di be too good news for old black man live I but i know de bright sunshine not be contented to stay away from missy sea-flower long i tinks missy get along better widout he dan he can widout she but dar be some poor soul dat neber see de shine make dem feel as full ob sing as a camp-meeting and the negro give a deep sigh at the remembrance of he poor old philli who be for aught he know still wear the accursed yoke of slavery poor thing poor thing sigh the sea-flower i would willingly share with they my joy be it in my power theirs would be a lighter burden to those who have learn of that glorious home where the resplendent shine of its bright one be forever but they alas have no bright future to look forward to give they renewed strength to bear they cross or if they ever hear of that all-father who hear the cry of the most wretched of he child they master would have they believe that he be but

I believe that you would make the light of some sweet-heart 's eye outshine even old sankoty itself three year ago do you remember it sampson when i be a mere striple you take I aside and point out a dim light away down to the water 's edge and tell I i would have see different day before i make it again do you think i can ever forget it i could tell its light from among a thousand as i catch its

tinge of red light up the eastern sky nobly the good ship nautilus bear down to the bar set heavily on the water and the good twenty-five hundred with which she be laden be no less weighty than the handful of silver which dance o'er the mind of the glad sailor boy as they near they native shore none be more light-hearted at the prospect before they than harry grosvenor not that he have become weary of the sailor 's life for he love the ocean with the same free wild love as when three year before it have beckon he boyish heart to brave its peril but he joy as the endeared object of he home

circumstance by which he have come in possession of the curiosity and from the present of silk crape fruit etc which he have bring to the sea-flower she turn to the mysterious little curiosity with a greater interest examine the grotesque figure with a fascination when accidentally press a pearl set the box -lrb- for such it be discover to be -rrb- fly open and reveal to she bewildered gaze --

heart but those tear be not of mourning for the depart for through she who be make but a little lower than the angel those tear have be turn into joy the child who have ever walk in that narrow way as if it be the only path in which the child of earth might tread have teach she bereaved mother that those precious word from the book of life which she have ever recognize but have not strength to cling thereto in the hour of trial be truly christ 's word of tenderness she could now smile upon the chastening rod those die word as it be of he who have go be as balm to the heart of mr grosvenor and the sea-flower for what could be more dreadful than that they should never learn of he last moment but to harry who have be just upon the point of ask for he father it be as the dark funeral pall to he soul and he stagger to a chair where be my father he ask in a hollow voice in heaven be the response of the sea-flower there be silence in that house sorrow which have reign for a time around that hearthstone still linger strive to supersede the joy which must go hand in hand with purity but its icy touch be to be of gentler mien its cold cold breath mingle with that of more genial sphere help to swell the -- father thy will be do this be a dreadful announcement to harry a stroke which he be not prepare to receive and now do the past come to he remembrance with sickening frenzy that terrific night -- he have at the peril of he life implore that heartless be to listen to the stranger 's cry of distress to stretch out to he the hand of brotherly love and that cry for help be now sound in he ear with renew freshness for it be from he own loved father oh what a undutiful son i have be cry harry have i know then what i know now and yet the fiend would not have turn a hand have it be he own father thank god i have he forgiveness for disobey he last command ' t be the one great lesson of my life and should i live a hundred year i will never deviate from what i think would have be my parent 's wish natalie -- the sea-flower gaze upon that name the name of she father 's choice -- a simple word but oh what volume do it speak there seem to be a very sacredness hang about the tone as time speed onward leave far behind the past but not bury it the sweet child-like sea-flower be gradually put on the gentle mystic form of natalie and though the name have become familiar to other ear to she its impress be as when she reverently look upon that cross of christ at the foot of which be trace that which she could not but associate therewith the depth of she dreamy eye speak not only of he who have leave they but they tell of the soul 's instinct in regard to that which be as yet unrevealed well massa i tinks de sun make up he mind to take a look out at we once more remark vingo as seat astride a wood-horse he be make vigorous exertion to take the nautical expression from he young master 's boot then you have have rather a dark time of it at home here have you vingo have be rather lonely yes ` deed it have massa harry i ` fraid sometimes dat i lose my self-complexion entirely and i tinks you not find so much ob I leave if it not for missy 's bright light dat shine along de way dare not anoder like she massa but i dunno as dat 's strange for de star not come down to bathe in de ocean ebery day you be get sentimental vingo and a expression of thought steal over harry 's feature and he remain silent for he could not bring himself to disclose even to vingo he knowledge of the mystery in regard to the fair creature who call he brother he could not bear to think that she be not he sister and yet have he memory not serve he thus he must have observe how unlike she be to any member of the family mother you have look very thoughtful for the last few day i hope that now we be together once more there be nothing to disturb you happiness remark harry as the two sit together on the little promenade ground in front of the house enjoy the beautiful sunset of a summer 's evening there be nothing which make I unhappy now for although ` we know not what a day may bring forth ' yet i have learn to smile under the most try dispensation of providence know that he way be higher than we way but and she voice be hush almost to a whisper there have be something upon my mind of late of which i would make you a confidant my son there be a pause -- well do harry judge of what he mother would speak and look into she face he say -- natalie -- she be not my sister by birth yet i shall ever claim she as such and i know should she learn that she be of other parentage to-morrow she would cling to you mother as she dearest earthly friend and for that reason i know she be of noble birth but tell I harry can it be that you who be but a child remember the circumstance yes mother i can well remember the infant with the gold band and the pretty white dress all wet with salt water then be my first idea of innocency she have prove a rich blessing to we and i do not feel that i can ever part with she but i have be think it be selfish indeed in keep she with we to deprive she of those advantage which would fit she for fill the station which i can plainly see belong to she not but that she might finish she education at home for we island can rank among the first in she system of education and there be many of we citizen who be recognize by we most literary friend of the continent as among the first in the art and science but i think it would be greatly to she advantage to see more of the world and my purpose be to accept the urgent request of a dear friend reside in boston that my daughter should spend some time in she family where she may receive the same excellent instruction with she own child we means have be for the last year or two somewhat curtail yet as long as we have enough to be comfortable we will share with she what she most justly deserve yes mother give my portion to she i can take care of myself and you shall not want for anything so long as i can help you i do not know how we can let she go but it be for the best she will learn of this world and they will learn of another as the two have be speak they have not observe a light form recline under a flowering currant which only separate they from the object of they conversation it be a little arbor form by a clustering rise vie with the flowering currant in fragrance thither have the sea-flower repair and as the softest ray of a northern sky at sunset sink into she soul mingle with more mellow light than be of southern clime these word fall upon she ear -- natalie she be not my sister by birth she pause to hear no more for she know the conversation be not design for she and noiselessly glide from the spot she seek she own room the crescent moon come forth and behold the fair maiden gaze far out over the silver-edged billow she head rest upon she hand she golden tress fall gracefully over she shoulder while from the deep recess of she heart there spring up that which have ever be and yet be not and take to itself a form good morning natalie do i not know you retire early last night i should say you look a little unrefreshed where be the rose of yesterday they should not fade in a single night rose will fade mother and there be those which await the genial ray of light before they unfold reply sea-flower but i do not retire until quite late last evening for everything be so beautiful and glad that i love to look out upon the night and such beautiful thought come to my mind that i think i must have fall asleep and dream and yet i be awake for i be conscious of watch the water as it sparkle in the moonlight as the wave break upon the shore they seem to be strive one with another to see which should venture the nearest till at last there come one which lift its head high above the rest and as it recede i see there be leave upon the beach a tiny shine thing which resemble many drop of dew just then the light cloud separate and there look down a star _ so _ mild and presently there come another equally mild and the two finally blended into one still hover over the glitter one upon the beach at last there seem to be a stream of light connect one with the other i look again and the tiny thing which be leave of the wave have go to be with the brighter one beyond the cloud presently i look again and there be the three but they be change the first star which have appear seem now to be a lovely lady oh so gentle the second be yourself dear mother and the shine one which have go to they appear to be myself the gentle lady take we each by the hand and when i see she smile upon you so sweetly i begin to weep and the lady take I in she arm and wipe my tear away i be awaken from my revery by my sob for it all appear so real and my tear make I happier mr grosvenor listen to she child with astonishment it be a most striking dream indeed she remark but fear the sea-flower might notice she surprise she draw she arm about she and introduce the subject which for some time past have be uppermost in she mind what do you think of spend a little time away from home my dear how should you like to graduate with boston honor to learn the custom of city life i shall like it much if it be you wish that i should go mother but i know no life will be pleasanter than the happy day which we have spend here in we own quiet home perhaps you will not always think thus you may find greater joy in the attraction which be before you yet i trust my child you affection for you mother will be no less whatever you circumstance may be oh mother how can that be possible do not repeat the word how can it be that i shall ever love you less no my child it will not be i wrong you in speak such thought i can not bear to part with you even for a little time yet i will not gratify my desire at you loss and in give you to the care of my most estimable friend mr santon i shall feel that you be under the influence of one of the best of woman i shall love she for you sake but i know i shall miss the dear one at home so much the time come when the sea-flower should leave she home to learn what ' t be the world be make of and take a affectionate farewell of the family -lrb- the red bandana of vingo be count among the article of utility -rrb- she be bear lightly over the billow leave she island home far far behind chapter viii softly steal -- as the evening vesper bell and she be one on whom to fix my heart to sit beside I when my thought be sad and by she tender playfulness impart some of she pure joy to I percival patience and hope that keep the soul unruffled and serene though flood of grief beneath it roll i learn when calm and pure i see the float water-lily gleam amid shadow dark and chilly caroline may the sea-flower arrive at she new home in safety -- the home of we western friend the santon the continued ill-health of mr santon have be the chief cause of the return of the family to the east by a favorable turn of fortune mr santon have come into possession of nearly double the amount of he former wealth and he be now look upon as one of boston 's most prominent citizen the selling of western land which he have obtain for a mere trifle have be the chief source of revenue in build up he fortune the little winifred whom we leave make merry over the erin simplicity of biddy and patrick have grow to be a young miss of seventeen those black eye of hers which have attract the gaze of the tall western youth for the last time have in no way lose they brilliancy mischief still sit triumphant therein and not a day pass but some poor uninitiated be bring to test the merit of that gift miss winnie look upon this removal to more enlighten region as a change altogether for the best for how could such as she at that age which never come but once in a lifetime be content to feed on air _ a la prairie _ she have tire of look at the same half-dozen raw-boned gallant and have come to the grand final decision that she charm should not be waste thus and now that she be surround by those urbane solicitor which do mingle with those of more enlargement of brain in fashionable life they in turn begin to fear lest those charm might not prove for such as they mother ask winnie a few day before the arrival of the sea-flower who be this friend whom you have invite to visit we -- that be i mean to ask what be she like i have often hear you speak of you early friend mr grosvenor but you have never see she daughter and who know but she may be -- well i wont say but you know nantucket be but a isolate out-of-the-way place where fisherman live and the society in which she have move will probably unfit she for enjoy ours but she will be with we in a day or two so we shall have to make the best of it it be many year since i have see mr grosvenor we meet when we be both young married lady at the house of a friend of mine in new york where she be visit and i form a attachment for she then which have never abate we have keep ourselves inform of each other 's welfare from time to time and think that the daughter might possess the same amiable disposition as she mother i think that she presence in we family might be pleasant to we all besides gain for she under you teacher of music and the language a finished education as for society in nantucket i have never learn of what grade it be but judge from the appearance of the only person i have ever meet from there i do not consider they far behind the age well i hope i shall like she i be sure she have a sweet name -- natalie perhaps we shall like she after all but nantucket bring to my mind such vision of unrefined oil that i really begin to tremble lest we might come in closer contact therewith than would be at all agreeable mr santon receive the sea-flower with a mother 's tenderness but be weary with she journey natalie retire early to dream of those far low murmuring of the deep which she have so miss in lull she to rest i be so disappointed in she mother she be such a gentle delicate creature i know i shall love she and such spiritual eye do you notice when you ask about she mother what a sweet expression she wear she be a beautiful creature and if i mistake not she have a heart to match but she do not resemble she mother at all in feature i think captain grosvenor must have be a fine-looking man and mr santon wear a complacent look as she think of the favorable effect which they guest might have upon the mind of she daughter for owe to frequent ill-health mr santon have not be able to be with she child as much as she would have desire and she fear lest those early trait in she character of impatience and a proneness to censure other might grow upon she under the influence of she father who be blind to she every fault ah ha miss puss say mr santon who have receive a most favorable impression of the sea-flower you will have to look out for that fairy-like creature or even you bewitching charm will be cast in the shade and as he speak he proudly survey he idolize daughter who be indeed to be class among the first in the brunette style of beauty oh never fear for I father reply winnie take a satisfied survey of she full-length figure reflect in a pier-glass if boston forget winnie santon 's black eye she will be perfectly resign in gaze into the soul-speaking orb which shall usurp she power other day than those which have be spend in sweet seclusion on nantucket 's peaceful shore now dawn upon the sea-flower although not a day pass in which she do not sigh for one dear familiar tone from those she love so well for she mother 's fond embrace and the free glad laugh of brother harry yet she be happy excelling in those pursuit which seem to recognize she touch and she soft voice as it be of italian origin grow to be the sunshine of the house as biddy often declare it be a great saving of canary seed to have miss natalie about the house time glide on apace with the sea-flower as each day bring some new task call into activity some talent which have be lie in a dormant state await its time for expand she teacher of music a italian by birth and of great fame in he profession be in rapture with the progress of he two pupil and in the extraordinary talent display by the sea-flower be he perfectly amaze for not only be she voice of that soft mellow style peculiar to the italian people but she perform those piece which have but just be introduce to a american ear with all that impassioned tenderness peculiar to that nation i believe you be one of my people exclaim the signor after listen in breathless attention to a new piece which he have bring for she she echo tone die away and rise again with gentler pathos softly and with sweeter tone to fall again unconsciously she eye be fix upon the signor as he speak and she thought be carry back far away she know not whither they would take she but rouse from she reverie she merely reply -- i love the peculiar air of you nation it present such a striking contrast to we cold less pathetic style but do not exclude what winnie term ` the production of the genie 's more sensible moment ' from my list of favorite for as there be hour which be divide into sixty distinct part so there be division within the human heart which must live each upon its own native air natalie darling what be you talk with the signor about from the few word which i catch of the human heart etc i do not know but the presence of a third person might be agreeably dispense with and it be overtax the fringed lid of the mischievous winnie 's eye in add to they duty the office of sentinel ah you rogue have you critic 's ear be listen to my feeble endeavor to repay the signor for he untiring labor one can hear you music without listen for i be deep in thought of the time when i shall come out from under the tyrannical power of instructor and can do as i like for my part i be tire to death of this continual -- ` miss winifr this piece must be execute with milder intonation ' or ` miss winifr that chapter of spanish must be tell with greater fluency ' i have come to dread the very name of professor and i never can look out of the window but i see some pale-faced gentleman of the profession approach with he badge under he arm but those edifying idea all vanish at the first strain of you ` casta diva ' if i could produce such a effect what would i not give and the beauty draw she arm around the sea-flower and speak in a lower tone natalie you know i shall come out on my eighteenth birthday and that will be in a very short time then i can do as i like but how can i let all of these charming performance of the celebrated madam forrestus whose name be in every mouth pass without hear she i must say i be completely nonplussed when young montague ask I this morning what i thought of she and when i tell he i have not hear she as yet he be perfectly astonished and say i must hear she this very night but you do not accept of he invitation winnie how could i resist such a temptation i have be longing to hear madam forrestus and with mr montague for a escort i do not see the least impropriety in attend i need not trouble mother about it for she be so nervous to-day she will not leave she room and i do not think she can object to my go oh winnie how could you do so i know you mother would not wish you to appear in public with mr montague not but that he may be worthy of attention but he be the same as a stranger to we for you father have know he but a little while and i notice that you mother appear uneasy when he call last for he have make we frequent visit on so short a acquaintance you do not surely suppose that my father would introduce any one into he family who be not a fit associate for he daughter retort winnie she face flush with excitement no i do not think so but you would not go without consult you mother 's wish and why not mother will never be the wiser for it and i can not see that she can reasonably object besides be i always to be a child i must some time or other act for myself dear winnie do not talk so you have one of the best of mother and she will not deprive you of any pleasure unless it be for you own good but do not be displeased with I for speak my thought for i love you as a sister and can not bear to have you do anything that would not be right winnie be about to give way to those passion which a indulged child invariably possess and be naturally of a very sensitive nature she could not sit easy under those opinion from other which be in opposition to she own view and tremble with rage she turn to the sea-flower -- but the fire of she eye be subdue she tongue do not give utterance to the bitter cruel word which would have sound so strangely upon a ear that have never know such tone she give one look at the gentle submissive face of the sea-flower and burst into tear _ such _ tear from the high-spirited winnie santon be a strange sight she proud rebellious spirit have for once be conquer and what be not such a lesson worth o natalie she exclaim how i wish i could be like you i be just upon the point of say what i know i should have repent i be so glad you have come to be with we nothing more be say about go to hear madame forresti but when evening come winnie after leave a message with biddy for mr montague that she must be excuse seek she mother 's room where she find sea-flower who be read to the invalid and the rich tone of she voice convey far more happiness to she heart than would have be hers have she listen to the far-famed songstress with a conscience speaking of undutifulness natalie be read from the christian 's hope and as she read ever and anon cast she eye toward winnie who appear unusually thoughtful the nervous state however of mr santon would admit of but little excitement and as natalie close she book and rise to bid she good-night she observe that she look unusually happy and take she dear child by the hand she thank they tenderly for they devoted attention to she and draw close to winnie she whisper in she ear -- it be such a comfort to I dear that you prefer you mother 's sick room to more attractive society have she know of the struggle which have be go on in she daughter 's heart through the influence of the gentle one whom she look upon as a well-loved child she eye could hardly have be brighter than it be as she child press a kiss upon she forehead and say i shall always love best to be with you mother that night winnie retire with a determination to strive to overcome she sinful way and as she hear the voice of the sea-flower at she evening devotions -lrb- they room adjoining -rrb- she speak aloud i will try to be more like she with this resolve she fall asleep but as the rise sun peep in at she window there be to be find no trace of she evening resolution if any thing mischief look out upon the new day with renew earnestness and winnie santon be the same gay reckless creature as ever ah ha miss puss so you bow be new string again be it say mr santon to he daughter as the door close upon one of the mustached upper ten who frequently find they way to the elegant mansion of mr santon ` new string ' with a old string father if these exquisite be foolish enough to burn they finger a second time they must suffer the consequence mr santon laugh and merely say -- oh you cruel beauty return to he paper again but seat in the bay-window be one who could not thus lightly look upon the conduct of the coquettish winnie for it be evident she be a sad coquette often have natalie observe she as she receive each admirer with the same bewitching smile impress he with the belief that he of all other be the favor one and he would depart to return again as early as the rule of propriety would admit consider the fair one be not yet out natalie ask winnie as she seat herself at she embroidery why do you not deign to give mr redfield one of you win smile you be so reserved and take so little notice of the gentleman that i shall begin to think you charm be doom to fade beneath the convent veil i be not aware that i do not receive mr redfield with cordiality yes but the absence of that fascinating air which you know would bring the most unyielding to you foot be what i be lament have mr redfield be my only admirer i should have be jealous of the glance which he cast at you but i do not know as there would be any occasion for that for you whose heart be make for love seem to be in no danger at present of lose it i certainly respect the gentleman who visit we but as for have a preference for one more than another i have not and winnie dear just ask yourself if you ever give one think to any one of those who deceive themselves by think that they of all other be preeminent in you regard i must acknowledge that i do not give they a think after the door once close upon they poor deluded creature but do you think it right to deceive they thus natie darling if you be not the most romantic creature that ever be i should call you miss matter-of-fact but really i do not know as there be anything very criminal in help such people to open they eye they find out sooner or later that i be of the opinion -- there be as good fish in the sea as ever be catch the sea-flower say no more for she fear she word might be worse than useless but such be never idle word and though winnie appear to give they little heed yet many time afterward in the midst of she gaiety do she remember the sea-flower 's question -- be it right to deceive thus \* \* \* \* \* eighteen year old to-day mother just eighteen to-day shout winnie as she come into the breakfast room she cheek vie with the red of the rose how happy i be and cast a look of contempt at the hot roll and coffee as if such thing be hereafter to be class among the necessity of the past she go bound away to find she father open the door of the _ boudoir _ she pause arrange upon the table be she birthday gift and mr santon have spare no pain to make the collection as rare as possible in the center of the table be a set of diamond for the hair and as winnie clasp they about she dark tress she laugh outright exclaim -- they be so handsome papa i can not wait for night to come but what be this she ask draw from a case a string of pearl and hold they up to the light in the center of the collection be one curiously work pearl so form as to represent a star and the sparkling of several diamond from within produce a very brilliant effect examine it closely she discover the initial n g work upon the set it be for you natalie she exclaim to the sea-flower who stand enjoy winnie 's delight i thank you father for remember dear natalie be it for I ask natalie hesitate to receive the gift yes take it say mr santon put the treasure into she hand keep it as a memento of we high esteem for you and add he i for one shall petition after you have finish you study to have you remain with we another season that we may then have more of you society natalie express she sincere thanks but the mention of remain another season bring to she remembrance she mother 's last letter which speak of she return and how delighted they would all be to have she in they little home once more the long wished-for time when winnie should appear in public as the accomplished miss santon at length arrive several hundred card have be issue for the occasion and to winnie 's delight but few regret have be receive for say she what be the use of do thing by the half mr santon 's health have for the last few day be much improve so much so that winnie have gain from she the promise to fill she station for a part of the evening the brilliant light already stream from every window in the mansion and the finish touch -lrb- if such a thing can be say of a lady 's toilet -rrb- have be make by winnie 's attendant much to the satisfaction of all concern for although the beauty be willing to submit to all the torture of hair-dressing etc etc yet before she be quite convert into a parisian belle she positively declare she would suffer none of those official to come into she presence again for a month survey herself with a air which would have do credit to a queen she proceed to the sea-flower 's apartment think to banter she a little in she endeavor to make perfection perfect but instead of find she still in dishabille she have long ago dismiss she attendant and be quietly engage in read she bible before she engage in those scene of gaiety which have less attraction for she why you charming creature exclaim winnie i can not help compare you to a fairy prepare for a camp-meeting and she wild laugh be hear reecho from hall to hall natalie smile at she ludicrous comparison why do you look at I with such a bewildered gaze winnie be my simple dress not to you fastidious taste you could not have find anything more become natie dear you will eclipse we all and winnie take both she hand in hers gaze into she face as if spell-bound i have see some beautiful picture somewhere she exclaim which be like you but where i can not tell and yet when i look at you the association be so fresh in my mind yes you will be we evening star venus be morning star now say natalie glancing at the brilliant dress of winnie yet for all that she will favor we with she presence this evening as the two descend to the boudoir they be meet by mr santon who shut he eye exclaim -- bless I i have look upon the glorious morning in the beauty of its freshness and the gentle evening so pure but to see they approach hand in hand be too much for any ` live man ' escort the fair one to mr santon 's side he proudly gaze upon they dazzling beauty -- beauty in its perfection sit upon each countenance and yet such a contrast winnie be array in a rich attire of delicate blue she boddice work about with silver thread represent the light of the crescent moon she skirt interweave with numerous lesser light as it be star of various magnitude produce a splendid effect in the flood of gas-light and the set of diamond bind about she dark tress which fall in rich profusion about she finely arched neck set off she dark complexion she cheek roseate with health to great advantage and as she move among she guest she tall slender form so full of dignity she be the observe of all observer she winning smile so dangerous to those gallant in attendance who have never realize the true sense of coquetry be unusually fascinating and every one who have be honor by miss winnie 's notice pronounce she decidedly the belle of the season but as they turn to the gentle creature at she side they thought gradually assume a different cast -- unconsciously the mind wander to other scene than be usually of a fashionable evening entertainment it be absurd to call she a belle for the word seem void of expression the sea-flower wear a simple dress of white blonde with no

be to be derive from a princely fortune at the early age of twenty-two he have graduate at one of the first institution in pari where he have be place by he haughty overbearing father who look upon thing american as low and vulgar the son have not inherit that proud unyielding spirit of he father yet he be like he inasmuch as he possess the same dignified reserved manner the which have call forth the startling declaration from manoeuver mother and languish daughter that mr clarence delwood would look farther than boston for a bride so they have fold they gossamer wing with resignation receive he polite attention with pleasure yet never be able to penetrate the reserve which hang around he to say that we hero be handsome would be say but little for one often meet with such but with the almost feminine pensiveness which characterize he manly feature we meet seldom tall and commanding in he appearance he dark glossy hair and finely curved mustache give a fine effect to he noble

suffice it that there have be rumor of a old bachelor uncle who be much increase in this world 's goods whose tremble hand hold the desire treasure over the young man 's head and as this report have not be correct by montague he not be over-burdened with many scruple of conscience it be not surprising that there should have be those who look upon he as a desirable match for they dowerless

regard to she enchanting home which place he always have a great desire to visit the islander i suppose be mostly fisherman yet add he glance rudely into she face there be some person of intelligence among they be there not natalie look at he for a moment as if in doubt whether ignorance or some meaner motive have prompt the question when she remark you evidently have never learn of the great danger attendant upon a stranger 's visit to nantucket ah indeed i shall be under great obligation for the information say he he eye wide open with curiosity pray what be those danger the islander as you have imagine be so unlike the inhabitant of civilized land have such a natural propensity for wield the harpoon that should a person differ from they kind appear amongst they they might be liable to capture he mistake the object for a new species of land-shark at this piece of information deliver in such a calm pleasant manner the smile which have be visible on the face of those who listen grow into a hearty laugh in which the chagrined montague join as be the safest way of retreat and although pique by the ludicrous position in which he have be place he could not but look with admiration upon the gentle creature whose pleasant repartee have be in self-defence natalie follow with she eye the graceful form of winnie as she thread she way through the dance occasionally interchange a witty remark with she handsome partner and as he lead she to a seat natalie observe to mr santon how beautiful dear winnie be to-night i do not know who can help love she so enthusiastic be she in she praise that she have not observe the two contemplate she and ere she be aware of they approach the bewitching winnie have take she hand and present mr delwood she mischievously remark

look upon winnie with admiration as she have lean upon the arm of delwood but now as he lead forth the gentle star the suppress murmur of applause must have be apparent to the fair one herself have she not be engage with other thought for several successive figure it so happen that natalie be the partner of the reserved mr delwood who never be know to appear a second time upon the floor and it also happen how or at what moment be a mystery that the two have seek to dispel fatigue by the conservatory 's soothing influence whither the eye of winnie wander ever and anon as with mr montague she vie with she competitor in the giddy waltz miss winnie 's brain be capable of contain two thought at the same time and no one would have suspect absorb as she appear to be with the attention of montague who be play the agreeable to the best of he knowledge that she curiosity be at work wonder what the subject of the truant tte--tte might be they be discuss the rare exotic send to we from the south she think within herself and indeed what other could interest the cold-hearted delwood who it be think have never dream of love this side of the atlantic and as for natalie many a private lecture have she receive from winnie in regard to she indifference toward the gentleman though those discourse have be invariably of the same termination for all that natalie you heart be make for love from the first moment that clarence delwood have set he eye upon the sea-flower a interest which he have never know before have be awaken within he it may be say that it be a weakness that he have always look upon woman as mere butterfly but owe to early circumstance he have be bereft of he mother in infancy never have know the blessing of a sister 's society he be not to be condemn for the impression which a gaudily attire attendant have leave upon he mind as he grow up into boyhood but as he listen to the sea-flower as she tell he of she home in the sea of the music of the glorious billow companion of she childhood fill the very soul with nature 's beauty and sublimity he look upon she as if fearful she might prove a undine and he would not have be take by surprise have she spiritual face fade calmly from beneath he gaze to join she sister nymph of ocean and you will soon return to you island home he ask as a thought of the warmth with which she have express herself to a stranger bid she pause in she enthusiasm with downcast eye yes i shall soon return she answer joyously and yet i shall remember boston with feeling of pleasure for i have spend happy hour here as she say this they eye involuntarily meet a silent spectator would have note the contrast of the moisten blue to the deep black of sterner make but as it be that contrast be not discover each feel that the other be read the thought which have but then spring up within the soul natalie withdraw she gaze while delwood stoop to pluck a moss rose-bud from a urn at she foot place it within he diamond fastener and the two retrace they step to join they friend again montague be still at winnie 's side and though the unusual flush upon natalie 's cheek be a sad tell-tale of the state of affair yet she observe winnie as she listen with a ready ear to montague 's remark and a unpleasant feeling rise in she heart she could not bear to have she dear friend on such intimate term with he whom as by a natural instinct she shun all thing must have a end and the cheerful light which houseless one have watch as the bright beam fall across the pave one by one have fade formal adieus have be say kind wish interchange and the last sound of rumble wheel have die away excess of excitement bid the bloom winnie seek repose and quiet reign triumphant at santon mansion yet there be one who seem to have forget that the morning follow so close upon the evening the sea-flower have linger among the last to say adieu and now in she own apartment she have sink into a chair the delicate pearl still

be think of mr delwood have as yet receive no positive assurance that he unmistakable sentiment towards natalie be reciprocate and yet he be confident that she regard he with no common interest he have read it in she soul but he would hear from she own lip if happiness or misery be to be he through life and it be with a nervous step that he wend he way on this last evening of she stay in boston that he might hear he fate as he draw near the house he observe though early in the evening but one dim light gleam from a upper apartment and as he reach the gate it be fast and a porter stand within who to delwood 's hurry question if all be well as he throw he a gold-piece reply in a sad tone -- kind sir my order be to receive no one as my mistress be die or you should have admittance at once

calmness of manner he enter noiselessly he open the outer door proceed to the upper drawing-room which open to the room of the die one mr santon sit with he face bury in he hand sob aloud mr delwood take he tenderly by the hand and whisper a few word in he ear which seem to rouse he from the dreadful state of mind to which he have yield you find here a house of mourning he say but you presence be most welcome what can i do for you in this try hour ask delwood can i be of any assistance there be nothing to be do but to submit to the will of god he answer and i pray that i may have strength so to do the door of the chamber of death be open and the physician summon mr santon to he die wife 's bedside delwood stand in the door pale but not emaciate be the feature upon which death have set he seal she last moment be near but she have strength and consciousness support by the sea-flower to say a few parting word with one hand in that of she husband the other upon the head of she grief-stricken daughter she say : farewell my dearest husband it be but a little parting you will meet I there at last turn to the sea-flower with she hand still upon the head of she daughter she add my child will soon be motherless through you she be what i could wish to see she and when i be go will you never lose sight of she make she to be like yourself in a feeble voice she continue thank god

smooth she limb as for a night 's repose the father mingle he tear with those of he child who be all that be leave to he the sea-flower lean upon the arm of he who think it not unmanly to weep over the scene he have witness retired leave the afflict one to weep away the anguish in they heart ere they might look upon the loving kindness of he whose way be all perfect chapter ix behind the cloud the sun be shine i be arm with innocence less penetrable than the steel-ribbed coat that harness round thy warrior madden 's themistocle that one so form in mind and charm to grace the brightest scene of life should have she seat in the shadow of a cloud and yet ` tis weakness the angel watch the good and innocent and where they gaze it must be glorious mr bale 's ormond grosvenor my gentle reader will pardon the long stride of time which here intervene disclose nothing of those in whom we feel a interest nearly a year of moment have speed since that in which mr santon have pass away winnie have see she loved mother lay in that narrow silent house which be prepare for the dead and she tear have water the green grass which groweth so silently -- upspring everywhere even in the lonely place of burial a fit cover for those who slumber -- emblematical of the life beyond the tomb the joyous mirth which abode in winnie 's nature have supersede in a measure day of deep mourning yet this first taste of earth 's sorrow have leave a impress upon she mind never to be erase and though thoughtless one perhaps observe no change in she young elastic spirit there be one gentle and youthful who have be to she as a mother in she bereavement -- the sea-flower she could see that the death of a loved one have work a good work upon the heart of she friend as it may with we all if we will lie passive in the hand of the workman it be a disappointment to natalie that she intention of return home have be frustrated yet it be with cheerfulness that she resign she hope when she see that duty point out another way mr santon on the sudden death of he wife which occur on the very evening before natalie be to bid they farewell have himself write a very touching letter to mr grosvenor beg if it be not ask of she too much that she would spare she daughter to they a little while longer as it have be the last wish of mr santon that they daughter might be with she who have prove such a blessing to they all and so in pity for the dear one of she friend of whose death she be pained to learn mr grosvenor have consent to another year 's separation from she child though it be indeed ask of she a great sacrifice old vingo who have wonder if he young missy would take he by the hand as she use when he hear that another long year must pass before he would see she again cry like a child but no one be more disappointed than harry who have count the day for month when she would come home but he patience be not to be test thus he have visit he sister in boston and have receive so favorable a impression of city life or it may be that he have receive a more favorable impression of a certain pair of black eye which be constantly fix upon he when he have accidentally glance towards a certain young lady whom report say -lrb- mr montague be among the foremost to give credit thereto -rrb- be the greatest catch in town whether it be actually the lady 's beauty in question which have dazzle score of disengaged young man or whether they have see vision of a well-built money-chest we do not pretend to say but this much we can perceive that a beautiful young heiress leave to she own discretion in the choosing of a partner for life stand in a critical situation and if these innuendo refer to miss winnie santon we be foremost in wish we young nautical friend success in the great game of heart for we can see too much of worth in she character for she to be throw away on a worthless dandy whose money for the little time that it keep he company be he god be all this as it may harry grosvenor have find several opportunity for visit he sister and upon each visit he be receive not only by the sea-flower but by winnie herself with a warm welcome but winnie as we have discover have be a sad coquette another year however have be add to she age since we see she in society last and this last year so different from any other of she sunny life have bring with it the knowledge and experience of many perhaps the sea-flower 's influence which fortunately she have be under may have have its effect upon she character which be now form itself and yet she bewitching smile which harry loved to dwell upon when he have return to he island home as second only to he matchless sister 's be very like those which she have bestow upon many a elated gallant natalie have not fail to notice the seeming pleasure with which she brother have listen to winnie 's brilliant conversation and she have ask herself if it be possible that winnie could be so heartless as to impress she brother with erroneous view in regard to she sentiment she would not believe that she have the heart to do it and yet through habit and a perfect thoughtlessness of the consequence she might be lead to do so it be evening and the two sit fold in each other 's arm gaze at a autumn sunset winnie be still in she black habiliment for it be not quite a year since mr santon have die harry have leave they the day before and have bid they both a warm farewell winnie have be silent for some moment when natalie remark -- what new scheme be you plan now winnie you be very thoughtful to-night winnie rouse herself and blushingly reply i do not wonder that you note my thoughtful moment i be such a gay creature but dear natalie there be time when even _ i _ can be serious though there be few who could credit my word i can believe you winnie for i know you have a good heart but what can have occur of sufficient importance to banish those dimple from you cheek come rogue make I you confidant or i shall begin to think you be at you old trick after all if i do not know you forgiving spirit i should hesitate to place myself in you power for fear you might repay I with interest in make you and you particular friend mr delwood the subject of my merriment natalie look calmly into she eye the truth flash across she mind at once and she be about to clasp she in she arm call she by the name of sister when a well-known voice from behind they repeat the name sea-flower and mr delwood be by she side where do you learn the name by which i be call in my island home ask natalie why do you never tell we that you have a name in keep with you character he ask take the seat by she side which winnie who have retire to hide she blush have vacate ` tis the name by which my father love to call I and i associate it with he sacred memory she reply and a tear which delwood look upon as also sacred fall upon the hand which clasp she 's as with reverential fervency you brother tell I of the name he reply and will you permit I to associate with that name all that be of purity may i not call you by that name can you give one think to he whose very happiness for life be dependent on you there be a pause delwood have never until this night declare to she he love in so many measure word which be but coldness in comparison with the love for she which fill he soul a year ago would have seal he doom but that night witness another scene death have claim it for he own the hand which he hold be not withdraw neither do a simper mark she reply with eye meekly turn upward she answer in a calm low voice -- my dear father be in heaven if he be look down i feel that he will smile upon I when with my mother 's consent she shall give I away to you i have long ago give myself to christ and if you recognize he as you savior we will together serve he as dutiful child pray one for the other that we may not fall i be not like you he reply i can never be as pure as you be neither be i what the world call a christian but by god 's help i pledge myself to be one of christ 's follower and of one thing i be confident i shall never be if i grope my way alone through the world as i must if i lose you what i shall be if i have you for a guide it be enough you depreciate you own merit she say glance proudly upon he go when i return and with you own lip ask my mother if she can find a place in she noblest of woman 's heart for he who be all too worthy of she daughter 's love he fold she to he heart and the rich harvest moon have sink far below the horizon ere these two kindred spirit have weary of the glorious night mr santon have not feel the utter desolation after the first overpowering sense of grief have pass after he wife 's death that he would have feel have he have no one upon whom to have lean as it be he home be not desolate for he cherish he daughter as the apple of he eye and he have come to be like himself again happy face meet he as he come in wearied from he duty on ` change and he have again assume he easy jocose manners natalie be still continue she study make unprecedented progress to the rapturous delight of the signor while winnie enliven the whole household as mistress of the mansion she have new duty to discharge though they be not so arduous as to deprive she of entertain the young aspirant to she hand who if they do not throw themselves at she foot it be only for the want of a opportunity and thus be everything go on harmoniously at santon mansion when to the no little surprise of every one it be rumor that the wealthy mr santon be about to introduce to he domain a new mistress no one be more take by surprise than be winnie and natalie they could hardly credit they sens when mr santon congratulate he daughter on the prospect of have a new mother poor winnie she try to smile and she try to make one of she most brilliant remark as she congratulate she father on he happiness yet it be not like herself and natalie could see what mr santon in he blindness of joy do not discern -- there be no heart in he daughter 's mechanical tone winnie have not as yet see she intended mother-in-law she might be all that could be desire of one standing in that peculiar relation and she might be otherwise it be not that which have quell the buoyant spirit of the heiress it be that she shrink from the thought of any one so soon fill she own dear mother 's station and she hide she face in natalie 's golden tress as she father leave the room and burst into tear dear dear natalie she exclaim you will think I so wicked but i want no other mother than you though you be younger than myself i have learn to look up to you as a valuable bequest leave I by my mother who smile even in death when you promise never to forget I we be happy now why need a stranger come among we oh natalie i never can part from you hush hush dear winnie you must not think thus you may come to love you new mother fill the most sanguine wish of you father 's heart who would be wretched if he daughter be not reconcile to she who will stand in the nearest relation to he and thus the sea-flower endeavor to prepare winnie 's mind for receive she new mother who would so soon take she place at the head of this once unbroken family as become a meek and dutiful child but she do not tell she of the tremble within she own heart lest this new tie should prove a source of sorrow sowing she youthful heart with seed which might be productive of bitter among the sweet neither do she know of the prayer of the innocent maiden that hers might be a thornless path the lady in question whom mr santon have deem worthy of he hand and its consequent honor be of a family of lower standing than he own as far as much of this world 's goods go to give caste but if aside from depth of purse she be he inferior we have yet to learn the marriage ceremony be attend with little display in deference to mr santon 's wish and the day at length arrive when the bride who reside in a neighboring city be to be receive in she new home she come and congratulation be exchange between mother and daughter first impression be make and the hour arrive which should liberate each one to the night 's repose winnie fly to she room she have see she whom she be to call mother and from the few hour which she have already pass with she she superior discernment of character have judge of she aright she never have cause to vary from the opinion which she have from the first form of she she choke back the tear so strange to see within she eye and kneel she repeat the very first prayer she mother have ever teach she a exercise which from the example set before she for the last two year she now never fail to observe arise she endeavor to dispel the mountain of anguish which be creep into she soul -- in sleep poor winnie we can pity you ` tis but life 's lesson teach the impression which natalie have receive of the second wife of mr santon 's choice though she would not bring herself to realize it be by no means prepossessing she have school she own and winnie 's heart to love she under any circumstance but when she see with what frigidity she receive winnie 's warm welcome thinking not of the condescension with which she have take she own hand she tender heart be pierce as winnie look toward she as if for strength and she have return she look with a smile which could not fail to prove to she a ray of sunshine why be it that it be of so frequent occurrence that a man who have be bless with peculiar loveliness of character in a wife if he be call upon to part with she find alas too late in a second partner a extreme opposite it be thus in mr santon 's experience as he but too soon be oblige to acknowledge to himself though he would not that other should have a suspicion of the fact yet it be evident to he nearest friend that he be not the happy man he once be the few sprinkle of gray which have reflect honor upon the raven black of he hair have increase ere the honey-moon be hardly end early the next morning after the arrival of mr santon winnie be awaken by a attendant whose sense of propriety be a question if place in a balance with that of she new mistress which be the weightier the woman apologize for disturb she leddy-ship but the new mistress would like to see miss santon in the drawing-room as soon as possible you can go be winnie 's reply and tell mr santon that at my convenience i will see she but recall the servant with she next thought she add merely say to my mother that i will soon be with she and hastily make she

not trouble themselves much about such thing i wonder that you have not be bring up to something beside kill time madam vociferate winnie she face crimson with the insult which she have receive but she pause though still tremble with rage she eye have rest on a gentle form standing within the open door -- it be the sea-flower with one finger upon she lip she brow calm as the new day she gaze upon winnie till gain she eye unobserved by mr santon she glide away instead of the rage winnie would have pour forth she merely say i will send you the key and leave the room despatch a servant with the key which she have intend to have put into she hand at the earliest opportunity thereby acknowledge she superior claim at once she seek natalie whom she find seat in the conservatory enjoy the indian summer breeze which steal softly in among the fragrant plant which be the particular object of she care each know what be uppermost in the other 's mind but winnie 's heart be too full to speak i have be think winnie say the sea-flower how thankful we should be that we have so many friend to love we i think i have never realize it until now and she speak in a lower tone dear winnie should you ever receive other than the kindly treatment to which you have always be accustom let it serve to increase you gratitude that you have so many with whom you can trust you affection yes natalie i will strive to do aright i will try to do as i think you would have do but i fear i shall not have you strength o it be so hard if i only have a mother to love I i could endure anything else and she excitable nature get the better of she she burst into tear natalie throw she arm about she neck and she own voice tremulous with the pity which she feel for she she try to soothe she spirit you shall have a mother my mother shall be you mother for be you not to be my sister and she will love you as do you own gentle mother but mr santon will yet become reconcile to you for when she find what a good heart you have she can not but treat you with kindness at this juncture the door open and mr santon brush rudely in welladay be this you usual morning 's occupation miss grosvenor i think you should have more wisdom than to be pet a spoil child i imagine that i shall have as much as i shall care to undertake to undo the mischief which be already too apparent it have be as much as i could do for the last two hour to get thing a little in order but i suppose i need not look for assistance here she scornfully say and turn to leave the room winnie have it upon she tongue 's end to reply my father employ he servant to keep he house in order and they have never fail to give satisfaction but bite she lip the thought die away natalie arrest mr santon 's step say winnie and myself will consider it a pleasure to assist you and whatever we can do at any time for you enjoyment we shall be most happy to do it the hard-hearted woman quail a little at the sea-flower 's proffer assistance and natalie accompany she to the upper drawing-room wonder much what could have give offence to she idea of a well-regulated house for under the housekeeper 's scrupulous care everything be keep in the nicest order desire natalie to assist she in the disposal of some article she direct winnie to find some out-of-the-way place and to stow away the rubbish which she would find in the next apartment point to the room which have be she mother 's and which winnie have not permit any one to disturb since she death everything have be leave just as she have leave it even some withered flower have not be remove and the book from which she have read have be leave open at the place she eye have last look upon this room have be keep as a place sacred to winnie 's heart and indeed the very servant pass it by with a blessing on they depart mistress and it be now with tremble step that winnie hardly realize what have be say to she follow in the direction which the cruel woman have pointed she open the door and sink faint into a chair in the middle of the floor be the very clothes which she mother have wear with other article throw together in a pile she mother 's portrait have be remove and the room be otherwise in disorder natalie run to winnie 's assistance bathing she temple and smooth back she long tress with tenderness just at that moment mr santon enter the room he look at he daughter at the disorder apartment of he bury wife which he have never hold more sacred and he look at mr santon without speak a word he leave the room poor winnie this be indeed life 's lesson but thou art learn to suffer and be strong have the character of the mother-in-law be in accordance with she exterior santon mansion might still have resound with joy for hers be a face by no means forbid on the contrary a stranger would have pronounce she to be decidedly good-looking consider that she be a woman of nearly fifty year and those good look be the secret of mr santon 's unfortunate connection with she from the first the woman have take a dislike to natalie it seem as if she be determine to spite she in every way possible why she should have feel thus toward she be certainly unaccountable as there be no trait more unlovable than innocency about she character but this very gentleness of nature in contrast with the iciness seldom find in woman 's heart would as a unavoidable result serve to widen the two extreme the sea-flower would as time advance have seek refuge in she own home from this mist of unrest which have by degree spread itself around but when she have speak of the thing to mr santon he have grasp she by the hand as a drown man would catch at a straw say if she would not entirely sever the golden thread which be once bind around they home circle she would defer she departure for at least a little time and she have see the tear which be as molten lead well up from the strong man 's heart then she say it be my duty i will remain with you i feel there be something which bid I stay some mysterious power control my destiny may you have you reward be mr santon 's reply and we heartily respond may she have she reward never a word do mrs santon receive from the sea-flower in return for she ungenerous treatment of she other than tone of kindness and natalie be happy under this new dispensation for she say within herself -- i be but bear a part of the burden which would crush dear winnie 's heart and so she sing and play with she usual glad spirit glide about the house with simple dignity with a cheer word for every one and as biddy say -- she be a escape ray of light too bright for the darkness to hide as we may foresee this very light-heartedness of the sea-flower only serve to incite the ire of mr santon who see that every new indignity which she have cast upon she be return with more meekness of spirit if natalie have resent such conduct give measure for measure the stern woman could have bear it better but as it be it enrage she that she could not come within she sphere and if the truth be know she sens be not so steep in the water of insensibility but that in she very heart she feel she great superiority over herself i will put she down yet she say to herself after another return through the sea-flower of good for evil she shall yet feel my power and why mr santon will persist in she staying with we be more than i can tell but that be the way with these man they will get strange notion into they head which nobody can account for even a wife 's wish be look upon as of little consequence in comparison with they lordly command i should not be surprise at any time if santon should withhold a favor from I to lavish upon she but i be think that he will before long find out what i be make of if he thwart my wish to be sure he daughter have become attach to she but what of that she must learn that she can not have every whim gratify she be a spoil child at best and will not be likely to improve under she skim-milk discipline leave I alone for manage affair i have get the staff in my own hand and all they can do wont make I anything but the honorable mr santon 's lady though i be greatly mistake if he do not look with evil eye on the day that make I he bride but that be not of the slightest consequence as i use to tell my first husband poor fellow i suppose i be rather hard upon he once in a while but i know he be wait patiently for the day which should separate we he little think he would go first and the woman laugh aloud as she think how she have creep into the good grace of she present husband leave I alone for play my part she say as seat in she own apartment she listen to the voice of delwood in the drawing-room it be evident that she very life be wrapt up in mr delwood and it be really quite a pity that so fine a fellow should be deceive and lest she should follow my illustrious example i might as well interfere in they arrangement and if i can see aright she have talk the enviable heiress into the belief that she brother be a very paragon of perfection for she know right well that a good bag of money would be no serious objection to he fishermanship how they ever raise two such likely look specimen of humanity down there in the land of whale be a mystery but they 'll find they can not take the precedence with boston gentry if i can avail anything my particular friend montague shall try he luck in secure that portion of the heiress 's estate which i shall be please to leave she with these plan mature she usher herself into delwood 's presence and in she blandest manner make he welcome initiate herself as far as possible into he good opinion which be no difficult task inasmuch as he have be accustom to look upon a character so spotless that he be not prepare for the detestable machination of one who be not worthy the name of woman it have be far from the sea-flower to breathe a suspicion that there be aught amiss in the character of the flattering mistress of santon mansion she high esteem for mr santon have not permit she to speak of the sad change even to she mother my dear say mr santon turn to natalie in the pleasure which we must ever find in mr delwood 's society you have forget you engagement with the destitute family which you have take under you especial charge and poor mr brown 's child be so ill i fear a few hour ' delay in take the necessary restorative recommend by we physician may cause the poor thing to suffer i would despatch a attendant but i fear there may be some mistake make and i know you very presence will impart comfort to the poor woman oh no i have not forget they reply natalie but the physician say any time this afternoon would do as the little sufferer 's disease be about turn and we must await the result yes but i have such a anxiety about they for in they ignorance they may act contrary to order and so be the means of the little fellow 's death it will be a great relief to my mind if you will just step around and look in upon they as it be but a step and i know mr delwood will excuse you for a few moment and i will promise to do my best to supply you absence natalie prepare to depart on this errand of mercy and delwood would have take he hat to accompany she but mr santon hold he fast by commence a brisk conversation from which he could not with politeness take himself away miss grosvenor excel in she performance of the latest style which the signor have introduce remark mr santon endeavor to draw he out when the sea-flower have depart i be perfectly amaze at she original rendering of the italian reply delwood and i think i can safely say that among all my sojourning among they people i have never meet with one whose style be more pure than that of miss grosvenor 's i should certainly say that she be of italian birth though she tell I that she have never cross the atlantic she be evidently captivate with they people or perhaps i may more properly say with the only person she have ever meet of that nation say mr santon with a mysterious manner to what or whom do you refer ask delwood in a altered tone of voice mr delwood i feel that it be my duty to inform you of a matter which have be a source of no little uneasiness not only to myself but to every member of my family and as you have show a manifest interest in miss grosvenor it be not well that you should remain in ignorance of what so deeply concern you welfare speak what can it be ask delwood pale with emotion do not allow yourself to be thus move i pray you but what i have to say be that three month ago we give the signor notice that we should require he service no longer as we have reason to believe he visit be become something more than mere professional call and to we great consternation we find that miss grosvenor be not entirely indifferent to he marked attention i be the last to believe that miss grosvenor could so lose she self-respect and standing as to look upon a poor professor who gain he bread by he own exertion as a favored competitor for she hand and it be not until i see with my own eye that i could credit what i have hear i be satisfy in time that he rapt admiration as he gaze upon she be something more than enthusiasm that she have excel even he most ardent expectation and the expression of she beautiful face as she conclude might have be the envy of a greater than the signor we dismiss the signor but he still continue he visit under the plea that it be he custom to give a few additional lesson at the close of a course and if he might be allow he should consider it a valuable acquisition to he own musical power to continue for a time he exercise under miss grosvenor 's superior talent as mr santon pause delwood in a state of frenzy exclaim -- it can not be i will never believe that she be false to I even though she should declare to I with she own lip that another 's claim upon she affection be paramount to my own excuse I madam but i think there must be some dreadful misunderstanding in regard to the fact which you have state no i would scorn myself if i have a doubt of she innocence and if such a thing might be possible i would die rather than be force to believe it i will tell she this very day what i have hear but i will not degrade myself or forfeit she trust by ask she if it can be so be calm my dear friend say mr santon compose yourself i pray you and take my advice in the matter say nothing of what you have hear to any one but come here to-morrow morning at ten when the signor will make he appearance and from a private window opening from the conservatory you may unknown to any one witness for yourself the truth of what i have say i will follow you advice inasmuch as i will reveal to no one what i have hear until i become like myself say delwood endeavor to compose himself as he hear the light step of the sea-flower in the hall and as she enter he arise to depart plead a slight indisposition as a apology for he abruptness the calm spiritual eye of natalie look out upon he as he walk rapidly down the street for she could not but notice a estrangement in he manners but she do not mistrust that a arrow poison by sin in its vilest form have be aim at he heart the starry heaven of that night tell that another day have go to be with the past and innocence lay she head upon she pillow and sleep unmindful of plot of guilt engender of sin which might prove for she a draught of bitterness at a early hour the follow morning clarence delwood bent he step towards the residence of mr santon come here to-morrow and you shall see for yourself -- those word still sound in he ear and as he draw nearer the house it seem as if they grow louder and louder till he brain be nearly distract but would he privately watch she way whom of all other in the wide wide world he have look upon as nearest perfection no he would not thus debase himself it be at a much earlier hour than that which mr santon have name that delwood present himself and handsomely fee the porter who answer he summons he ask to see miss santon and jame say he you need mention my presence to no other member of the family as my business be strictly private for miss santon 's ear alone yes sir reply jame twist he face info a most know wink as he smile upon the yellow ore i have be there before winnie soon make she appearance with no little astonishment picture in she countenance that mr delwood should have honor they with what she term a sunrise call and that he should have ask for she in particular be a matter more mysterious he manners so unlike himself serve to check at once she flow of spirit which in spite of the weight of oppression which have mark the last year would find vent if not in a witty remark in the expression of she speaking countenance be it visible but she be not slow to discern that some serious subject be upon he mind and become serious also in a few word he inform she of what he have learn from mr santon the day previous but what be he astonishment to find she totally ignorant of the circumstance not hesitate to declare the whole a base falsehood i have not a doubt of the falsity of the report say delwood but what can have give rise to such a statement surely you mother would not wish to injure my feeling by repeat what may have originate without foundation among the servant and which she could not have herself credit winnie see the truth at once know as she do the character of she whom if she have ever look upon as a mother must from this moment forfeit every claim upon she feeling unless it be that of utter contempt mr delwood say she raise herself to she full height she slender finger clench together every nerve ` rouse to action -- if you would not insult I never again call the woman who have have the heart to cast such a slur upon the character of she whom we know be innocent _ my mother _ it be not to injure you feeling that she have invent such a vile scheme but it be by injure natalie 's character in you eye she may banish from she heart all future happiness nay do not start at such a strange declaration from my lip you be the only person out of my father 's household who have a suspicion that we happiness be not what it once be but since it have come to this i will at the risk of disclose to the world what it be wisdom to conceal establish the innocent and rest assure that what i say be true -- this originate not among the servant for there be not one but would kneel and kiss the very ground upon which we dear sea-flower tread delwood be thunderstruck indeed i never could have mistrust mr santon 's character be so vile say he but i can sooner believe this than that darkness be bear of light and have miss grosvenor suffer the ill-will of this cruel cruel woman and never lisp a word but should lead other to respect she noble girl that she be thrice noble have these very evil designing prove she ` tis useless for intrigue to cope with purity and she bid you come and see for yourself what meaning be there in that ask winnie for surely such a act would go to prove she innocence if mr santon can stoop to the deed which fortunately have be disclose in time to prevent the affair from come to miss grosvenor 's knowledge she would not hesitate to do a meaner thing favorable to the furtherance of she plan and it be my opinion there be more to be learn in regard to this matter i will foil she by follow she own advice and at the appoint hour will station myself as desire not as a spy upon she way but that i may sift this affair to the bottom accordingly at the hour which mr santon have mention mr delwood 's summons be answer by the mistress of the mansion in person who smilingly draw he to the conservatory which overlook the drawing-room where he could unobserved by any one notice every movement of she whose very be be dearer than he own natalie be perform he favorite air and as he listen he gradually lose sight of the object of he visit -- engulf in the ocean of bliss which she impassioned tone have spread before he when he be recall to a sense of outward circumstance by the voice of the signor who as the bird-like trill of she voice die away spring to he foot and in a voice hoarse with passion exclaim -- never and be about to leave the house when delwood intercept he in the hall and take he by the collar demand to know the cause of he strange conduct the signor in he peculiar dialect reply do not detain I sir it be far better that none should ever know of the temptation which well-nigh make I a villain you do not leave this house sir until you disclose to I what may concern my welfare and do not i pray you sir force I to treat you as other than a gentleman for if i mistake not you be yet worthy of respect you do I proud sir but i would much prefer to keep my own tongue for should it come to the ear of madam that she secret be a secret no longer i fear it may prove a injury to my professional duty remember that i have say sir you do not leave this house until you have give I a account of you strange conduct but in do thus if i find you undeserve of censure it shall be no sacrifice to you reputation i will pledge myself that you lose nothing since you be determine sir i will make a clean breast of it say the signor dash several piece of gold upon the floor -- there sir be indeed the root of all evil that gold be place in my hand by a woman who would make I a tool for the carry out of design which i have not the heart to perform well madam for some cause have a under current of thought which do not appear to be in keep with the more open sentiment of this family for that amount of gold she connive with I to express such sentiment toward miss grosvenor as should fire you with a belief of she inconstancy and a attachment for myself it be some time before i could be buy with gold but she double the amount i at last yield to what thank god i have not have strength to perform have it be other than miss grosvenor whom i be to injure i tremble for my weakness in resist so great a temptation but she remind I too strongly of the tear which i have see in my mother 's eye when she pray for she baby boy no sir thrice that paltry amount should not tempt I now to such degradation you have do well sir say delwood calmly as he place double the amount of mr santon 's bribe in the signor 's hand you have do well sir and mark my word -- gold can never relieve a guilty conscience go sir and see that you lisp not a syllable of this to any one mr delwood be about to take he leave when he be meet by winnie who trip lightly in fresh from a morning walk he grasp she hand and press it to he lip say -- you have help to do away with the sinful impression which do they best to fasten themselves upon I you will never be forget by I and i know you will do you best to protect _ she _ from the wiles of this hard-hearted woman of whose deed the world shall through I be none the wiser i should be iron-hearted do i not strive to make she happy for it be in pity for my father and he motherless child that she consent to be separate from she own loved family mr santon have never the impudence to inquire in what way this matter terminate but she could see that she machination have be foiled as day after day bring mr delwood a welcome visitor to the house yet this defeat do not subdue she bitter feeling towards the sea-flower they only slumber to break out afresh on the first occasion that might present natalie have observe the signor 's abrupt departure she know that something must be amiss and question winnie in the matter she disclose to she what never come to the ear of mr santon : i forgive she say the sea-flower and i can pity she for perhaps she have never have dear friend who might teach she how to love chapter x the madonna and child pure and undimmed thy angel smile be mirror on my dream like evening 's sunset gird isle upon she shadowed stream and o'er my thought thy vision float like melody of spring-bird note when the blue halcyon gently lave he plumage in the flash wave park benjamin please miss a letter for you say the post-boy handing natalie a letter which she be not long in discover be from she dear mother i thank you most heartily say she in she low musical voice which cause the youthful sprig of uncle sam 's department to leave incomplete the angle of forty-five degree which he have be in the habit of consider as of no little importance in the perfecting of he duty as he go he daily round zound say he to himself as he go whistle up the street if i do not hope they 'll send down another document to she soon and he eye wander up to the little patch of blue sky which be to be see between the top of brick wall the sea-flower peruse the letter and sit apparently bury in deep thought why natie darling exclaim winnie as she come bound into the room what have give you such a wise look this morning a letter eh good news i trust far be the day which shall bring to you aught but happiness thank you thank you winnie for you good wish but i can not well conceive of any other than pleasure come from my gentle mother 's pen winnie run she finger lightly over the key of the piano and natalie do not suspect as she listen to she sprightly air that there be a bright tear glisten in she eye at the holy name of -- mother but you be unusually thoughtful to-day natalie say winnie run she taper finger through the sunny tress of she friend do i not know it be a impossibility i should say you have lose you best friend and put she dimpled mouth close to she ear she whisper some mysterious word so softly -- so very softly that be we dispose to turn listener we could only have distinguish that one word -- delwood but we might have see the delicate tinge of pink which tell-tale like overspread the face and neck of the sea-flower be that as it may there be a thoughtful look linger about those expressive feature which could even be trace when at night-fall a well-known step be hear echo with no unpleasant sound along the corridor and a hand which though of feminine delicacy could have be fire with sufficient nerve to have wield a giant 's weapon at the invader who should come between he and the gentle be whose hand be not withdraw as he hold it reverently within he own ah miss sea-flower say delwood as he gaze deep into she eye you be far away among the invisible sprite of ocean to-night be you not one thought for we poor unfortunate who be so ungenial to those translucent one as never to have be initiate to they fairy haunt really i must get up a little smile at you expense for you could not better please a artist in the composing of you feature if you be sit for you picture by the way have you see the famous madonna whose great beauty be the theme of all conversation i be tell it be a master-piece by some gentleman who appear not anxious that he brilliant artistical power shall be publish as he name never accompany he work and the piece in question be but by accident bring to public view it hang among other in he fine gallery of painting and be hang with a heavy drapery of black which be by chance remove by a gentleman a friend of mine who offer a handsome fortune at once for the prize but he rich offer be decline by the owner who to the gentleman 's earnest desire that he might become its possessor reply -- ` sir that bit of inanimate canvas be all upon which my weary life feed be you to offer I the wealth of the world i would not part with that one small picture neither can i be work upon to produce a copy of the same without violate feeling which be sacred ' whether this be a fancy piece or if it bear the semblance of some one of he kindred my friend do not inform I as he say he very tongue cleave to the roof of he mouth as the sad artist speak those few deep-toned word i have not myself see this wonder and whether i might be thus warm in my praise be a question as you know i be insensible to female beauty if i may judge by remark which from time to time have come to my ear in past year from estimable mother whose beautiful daughter ought to have call forth my glowing sentiment ` but that which be want can not be number ' say he steal a arch glance at natalie i have not see this painting reply natalie she countenance light up with a new thought but i have several time visit the artist 's room though i have never be so fortunate as to get sight of the mysterious connoisseur those who have meet he describe he as be a middle-aged gentleman of foreign birth very marked in he polite graceful manners yet there appear to be a great mystery hang about he and some have venture to remark that he be no common history that he be not merely what he pretend -- a obscure artist there be that about he bearing which denote high birth i have admire he talent display and must see this remarkable production for you know i be a great admirer of female beauty that night natalie muse over the event of the day -- the contents of the letter which she have receive be first in she mind she mother have express a earnest desire to see she child once more among other thing she have briefly make mention of a matter in regard to they pecuniary affair -- quite a little sum of the comfortable fortune which capt grosvenor have by dint of the many peril at sea accumulate have be lose in a recent bank failure -- a failure as mr grosvenor state which have prove a source of poverty to many a family upon they little island many a widow have be oblige to part with the last dollar which have be earn by the seafaring husband who have never return to share the benefit of he labor they whole community have be more or less affect by this failure as to mr grosvenor 's own loss she have say it be not heavy or at least she have speak of it as not rest heavily upon she spirit why then should the sea-flower 's thought dwell thus upon the matter -- she still muse -- i fear this may have be a heavier loss than the gentle word so characteristic of my mother 's tenderness for I may imply she would not if it be in she power to prevent have I feel that i must curtail my expense in the least and i know that my necessary expense here must be a great tax upon she income to be sure harry have often say that we dear mother shall never know what it be to want but for all that i feel that i might do something to repay my mother for all that she have do for I yes it be my duty and it certainly would be a duty of pleasure if i could do anything to assist she this it be which have cause the thoughtful expression of the sea-flower this which have call forth the ever ready wit of miss winnie -- have detain delwood 's gaze but what would be the sentiment of uppertendom when it should be rumor that the beautiful young creature of the proud clarence delwood 's choice have stoop so low as to maintain herself by she own hand how would mr delwood himself receive such a announcement such thought do not occur to the mind of the noble hearted girl she every thought and act be of good and she do not for once think that there be those who could sneer at good motive ah natalie this be a cold unfeeling world at best as experience of long year doth confirm thy little day have not yet teach thee that the world be bear of sin for thou only lookest on the human face as divine how natalie be to render assistance to she mother by relieve she of any incumbrance of which she herself might be the cause have not yet be mature until delwood have speak of the popular picture-gallery of the unknown artist when as we have say she face be light up with a new thought i will seek this gentleman and it may be that he can be induce to bring out the dormant power which i be persuade be in existence for my love for he department of the fine art know no bound to-morrow i will visit he this veil of mystery would seem a barrier yet perhaps it be of sadness and i can conceive that such be of the tender heart -- alive to another 's want want she repeat aloud it sound strangely upon she ear and indeed we can not couple the think with such as she can such fair one of earth meet with the chill breath of adversity yes we may meet with they in we wanderings let we deal with they tenderly for it may be one of heaven 's sensitive flower stranger still would that word have sound to mr grosvenor and she son in connection with they sea-flower yet it be remotest from they mind that such thought would find they way to she heart mr grosvenor 's circumstance be indeed more embarrassed than she have express to natalie yet she have sufficient left wherewith they might by retrench a little live very comfortably accordingly that natalie might not feel this change she have dismiss she only servant -lrb- if we may do honor to old vingo by dub he with a more elevated appellation -rrb- make some other restriction in she domestic affair for the sake of the child whom she know be not she own by kindred do away with what she persuade herself be but unnecessary indulgence faithful mother thou wilt have thy reward natalie arise the next morning refresh by the sweet repose which innocence only know and although the day be usher in with cloud and a occasional rain-drop she proceed to put into execution the plan of yesterday she have make no one a confidant of she design not even winnie and when that little lady meet she in the hall all armed and equip as the weather direct she exclaim -- where now miss snow-wreath be you go to temper you indissolvable charm to a April shower or be it to hunt up some poor little refugee who be so unfortunate as to be minus a umbrella that you be so bereft of you sens as to venture out afoot and alone this disagreeable morning neither the one nor yet the other my fair sister joyously reply the sea-flower and she trip down the step smile upon the little frightened rain-drop which fall lightly upon she from the sky not offer to treat they with such indecorum as the spreading of she umbrella and when winnie call to she to come back or if she would venture forth to take the carriage she be far out of hearing arrive at she point of _ destination _ natalie be so lose in admiration of the noble illustration of the infinite mind of man that she have lose sight of she object in visit the unknown artist until she be awaken from she revery by a voice near she and look ` round she discover a poor dejected look old negro woman kneel with she hand clasp together and she eye fix upon -- natalie follow in the direction -- it must be the beautiful madonna of which she have hear involuntarily she assume the position of the negress what vision fill she soul flit to and fro the past the present and the future rush in mingled indistinctness through she mind and over the chaos there float a calm which gradually take the form of recollection which

foster-mother 's arm be hold up to view it be of a costly fabric embroider heavily with needle-work evidently the production of the industry of some lone sister of convent life the casket the contents of which have be so long treasured as thing sacred be open and the band of gold place in mr albonus 's hand he examine they closely there be no initial not the least mark whereby he might learn of that which be of such vast interest to he when lo he press the spring which have before yield to mr grosvenor 's touch and behold -- the same feature which he have look upon day by day for twenty year be reveal to he -- the feature of he madonna -- he child my god exclaim he i thank thee that thou hast bring I from darkness to light not only that i may acknowledge thy supremacy but to bless thee

gentleman hold he grand-daughter to he heart and be it really thus ask natalie can it be that my mother have be look down upon I from she home in the sky you sainted mother be in heaven spake mr alboni the sea-flower glance towards she from whom she have ever receive a mother 's tenderness there be a smile upon she countenance yet natalie observe though she would fain be happy that she loved

dear to I i must always look upon you as my mother and throw she arm about mr grosvenor 's neck she exclaim though other shall claim I by the tie of kindred they never shall part I from you you child will never forsake you it be enough the widow mother be not write childless then it be that mr grosvenor related every minute particular in regard to the child 's discovery and how she have be a blessing to they all repay they doubly for they care it be a long and interesting story to which this little circle listen regardless of the rage element without with the exception of the sea-flower who drink in every note of nature 's mighty chorus scarcely think of the peril to which those who be ride at the mercy of the wave might be expose for she young heart shrink not from ocean 's awe she have always look upon a ocean grave as a hallowed place of burial and you daughter 's name be natalie remark mr delwood it be a singular coincidence that the child should be name for the mother it be all a miracle say harry and sometimes i have think old vingo not far out of the way when he declare ` missy sea-flower to have be leave upon the beach by no other than the lord ' gradually mr albonus come to be like himself again he be a remarkably handsome man he countenance denote he generosity of heart he delight in the society of the sea-flower as she point out to he each day some new attraction about she island home know no bound it be now that mr albonus direct he attention to he unsettled affair in italy have he live out he day as the unknown artist without discover a heiress to he vast estate he would probably never have give the subject a thought and stranger or some public institution would have realize a handsome legacy but he every nerve thrill now with new life for she every advantage which wealth could procure would be hers but it be not only to look after he pecuniary affair that he lay the question before mr grosvenor if she child should accompany he to the land of she birth but that she might become acquaint with the position in life which she be every way capable of fill and so it be arrange that natalie with she grandfather should make the tour of the eastern world whither mr delwood should accompany they after dispose of mr albonus 's estate and visit the lion of the east they would return to make america they home and it be leave for natalie to decide what spot should be choose as they future home she say steal a glance towards clarence delwood -- we will return to my mother 's peaceful island home for we can be happy here accordingly the day be fix when they should depart but the very evening before they would sail bring news to mr delwood of the dangerous and probably fatal illness of he father it be with a sad heart that he look upon such a separation from he betrothed for he would necessarily resign the pleasure which he have anticipate in escort she to country which he have visit and which have become dear to he it be a great disappointment also to natalie yet she seek to persuade he it be for the best she would soon return and the separation would bring a thrice joyful meeting it be a glorious evening the soft moonlight kiss the white sea-cap as each strove to lift its head above its fellow as if to gaze upon night 's purity -- or mayhap they would beckon that gentle one who smile upon they wild joy as she recline upon she lover 's breast to join they in they revelling upon the broad bank of the old south shore they sit -- a favorite resort of the youth and maiden of this little island of a mid-summer

jaw-breaker of a name well we have a fair time of it till we get pretty well on to the american shore and as for I i never expect to enjoy myself again as i do the first part of that voyage we have quite a crowd of passenger and among they be a gentleman with he lady and child if that be not the handsomest couple that i ever sot eye on then i have miss my reckoning the lady -- why you honor it fairly dazzle my eye to look at she she always have a kind word for everybody even we old tar she would talk with as if she be not the best lady in the world there be not one of we but would have go to the mast-head foot first to do she a favor and as for gold she waste a young fortune on we ugly self we be within a couple o ' day sail of new york when one of those moist fog come up such as will make a fellow lose a whisk of he patience if he happen to have any well we keep on as we think in the same course for about twelve hour when like a clap of thunder we strike fast upon a rock it be as calm as any day i ever see but we sail be all set and that with the run of the sea give we no small shock but we captain hope we might not have receive any serious damages and set the carpenter to work to find what we situation be well you honor it be not ten minute after we strike afore we begin to settle down i know i would sail the ocean longer than we captain and when i find that we be go down i run below and find the gentleman and he lady and tell they just how matter stand with we and offer to stand by they till the last for we have but two boat aboard and i know there would be a scene when the lady hear this she turn to she husband and say -- ' i be prepare to share whatever be to be you fate paul but god in mercy save we child we go aloft to the hurricane deck and such a sight i have never see since every man woman and child that we meet there be look for something if no more than a straw to save themselves we have now settle down even with the water when i ` spy a large trough float near make for it and the gentleman take the babe from its mother 's arm spread a few clothes in it and lash the little thing into this curious look craft both give it one last kiss and it be launch on the wide ocean at this instant the lady draw from she pocket a roll of parchment and hand it to I say -- you may be save if you ever hear from my child again put this into safe hand for she but if you should never hear of she keep it for yourself and may god be with we all at that moment we be carry down and as i rise again i catch at a spar which be float near and look after my friend i see they rise far to leeward they be still clasp in each other 's arm i would willingly have go down if she might have be save but that could not be and i be bear far out to sea the fog lift but i be not able to make my whereabouts and in this condition i be leave for two day when i be pick up by a vessel bind to liverpool direct i tell the captain my story and find that we have miss we bearing that we vessel have be wreck upon the nantucket shoal we voyage prove to be a long and stormy one for the September gale take we on to the coast of africa and when a year after i ship for new york i hear nothing of the child and have always suppose she little bark take she to a better land and so it do exclaim the weep natalie hold the great rough hand of the tar within she own the little bark bear she in safety to a peaceful shore where she be receive with open arm by those who have fill the place of she natural parent you see before you my honest friend no other than the child of that gentle mother whose parting from she babe you witness sampson gaze upon she with astonishment and clap both hand to he head as if to assure himself that he exterior be yet in a healthful condition whatever transmogrification the interior might have undergo he exclaim -- i be not so sure after all that my name 's sampson i really begin to think that i must have go down with the rest and yet i could swear to it that i be a portion of that dust-heap if my topsail be not shiver this time clean go by the board and as if to verify he word he sink deeper into he chair and break into such a train of muse as cause the little son of africa in attendance to jingle he glass right merrily that the wild burst of he uncontrollable mirth might sound the less mr albonus could scarce credit what he have hear and the parchment inquire he what be the purport of that the tar sit as one in a trance but by certain gesticulation it appear that he skysail be not so shatter that he do not comprehend the drift of the question and after much tug and pull at a old waistcoat which be worn beneath the round-about he produce a roll which from twenty year ' wear it have be he constant companion during that time by sea and by land have become in appearance of a uncertain nature and hand it to the gentleman he say after examine the miniature which natalie put into he hand of she mother the document belong to she and if i would a happen to have meet she on the sea i might have know it even if i have not see the picture of the noble lady for she be the exact imitation but i never can get the land fog out of my eye when i be ashore that be a sorry look bit of paper you honor but it be what 'll buy more than one twist of pig-tail mr albonus peruse the document he be astounded -- not so much at the contents of that soil bit of parchment which be the instrument by which natalie or the holder could come into possession of a handsome fortune but it be at the honesty of this whole-souled sailor be it possible that this poor fellow who gain he bread by dint of hard labor have a fortune within he grasp which he conscientiously could have call he own have not disturb a farthing thereof -- choose rather to reap the fruit of he own industry treasure this rich legacy as sacred to the memory of a friend be there indeed such honor to be find in the breast of fall man aye ' t be the heart of the noble sailor that beat with a heroism like this to he who goeth down to the great water in ship such honor be due and you have have this in you possession for more than twenty year say mr albonus and yet have never help yourself to a cent of that which be rightly you own pray tell I how would you have dispose of this wealth at last have you never hear of a heiress to the estate d' ye see sir i have not travel this world over so many time without make a beacon light occasionally now there be a difference in light-house yer honor there be the revolving light and many other kind of light but the brightest of all be that steady light which shine into the darkness of the poor sailor 's soul i first make that light sir at the seaman 's home in new york and it be there i make up my mind that i would lend this money to the lord for i be convince that that would be the most profitable investment and i have be think of it more and more for these last few day if i have not better settle this on the home for you know these iron frame will give out after a while man do not live to see nine hundred year nowadays though i be name after the strongest fellow that ever handle a harpoon mr albonus read the document to he grand-daughter the effect of which be that certain sum of specie deposit in the bank of -- by the honorable paul sunderland could by the bearer of this instrument be withdraw at sight sampson 's tongue be still fly with rapidity as if he auditor have not be void of a number while mr albonus and natalie be hold a consultation aside you be right my child you will never miss this from the wealth which i thank god i have it in my power to place in you hand let it be as you say -- divide this sum between you protector i thank you my dear generous father say natalie imprint a kiss upon the cheek of she relative you have make I happy i will send this most acceptable gift to my dear mother not pain she feeling with the thought that i would seek to repay she love for she child with gold but as a expression of she daughter 's filial affection and not only will i reward this honest man with the half of this sum but he shall have the pleasure of present with he own hand this offering to my mother to this latter proposition sampson acquiesce with pleasure he be delighted with the prospect of once more see he young shipmate whose mysterious allusion to the sea-flower he could now comprehend but as to himself receive so liberal a legacy he be not prepare to look upon the proposition as favorably take it my good fellow say mr albonus it be rightly you own and should you ever have anything to spare you can not do better than to make the investment which you have purpose they part -- the honest tar to take he way to columbium 's happy land while mr albonus and the sea-flower would prolong they visit for a little here then depart to feast they eye upon italian sky sampson look long after the gentle form of the sea-flower as he leave they for when might he see so fair a sight again \* \* \* \* \* and this be the home of my mother muse natalie as arrive in florence we tourist enter the arched gateway which lead to the broad domain of the long absent master just as the sun be sink to rest he soft linger ray kiss the fleecy cloud o'er which a blush come and go now deepen as the rose carmine give place to the most delicate tinge that e'er sit upon a maiden 's cheek -- bear of pure modesty the scent of the delicate jasmine perfumed the air while the pensive strain of some fair one soft and clear as the tone of a wind-harp be bear on the stillness of evening to the ear of the lovely sea-flower who recline upon the bosom of she father she sunny tress mingle with the silvery lock which tell that he have see many winter whisper in word low and musical -- my angel mother -- i can feel she presence near she have breathe this blissful air can it be more heavenly there with she eye still upturn as if they mildness might pierce the veil of azure she lip move as they have ofttime do before in praise and thanksgiving for the wondrous beauty which we father in he boundless love have set before he child as mr albonus gaze upon each familiar object surround he beautiful villa he be greatly surprise to find everything in the same state of preservation as when he have last behold he home once so dear instead of a air of desolation everything fall to decay as would be a natural consequence attendant upon the long absence of the family the scrupulous care and attention of some interested one be apparent on all side even the little ivied bower which mr sunderland have arrange with he own hand when he first smile upon he beautiful bride be still in existence and here do natalie dream away many a happy hour during she stay in dear florence the old man and he frugal wife to whose keep the premise have be entrust and who occupy a small tenement upon the grounds could not have be more surprised if one have appear to they from the dead than be they when mr albonus stand in the door of they cottage i tell you he honor would come again say the woman turn to she husband but i be really afear it might not be in we time and as we have no one to leave in we shoe i be of the ` pinion that the place would have drop off to some stranger ha yes reply the husband my old woman 's never far out o ' the way though she do sometimes talk as if she expect to become extinguished but for all that she be equal to two common one but i be particularly glad you have come home on a good many ` count for if the place must go into any other hand than a alboni i be not over anxious to witness the change in the coat of arm mr albonus receive this compliment as it be intend and as one motive in visit he native land again be to dispose of this estate he now direct he attention to the future comfort of this most worthy couple for the domestic who have serve in the family of albonus must not suffer from want accordingly a comfortable cottage adjoining these land be obtain for they use and a annual income sufficient to supply they want settle upon they for life and so with the estate of the alboni whose last representative of the name would soon depart for a memorial of day past this aged couple hope to spend in contentment the residue of they day amid all the splendor and gayety of fashionable life in italy the sea-flower be never so happy as when seat in the ivy bower which look out upon a little lake the same which have be she mother 's favorite place of retreat where she might watch the ever-changing face of the mellow sky or roam through those ancient hall she might feast she eye on the many antique surroundings but most of all she love to linger in the great reception hall whose wall be hang with the portrait of she mother 's family for many past generation some of those countenance denote man of much strength of character amounting almost to a fierceness but in nearly every female face natalie discern that same gentleness of spirit which unknown to herself be the expression of she own spiritual countenance beneath the portrait of the last mr albonus be a place reserve for that of she child -- the lady sunderland but by some circumstance it have never be place there during the period of we heroine 's stay in italy she spend much of she time in the home of she ancestor to which she become greatly attach but once have be introduce to a admiring italian assembly it be no easy matter to remain in seclusion this new star so mild yet brilliant be the theme of present conversation she never appear in public but the blessing of high and low marked she way and as she kneel in public worship meekly bow at the name of christ there be not one who look upon she but this passage of scripture be bring to they mind -- if the righteous scarcely be save where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear but all time come to a end pass away be write upon everything pertain to earth and the time when we friend should return to they island home draw near it be the day before they would bid adieu to pleasant scene here to journey to liverpool for business lead mr albonus to sail for america from that port the sun have go down -- the last sunset which the sea-flower would look upon here -- the last sunset pause dear reader -- when will that same sun set to we for the last time it may be soon it may be later yet it be the same for all time be present with god the evening shades begin to claim they reign regardless of the smile and entreaty of linger day that he would delay he approach -- fit symbol of sunny youth who would banish from he presence death 's unrelenting grasp and yet who do not love night with earnest tenderness and have no one a smile for death natalie still linger beneath the ivy trelli she foot draw upon the cushion for she would not crush the gentle flower which tell to she they love in the rich perfume of the air and yet if trodden under foot the flower with they die breath the beauteous flower do with they richest perfume breathe forgiveness she eye be fix upon the lake -- its glassy ripple a striking contrast to the giant wave upon which she have ever look with delight ah who may divine she thought as she muse thus a faint smile play with the dimple around she mouth and but for the word she whisper one might indeed think she intent upon the ripple which kiss the shore at she foot but no she be transport to where the breaker 's roar be hear and a proud noble form she see -- he piercing eye bent upon the sea full well she know for whom he heart thus wildly beat dear good clarence she whisper and start from she revery she kneel in prayer my father god thou art merciful unto the weakest of thy frail one keep thou my heart to thee alone may i have no other god before thee cast out all idol if any there be and breathe thy spirit within my soul and may thy will be do aman be the response of bright one of upper sphere and may we receive strength to say -- thy will be do adieu dear home of my childhood spake mr albonus as the dim outline of the land of he nativity at last fade in the distance and bury he face in he hand he give himself up to he own reflection from which natalie would not recall he arrive in liverpool the steamer in which they be to have embark have sail consequently a few more day be add to they sojourn there but when at length they proud steamer leave she pier accompany by many heartfelt good wish that she might be attend with all success that she voyage might prove most favorable the sea-flower weep tear of delight that she might once more listen to those voice of the deep and calmly gaze upon the countenance of mr albonus she say -- father we be go home she word fall upon the ear of a officer of the ship a gentleman of that nobleness of soul which alone constitute a true man one whose kind and gentlemanly consideration of the comfort and pleasure of those who have from time to time cross that three thousand mile of ocean which separate liverpool from new york have before be publicly mention and will long be remember by those who have before come under he guidance we be go home -- the officer raise he hat as he pass the sea-flower involuntarily repeat she word -- word which many time have be idly speak but how full of mean as that gallant steamship make she way over the roll billow like a thing of life as if indeed she recognize the course o'er which she have so many time bear aloft she proud head in season of tempest as well as of sunshine there be not one who walk she deck but look upon she gigantic form as a ark of safety rather than the frail plank which only separate not far from three hundred immortal being from a ocean grave several day ' sail leave merrie england far behind and as they draw nearer the american shore many a eye be delude with the belief that it have be the successful one in be the first to make the outline of the nearest shore of this land of the free there be the eye of youth light up with the light of innocence which when riper year should have leave they impress might have give place to more of guile while hand in hand along she peaceful deck roam old age and infancy alike joyous in the air of cheerfulness which reign with all around it be near the hour of mid-day weather favorable with the exception of a fog which have suddenly spring up occasionally the signal bell sound that if any vessel be in they neighborhood she might know of they whereabouts the fog as suddenly lift as it have shut in upon they but to close down again heavier than before natalie have not as most of the lady go below but stand intent upon those new thought which the veil of fog which have shut out all sight and sound save a occasional tone of the bell have inspire when -- a crash which shake they vessel from stem to stern cause every one to look upon the countenance of he fellow there to read the word which he have no power to utter a propeller be at that instant see move athwart they bow and from the severity of the shock it be think that the smaller vessel must have sustain serious damage accordingly a boat be lower from the steamer under command of the first officer to render the unfortunate such assistance as be in they power believe they own damages to be but slight but the boat have not be long go when word be pass to they captain that they be in a sink condition upon examination it be find that a large breakage have be make directly under they bow and the sea be rush in terrifically all be now a scene of confusion some apply themselves diligently to the pump and other seek to diminish the leak by stretch a sail across the gap while the passenger hurry some one way and some another as if in a state of frenzy to seek assistance from the propeller even if she might not be in as disastrous a condition as themselves be out of the question for both vessel be under full headway at the moment of the collision she be now again envelop in fog oh god must it be thus no escape for these three hundred being what a awful moment of suspense still the steamer settle down what be do must be do speedily the captain be without he first officer with whom he might consult he absence necessarily detract from the number of boat but have the boat be suffer to remain unmolested for the benefit of the passenger it be doubtful if they could have contain so large a number where now be those gladsome little child those aged man and woman who listen to those voice of childhood would fain have believe themselves young again ah where be they wring they hand in wild despair clamber over the side of the ship endeavor to save themselves on raft spar or article afford inferior protection the sea-flower -- where be she where be she aged protector upon the deck of that ill-fated steamer the sea-flower kneel with eye meekly turn heavenward she ask that peace may be shed upon the heart of that agonized throng that they may fitly receive this will of divine dispensation never be she countenance more serene just then a voice be hear at she side -- we be go home it be the voice of the noble officer who have before note she word i be happy reply natalie when i say we be go home but i do not realize we would so soon meet the loved one in that celestial home where we shall part no more forever and i be happy now yet this terrible cry of anguish incite my deep deep sympathy thank god for this presence of a angel to shed light over my last hour say the officer i now go down through that dark valley of death unattended by that gloom which have seize upon my soul my god in mercy wilt thou sustain my wife and child when they shall look for my come and i shall never return to they more and may they soon meet I there -lrb- he know not that the youngling of he flock would so soon join he in sing the song of the redeem -rrb- he say no more they be go down a

water and god shall wipe away all tear from they eye the blue wave roll on in they untiring way and the sun go calmly down upon this day -- the twenty-seventh of September eighteen hundred and
