wight and beauty make beautiful old rhyme in praise of lady dead and lovely knight shakespeare sonnet cvi i -- wace in the long line of arthurian chronicler geoffrey of monmouth deservedly occupy the first place the most gifted and the most original of they number by he skilful treatment of the arthurian story in he _ historium regum britanniae _ he succeed in unite scatter legend attach to arthur 's name and in definitely establish they place in chronicle history in a form that persist throughout the later british historical annals he theme and he manner of present it be both peculiarly adapt to win the favor of he public and he work attain a popularity that be almost unprecedented in a age that know no print book not only be it accept as a authority by british historian but french chronicler also use it for they own purpose about the year 1150 five year before the death of geoffrey a anglo-norman geoffrey gaimar write the first french metrical chronicle it consist of two part the _ estorie des bretons _ and the _ estorie des engles _ of which only the latter be extant but the former be know to have be a rhymed translation of the _ historium _ of geoffrey of monmouth gaimar 's work might possibly have have a longer life if it have not be cast into the shade by another chronicle in verse the _ roman de brut _ by a norman poet wace which fill a important and interesting place among we arthurian source not merely because of the author 's quality as a poet and he treatment of the arthurian story but also because of the type of composition that he produce for the metrical chronicle occupy a intermediate position between the prose chronicle one of the favorite form of mediaeval monastic production throughout europe and the metrical romance which bud and blossom most richly in france where during the last half of the twelfth century it receive its greatest impulse from crestien de troies the most distinguish of the _ trouvères _ the metrical romance be write for court circle and be use as a vehicle for recount adventure of love and chivalry and for set forth the code of behavior which govern the courtly life of france at that period wace 's poem though base upon chronicle history be address to a public whose taste be turn toward chivalric narrative and it foreshadow those quality that characterise the verse romance for which no more fitting theme could be find than those supply by the story of arthurian hero whose prowess teach we that we should be valiant and courteous wace see the greater part of the twelfth century we can not be certain of the exact year of he birth or of he death but we know that he live approximately from 1100 to 1175 practically all we information about he life be what he himself tell we in he _ roman de rou _ : -- if anybody ask who say this who put this history into the romance language i say and i will say to he that i be wace of the isle of jersey which lie in the sea toward the west and be a part of the fief of normandy in the isle of jersey i be bear and to caen i be take as a little lad there i be put at the study of letter afterward i study long in france -lrb- 1 -rrb- when i come back from france i dwelt long at caen i busied myself with make book in romance many of they i write and many of they i make before 1135 he be a _ clerc lisant _ -lrb- reading clerk -rrb- and at length he say he writings win for he from henry ii preferment to the position of canon at bayeux he be more author however than prebendary and he give he first effort and interest to he writings he compose a number of saint ' life which be still extant but he two most important work be he historical poem the _ roman de brut _ and the _ roman de rou _ -lrb- ie rollo -rrb- a chronicle history of the duke of normandy this latter be wace 's last production and beside have a literary and historic importance it have a rather pathetic interest he have begin it in 1160 in obedience to a command of henry ii but for some unknown reason henry later transfer the honor to another poet wace lay aside he pen leave he work incomplete and probably soon after die since the king have ask he to do this work i must leave it and i must say no more of old the king do I many a favor much he give I more he promise I and if he have give all that he promise I it have be better for I here end the book of master wace let he continue it who will -lrb- 2 -rrb- some twenty year earlier in 1155 wace have complete the _ roman de brut _ he himself call it the _ geste des bretons _ -lrb- history of the briton -rrb- but it be best know under the title that appear in the manuscript the _ roman de brut _ give to it by scribe because of its connection with brutus the founder of the british race the brut be a reproduction in verse of geoffrey 's _ historium _ to call it a translation be almost to give it a misnomer for although wace follow exactly the order and substance of the _ historium _ he be more than a mere translator and be too much of a poet not to impress he own individuality upon he work he make some few addition to geoffrey 's arthurian history but he real contribution to the legend be the new spirit that he put into it in the first place he vehicle be the swift-moving french octo-syllabic couplet which alone give a entirely different tone to the narrative from that of geoffrey 's high-sounding latin prose wace moreover be norman bear and norman breed and he inherit the possession of he race -- a love of fact the power of clear think the appreciation of simplicity the command of elegance in form such a spirit indeed be he as in a finer type have already express itself in caen in the two noble abbey under whose shadow he pass the greater part of he life the dignified and sternly simple abbaye-aux-homme of william the conqueror and the graceful richly ornamented abbaye-aux-dame of queen matilda sincerity and truth wace ever aim at but he embellish he narrative with countless imaginative detail as a narrator he have the tendency to garrulity which few mediaeval poet altogether escape but he be by no means without conversational charm and in brief sentence abound in colloquial turn he lead we easily on with seldom flagging interest even through those page where he be most inclined to be prolix he be a systematic person with accurate mental habit and be keenly alive to the limitation of he own knowledge he doubtless often have to bid he common sense console he with the reflection with which he begin he _ life of st nichola _ : -- nobody can know everything or hear everything or see everything god distribute different gift to different people each man should show he worth in that which god have give he he be extremely careful to give he authority for he statement and have all the shyness of a antiquarian toward fact for which he have not full proof through breton tale for example he hear of the fairy fountain of barenton in the forest of broceliande where fay and many another marvel be to be see and he determine to visit it in order to find out how true these story be i go there to look for marvel i see the forest and i see the land i seek marvel but i find none a fool i come back a fool i go a fool i go a fool i come back foolishness i seek a fool i hold myself -lrb- 3 -rrb- the wonder relate of arthur he tell we have be recount so often that they have become fable not all lie nor all true all foolishness nor all sense so much have the storyteller tell and so much have the maker of fable fabled to embellish they story that they have make all seem fable -lrb- 4 -rrb- he omit the prophecy of merlin from he narrative because he do not understand they i be not willing to translate he book because i do not know how to interpret it i would say nothing that be not exactly as i say -lrb- 5 -rrb- to this scrupulous regard for the truth absolutely foreign to the ingenious geoffrey wace add a unusual power of visualise he see clearly everything that he describe and decorate he narrative with almost such minute detail of any scene as a seventeenth-century dutch painter love to put upon he canvas the most famous instance of this power be he description of arthur 's embarkation for the roman campaign geoffrey after say simply that arthur go to southampton where the wind be fair pass at once to the dream that come to the king on he voyage across the channel but wace paint a complete word-picture of the scene here you may see the crew gather there the ship prepare yonder friend exchange parting word on this side commander call order on that sailor man the vessel and then the fleet speeding over the wave -lrb- 6 -rrb- another spirited example of this same characteristic be find in the _ roman de rou _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- in the stir account of the advance of the norman under william the conqueror at the battle of hasting : -- taillefer who sing right well mount on a charger that go swiftly ride before the duke singing of charlemagne and of roland and of oliver and the vassal who die at roncesval when they have ride until they come close to the english ` sire ' say taillefer ' a grace i have serve you long for all my service you owe I a debt to-day a it please you repay it I for all my guerdon i beg you and fervently i pray you grant I to deal the first blow in the battle ' the duke reply ' i grant it ' and taillefer prick on at full gallop on before all the other he press he strike a englishman and kill he beneath the breast clean through the body he thrust he lance he fell he down full length on the ground then he draw he sword he strike another then he cry ` on on what do ye strike strike ' then the english surround he at the second blow that he deal hark to the noise raise and the cry apart from matter of style wace make other change from geoffrey 's narrative that be more important for arthurian romance he write the _ brut _ under the patronage of henry ii and if we may trust layamon 's statement he dedicate it to queen eleanor who be the ardent propagator in england of the courtly ideal of southern france accordingly wace perhaps partly because of he own milieu partly because of he royal patroness weave into geoffrey 's narrative more pronouncedly chivalric material the lack of the courtly virtue of mesure -lrb- moderation -rrb- that be noticeable in geoffrey 's arthur wace be careful to conceal he give furthermore a place to the description of love which fill so many line in the later romance but which be absent from geoffrey 's page gawain for instance who be valiant and of very great moderation declare that jest and the delight of love be good and that for the sake of he lady a young knight perform deed of chivalry -lrb- 8 -rrb- in addition to these change which be to be attribute to he personal bent and surroundings wace also make it clear that he be conversant with story of arthur quite independent of the _ historium _ fable about arthur he himself say that he have hear as we have see and from these he add to geoffrey 's narrative two that bear unmistakable sign of a celtic origin and that be destine to become important element in later romance for he give we the first literary record of the famous round table -lrb- 9 -rrb- and the first definite mention in literature of the hope of britain -lrb- 10 -rrb- wace be not to be regard as one of the great contributor to we knowledge of arthurian legend but without a familiarity with he work later french romance can scarcely be appreciate so important be he place as a delicate transformer of the story the harsher element of which he veil with the courtliness familiar to he while he diffuse throughout it the indefinable spirit of french romance and this he do with the naive simplicity and grace that be he by birth and temperament ii -- layamon to wace we owe still another debt for the _ roman de brut _ serve as the direct source for one of the greatest member of the arthurian literature of any period this be the _ brut _ write in the first half of the thirteenth century after the year 1204 by layamon a english priest of the country parish of lower arnley in worcestershire there be a priest in the land who be name layamon he be son of leovenath -- may the lord be gracious to he -- he dwell at ernley at a noble church upon severn 's bank -- good it there seem to he -- near radestone where he book read it come to he in mind and in he chief think that he would tell the noble deed of the english what they be name and whence they come who first possess the english land after the flood that come from the lord layamon begin to journey wide over this land and procure the noble book which he take for pattern he take the english book that saint bede make another he take in latin that saint albin make and the fair austin who bring baptism in hither the third book he take and lay there in the midst that a french clerk make who be name wace who well could write and he give it to the noble eleanor who be the high king henry 's queen layamon lay before he these book and turn over the leaf lovingly he behold they -- may the lord be merciful to he -- pen he take with finger and write on book-skin and the true word set together and the three book compress into one now prayeth layamon for love of the almighty god each good man that shall read this book and learn this counsel that he say together these soothfast word for he father 's soul who bring he forth and for he mother 's soul who bear he to be man and for he own soul that it be the better aman -lrb- 11 -rrb- with these word layamon introduce we to he book and to himself in fact they contain the sum total of we information about he life but they put we at once into sympathy with the earnest sincere student who write not like geoffrey and wace for the favor of a high-born patron but for the love of england and of good man and he few hardly-won and treasured book of these book wace 's _ brut _ receive the lion 's share of he attention and he make little or no use of the other that lay before he he follow wace 's poem in outline but he succeed in extend its 15300 verse to 32241 by give a free rein to he fancy which he often allow to set the pace for he pen for layamon in he retired parish perform the monotonous and far from engross duty of a reading clerk -lrb- 12 -rrb- live in reality a stir life of the imagination back in the saxon past of england he thought move and he mind dwelt on she national epic hero not only in he language which belong to the period of transition from anglo-saxon to middle english but in he verse -lrb- 13 -rrb- and phraseology he show the influence of earlier anglo-saxon literature the sound of the _ ode on athelstane 's victory _ and of _ beowulf _ be in we ear as we read he intense stir line war and battle the stern career of a saxon leader the life of the wood and field attract he far more than the refinement of a norman court and by emphasise the element that be most congenial to himself he develop a entirely different picture from that present by either geoffrey or wace writing with intense interest he live and move and have he being among the event that he be narrate and be far too deeply absorb in he story to limit himself to the page that he have before he give a dramatic situation the actor become live personality to he and he hear impassioned word fall from they lip in terse phrase such as he never find in the line of wace uther pendragon in a deadly battle against the irish invader under gillomar and pascent slay gillomar then overtake pascent : -- and say these word uther the good : ` pascent thou shalt abide here cometh uther ride ' he smite he upon the head so that he fall down and the sword put in he mouth -- such meat to he be strange -- so that the point of the sword go in the earth then say uther ` pascent lie now there now thou hast britain all win to thy hand so be now hap to thee therein thou art dead dwell ye shall here thou and gillomar thy companion and possess well britain for now i deliver it to you in hand so that ye may presently dwell with we here ye need not ever dread who you shall feed ' -lrb- 14 -rrb- arthur lead he man close to the host of colgrim the leader of the saxon invader : -- thus say arthur noblest of king : ` see ye my briton here beside we we full foe -- christ destroy they -- colgrim the strong out of saxonland he kin in this land kill we ancestor but now be the day come that the lord have appoint that he shall lose the life and lose he friend or else we shall be dead we may not see he alive ' up catch arthur he shield before he breast and he gan to rush as the howling wolf when he cometh from the wood behung with snow and thinketh to bite such beast as he liketh arthur then call to he dear knight : ` advance we quickly brave thane all together towards they we all shall do well and they forth fly as the high wood when the furious wind heaveth it with strength ' fly over the -lrb- field -rrb- thirty thousand shield and smote on colgrim 's knight so that the earth shake again brake the broad spear shiver shield the saxish man fall to the ground some they gin wander as the wild crane doth in the moor-fen when he flight be impaired and swift hawk pursue after he and hound with mischief meet he in the reed then be neither good to he nor the land nor the flood the hawk he smite the hound he bite then be the royal fowl at he death-time -lrb- 15 -rrb- layamon let he imagination display itself not merely in the dramatic speech that he put into the mouth of he actor he occasionally compose a long incident as in the story of the coronation of constan -lrb- 16 -rrb- of the announcement to arthur of mordred 's treachery -lrb- 17 -rrb- and in the very striking account of arthur 's election to the throne of britain and he reception of the messenger who come for he arthur sate full still one while he be wan and in hue exceed pale one while he be red and be move in heart when it all brake forth it be good that he speak thus say he then forthright arthur the noble knight : ` lord christ god 's son be to we now in aid that i may in life hold god 's law ' -lrb- 18 -rrb- but in general layamon 's expansion of wace be merely slight addition or modification sufficient in number however to go far in double the size of the volume he great change be that which i have already mention the spirit in which the story be conceive and this be best illustrated perhaps in the person of arthur himself for arthur be no knight-errant but a grim stern ferocious saxon warrior loved by he subject yet dread by they as well as by he foe be never ere such king so doughty through all thing he stand in the cold glare of monarchy and conquest and save in the story of he birth and of he final battle he be seldom if ever see through the softer light of romance but layamon be the only source for the story of which we hear nothing in the later romance and which be generally attribute to a teutonic origin that elve come to arthur 's cradle and give he good gift -- to be the best of knight a rich king long live abound in virtue most good layamon too give a truly celtic version of arthur 's disappearance from earth two fairy maiden bear the wounded king in a boat from the battle-field over the sea to argante the queen of avalon who will make he whole again and the briton ever expect when arthur shall return this story and also layamon 's very important account of the establishment of the round table which be vastly more complete than wace 's bear unmistakable mark of a celtic origin layamon in fact living as he do near the welsh border naturally show familiarity with current welsh tradition he work have a high value in the vexed question of the origin and growth of arthurian romance for it prove the existence of genuine welsh tradition about arthur and make untenable the position of those critic who maintain that the arthurian legend have a independent development only on the continent layamon 's contribution to we knowledge of the arthurian material be however comparatively small since he augment he original in the main by passage inspire by he own imagination -lrb- 19 -rrb- he addition may be call poetic rather than legendary partly because of its saxon character he _ brut _ never attain wide popularity and it have little effect upon the cycle but it remain one of the most truly great literary achievement in the field of both arthurian chronicle and romance we three most important arthurian chronicler geoffrey wace and layamon be all man of marked individuality and ability each life for we with as distinct a personality as if we have far more than we very imperfect knowledge of the detail of he life geoffrey a clever combiner a highly gifted narrator and scholar bear at a happy hour give the arthurian legend a definite literary form bring permanently together independent element of tradition and contribute enormously to the popularity of the cycle wace the professional author the scrupulous antiquarian and naïve poet carefully refine the material of geoffrey and dress it in the french costume of courtly life layamon the intense and imaginative english priest transform it by the saxon spirit and divest it of its courtly elegance fill it with greater simplicity and force excursus i -- arthur 's magic possession arthur 's magic possession form a prominent element in welsh tradition and they appearance in the early chronicle be a important testimony to the diffusion of welsh legend _ kilhwch and olwen _ contain a list of he belongings all of which there be reason to believe from record or from logical inference be of otherworld origin each have its significant proper name which in most case convey the idea of brilliant whiteness a characteristic of celtic fairy object he ship for example be name white form he shield night gainsayer he dagger white haft the _ dream of rhonabwy _ -lrb- 20 -rrb- describe he carpet -lrb- or mantle -rrb- white which have the property of retain no color but its own and of make whoever be on it -lrb- or wrap in it -rrb- invisible and also he sword hard-breacher graven with two serpent from whose jaw two flame of fire seem to burst when it be unsheathed and then so wonderful be the sword that it be hard for any one to look upon it this sword -lrb- caletvwlch caliburn excalibur -rrb- be a pan-celtic marvellous object and be one of arthur 's most famous possession the deadly blow attribute by nennius to he in the battle of mount badon without doubt traditionally be deal by caliburn geoffrey of monmouth recognize it as a fairy sword and say that it be make in avalon namely the celtic otherworld we may also feel confident that the full panoply of armor with which geoffrey equip arthur -lrb- ix 4 -rrb- consist of magic object although geoffrey who in general as a historian rationalise the supernatural merely describe they as amazingly efficacious the shield he call by the name of arthur 's ship in welsh source pridwen -lrb- evidently a fairy boat limitless in capacity -rrb- either from some confusion in tradition or because be enchanted pridwen might of course serve as either ship or shield layamon add further information about arthur 's weapon he burny he say -lrb- vs 21133-34 -rrb- be name wygar -lrb- anglo-saxon _ wigheard _ -rrb- battle-hard which witeze work witeze be a corrupted form for widium the anglo-saxon name of the son of weland the teutonic vulcan a famous maker of magic weapon in romance with whom he son might easily become identify in legend this be the explanation give by professor gl kittredge of the above line as a correction of sir frederic madden 's translation : he -lrb- namely the smith who make the burny -rrb- be name wygar the witty wight layamon say -lrb- v 21147 -rrb- that arthur 's helmet be call goswhit a name that be evidently a translation of some welsh term meaning goosewhite which at once class the helmet with arthur 's dazzlingly bright fairy belongings moreover layamon say -lrb- vs 21158 23779 ff -rrb- that he spear ron -lrb- a welsh common noun meaning spear -rrb- be make by a smith call griffin whose name may be the result of a english substitution of the familiar word _ griffin _ for the unfamiliar _ gofan _ the name of the celtic smith-god these fact be mainly important as testimony to the celtic element in arthurian romance and especially to layamon 's use of current welsh arthurian tradition the large variety of magical possession assign to arthur be also a notable indication of the great emphasis that welsh legend lay upon he mythological attribute and he character as otherworld adventurer -lrb- the above fact have be establish and discuss by professor acl

tale of the briton and in say that arthur have it make to prevent rivalry as to place among he vassal when they sit at meat layamon however expand the few line that wace devote to the subject into one of he longest addition to he source by introduce the story of a savage fight for precedence at a court feast which be the immediate cause for fashion the round table a magical object ancient source prove that the celt have a grievous habit of quarrel about precedence at banquet probably because it be they custom to bestow the largest portion of meat upon the bravest warrior it be also they practice to banquet seat in a circle with the most valiant chieftain of the company place in the middle possibly owe to the circular form of they hut possibly for the sake of avoid the dispute that so commonly disturb they feasting the round table accordingly be to be regard as a pan-celtic institution of early date and as one of the belongings that would naturally be attribute by popular tradition to any peculiarly distinguished leader layamon 's version so closely parallel early celtic story of banquet fight and have so barbaric a tone as to make it evident that he be here recount a folk-tale of pure celtic origin which must have be connect with arthur before he time and probably before that of wace for this story be undoubtedly one of those many fable which wace say the briton tell about the round table but which he do not incorporate into he narrative -lrb- see acl brown _ the round table before wace in study and note in philology and literature _ vii -lrb- boston 1900 -rrb- 183 ff

layamon 23080 ff 28610 ff -rrb- the belief that arthur would return to earth which be firmly establish among the briton by the beginning of the twelfth century do not in early record appear clothe in any definite narrative form in later source it assume several phase the most common of which be that record by layamon that arthur have be take by fay from he final battle-field to avalon the celtic otherworld whence after the healing of he mortal wound he would return to earth layamon 's story conform essentially to a early type of celtic fairy-mistress story accord to which a valorous hero in response to the summons of a fay who have set she love upon he under the guidance of a fairy messenger sail over sea to the otherworld where he remain for a indefinite time in happiness oblivious of earth it be easy to see that the belief that arthur be still live though not in this world might gradually take shape in such a form as this and that he absence from he country might be interpret as he prolonged sojourn in the distant land of a fairy queen who be proffer he not the delight of she love but healing for he wound in order that when he be make whole again he might return to help the briton historic mythical and romantic tradition have combine to produce the version that layamon record geoffrey of monmouth -lrb- xi 2 -rrb- write in the mock role of serious historian and with a tendency to rationalisation say not a word of the wound king 's possible return to earth wace with characteristic caution affirm that he will not commit himself as to whether the briton who say that arthur be still in avalon speak the truth or not here as in the story of the round table it be layamon who have preserve for we what be undoubtedly the form that the belief have already assume in celtic story through whatever medium it may have pass before it reach he hand in the _ vita merlinus _ -lrb- 21 -rrb- a latin poem attribute by some scholar to geoffrey of monmouth a curious version of arthur 's stay in avalon be give the wounded king be take after the battle of camlan to the isle of apple -lrb- for such be understand to be the meaning of the name _ avalon _ -rrb- which be the domain of a supernatural maiden wise and beautiful morgen by name who understand the healing art and who promise the king that he shall be make whole again if he abide long with she this be the first

they depart from the realm they pray vortigern to go in embassy to vortimer he son persuade he to give they safe conduct from the land and not to do they further mischief vortigern who be in they company and would in no wise depart from they fellowship go to he son to procure such truce as the saxon require whilst he be about this business the saxon enter in they galley and with sail and oar

desire peace he ensue peace be he love and he seek she with tear nothing be further from he wish than war and he would rather be banish from the realm than remain by force of arm it be for the briton to elect those whom they will to stay and for the other they would return whence they come the briton grant the love-day and the two people take pledge one of the other but who can trust the oath of a liar a time be appoint when this council should be holden the king send message to hengist that he must come with few companion and hengist plighted troth right willingly moreover it be command that none should bear weapon at the council for fear that man should pass from word to blow the two party meet together near the abbey of ambresbury on the great salisbury plain the day be the kalends of may hengist have teach he comrade and warn they privily that they should come each with a sharp two-edged knife hide in he hose he bid they to sit in this parliament and hearken to the talk but when he cry nimad covre seax -lrb- which be interpret means pluck forth you knife and would not be understand of the briton -rrb- they be to snatch out they dagger and make each a dead man of he neighbor now when the council be meet and man be mingle together the naked briton near by the false heathen hengist cry loudly nimad covre seax the saxon at he word draw forth the knife from they hose and slew that man sit at they side hengist be seat very close the king he hold the king fast by he mantle so that this murder pass he by but those who grip the knife thrust the keen blade through cloak and mantle breast and bowels till there lay upon back or belly in that place nigh upon four hundred and sixty man of the richest and most valiant lord of the kingdom yet some win out and escape with they life though they have naught to defend they body save the stone eldof earl of gloucester get a great club in he right hand which he find lie at he foot though little he reck who have carry it to the council he defend he body stoutly with this mighty staff striking and smite down till he have slay fully sixty and ten of the pagan a mighty champion be he and of rich worth he cleave a path through the press without take a wound for all the knife which be fling at he body he escape with not a hurt to the flesh he win at the end to he horse which be right strong and speedy and ride swiftly to gloucester shut himself fast in he city and victual tower as to vortigern the saxon would have slay he with he baron but hengist stand between they cry harm not the king for nothing but good have i receive at he hand and much have he toil for my profit how then shall i suffer my daughter 's lord to die such a death rather let we hold he to ransom and take freely of he city and walled place in return for he life they therefore slew not the king but bind he fast with fetter of iron keep he close in bond for so long a space that he swear to render they all that they would in quittance of he ransom and to come forth from prison vortigern grant sussex essex and middlesex to hengist as he fief besides that earldom of kent which he have hold before to remember this foul treason knife be long

to send for merlin and build accord to he bidding since there be none so skilled in counsel or labor more truthful of word or apter in divination the king desire greatly to behold merlin and to judge by hearing of he worth at that time merlin abode near the well of labene this fountain spring in a hidden place very deep in wale but i know not where since i have never be merlin come straightway to the king even as he be bid the king welcome he with marvellous joy honor he right gladly he cherish he richly and be ever about he with prayer and entreaty that he would show he somewhat of thing that be yet to come for these he be on itch to hear sire reply merlin this i may not do i dare not open my lip to speak of such awful matter which be too high for I save only when need speak i must should my tongue be unloose by greed or lightness should i be puff up by vanity then my familiar spirit -- that be by whom i know that which i know -- would withdraw he inspiration from my breath my knowledge would depart from I and the word i speak would be no weightier than the idle word on every gossip 's lip let the future take care of itself consider rather the concern of to-day if thou art desirous to make a fair work and a lasting of which man will brag till the end of time cause to be bring hither the carol that a giant work in ireland this giant labor greatly in the building of a mighty circle of stone he shape he carol set the stone one upon another the stone be so many and of such a kind they be so huge and so weighty that the strength of man -- as man be in these time -- might not endure to lift the least of he pebble the king laugh loudly merlin say he since these stone be of such heaviness that it pass the strength of the strong to move they who shall carry they to my mason have we not in this realm stone mighty enough and to spare king answer merlin knowest thou not that wit be more than strength muscle be good but craft be better skill devise means when strength fail cunning and engine bring many matter to a good end that strength would not venture even to begin engine can move these stone and by the use of engine we may make they we own king these stone be carry from africa : there they be first shapen the giant who ravish they to ireland set up he carol to he own content very serviceable be these stone and right profitable to the sick it be the custom of the surgeon of that land to wash these stone with fair water this water they would make hot in bath and set therein those who have suffer hurt or be grieve by any infirmity they wash in this water and be heal of they sickness however sore they wound however grievous they trouble other medicine need they none when the king and he briton hear of the virtue reside in the stone they all desire they very greatly not one but would gladly have venture on the quest for these stone of which merlin tell such marvel they devise therefore to pass the sea with fifteen thousand man to make war upon the irish and to ease they of the stone uther at he own desire be choose as they captain merlin also go with they to furnish engine for they toil so uther and he company cross to ireland on such quest when the king of ireland that man call guillomer hear tell that stranger be array in he land he assemble he household and the irish and menace they proudly seek to chase they from the realm after they have learn the reason of this quarrel and that for stone the briton be come they mock they loudly make they they mirth and they song for mad it seem in the eye of these irish that man should pain themselves so grievously by land and sea to gain a treasure of naked stone never a stone say these shall they have not one shall they carry with they to they home very lightly you may scorn you enemy in you heart but at you peril you seek to do he mischief with you hand the irish mock and menace the stranger and seek he until they find the combat be join directly the host meet together but the irish be man of peace unclad in mail and not accustom to battle the briton be they jest but they be also they victor the king of ireland flee from the battle discomfited he go from town to town with no long tarry in any place so that the briton might not make he they captive after the briton have lay aside they armor and take rest from the battle they be bring by merlin they companion into a mountain where the carol be build this high place be call hilomar -lrb- 1 -rrb- by the folk whom they have vanquish and the carol be upon the summit of the mount the briton stare upon the stone -lrb- footnote 1 : kildare -rrb- they go about they say each to he fellow that none have see so mighty a building they marvel how these stone be set one upon another and how they should be get across the sea comrade say merlin you be strong champion strive now if of you strength you may move these stone and carry they from they seat the young man therefore encompass the stone before behind and on every side but heave and tug as mightily as they could the stone for all they travail would not budge one single inch bestir yourselve cry merlin on friend on but if by strength you can do no more then you shall see that skill and knowledge be of richer worth than thew and fleshly force have speak these word merlin keep silence and enter within the carol he walk warily around the stone he lip move without stay as those of a man about he orison though i can not tell whether or no he pray at length merlin beckon to the briton enter boldly cry he there be nought to harm now you may lift these pebble from they seat and bear and charge they on you ship so at he word and bidding they work as merlin show they they take the stone and carry they to the ship bestow they thereon afterwards the mariner hoist they sail and set out for britain when they be safely come to they own land they bear the stone to ambresbury and place they on the mountain near by the bury ground the king ride to ambresbury to keep the feast of pentecost bishop abbot and baron he have bid they all to observe the feast a great company of folk both rich and poor gather themselves together and at

naked the sword be thrust through they breast or heart or bowels in that place the heathen perish from the land since the christian destroy they utterly octa and os the lord of they host -- these troubler of britain -- be take alive they be lead to london and set fast in a strong prison bind in iron if any of they fellow escape from the battle it be only by reason of the blackness of the night

tintagel seek to do we mischief for if he fall upon we in this trap we shall pipe to deaf ear igerne praise the counsel of he she deem she lord the king embrace she by reason of she tenderness and kiss she as he bid farewell he depart straightway from the castle and he familiar with he when they have ride for a while upon the road merlin again put forth he enchantment so that he the king and ulfin take they own shape and become as they have be before they hasten to the host without draw rein for the king be with child to know how the castle be so swiftly take and in what manner the earl be slay he command before he he captain and from this man and that seek to arrive at the truth uther consider the adventure and take he lord to witness that whoever have do the earl to death have do not accord to he will he call to mind earl gorloi ' noble deed and make complaint of he servant look upon the baron very evilly he wear the semblance of a man in sore trouble but there be few who be so simple as to believe he uther return with he host before tintagel he cry to those who stand upon the wall ask why they purpose to defend the tower since they lord be dead and he castle take neither could they look for succor in the realm or from across the sea the castellan know that the king spake sooth and that for they there be no hope of aid they therefore set open the gate of the castle and give the fortress and its key into the king 's hand uther whose love be pass hot spoused igerne forthwith and make she he queen she be with child and when she time be come to be deliver she bring forth a son this son be name arthur with the rumor of whose praise the whole world have be fill after the birth of arthur uther get upon igerne a daughter cleped anna when this maiden come of age she be bestow upon a right courteous lord call lot of lyone of this marriage be bear gawain the stout knight and noble champion uther reign for a long time in health and peace then he fall into a great sickness fail alike in mind and strength he infirmity lay so sore upon he that he might not get he from he bed the warder who watch over he prison in london be pass weary of they long guard and be corrupt also by fair promise that be make they take rich gift from octa that be hengist 's son and from ossa he cousin and deliver they out of they bond let they go free from they dungeon octa and os return swiftly to they own place they purchase war galley to themselves and gather they man about they menace uther very grievously with a great company of knight and spearman and archer they pass the march of scotland burning and spoil all the realm since uther be sick and could do little to defend he life and land he call lot the husband of he daughter to he aid to this lord he commit the guidance of he host and appoint he constable of he knight he command these that they should hearken lot as himself and observe all he bidding this uther do because he know lot for a courteous and liberal lord cunning in counsel and mighty with the spear now octa vex the briton very sorely he boast himself greatly by reason of the number of he folk and of the king weakness to avenge he father 's death and he own wrong he make britain fearful of he name for he neither grant truce nor keep faith lot meet octa once and again in battle many a time he vanquish he foe but often enough the victory remain with octa the game of war be like a game of table each must lose in he turn and the player who win to-day will fail to-morrow at the end octa be discomfited and be drive from the country but it afterwards befall that the briton despise lot they would pay no heed to he summons this man for reason of jealousy this other because of the sharing of the spoil the war therefore come never to a end till the king himself perceive that something be amiss whilst the folk of the country say openly that the captain be but carpet knight who make pretence of war at this certain man of repute come before the king pray he to remain no longer hide from he people come what may say these counsellor you must get to the host and show yourself to the baron the king take they at they word he cause himself to be set within a horse litter and carry as though in a bier amongst he people now we shall see say these which of these recreant lord will follow he to the host the king send urgent message to the knight who be so disdainful of lot summon they on they allegiance to hasten to he aid for himself he be carry straight to verulam -lrb- 1 -rrb- this once be a fair city where st alban fall upon he death but be now altogether ravage and destroy of the heathen octa have lead he people to the city and seize thereon make fast the gate the king sit down without the town he cause great engine to be array to break through the wall but it be very strong and he might make no breach octa and he friend make merry over the catapult set over against they on a morning they open wide they gate and come forth to do battle with the king a vile matter it seem to they that the door should be lock and bar because of a king lie sick within a litter they could not endure to be so despise that he should fight against they from he coffin as i deem they pride go before a fall that captain win who be deserving of the victory the heathen be defeat and in that battle octa and he fair cousin os be slay -lrb- footnote 1 : st alban -rrb- many who escape from the field flee into scotland there they make colgrin they chieftain who be a friend of octa and he cousin uther rejoice so greatly by reason of he victory and of the honor god have show he that for sheer joy he be as a man heal and altogether whole he set himself to hearten he baron and inspire they with he own courage he say to he man with mirth i like rather to be on my bier languish in long infirmity than to use health and strength in flee from my foe the saxon disdain I hold I in despite because i can not rise from my bed but it have befall that he who have one foot in the grave have overthrow the quick forward then and press hardly on they heel who seek to destroy we religion from the land when the king have rest he for a space and have encourage the lord with he word he would have follow after the heathen see that he sickness be yet heavy upon he the baron pray that he would sojourn awhile in the city until it pleased god to give he solace from he hurt this they say fear lest he courage should bring he to he death it chance therefore that the host depart leave uther at verulam because of he infirmity none be with he save the folk of he private household now the saxon who be drive from the land when they have draw together consider within themselves that if the king be but dead he have no heir who might do they a mischief and despoil they of they goods since they have no trust in they weapon doubt that they could slay he with the sword they devise to murder the king by craft and poison they suborn certain evil-doer whose name i do not know by promise of penny and of land these man they convey to the king 's court array in ragged raiment the better to spy in what fashion they might draw near he person and carry out they purpose the malefactor come to verulam but for all they cunning and craft of tongue in no way could they win anigh the king they go to and fro so often they listen to the servitor ' talk so readily that in the end they know that the king drink nothing but cold water that other liquor never pass he lip this water be grateful to he sickness it spring from a well very near he hall and of this water he drink freely for none other be to he mind when these privy murderer be persuade that they might never come so close to the king 's body as to slay he with a knife they sow they poison in the well they lurk secretly about the country until it come to they ear when and how he die and then flee incontinent whence they come presently the king be athirst and call for drink he cupbearer give he water lace with venom from the spring uther drink of the cup and be infect by the plague so that there be no comfort for he save in death he body swell become foul and black and very soon he die right quickly all those who drink of the water from that fountain die of the death from which they lord lay dead after this thing become known and the malice of these evil-doer be make clear the burgess of the city meet together and choke the well for evermore they cast therein so much earth that a pyre stand above the source as a witness to this deed uther the king have fall asleep he body be bear to stonehenge and lay to rest close by aurelius he brother the brethren lie side by side the bishop and baron of the realm gather themselves together and send message to arthur uther 's son bidding he to cirencester to be make they king arthur at the time of he coronation be a damoiseau of some fifteen year but tall and strong for he age he fault and virtue i will show you alike for i have no desire to lead you astray with word he be a very virtuous knight right worthy of praise whose fame be much in the mouth of man to the haughty he be proud but tender and pitiful to the simple he be a stout knight and a bold : a pass crafty captain as indeed be but just for skill and courage be he servant at need : and large of he give he be one of love 's lover a lover also of glory and he famous deed be right fit to be keep in remembrance he ordain the courtesy of court and observe high state in a very splendid fashion so long as he live and reign he stand head and shoulder above all prince of the earth both for courtesy and prowess as for valor and liberality when this arthur be freshly crown king of he own free will he swear a oath that never should the saxon have peace or rest so long as they tarry in he realm this he do by reason that for a great while they have trouble the land and have do he father and he uncle to they death arthur call he meinie to he aid he bring together a fair company of warrior bestow on they largely of he bounty and promise to grant largely of the spoil with this host he hasten into the land that lay about york colgrin -- who be the chief and captain of these saxon since the slaying of octa -- have many pict and scot in he fellowship besides a goodly company of he own people he desire nothing more hotly than to meet arthur in battle and to abate he pride the army draw together upon the bank of the dougla the two host fall one upon the other furiously and many a sergeant perish that day by reason of lance thrust or quarrel or dart at the end colgrin be discomfited and flee from the field arthur follow swiftly after strive to come upon he adversary before he might hide he in york but colgrin for all he pain take refuge in the city so arthur sit he down without the wall now baldulph the brother of colgrin tame by the shore await the come of cheldric the king and he saxon from germany when he hear the tiding of what have befall colgrin at the ford of dougla and of how he be holden straitly by arthur in york he be pass heavy and sorrowful for with this colgrin be all he hope baldulph make no further tarry for cheldric he break up he camp and march towards york set he comrade in ambush within a deep wood some five mile from the host together with the folk of he household and the stranger of he fellowship baldulph have in he company six thousand man in mail he trust to fall upon arthur by night when he be unready and force he to give over the siege but certain of the country who have spy baldulph spread this snare run to the king and show he of the matter arthur know of the malice of baldulph take counsel with cador earl of cornwall a brave captain who have no fear of death he deliver to the earl 's care seven hundred horseman and of spearman three thousand and send he secretly to fall upon baldulph in he lurk place cador do the king 's bidding the saxon hear no rumor of he come for the host draw to the wood privily without trumpet or battle cry then when cador be near the foe he cry he name and burst fiercely upon the heathen with the sword in this combat there perish of the saxon more than three thousand man have it not be for the darkness of the night and the hindrance of the wood not one might have flee on he foot baldulph the cunning captain get he safely from the field by hide beneath every bush and brake he have lose the fairer and the stronger half of he meinie and be at he wit ' end to know how to take counsel with he brother or to come to he aid but speak with he he would so that craft and courage might find a way baldulph devise to seek the besieger ' camp in the guise of a jongleur he array himself in all point as a harper for he know well how to chant song and lay and to touch the string tunably for he brother 's sake he make himself as a fool he shave off one half of he beard and moustache and cause the half of he head to be poll likewise he hang a harp about he neck and show in every respect as a lewd fellow and a jester baldulph presently go forth from he abode be know again of none he go to and fro harping on he harp till he stand

pay enough by reason of the saxon pass this way it be not for we pleasure they sojourn awhile in the land we go the more heavily for they presence for much pain and sorrow we suffer because of the heathen and pass weary be we of they speech if we sheltered they in we house the greater sorrow be ours since we have endure the more at they hand we beast they have slay and eat and for we goods these they have take and send the gear into they own realm there be none to help we nor be any man so strong as to deliver we from they power sire if we prepare they a feast it be because we fear to drink they wine cup to the dregs might be theirs and we be as the captive who see no succor on the road these saxon be pagan man thy servant be christian therefore the heathen oppress we the more mightily and lay the heavier burden upon we but great as be the mischief these saxon work we thou hast do we the sorer harm theirs be the whip but thine be the stinging scorpion it should prove little

to another yet none can certify by touch or sight whether craft keep these fish each in he place or what be that hindrance they may not overcome yea i can not tell whether the pond be dig by the wit of man or if nature shape it to she will moreover i know of another mere whereof you would be more amaze than of both these marvel this lake be close by the severn in the land of wale the sea pour its tide into this lake yet empty itself as it may the water of the lake remain ever at the same height never more and never less the ocean itself may not suffice to heap its water above the lake neither to cover its shore yet at the ebbing of the tide when the sea turn to flee then the lake spue forth the water it have take to its belly so that the bank be swallow up the great wave rise tall in they wrath and the wide field round about be hide and all be sodden with the foam the folk of that country tell that should a man stare upon the wave in its anger so that he vesture and body be wet of the spray then whatever be he strength the water will draw he to itself for it be mightier than he many a man have struggle and fall on the brink and be drown in its clutch but if a man turn he back upon the water then he may stand safely upon the bank take he pleasure as long as he will the wave will pass by he do he no mischief he will not be wet even of the fly foam so hoel marvel greatly at these wonder tell he by the king then arthur bid sound he horn he clarion and trumpet to call he meinie to himself he grant leave to all but the folk of he privy household to return to they home the host go

hundred and by thousand the stoutest knight and archer he could find these he join to he host purpose to lead this fair company into france without any long tarry the king act on he purpose town city and castle fall before he so that flander and the country about boulogne be speedily in he power arthur be a prudent captain he perceive no profit in waste he own realm burn he town and steal from he very purse he eye be in every place and much be forbid by he commandment no soldier might rob nor pill if there be need of raiment meat or provand then must he buy with good mint coin in the market nothing he dare to destroy or steal now in arthur 's day the land of france be know as gaul the realm have neither king nor master for the roman hold it strongly as a province this province be commit to the charge of frollo and the tribune have govern the country for a great space he take rent and tribute of the people and in due season cause the treasure to be deliver to the emperor at rome thus

battle other be sorely wound or make captive or return sorrowing to they own home out of the meinie frollo have gather from so many city more than two thousand be destroy this be no great marvel since the count of arthur 's host be more than frollo might endure from every land he have subdue to himself from every city that be take arthur see to it that not a spearman nor knight of fitting year and strength of body but be number in the host and command to serve arthur as he lord of these outland folk arthur choose a fair company of the hardiest knight and most proven champion to be of he private household the very french begin to regard he as they king so only that they have the courage of they mind this man love he for he wise and comely speech this by reason of he liberal hand : this because of he noble and upright spirit whether man be drive to he presence by fear or consider he a refuge in the storm all find cause enough to seek he court to make they peace and to acknowledge he as they suzerain now frollo after he discomfiture by the king flee to pari with all the speed he might make no stop upon the road the tribune fear arthur and he power very sorely and since he seek a fortress to defend he person he would not trust he fortune to any other city he resolve therefore to await arthur within pari and to fight the king beneath the wall frollo call to himself such legion as be yet in town near by because of the number of the fugitive who be come to that place together with the burgess abide therein a great concourse of people fill the city all these folk toil diligently to furnish the city with corn and meat and to make sure the wall and gate against they foe arthur learn that frollo be make strong he tower and fill the barn with victuals he draw to pari

the key of the city have be render diva clamour the famished citizen what doest thou frollo why requirest thou not peace at arthur 's hand frollo regard the common people who fail for famine he look upon the folk die by reason of they hunger and know that they would have he yield the city frollo perceive that of a surety the end of all be come the tribune choose to put he own body in peril -- yea rather to taste of death than to abandon pari to she leaguer frollo have full assurance of arthur 's rectitude in the simplicity of he heart he send urgent message to the king pray he to enter in the island that body to body they might bring they quarrel to a end he who prevail over he fellow and come living from the battle should take the whole realm as he own and receive all france for he guerdon thus the land would not perish nor the folk be utterly destroy arthur hearken willingly to the herald for very greatly be they message to he mind he accord that the battle should be between the two captain even as frollo desire gauntlet be take from one and the other and hostage give on behalf of pari and on the part of the besieger for better assurance of the covenant that be make on

the world you resemble a blind man whose eye the leech prepare to open you know not yet but very soon you will have learn the presumption of he who teach law to the justice of rome it be not enough to say that you have act after you kind and sin accord to you nature know you not whom you be and from what dust you have come that you dare to dispute the tribute to rome why do you steal we land and we truage why do you refuse to render caesar that which be he own be you indeed so strong that we may not take we riches from you hand perchance you would show we a marvellous matter behold -- you say -- the lion flee from the lamb the wolf tremble before the kid and the leopard fearful of the hare be not deceive nature will not suffer such miracle to happen julius caesar we mighty ancestor -- whom maybe you despise in you heart -- conquer the land of britain take tribute thereof and this you have pay until now from other island also neighbor of this it be we custom to receive truage these in you presumption you have take by force to you own most grievous hurt moreover you have be so bold as to put yet greater shame and damage upon we since frollo we tribune be slay and france and britain by fraud you keep wrongfully in you power since then you have not fear rome neither regard she honor the senate summon you by these letter and command you under pain of they displeasure to appear before they at mid August without fail or excuse come prepared to make restitution of that you have take whatever the cost and to give satisfaction for all those thing whereof you be accuse if so be you think to keep silence and do naught of that you be bid i will cross the mont st bernard with a mighty host and pluck britain and france from you hand do not deem that you can make head against I neither hold france in my despite never will you dare to pass that sea for my dearer pleasure yea be you courage indeed so great yet never might you abide my come be persuade that in what place soever you await I from thence i will make you skip for this be my purpose to bind you with bond and bring you to rome and deliver you bind to the judgment of the senate when this letter be read in the hearing of those who be come to arthur 's solemnity a great tumult arise for they be anger beyond measure many of the briton take god to witness that they would do such thing and more also to those ambassador who have dare deliver the message they press about those twelve ancient man with many wild and mock word arthur rise hastily to he foot bid the brawler to keep silence he cry that none should do the roman a mischief for they be a embassy and carry the letter of they lord since they be but another 's mouthpiece he command that none should work they harm after the noise be at a end and arthur be assure that the elder be no longer in peril he call he privy council and the lord of he household together in a certain stone keep that be name the giant 's tower the king would be advise by he baron -- so run the summons -- what answer he should give to the messenger of rome now as they mount the stair earl and prince pell mell together cador who be a merry man see the king before he fair king say the earl gaily for a great while the thought have disturb I that peace and soft living be rot away the british bone idleness be the stepdame of virtue as we preacher have often tell we soft living make a sluggard of the hardiest knight and steal away he strength she cradle he with dream of woman and be the mother of chambering and wantonness fold hand and idleness cause we young damoiseaux to waste they day over merry tale and dice raiment to catch a lady 's fancy and thing that be worse rest and assurance of safety will in the end do britain more harm than force or guile may the lord god be praise who have jog we elbow to my mind he have persuade these roman to challenge we country that we may get we from sleep if the roman trust so greatly in they might that they do accord to they letter be assure the briton have not yet lose he birthright of courage and hardness i be a soldier and have never love a peace that last over long since there be uglier thing than war gawain overhear these word lord earl say he by my faith be not fearful because of the young man peace be very grateful after war the grass grow greener and the harvest be more plenteous merry tale and song and lady ' love be delectable to youth by reason of the bright eye and the worship of he friend the bachelor become knight and learn chivalry whilst the lord jest amongst themselves in this fashion they climb the tower and be seat in the chamber when arthur mark that each be in he place silent and attentive to the business he consider for a little that he have to speak presently he lift he head and speak such word as these lord say the king who be here with I nay rather my companion and my friend companion alike whether the day be good or evil by whose sustenance alone i have endure such diver quarrel hearken well to I in the day that be tell have we not share victory and defeat together partner you with I as i with you in gain and in loss through you and by reason of you help in time of trouble have i win many battle you have i carry over land and sea far and near to many strange realm ever have i find you loyal and true in business and counsel because of you prowess i hold the heritage of diver neighbour prince in subjection lord you have hearken to the letter carry by the ambassador of rome and to the malice they threaten if we do not after they commandment very despiteful be they against we and purpose to work we bitter mischief but if god be gracious to he people we shall yet be deliver from they hand now these roman be a strong nation pass rich and of great power it become we therefore to consider prudently what we shall say and do in answer to they message look always to the end he who be assure of he mark get there by the shortest road when the arrow start to fly the sergeant take shelter behind he shield let we be cautious and careful like these this lucius seek to do we a mischief he be in he right and it be ours to take such counsel that he mischief fall on he own head to-day he demand tribute from britain and other island of the sea to-morrow he purpose in he thought to receive truage of france consider first the case of britain and how to answer wisely therein britain be conquer by caesar of force the briton know not how to keep they against he host and perforce pay he they tribute but force be no right it be but pride puff up and swollen beyond measure they can not hold of law what they have seize by violence and wrong the land be ours by right even if the roman take it to himself by force the roman really reproach we for the shame and the damage the loss and the sorrow caesar visit upon we father they boast that they will avenge such loss as these by take the land with the rent and make they little finger thicker than they father 's loin let they beware hatred breed hatred again and thing despiteful be do to those who despitefully use you they come with threat demand truage and reprove we for the evil we have do they tribute they claim by the right of the strong leave sorrow and shame as we portion but if the roman claim to receive tribute of britain because tribute be aforetime pay they from britain by the same reasoning we may establish that rome should rather pay tribute to we in olden day there live two brother british bear namely belinus king of the briton and brennus duke of burgundy both wise and doughty lord these stout champion arrive with they man before rome and shut the city close at the end gain it by storm they take hostage of the citizen to pay they tribute but since the burgess do not observe they covenant the brethren hang the hostage to the number of four and-twenty in the eye of all they kinsfolk when belinus go to he own place he commend rome to the charge of brennus he brother now constantine the son of helena draw from brennus and belinus and in he turn hold rome in he care maximian king of britain after he have conquer france and germany pass the mont st bernard into lombardy and take rome to he keep these mighty king be my near kinsman and each be master of rome thus you have hear and see clearly that not only be i king of britain but by law emperor of rome also so we maintain the rights of we father the roman have have truage of we and my ancestor have take seisin of they they claim britain and i demand rome this be the sum and end of my counsel as regard britain and rome let he have the fief and the rent who be mightier in the field as to france and those other country which have be remove from they hand the roman should not wish to possess that which they may not maintain either the land be not to they mind or they have not the strength to hold it perchance the roman have no rights in the matter and it be by reason of covetousness rather than by love of law that they seek this quarrel let he keep the land who can by the right of the most strong for all these thing the emperor menace we very grievously i pray god that he may do we no harm we fief and goods he promise to take from we and lead we captive in bond to rome we care not overmuch for this and be not greatly fright at he word if he seek we after he boast please god he will have no mind to threaten when he turn again to he own home we accept he challenge and appeal to god 's judgment that all may be render to he keep who be able to maintain it in he hand when arthur the king have make a end of speak in the ear of he baron the word be with those who have hearken to he counsel hoel follow after the king sire say he you have speak much and right prudently nor be there any who can add wisdom to you speech summon now you vassal and meinie together with we who be of you household cross the sea straightway into france and make the realm sure with no further tarry from thence we can pass mont st bernard and overrun lombardy by move swiftly we shall carry the war into the emperor 's own land we shall fright he so greatly that he will have the less leisure to trouble britain you movement moreover will be so unlooked for that the roman will be altogether amaze and quickly confound sire it be the lord 's purpose to exalt you over all the king of the earth hinder not the will of god by doubtfulness he be able to put even rome in you power so only it be accord to he thought remember the book of the sibyl and of the prophecy therein the sibyl write that three king

upon we send you letter with a embassy he deem that britain be no other than it be or he would not demand he measure of tribute press down and run over the roman have raise such a smoke that he finger will quickly be scorch in the flame moreover have the roman keep quiet even have he refrain from threat it become we honor of we own choice to enter on this war to avenge the wrong of we father and to abase he pride the roman ' logic be that they be entitle to receive tribute at we hand by reason that they father in they day take truage of we ancestor if this be so it be no free-will offering of we father but be wrench from they by force so be it by force we take again we own and revenge ourselves for all the pilling of the past we be a perilous people who have prove victor in diver great battle

be welcome of the king and report much concern he this arthur -- say these ancient man -- be a lord amongst king generous and brave lettered and very wise not another king could furnish the riches spend on he state by reason of the attendance of he minister and the glory of they apparel it be useless to seek tribute from arthur since in olden day britain receive tribute of rome now when the senate have hear the report of the messenger and consider the letter wherewith they be charge they be persuade of ambassador and message alike that arthur neither would do homage nor pay they the tribute they demand the senate therefore take counsel with the emperor require he to summon all the empire to he aid they devise that with he host he should pass through the mountain into burgundy and

greatness of he power and of the harness of he man he write letter to each of he captain command he that on a appoint day he should come in ship to barfleur in normandy the lord of he baronage who have repair from the court to they fief hasten to make ready with those whom they should bring across the sea in like manner arthur push on with he business that nothing should hinder or delay arthur commit the care of he realm and of dame guenevere he wife to he nephew mordr a marvellously hardy knight whom arthur love pass well mordred be a man of high birth and of many noble virtue but he be not true he have set he heart on guenevere he kinswoman but such a love bring little honor to the queen mordr have keep this love close for easy enough it be to hide since who would be so bold as to deem that he love he uncle 's dame the lady on she side have give she love to a lord of whom much good be speak but mordr be of she husband 's kin this make the shame more shameworthy ah god the deep wrong do in this season by mordred and the queen arthur have put all the governance in mordred 's power save only the crown go he way to southampton he meinie be lodge about the city whilst he vessel lay within the haven the harbor be fill with the ship they pass to and fro they remain at anchorage they be bind together by cable the carpenter yet be busy upon they with he hammer here the shipman

the haven right diligently the mariner labor spread the sail and make fast the stay they pull stoutly upon the hoist and rope so that the ship run swiftly out to sea then they make the rope secure each in its wonted place the captain who be charge with the safety of the ship set he course carefully whilst pilot and steersman needfully observe he word at he bidding they put the helm to port to lee as they might better fill they sail with the wind as need arise the shipman draw upon the cord and bowline or let the canvas fall upon the deck that the vessel might be the less beat of the wave thus loose and make fast let go and bring quickly to the deck haul and tug at the rope -- so they proceed on they way when night be come they steer they course by the star furl the sail that the wind should not carry they from they path very fearful be the mariner of the dark and go as slowly as they be able pass bold be he that first courteous captain who build the first ship and commit he body to the wind and wave set forth to seek a land he might not see and to find such haven as man have never know now it come to pass that whilst the host voyage in great content with a fair wind towards barfleur that arthur sleep for he be pass heavy and it be night as the king slumber he behold a vision and lo a bear fly high in air towards the east right huge and hideous of body be the bear and marvellously horrible to see also the king see a dragon fly over against he towards the west the brightness of he eye be such that the whole land and sea be fill with the radiance of he glory when these two beast come together the dragon fall upon the bear and the bear defend himself valiantly against he adversary but the dragon put he enemy beneath he and tumble he to the earth crush he utterly in the dust when arthur have sleep for awhile he spirit come to he again and he awake and remember he dream the king call therefore for he wise clerk and related to they and he household the vision that he have see of the bear and of the dragon then certain of these clerk expound to the king he dream and the interpretation thereof the dragon that be beholden of the king signify himself by the bear be show forth a certain horrible giant come from a far land whom he should slay the giant desire greatly that the adventure should end in another fashion nevertheless all would be to the king 's profit but arthur reply my interpretation of the dream be other than yours to I it typify rather the issue of the war between myself and the emperor but let the creator 's will be do after these word no more be speak until the rising of the sun very early in the morning they come to haven at barfleur in normandy presently the host issue from the ship and spread themselves abroad to await the come of those who tarry on the way now they have but dwell for a little while in the land when tiding be bring to the king that a marvellously strong giant newly come from spain have ravish helen the niece of he kinsman hoel this doleful lady the giant have carry to a high place know as st michael 's mount though in that day there be neither church nor monastery on the cliff but all be shut close by the wave of the sea there be none in the country so hardy and strong whether gentle or simple of birth that dare to do battle with the giant or even to come where he lay often enough the folk of the land have gather themselves together and compass about the rock both by land and sea but little have they gain from they labor for the giant have beat they boat amongst the rock so that they be slay or drown therefore they leave he to himself since there be none to hinder he pleasure the peasant of the realm be exceed sorrowful they enemy spoil they house harry they cattle bear away they wife and child and return to he fastness on the mount the villein lurk in the wood from he wrath they perish of misery in secret place so that the whole land be barren because there be none to labor in the field this marvellous giant have to name dinabuc not a soul but pray that he might come to a evil end when arthur hear these lamentable tiding he call to he kay the seneschal and bedevere he cupbearer for he would open he counsel to no other man he tell they he purpose to depart from the camp that same night privily take none with he save themselves alone none but they would know of he errand for he ride to the mount to be assure as to whether he or the giant be the stouter champion all through the night the three ride together spare not the spur at daybreak they come upon the ford that lead across the water to the mount look towards the mount they behold a burning fire upon the hill that might be see from very far over against the mount be set another hill near by and of lesser height and upon this hill also a fire of coal arthur gaze from hill to mountain he doubt where the giant lodge and in which of these two high place he should come upon he there be no man to ask of he dwelling nor to tell of he outgoing arthur bade bedevere to go first to the one and then to the other hill seek news of the giant when he have find that which he seek he must return swiftly bring good tiding bedevere set forth upon he quest he enter into a little boat and row over to that mount which be nearer he could cross in no other manner for the tide be very full and all the sand be cover of the sea bedevere get he from the boat and begin to climb the hill as he climb he stand still for a space and hearken from above bedevere might hear a noise of sore weep and loud lamentation and doleful sigh the knight grow cold at the heart root by reason of he exceed fear since he deem to have come upon the giant at he play presently the courage return to he breast and draw the sword from its sheath he advance stoutly up the hill bedevere consider within himself that it be better for a knight to die rather than know himself a coward he reproach himself for he tearfulness and in heart and hope desire only to bring the adventure to a good end he wish prove but vain when bedevere win the summit of the mountain there be no giant but only a flaming fire and close by the fire a new-digged grave the knight draw near this fire with the sword yet naked in he hand lie beside the grave he find a old woman with rent raiment and streaming hair lament she wretched case she bewail also the fate of helen make great dole and sorrow with many shrill cry when this piteous woman behold bedevere upon the mount oh wretched man she exclaim what be thy name and what misadventure lead

to the foot of the hill there they dismount give they mantle and destrier to the charge of the squire arthur bedevere and kay the three together begin briskly to climb the mount after they have climb for a while arthur spake to he fellow : comrade i go before to do battle with the giant for you part you must follow a little after but let neither of you be so bold as to aid I in my quarrel so long as i have strength to strive be the buffet what they may stand you still unless he beat I to the ground it be not seemly that any save one should have lot in this business nevertheless so you see I in utmost peril and fear come swiftly to my succor nor let I find death at he hand sir kay and sir bedevere make this covenant with they lord and the three knight together set forth again up the hill now when arthur draw near to the summit of the mount he behold the giant crouch above he fire he broil a hog within the flame upon a spit part of the flesh he have eat already and part of the meat be char and burn in the fire he be the more hideous to see because he beard and hair be foul with blood and coal arthur trust to take he thus unready before he could get to he mace but the giant spy he adversary and all amarvell leap lightly on he foot he raise the club above he shoulder albeit so heavy that no two peasant of the country could lift it from the ground arthur see the giant afoot and the blow about to fall he grip he sword dress the buckler high to guard he head the giant strike with all he strength upon the shield so that the mountain ring like a anvil the stroke be stark and arthur stand maze at the blow but he be hardy and strong and do not reel when the king come to himself and mark the shield shatter on he arm he be marvellously wroth he raise he sword and strike full at the giant 's brow the blow be shrewd and would have bring the combat to a end have not the giant parry with he mace even so he head be sorely hurt and the blood run down he face that he might not see when the giant know that he be wound to he hurt he become in he rage as a beast possess he turn grimly on he adversary even as the boar tear of the hound and mangled by the hunting knife turn on the hunter fill with ire and malice the giant rush blindly on the king heedless of the sword he fling he arm about he and put forth the full measure of he might bear arthur to he knee arthur be ardent and swift and ready of wit he remember he manhood and struggle upright on he foot he be altogether angered and fearful of what might hap since strength could not help he call subtlety to he aid arthur make he body stiff like a rod and hold himself close for he be pass strong he feign to spring on he foe but turn aside slip quickly from under the giant 's arm when arthur know he person free of these band he pass swiftly to and fro elude he enemy 's clasp now he be here now there ofttime striking with the sword the giant run blindly about grope with he hand for he eye be full of blood and he know not white from black sometimes arthur be before he sometimes behind but never in he grip till at the end the king smite he so fiercely with excalibur that the blade clove to he brain and he fall he cry out in he pain and the noise of he fall and of this exceed bitter cry be as fetter of iron torment by the storm arthur stand a little apart and gaze upon he adversary he laugh aloud in he mirth for he anger be well-nigh go he command bedevere he cupbearer to strike off the giant 's head and deliver it to the squire that they might bear it to the host for the greater marvel bedevere do after he lord 's behest he draw he sword and divide the head from the shoulder wonderfully huge and hideous to sight be the head of this giant never say arthur have he known such fear neither have meet so perilous a giant save only that riton who have grieve so many fair king this riton in he day make war upon diver king of these some be slay in battle and other remain captive in he hand alive or dead riton use they despitefully for it be he wont to shave the beard of these king and purfle therewith a cloak of fur that he wear very rich vainglorious beyond measure be riton of he broidered cloak now by reason of folly and lightness riton send message to arthur bidding he shave he beard and commend it forthwith to the giant in all good will since arthur be a mightier lord and a more virtuous prince than he fellow riton make covenant to prefer he beard before theirs and hold it in honor as the most silken fringe of he mantle should arthur refuse to grant riton the trophy then nought be there to do but that body to body they must fight out they quarrel in single combat alone he who might slay he adversary or force he to own himself vanquish should have the beard for he guerdon together with the mantle of fur fringe and garniture and all arthur accord with the giant that this should be so they meet in battle on a high place call mount aravius in the far east and there the king slew riton with the sword spoil he of that rich garment of fur with its border of dead king ' beard therefore say arthur that never since that day have he strive with so perilous a giant nor with one of whom he be so sorely fright nevertheless dinabuc be bigger and mightier than be riton even in the prime of he youth and strength for a monster more loathly and horrible a giant so hideous and misshapen be never slay by man than the devil arthur kill to himself that day in mont st michel over against the sea after arthur have slam the monster and bedevere have take he head they go they way to the host in great mirth and content they reach the camp and show the spoil to all who would for they heart be high with that which they have do hoel be pass sorrowful for that fair lady he niece make great lamentation for a while over she who be lose in so fearsome a fashion in token of he dolor he bud on the mount a chapel to we lady st mary that man call helen 's tomb to this very day although this fair chapel be raise above the grave of this piteous lady and be yet hight tombelame none give a think to the damsel after whom it be name nothing more have i to relate concern this adventure and would tell you now of that which happen to the host when the man of ireland and those other for whom arthur tarry have join themselves to the host the king set forth a day 's march every day through normandy without pause or rest he and he fellowship pass across france tarry neither at town nor castle and come speedily into burgundy the king would get to autun as swiftly as he might for the roman be spoil the land and lucius they emperor together with a great company purpose to enter in the city now when arthur draw to the ford lead across the water of the aube he spy and certain peasant of those part come near and warn he privily concern the emperor who lay but a little way thence so that the king could seek he if he would the roman have sheltered they in tent and in lodge of branch they be as the sand of the shore for multitude so that the peasant marvel that the earth could bring forth for the footman and horse never might the king store and garner in that day for where he reap with one lucius the emperor would reap with four arthur be in no wise dismayed at they word he have go through many and diver peril and be a valiant knight have faith and affiance in god on a little hill near this river aube arthur build earthwork for he host make the place exceed strong he close the door fast and put therein a great company of knight and man at arm to hold it close in this fortress he set he harness and store so that he could repair thither to he camp in time of need when all be do arthur summon to he counsel two lord whom he esteem for fair and ready speech these two lord be of high peerage guerin of chartre be one and the other be that boso earl of oxford right learn in the law to these two baron arthur add gawain who have dwell in rome for so long a space this arthur do by reason that gawain be a good clerk meetly school and hold in much praise and honor by he friend in rome these three lord the king purpose to send as a embassy to the emperor they be to bear he message bid the roman to turn again to they own land nor seek to enter france for it pertain to the king should lucius persist in he purpose refuse to return whence he come then let he give battle on the earliest day to determine whether arthur or he have the better right this thing be certain so long as arthur have breath he would maintain he claim to france despite the roman power he have gain it by the sword and it be he by right of conquest in ancient day rome in she turn hold it by the same law then let the god of battle decide whether britain or rome have the fairer right to france the messenger of the king apparel themselves richly for they master 's honor they mount on they fairest destrier vest in hauberk of steel with lace helmet and shield hang round they neck they take they weapon in they hand and ride forth from the camp now when certain knight and diver bold and reckless varlet see the embassy make ready to seek the emperor they come to gawain and give he freely of they counsel these exhort he that when he reach the court to which he fare he should act in such fashion right or wrong that a war would begin which have threaten overlong yea to use such speech that if no matter of dispute should be find at the meeting there might yet be quarrel enough when they part the embassy accord therefore that they would so do as to constrain the roman to give battle gawain and he comrade cross a mountain and come through a wood upon a wide plain at no great distance they behold the tent and lodge of the host when the roman see the three knight issue from the wood they draw near to look upon they face and to inquire of they business they ask of they concern whom they seek and if for peace they have come within the camp but the three knight refuse to answer for good or evil until they be lead before the lord of rome the embassy get from they horse before the emperor 's pavilion they give they bridle to the hand of the page but as to they sword conceal they beneath they mantle the three knight show neither salutation nor courtesy when they stand in the emperor 's presence they rehearse over arthur 's message whilst lucius hearken attentively to they word each of the ambassador say that which pleased he to be say and tell over what he hold proper to be tell the emperor listen to each and all without interruption after he have consider at he leisure he purpose to reply we come from arthur we lord say gawain and bear to thee he message he be we king and we be he liegeman so it become we to speak only the word he have put in we mouth by we he ambassador he bid you refrain from set a foot in france he forbid you to intermeddle with the realm for it be he and he will defend he right with such power that very certainly you may not snatch it from he hand arthur require you to seek nothing that be he if however you challenge he claim to france then battle shall prove he title good and by battle you shall be throw back to you own land once upon a time the roman conquer this realm by force and by force they maintain they right let battle decide again whether rome or britain have the power to keep come forth to-morrow with thy host so that it may be prove whether you or we shall hold france if you fear this thing then go you way in peace as indeed be best for what else be there to do the game be play and rome and you have lose lucius the emperor make answer that he do not purpose to return to he realm france be he fief and he would visit he own if he might not pursue he road to-day why then to-morrow but in heart and hope he deem himself mighty enough to conquer france and to take all in he seisin now quintilian the nephew of the emperor be seat by he side he take the word suddenly from he uncle 's mouth for he be a pass proud youth quick to quarrel and very bitter in speech the briton cry he be know to all as a vainglorious people they threaten readily and they boast and brag more readily still we have listen to they menace but we remember they be of those who boast the more because they act the less quintilian as i deem would have continue with yet other grievous word but gawain who be hot with anger draw forth he sword and spring forward make the head fly from he shoulder he cry to he comrade that they should get to they horse and the earl win they way from the pavilion gawain with they and they with he each seize he steed by the bridle and climb nimbly in the saddle then they ride forth from the camp shield on shoulder and lance in hand ask no leave of any the patrician within the pavilion sit silent for a space after that bitter stroke the emperor be the first to come from he amazement why sit you here cry lucius follow after those man who have set this shame upon we ill fall the day if they come not to my hand the bravest of he household run from the tent cry for harness and horse from every side arise the shout swiftly swiftly bridle and spur gallop gallop the whole host be mightily move together they set saddle on destrier and lead the steed from the stable they gird they baldric about they and take they lance spur after the fugitive the three baron prick swiftly across the plain they look this way and that often glance behind they to mark how nearly they be follow the roman pursue they pell-mell some on the beaten road and other upon the heavy field they come by two

snare the briton have lime peredur move promptly he hasten with ten thousand shield to the plain and by sheer force and number bear the briton back to the wood for they be not mighty enough to contend against he in the field the briton hold the wood strongly and defend it right manfully peredur might not take it for all he cunning and lose there largely of he company the briton lure the roman within the covert and slew they in the gloom so hot and so perilous be the melley fight between the valley and the wood arthur take think to the tarry of he messenger and remember that those come not again whom he send to they aid the king summon yder the son of nut to he counsel he commit to he charge seven thousand horse and rider and despatch they after the other bid he seek until he find yder draw to the plain gawain and boso yet strive like champion and for the rest there be not one but do what he could from afar yder hear the cry and the tumult as the host contend together when the briton behold yder 's company they be refresh mightily in heart and hope they assail they adversary so fiercely that they win back the ground which be lose yder lead he horseman like a brave knight and a cunning captain he charge so vigorously with he company that many a saddle be empty many a good horse take and many a rider shocked peredur sustain the battle stoutly and wheeling about return to the field he be a crafty captain know well the hour to charge and to wheel to press hard on the fugitive or to wait many a fair charge do he lead that day he who be valiant find peredur yet more bold whoso be mind to tourney find peredur yet more willing to break a spear he bailly smite more terribly with the sword than ever they be stricken so that three hundred horseman and over lay dead upon the field when the briton mark the deed of peredur they could not be contain they break from they rank and company and run upon the foe they be desirous beyond measure to joust with they adversary and to show forth they prowess above all thing they be covetous of honor so that for chivalry they bring the battle to confusion so only they strive hand to hand with the roman they give no thought to the end peredur wish nothing better he hold he bailly closely together push home and draw off accord to need many a time he charge amongst the briton and many a time he return bring he wound from they midst boso of oxford regard the battle he see he dead upon the ground he mark the craft with which peredur -- that great captain -- sustain the roman and know well that all be lose save that peredur be slay how might the courage of a rash and foolish company prevail against the discipline of the roman host boso call about he the best and bravest of he captain lord he say give I you counsel you in whom arthur put he trust have enter on this battle without any commandment of we lord if well befall all will be well if ill he will require he sergeant at we hand should we be vile and niddering enough to gain no honor on the field very surely we shall receive yet more shame as we portion when we come into he presence we one hope be to fight against none great or small save only with peredur alive or dead he must be make captive and deliver into arthur 's power until peredur be take we shall never draw off in honor from the stour but must suffer yet greater loss than before if then you would make he prisoner follow after where i will lead and do that thing which you shall see I do the captain therefore plight faith to follow he ensample and in no wise to depart from he command boso bring together as many horseman as he might and range they in order of battle he send out spy to bring he tiding where that peredur should be meet who lead the roman so craftily the spy depart on they perilous errand and return presently proclaim that peredur ride with the host in that place where the press be thickest and the battle draw never to a end boso ride with he company straight to the heart of the stour he hurtle upon the roman and look on peredur fight he way to he side when they horse stand together boso flung he arm about he adversary and drag he amongst the briton then of he will he hurl himself to the ground and with he tumble sir peredur a very marvellous adventure be it to behold boso fall from he destrier in the hottest of the battle clasp peredur closely in he arm the two champion strive mightily but boso be above and for nothing would unloose he hold the bailly of peredur hasten fiercely to the rescue of they captain those whose lance be still unbroken charge till the stave be splintered when they lance fail they at need they lay on with they sword work havoc amongst the briton at any price the roman would rescue they captain and the briton be in the same mind to succor boso in he jeopardy never might heart desire to see battle array more proudly never be there a fairer strife of sword never a more courteous contention of valiant man plume and helmet be abase to the dust shield be cleave the hauberk rent asunder ash stave knapped like reed girth be break saddle void and strong man throw and brave man wound to the death the thunder of the shout fill the field the briton cry as arthur have teach they and the roman answer with the name of rome the one party do all that valiant man be able to guard they captive in they midst and the other to pluck they captain from amongst they so confuse be the contention so disorder the combat that man as they strive together hardly know roman from briton friend from foe save only by the cry they shout and by the tongue they speak in the stour gawain fling himself in the press hew a path towards boso with mighty stroke of the sword with point and edge thrust and cut he beat down many and put diver to flight not a roman of they all could prevail against he nor so he might would strive to hinder he in he road from another side of the field yder set he face to the same end a woodman be he clear a bloody path amongst the tree guerin of chartre aid he like a loyal comrade each cover he fellow with the shield the three champion draw before peredur and boso and drag they to they foot they bring a steed to boso and give a sword to he hand as for peredur the crafty captain who have do they so many and such great mischief they hold he strongly they carry he from the press to they own line for the greater surety there they leave he bind under the charge of trusty warder and straightway return to the battle now the roman have lose they captain they be as a ship upon the water without a rudder that drift here and there have neither aim nor direction at the bidding of the wind and wave such be the plight of the bailly which be spoil of its captain for a army without a constable be less a army than a flock of sheep the briton deal mercilessly with they beaten foe they press hardly upon the roman smite down and slaying many they make captive of the fall strip they of wealth and armor and pursued hotly after the fugitive these they bind with cord and come again in triumph to they companion in the wood together with they prisoner the briton carry peredur the wise captain to the camp and bestow he upon arthur they lord they render also to he hand diver other prisoner of less value than he arthur thank they for they gift he promise to recompense each for he goodwill when he return a victor to he realm arthur set he captive fast in prison whence they could in nowise break out afterwards he take counsel with he baron to convey the prisoner to pari and guard they close in he castle until the king 's pleasure concern they be know he fear to keep they with the host lest -- watch as he would -- they should escape from he ward arthur make ready a strong company to bring they to paris and set governor over they he give peredur and he fellow into the charge of four earl of high lineage namely cador borel richier and bedevere he butler these baron rise very early in the morning and bring the roman from they prison like careful warder they put the captive in they midst and set out on they journey ride right warily now lucius the emperor have learn from he spy that the earl purpose to start at daybreak on they road to pari lucius prepared ten thousand rider on horse he bid they travel the whole night through outstrip the briton and devise such

rome each of these lord be a wealthy man of he land and a skilful captain in war lucius have choose they from all they fellow and lay he charge straitly upon they to succor they comrade in they need these be the lord of the host the ten thousand horseman in mail set out at nightfall on they errand certain peasant of the land go with they to guide they by the surest way they travel throughout the night spare not the spur till they come forth on the paris road there they search out a likely place where they might hide they in ambush and hold themselves close and coy until it be day very early in the morning the pricker of the host send tiding that the briton be near at hand arthur 's man ride in all surety deem they have nought to fear they be order in two company cador and borel lead the

harness follow at the earl ' back have the captive in they midst they have tie they wrist behind they and fasten they foot with rope under the belly of the horse so they prick all unwitting into the snare the roman have spread when cador and borel be in the net the roman sally forth from they hide the hard ground tremble beneath the thunder of the destrier ' hoof they charge home fiercely amongst they adversary but for all they amazement the briton sustain the shock like man bedevere and richier give ear to the tumult and the noise of the shout they first thought be to the prisoner these they set in a sure place give they to the charge of they squire and command that they should be guard strictly then they hasten amain to the breaking of spear the adversary clash together with all they strength the roman drift here and there in little clump of lance for they mind be less to discomfit the briton than to release the captive from they bond for they part the briton keep they order and fare boldly among the enemy pass heavy be the roman because of the prisoner they might not find very grievous be the count of they horseman who perish in the search now the captain divide the briton

draw from the man of he household king evander perceive the loss and the peril cause to he host by reason of they divide mind since the captive could not be meet with he check the hastiness of he meinie he draw back he horseman and range they in order then he return to the battle it befall therefore that the roman bear away the prize and have the better of they adversary they work much damage to the briton make many prisoner they slew moreover four of the mightiest and most valiant lord of they enemy at that time perish yder a faithful knight courageous and pass strong hirelga of peritum die too this day there be no hardier knight than he ahduc of tintagel also for whom he kin make wondrous sorrow besides these be slay sir amaury of the island but whether he be welsh or briton i do

they adversary since many be kill and where one briton stand ten roman oppose themselves over against he doubtless they have be utterly discomfited and the captive wrest from they hand have not

and he company ride into the press with lowered lance and scarlet spur a hundred horseman and more be hurl from they steed in that shock never to climb in the saddle again the roman be altogether fearful and esmayed make complaint of they pitiful plight they deem that arthur himself have fall upon they with all he meinie at he back they heart turn to water by reason of the number of they dead the levy of poitou close about they and the briton fail not at need each company strive to outvie its fellow contend earnestly for the greater glory the roman could do no more they turn about and flee

be take and of they fellowship six hundred and more be destroy of these diver be slay and other make captive the briton take spoil of prisoner accord to they desire and retain of these as they might then they return by the road to the place where the combat be win the briton go about the field search amongst the dead for borel the stout earl of le man they find he among the fall beble with blood
