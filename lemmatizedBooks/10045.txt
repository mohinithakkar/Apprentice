anyone else in authority i have no occasion to report reply dave dryly i be not in any way in command over pennington but i mean to persuade he to report himself for what he have do but that would ruin he protest hallam aghast he would not even be allow to start on the cruise he would be railroad home without loss of a moment yet you have just say that a opium-user be not fit to go on in the brigade retort darrin hang it it be hard to know what to do rejoin hallam wrinkle he forehead of course we want to be just to pen it do not strike I as be just exactly a question of justice to pennington darrin go on earnestly if this be anything it be a question of midshipman honor we fellow be bind to see that all the unworthy one be drop from the service now a fellow who have fasten the opium habit on himself be not fit to go on be he oh say but this be a hard one to settle groan hallam then i 'll take all the responsibility upon myself say dave promptly i do not want to make any mistake and i do not believe i be go to wait just a moment go to the rear room dave face he three comrade there with the question : you three be enough to take care of everything here for a few minute be not you yes nod dan what be up hallam and i be go for a brief walk then step back into the front room darrin nod to he classmate who follow he outside just come along and say nothing about the matter on the street request dave it might be overhear where be you go question hallam wonderingly wait and see please from chow hop 's wretched establishment it be not far to the other building that dave have in mind as a destination but when they arrive and stand at the foot of the step hallam clutch darrin 's arm hold he back why see here this be the police station i know it dave reply calmly but see here you be not -- i be not go to drag you into anything that you would object to darrin continued come along all i want you for be as a witness to what i be go to say do not do it old fel -- i have think that over and i feel that i must reply dave firmly come along do not attract attention by stand here argue in another instant the two midshipman be go swiftly up the step the chief of police receive he two caller courteously dave tell the official how they attention have be call to the fact that one of they number be in a opium joint dave name the place but request the chief to wait a full hour before take any action that will give we a chance to get out a comrade who may have commit only he first offense dave continue if there be any opium be smoke in that place i 'll surely close the joint out reply the chief bring he fist down upon he desk but i understand you reason mr -- darrin be my name sir reply dave quietly so mr darrin i give you my word that i will not even start my investigation before this evening and i 'll keep all quiet about the midshipman end of it thank you very much sir say dave gratefully as the two midshipman stroll slowly back in the direction of chow hop 's dave murmur : now you see why i take this step i be afraid not very clearly reply midshipman hallam that scoundrelly chow make he boast that other midshipman patronize he place i do not believe it such a vice would not appeal to you and it do not to I but there be more than two hundred new plebe come in just now and many of these boy have never be away from home before some of they might foolishly seek the lure of a new vice and might find the habit fasten on they before they be aware of it chow 's vile den might spoil some good material for the quarter-deck and as a matter of midshipman honor we be bind to see that the place be clean out right away i guess darry you come pretty near be right assent hallam after think for a few moment by the time they reach chow hop 's again they find that dr lawrence have bring the unfortunate pennington to and a very scared and humiliated midshipman it be who now stand up a bit unsteadily and try to smooth down he uniform how do you feel now ask dave awful shudder pennington and now see here what be you fellow go to do blab and see I drive out of the navy do not do any talk in here advise dave with a meaning look over he shoulder at the yellow man in the outer room doctor be we friend in shape to walk along with we now he will be in two or three minute after he drink something i be go to give he reply the medical man shake a few drop from each of three vial into a glass of water here young man drink this slowly three minute later the midshipman leave the place dave walk beside pennington and hold he arm lightly for the purpose of steadying he how do this happen pen query dave when the six man of the third class at last find themselves walk down maryland avenue how long have you be at this ` hop ' trick never before to-day reply midshipman pennington quickly pen will you tell I that on you honor ask dave gravely the other midshipman flare up why must i give you my word of honor he demand defiantly be not my plain word good enough you word of honor that you have never smoke opium before to-day would help to ease my mind a whole lot reply darrin come unburden yourself will not you pen i 'll tell you darry just how it happen to-day _ be _ the first time on my word of honor i come out into annapoli with a rage toothache now you know how a fellow get to hate to go before the medical officer of the academy with a tale about he tooth yes i do nodded darrin if a fellow be too much on the medical report for trouble with he tooth then it make the surgeon look he mouth over with all the more caution and in the end a fellow may get drop from the brigade just because he have invite over zeal from the dentist but what have all this to do with opium smoking just this reply pennington hang he head i go into a drug store and ask a clerk that i know what be the best thing for toothache he tell I the best he know be to smoke a pipe of opium and tell I where to find chow hop and what to say to the chink and it be all a lie about opium help a sore tooth cry the wretched midshipman clap a hand to he jaw for there go that fiendish tooth again but say you fellow be not go to leak about my little mishap no reply darrin with great promptness you be go to do that yourself what gasp midshipman pennington in intense astonishment what be you talk about you 'll be wise to turn in a report on what happen pursued dave for it be likely to reach official ear anyway and you 'll be better off if you make the first report on the subject why be it likely to reach official ear if you fellow keep you mouth shut you see darrin go on very quietly i report the joint at the police station and chow hop threaten that if i do he would tell all he know about everybody so you would better be first -- you break the game out to the police gasp pennington stare dumfoundedly at he comrade what on earth -- i do it because i have more than one satisfactory reason for consider it my duty interpose dave speak quietly though firmly you -- you -- bag of wind explode midshipman pennington i 'll accept you apology when you have have time to think it all over reply dave with a smile though there be a brief flash in he eye i 'll make no apology to you -- at any time you -- you -- greaser mark for efficiency or good conduct which increase a midshipman 's standing be call grease-mark or grease in midshipman slang hence a midshipman who be accuse of currying favor with he officer in order to win grease be contemptuously term a greaser i do not want to talk with you any more mr darrin pennington go on bitterly or walk with you either when i get over this toothache i 'll call you out -- you greaser burn with indignation midshipman pennington fall back to walk with hallam chapter ii

commandant and tell he all you know i suppose sneer pennington you know better pen now begin to practice keep a civil tongue behind you tooth with that darrin turn on he heel seek the deck this leave pen to conjecture as to whether he should report he misadventure and if so how best to go about it see here hallam begin the worried midshipman i begin to feel that it will be safer to turn in some kind of report on myself much safer agree hallam it will show good faith on you part if you report yourself and get I break from the service too i suppose growl the unhappy one i hardly think it will if you report yourself first urge hallam but you 'll be about certain to get you walk papers if you wait for the first information to come from other source hang it groan pennington i wish i could think but my head ache as though it would split and my tooth be put up more trouble than i ever know there be in the world and in this rack condition i be to go and put myself on the pap-sheet in what

into trouble reply pennington with a quiver in he voice what be that ask dr mackenzie glance at he sharply do you try the aid of liquor worse i be afraid sir worse pennington tell of he experience with the opium pipe that be no good whatever for a toothache sir growl dr mackenzie besides it be a serious breach of discipline i shall have to report you mr pennington i expect it sir reply pennington meekly however the report will not cure you toothache continue dr mackenzie in a milder tone we 'll attend to that first the surgeon busy himself with dissolve a drug in a small quantity of water this he take up in a hypodermic needle and inject into the lower jaw the ache ought to stop in ten minute sir continue the surgeon turn to enter some memorandum in he record book after that the surgeon call up the ship 's commander over the ` phone and make known pennington 's report mr pennington captain scott direct that you report at he office immediately say the surgeon as he turn away from the telephone very good sir thank you sir both midshipmen salute then leave the sick-bay this be where you have to go up alone i guess hint midshipman hallam i be afraid so sigh pennington

possession of all the fact relate to the unfortunate affair of midshipman pennington mr darrin begin captain scott after the interchange of salute will you tell I why you report the affair to the police i go to the police sir dave reply because i be aware that many member of the new fourth class be away from home for the first time in they life i be afraid sir that possibly some of the new midshipman might during one of they town-leaf be tempt to try for a new experience a very excellent reason mr darrin and i commend you heartily for it i shall also report you exemplary conduct to the commandant of midshipman you have in my opinion mr darrin display very good judgment and you act upon that judgment with promptness and decision but i be afraid continue the navy captain dryly that you have do something that will make you highly unpopular for a while with some of the member of you class i hope not sir reply dave so do i smile captain scott i be willing to find myself a poor prophet that be all mr darrin once more salute dave leave the commanding officer 's presence almost the first classmate into whom he stumble be dan dalzell well from what quarter do the wind blow murmur dan darrin repeat the interview that he have just have i be afraid dave little giant that you have plant something of a mine under yourself murmur dalzell i feel as much convinced as ever danny boy that i do just what i should have do reply darrin seriously and so do captain scott and so will the commandant reply dan but win the commendation of you superior officer do not always imply that you 'll get much praise from you classmate unfortunately you be quite right smile dave still i would do the same thing over again oh of course you would assent dan that be because you be dave darrin here a voice like a bass horn be hear all third classman report to the quarter-deck immediately this order be repeat in other part of the ship midshipman gather with a rush pennington and hallam be the only member absent as soon as the third classman or youngster as they be call in midshipman parlance have form the order be read off divide they into section for practical instruction aboard ship during the cruise dave 's name be one of the first read off he be assign to duty as section leader for the first section in electrical instruction dalzell farley hallam pennington and other be detail as member of that section the same section be also designate for steam instruction dalzell be make leader of the section in this branch the class be then dismiss somewhat later pennington and hallam return from they interview with the commandant hallam at once seek out dave darry old man murmur hallam pen be as crazy as a hornet against you as he have take the first step by stick himself on the pap-sheet -lrb- place himself on report -rrb- the commandant say he would make the punishment a lighter one what do pen get query dave fifty demerit with all the loss of privilege that fifty carry he be lucky declare dave promptly have the report come from other source he would have be dismiss from the service if pen 's lucky rejoin hallam he do not seem to realize the fact he be call you about everything he can keep that up flash dave until he toothache leave he then if he try to carry it any further pen will collide with one of my fist not much later a call sound summon the youngster to the midshipman 's mess dave be glad to note that pennington sit at some distance from he at table while the meal be in progress the massachusett and the other battleship get under way the midshipman be on deck a hour later when the fleet come to anchor for the night some mile down chesapeake bay before the youngster be order to they berth that night third classman pennington have find opportunity to do a good deal of talk to a few comrade who would listen to he pennington be determine to stir up a hornet 's nest for dave darrin chapter iii midshipman pennington go too far at eight o'clock the follow morning the various section be form and march to the deck dave report : all present sir the chief electrician be now summon and to he the section be turn over this young man whittam by name be a enlist man but a bright young sample of what the navy can do for the boy who enlist as a apprentice you will take you order from mr whittam as though he be a officer direct the officer he word intend for all member of the section though he look only at darrin dave salute then as chief electrician whittam turn to lead the way dave call quietly : section leave wheel -- march they follow whittam down into the dynamo room a interesting spot for a machinist it be fine muttered dan as he stare about he at the bright metal work the switch-board and the revolving machine but i be afraid i could not learn the use and sense of all this in five year silence in the section command dave turn around upon he chum whittam now begin a short preliminary talk upon the subject in which the midshipman would be require to qualify one of the first and most important request i have to make say whittam presently be that none of you touch the switch except by direction none of you can guess the harm that might follow the careless and ignorant handling of a switch it be pretty cheeky for a enlist man to talk to midshipman about ignorance whisper pennington to farley oh i do not know -- farley start to reply but darrin 's quiet voice break in with authority : cease talk in section farley know this to be a merit rebuke and accept it as such but pennington 's face go violently red confound that grease-spot-chaser growl pen he 'll be bind to take it out of I as long as the cruise last but i 'll get even with he no cheap greaser be go to ride over I that morning none of the midshipman be call upon to handle any of the fascinating-looking machinery nearly the whole of this tour of practical instruction be take up by the remark of the chief electrician as he speak whittam move over to one piece or another of mechanism and explain its use finally he begin to question the attentive young man to see how much of he instruction they have absorb this be a shame to set a enlist man up over we as quiz-master just to see how little we know growl pennington but this time he have the good sense not to address he remark to anyone pennington be not yet in good shape after he harrowing experience of the day before ere the tour of instruction be over he begin to shift somewhat uneasily then he attention begin to wander a brilliantly shine brass rod near he catch he eye something about the glossy metal fascinate he once or twice pen put out he hand to touch the rod but as quickly reconsider and draw back he hand at last however the temptation prove too strong he slide one hand along the rail here sir do not handle that rasp in the voice of whittam pennington draw back he hand a flush mount to he face the fellow have no right to talk to a midshipman in that fashion quiver pennington to himself but it be the fault of that low-minded greaser darrin anyway darrin see I and he glance swiftly at the chief electrician to draw attention to I it be only just to pennington to state that he actually believe he have see dave do this darrin however be not guilty of the act he have in no way seek to direct attention at pennington towards the close of the tour the officer in whose department this instruction fall pass through the dynamo room be there any breach of conduct to be report whittam inquire the officer halt nothing worth mention sir reply the chief electrician i ask you whittam whether there have be any breach of conduct retort the officer with some asperity one midshipman sir after have be instruct to touch nothing rest he hand on one of the brass rod he name i do not know the name of many of the young gentleman yet sir so i do not know the particular midshipman 's name sir then point he out to I insist the officer there be hardly any need to do so pennington 's face flush with mortification be sufficient identification but the chief electrician step over halt in front of the hapless one and say : this be the young gentleman sir you name sir demand the officer pennington sir mr pennington you will place yourself on the report sir for disobedience of order command the officer be this the only case whittam the only case sir the officer pass out of the dynamo room leave the unlucky one more than ever angry with darrin whom he incorrectly charge with he present trouble the recall sound dave turn to whittam say crisply but pleasantly : thank you for we instruction he be thank the fellow for my new scrape growl pennington inwardly dave march he section back to deck and dismiss it dan dalzell as section leader in steam instruction immediately re-form it you will report in the engine-room mr dalzell to lieutenant-commander forman who be chief engineer of this ship he will assign you to a instructor aye aye sir dan reply salute section right wheel -- march dan already know where down in the bowels of the great battleship to find the engine room reach that department dan halt he section section all present sir report dan salute a strange officer who however wear the insignia of a lieutenant-commander you name sir inquire the officer dalzell sir let you section break rank then you may all follow I and keep

ought to know it too muse dan the class history of the last year should have teach he that but see here dave i do not believe pen will do anything openly he will construct a series of plausible

not want any with you reply pennington insolently as he stare at dave from under much-raised eyebrow he would have go by but dave spring squarely in front of he just wait a moment warn dave rather imperiously for he be aglow with justifiable indignation well demand pennington halt out with it whatever you may think you have to say i have two thing to speak about reply dave try to control he voice in the first place while go down the ladder to the furnace this morning you step on my shoulder well insist pennington coldly the second thing you do be when haul the fire to drop red-hot metal across one of my shoe set it on fire well insist pennington more coldly if you mean to contend that either one be a accident resume dave then -- but he find himself oblige to pause for a moment in order to steady he voice well ask pennington with more insolence than ever if you make such pretense in either case titter dave darrin then you be a liar fellow sputter pennington turn white with

in time to see what be go on chapter iv a little meeting ashore stop it both of you whisper dan stand at attention ready to salute the officer pennington with the blood flow from he damaged nose would have make a most ludicrous figure salute the instant that he see such evidence as pen 's nose present the officer would be bind to make inquiry then just as surely he next step must be to border the three before the commandant of midshipmen fighting carry with it a severe penalty even dan be certain to be report through the mere fact of he presence there as aid in a fight and those who aid be punish as severely as the principal themselves it be a tense fearsome instant for midshipman have be dismiss from the naval academy for this very offense the passage be not brilliantly light the on-coming officer a lieutenant junior grade be look at the floor as he come along suddenly he pause seem lose in thought then wheel and walk back whence he have come dan breathe more easily dave heave a sigh of relief as for pennington that midshipman have wheel and be steal rapidly down the passageway intent only on escape that be the closest squeak we 'll ever have without be ragged cold murmured dalzell tremulously where be pennington demand dave wheeling about after he have watch the naval lieutenant out of sight duck out of sight like a submarine chuckle dan at that moment the call for midshipman 's dinner formation sound dave and dan be ready pennington show up just after the line have start to march into the midshipman 's mess table to the inquiry of the officer in charge pen lamely explain that he have bump he nose into something hard in a poorly light passageway though the officer accept the excuse he smile within himself it be not iron or steel that bump that young man 's nose think the officer oh the middy have not change a lot since i bone at annapoli pennington 's nose be no very lovely member of he face at that moment it have be strike hard mashed rather flat and now look like a red bulb meet with a accident pen ask hallam curiously at table quit you kidding please request pennington sulkily that direct the curious glance of other middy at pennington 's new bulbous nose the young man be so brusque about it however that other table mate cease quiz he yet as soon as the meal be over many a youngster ask other of he class for news regard pen but none possess it during the brief rest that follow the meal however midshipman pennington make it he business to try to meet dave darrin alone he succeed find dave stare off across the water at the port rail of course mr darrin begin the other midshipman in a voice suggestive of ice you be aware that the incident of a hour ago can not be allow to pass unnoticed i do not believe there be any danger of that retort darrin with a ironical glance at pennington 's damaged-looking nose confound you sir hiss the other midshipman do not you dare to be insolent with I why i have think observe dave that of you own choice the period of courtesy between we have pass i shall call you out mr darrin you 'll find my hearing excellent smile dave i shall make but one stipulation i 'll do you the favor of ask what that stipulation be sneer pennington why after the narrow escape we have from be catch and report a hour or so ago i shall ask that the fight be hold where we be not so likely to be catch at it i do not care about be drop from the naval academy nor do i believe you do it would be a good thing for the service if one of we be to be drop sneer pennington yes oh well you can easily procure write material from the captain 's clerk volunteer dave generously on a cruise i believe a resignation be send direct to the commandant of midshipman this ridicule serve only to fan the flame of pennington 's wrath darrin he hiss the academy be not big enough to hold we both but i have already tell you how to get out protest dave coolly i do not intend to get out no more do i rejoin dave i will not even toss penny with you to find out who quit the service mr darrin you be merely seek to divert my mind from what i have say what do you say -- particularly that you would have to fight I i have already signify my entire willingness mr pennington to that i really can add nothing fourth classman be always address as mister and they must use the same handle to the name when address upper classman but member of the three upper class resort to the use of mister in address classmate only when they wish to be offensive or nearly so i will send a friend to meet you pennington continue why i think banter darrin ironically that you be go to fight I yourself so i be -- be sure of it i will amend my statement by say that i will send a second to see you save time by send he to dalzell very good mr darrin be that all you wish to say to I yes very good mr pennington with two very stiff nod the midshipmen part pennington hasten at once in search of hallam will you serve I old man query pennington sorry but -- well you see pen not know all the fact of the case i must admit that all my sympathy be with darrin all you sympathy echo pen frown well nearly all anyway you see i have know and observe darrin for a full year now and i do not believe patient old darry be the one to start any trouble he call I a liar protest pennington do he gasp hallam well he qualify the statement but he way of say it be as offensive as the direct lie could have be so you be bent on fight darry i be too bad muttered hallam shake he head be you anxious for you idol ask pen in a disagreeable tone no penny it be you that i be concerned about in my own mind you be go next to a very hard proposition darry be patient -- almost as patient as the proverbial camel -- but when he fight he fight you 'll be hammer to a pulp pen pooh no one have yet beat darrin at a fist fight there always have to be a first time you know and you think you be it as far as darrin be concern -- yes too bad -- too bad sigh hallam i be afraid penny that the heat in the furnace room be too much for you this morning then you will not serve as one of my seconds the honor be most regretfully decline reply hallam in a tone of mock sadness you want to see darrin win if there have to be a fight i do reply midshipman hallam do not bet you money on he anyway i be not a gambler penny and i do not bet reply hallam with a dignity that somehow end the conversation pennington have considerable difficulty at first in find a second at last however he induce decker and brigg to represent he these two midshipman go to see dan dalzell wait until i send for mr farley propose dalzell he soon have that midshipman who be wholly willing to serve darrin in any capacity we be ready to have the fight this evening propose midshipman decker we be not retort dan with vigor why not this forenoon pennington deliberately step on darrin 's shoulder with such force as to lame it a good deal reply dan we man insist that he have a right to rest he shoulder and to wait until to-morrow but to-morrow we have a short shore liberty at hampton road remonstrate brigg yes and during that shore liberty we can have the fight more safely than on board ship insist dalzell but we intend to devote we shore leave to pleasure object decker you 'll find plenty of pleasure if you accept we proposition urge dan dryly at any rate we will not hear of darrin fighting before to-morrow he must have to-night to rest that shoulder all right so be it growl decker after a side glance at brigg on shore at some point to be select by the seconds ask dan dalzell yes that be agree detail as to whom to invite as referee and time-keeper be also arrange i suppose we 'll have to use up we shore leave that way then grunt pennington when tell of the arrangement there be one way you can save the day grin decker how put darrin to sleep in the first round then hurriedly dress and leave and enjoy you time on shore but darrin be a very able man with he fist observe pennington yes but you be a mile bigger and heavier and you be spry too you ought to handle he with all the ease in the world i do not know muttered pennington who do not intend to make the mistake of brag in advance i 'll do my best of course oh you 'll win out if you be awake predict midshipman brigg confidently when the cadet be call the follow morning they find the battleship fleet at anchor in hampton road chapter v when the seconds wonder one after another the launch speed ashore carry they swarm of distinguished look young midshipman the fight party manage to get off all in the same boat and on one of the earliest trip pennington be to have ordinary shore leave on the cruise he fifty demerit to be pay for by loss of privilege on he return to the naval academy decker propose dan you and i can skip away and find a good place in no time then we can come back after the other that be agreeable to I nod midshipman decker in twenty minute the two seconds be back we have find just the place announce decker and it be not more than three minute ' walk from here will you all hurry along the place turn out to be a barn that have not be use for a year or more the floor be almost immaculately clean in consideration of two dollar hand he the owner have agree to display no curiosity and not to mention the affair to any one how do you like it darry ask dan anxiously it will suit I as well as any other place respond dave slip off he blouse folding it neatly and put it aside he uniform cap follow and you ask decker of he man the floor 's hard but i do not expect to be the man to hit it reply pennington in five minute both midshipman be attire for they affair between they the different member of the party have smuggle ashore shoe old trousers and belt for the fighter it be a class affair remington of the third class have come along as referee while dawley be to be the time-keeper if the principal be ready let they step forward order midshipman remington go to the middle of the floor now i understand that this be to be a finish fight round two minute rest two minute i also understand that the principal do not care to shake hand before the call to mix up darrin and pennington nod they assent take you place gentleman order the referee quickly be you ready gentleman yes come from both principal time both man have they guard up as the word leave the referee 's lip each try two or three pass which the other block midshipman pennington be try to take he opponent 's measure then dave duck dart dodge and wheel about pennington have to follow he and it make the latter angry stand up and fight can not you hiss pen silence during the round mr pennington admonish the referee quietly let the official do all the talk that may be necessary dave as he dodge again and come up unscathed grin broadly over this rebuke that grin make pen angrier than anything else could have do i 'll wipe that grin off he face mutter pennington angrily and this very thing pennington try hard to do he be quick on he own foot and for a few seconds he follow the dodge darrin about rain in blow that require all of dave 's adroitness to escape dave 's very success however make he opponent all the angrier from annoyance follow by excessive irritation pennington go into almost blind rage -- and the man who do that anywhere in life must always pay for it suddenly dave swing he right in on the point of pen 's chin with a force that jolt the larger midshipman as part of the same movement darrin 's left crash against pennington 's nose then out of chivalry dave drop back to give pen a few moment in case he need they to get he wit back time roar dawley and pennington 's seconds pounce upon he and bear he away to he corner now i know how that fellow darrin win he fight growl pennington in a undertone he keep on run away until he have the other man gasp for breath then darrin jump in and win the method do not much matter comment brigg dryly as he and decker work over they man it be the result that count rush darry into a tight corner pen and then slam he hard and sufficiently thanks fellow now i be all right for the second round mutter midshipman pennington in a few seconds more dave and he opponent be hard at work dave still use he footwork and most cleverly yet wherever he go pen follow he nimbly it do not look so one side now then pennington at last manage to deliver one blow on darrin 's right short rib it take a lot of dave 's spare wind he race about seek to regain he wind before allow close quarter but at last pennington close in again and after a swift feint try to land the same short-rib blow darrin be watch and block then he temple redden with anger dave swing in a huge one that crash in under pennington 's right ear time shout dawley just as pen go to the floor in a heap that save the larger midshipman from have to take the count he seconds have he ready at the call for the third round now suddenly darrin seem to change not only he tactic but he whole personality to he opponent dave seem suddenly transform into a dancing demon it be about the same old footwork but it be aggressive now instead of be defensive first dave land a light tap on the already suffer nose a few seconds later he land on the point of pen 's chin though not hard enough to send he man down then a rather light blow on the jaw just under pen 's right ear again the larger midshipman be now thoroughly alarm he fear that darrin could do whatever he will and shiver with wonder as to when the knockout blow would come the truth be pennington be still put up a better battle than he himself realize and darrin be not dispose to take any foolish chance through rush the affair thus the third round end by the time that they come up for the fourth round after both man have undergo some vigorous handling by they respective seconds pennington be a good deal revive and far more confident dave 's tactic be the same in the fourth round pennington do not find time to develop much in the way of tactic for himself save to defend himself during the first minute no important blow be land on either side then suddenly dave dart in and under and bring a right-arm hook against pen 's nose in a way that start that member to bleed again and with a steady flow that jar the larger midshipman he plunge in heavily and blindly block one of darrin 's blow by wrap both arm around he none of that mr pennington break away fast order midshipman remington quickly dave take a fair get away not attempt to strike as the clinch be break but a instant later dave come back dance all around he dazed opponent landing on the short rib on the breast bone under either ear and finally on the tip of the chin pen be sure that none of these blow have be deliver with the force that darrin could have send in time shout midshipman dawley the principal retire to they corner pennington almost wholly afraid from the conviction that he antagonist be now merely play with he to keep the interest go so pennington be still rather badly scare when the two come together for the fifth round get lively now gentleman if you can beg referee remington finish this one way or the other and let we get some of the benefit of we shore leave pen start by put more steam behind every blow dave who have use up so much of he wind by he brilliant footwork begin to find it harder to keep the upper hand twice however he manage to land body blow he be try to drive in a third when pennington block follow this with a left-arm jab on darrin 's left jaw that send the lighter man to the floor instantly dawley begin to count off the seconds -- seven eight nine te -- dave be up on he foot pen try to make a quick rush but darrin dodge cleverly they wheel and face he opponent as the latter wheel about after that there be less footwork both man stand up to it as keenly alert as they could be each try to drive home heavy blow while they be still at it the call of time sound do not let he put it over you david little giant warn dan as the latter and farley vigorously massage darrin 's muscle he all but have you and there be not any need of make pen a present of the meeting i try to get he mutter dave in a undertone and i shall go on try to the last but pennington be pretty nearly superior to anyone in my class just waltz in and show he whisper dalzell as the call sound pennington enter the sixth round with more confidence he begin at the outset to drive in heavy blow nor do dave do much dodge bump twenty-five seconds only of this round have go when darrin land he right fist with fearful force upon the high point of pennington 's jaw down go the larger midshipman again this time he moan he eye be open though they have a somewhat glassy look in they dawley be count off the seconds in measure tone -- seven eight nine -- ten pen have struggle to rise to he foot but sink back with a gasp of despair and rage mr pennington lose the count and the fight announce referee remington coolly i do not believe we be need here dawley the seconds can handle the wreck come along as the two official of the meeting hustle out of the barn dalzell give he attention to help he chum while farley go over to offer he service in get the vanquished midshipman into shape there be time when i could have close both of pennington 's eye murmur dave to dan but i do not want to give he any disfiguring mark that would start question on board ship you have he whip from the start murmur dan confidently as he spray then rub dave 's chest and arm maybe but i be not so sure of that rejoin darrin that fellow be not so easy a prize for any one in my class there be time when i be all but convince that he have I oh fairy tale grunt dan have it you own way then danny boy when darrin and he seconds leave the barn they go off to enjoy what remain of the shore leave pennington 's seconds finally at he own request leave he at a ice cream parlor where he propose to remain until he could return to the big steel massachusett without exciting any wonder over the little time he have remain ashore pennington have strength to walk about but he be far from be in really good shape and prefer to keep quiet chapter vi in trouble on foreign soil from hampton road the battleship squadron with the midshipman on board sail directly for plymouth england during most of the voyage over slow cruise speed be use by the time that england 's coast be sight the third-class middy find they know much more about a battleship than they have believe to be possible at the start of the voyage they have serve as fireman they have master many of the electrical detail of a battleship they have receive instruction and have stand trick by the engine there have be some drill with the smaller rapid-fire gun and finally they have learn at least the rudiment of wig-wagging as signaling by means of signal flag be term it be just before the call to supper formation when england 's coast loom up most of the midshipmen stand at the rail watch eagerly for a better glimpse at the coast some of the midshipmen especially those who come from wealthier family have be in england before enter the naval academy these fortunate one be question eagerly by they comrade the battleship be well in sight of eastern king point when the midshipman 's call for supper formation sound feeling that they would much have prefer to wait for they supper the young man hasten below after the line be form it seem to the impatient young man as though it have never take so long to read the order yet there come one welcome order to the effect that immediately after the morning meal all midshipman might go to the pay officer and draw ten dollar to be charge against they pay account that ten dollar apiece loom up large david little giant murmured dan dalzell while the evening meal be in progress we ought to have a lot of fun on it reply darrin who be look forward with greatest eagerness to he first visit to any foreign soil but how much shore leave be we to have two day the word be we 'll get it straight in the morning at breakfast formation in defiance of regulation midshipman pennington whose father be wealthy have several hundred dollar conceal in he baggage he have already invite hallam mossworth and dickey to keep in he wake on shore and these young man have gladly enough agree say but we be slacken speed quiver dalzell when the meal be nearly finish headway have stop declare darrin a few moment later listen everyone call farley do not you hear the rattle of the anchor chain gentleman as we be forbid to make too much racket propose irrepressible dan let we give three silent cheer for old england rise in he place dan raise he hand aloft and bring it down as he lip silently form a hurrah three time this be do each time the lip of the midshipmen form a silent cheer then dan with a mighty swoop of he right arm let he lip form the word that everyone know to be tiger ugh-h-h groan midshipman reilly throw that irresponsible fenian out direct dan grin then the midshipman turn they attention to the remnant of the meal boom sound sharply overhead there go the twenty-one-gunner announce darrin when a foreign battleship enter a fortified port the visit fleet or rather its flagship fire a national salute of twenty-one gun after a short interval follow the discharge of the last gun one of the fort on shore answer with twenty-one gun this be one of the method of observe the courtesy between nation by they respective fleet ere all the gun have be fire from the flagship the third classman receive the rise signal the class march out and be dismiss instantly a break be make for deck the midshipman be in good time to see the smoke and hear the roar of gun from one of the fort on shore in the morning the commandant of cadet as command officer of the squadron would go ashore with he aide and pay a formal call to the senior military officer later in the day that english officer and one or two of he staff officer would return the call by come out to the flagship that accomplish all the require courtesy would have be observe it be still broad daylight for in summer the english twilight be a long one and darkness do not settle down until late oh if we be only go ashore to-night murmured hallam there be many other to echo the thought but all know that it could not be do could not we find a trick for slip ashore after light out eagerly query dickey who be not note as a greaser could we quiver hallam who with few demerit against he feel inclined to take a chance but pennington to whom he appeal shake he head too big a risk hally reply pen and trebly dangerous with that greaser darrin in the class oh stow that growl hallam darrin be no greaser you have get he on you black book -- that be all he be a greaser i tell you cry pennington fiercely there be a score of midshipman in this group and many of they nod approvingly at pennington 's statement though still a class leader dave have lose some of he popularity since he report to the police of annapoli so the middy turn in that night with unsatisfied dream of shore life in england soon after breakfast the next morning however every midshipman have draw he ten dollar even to pennington who have no use for such a trifling amount as fast as possible the launch range alongside at the side gangway take off group of midshipman everyone of whom have be caution to be at dock in time to board a launch in season for supper formation pennington and he party be among the first to land they hurry away it be on the second trip of one of the launch that dave dan and farley make they get away these three chum have agree to stick together during the day they land at the great western dock to find themselves surround by eager british cabbie be we go to take a cab and get more quickly and intelligently to the best part of the town to see asked farley i do not vote for it reply darrin we have only five dollar apiece for each of the two day we be to be ashore i move that we put in the forenoon anyway in prowl about the town for ourselves we 'll learn more than we would by ride come on then approve dan plymouth be a old-fashioned english seaport that have be rather famous ever since the thirteenth century many part of the town include whole street look as though the house have be build since that time this be especially true of many of the street near the water front for two hour the three middy roam through the street often meet fellow classman wherever the young midshipman go many of the english workman and shopkeeper raise they hat in friendly salute of the american uniform we do not seem to run across pen 's gang anywhere remark farley at last oh no smile dave that be a capitalistic crowd they 'll hit only the high spot nevertheless these three poor-in-purse midshipman enjoy themselves hugely in see the quaint old town at noon they find a real old english chop house where they enjoy a famous meal i wish we could slip some of these little mutton pie back with we sigh dan wistfully in the afternoon the three chum see the newer market place where all three buy small souvenir for they mother at home darrin also secure a little remembrance present for he sweetheart belle meade the guild hall and some of the other famous building be visit later in the afternoon dave begin to inspect he watch every two or three minute no need for we to worry with dave 's eye glue to he watch laugh dan come on fellow summon darrin finally we have not more than time now to make the dock and get back to supper formation take a cab ask farley you know we have find that they be vastly cheaper than american cab no-o-o not for I decide dave we 'll need the rest of we shore money to-morrow and we leg be good and sturdy yet even careful dave as it turn out have allow no more than time the chum reach the dock in time to see the launch half way between the fleet and shore some forty other midshipman stand wait on the dock among these be pennington and he party all look highly satisfy with they day 's sport as indeed they be

only a single backward glance at the young midshipman the undersized englishman be already lead the way at quicken pace the young midshipman reach the shed that have be indicate they guide have already draw a key from a pocket and have unsnapped the heavy padlock step right in young gentleman h ` and h ` i 'll follow h ` and show h ` it to you unsuspect the three middy step inside the darkened shed suddenly the door bang and a padlock click outside here stop that you rascally joker roar dalzell wheeling about what do this mean big trouble speak dave darrin seriously and with a face from which the color be fast receding chapter vii pennington get he wish the scoundrel gasp farley he face whiter than any of the other dave be already at the door try to force it open but he might almost as well have try to lift one of the twelve-inch gun of the battleship massachusett we be lock in -- that be sure gasp dalzell almost daze by the catastrophe and what be more we will not get out in a hurry unless we can make some of we classmate hear declare dave for the next half minute they yell themselves nearly hoarse but no response come what could have be that little cockney 's purpose in play this shabby trick on we demand farley perhaps the cockney think we be admiral with we pocket line with gold perhaps he and some of he pal intend to rob we later in the evening propose dan with a ghastly grin any gang would find something of a fight on they hand then mutter dave darrin grimly all three be equally at a loss to think of any explanation for such a joke as this equally improbable do it seem that any thug of the town would expect to reap any harvest from rob three midshipman desperately they turn to survey they surroundings the shed be a old one yet strongly build there be no window no other door save that at which the three middy now stand baffled another good old yell propose darrin it be give with a lusty will but prove as fruitless as the former one we do not take the last launch back to ship declare farley wild with rage which mean a long string of demerit say dan no shore leave to-morrow either groan darrin fellow this mishap will affect we shore leave throughout all the cruise we can explain it suggest farley with a hopefulness that he do not feel at all of course we can jeer dave darrin but what officer be fool enough to believe such a cock-and-bull story as this one will seem at the very least the commandant would believe that we have be play some pretty stiff prank ourselves in order to get treat in this fashion no no fellow we may just as well undeceive ourselves and prepare to take the full soak of discipline that we be bind to get if we attempt this sort of explanation we would be lucky indeed to get through the affair without be try by general court-martial for lie drake 's anchor indeed exclaim dan in deep self disgust we ought to have know better grunt farley equally enraged with himself what on earth make we so absent-minded as to believe that a priceless relic would be keep in a old shed like this we be sure enough idiot groan dan hold on there fellow interrupted dave darrin vent all you anger right on I i be the great and only cause of this misfortune it be i who propose that we take up that cockney 's invitation i be the real and only offender against decent good sense and yet you both have to suffer with I let 's give another yell bigger than before suggest dan weakly they do but with no better result than before the launch be away now anyway i guess groan farley after consult he watch yes and we be up the tree with the commandant grunt dalzell bitterly yell again ask farley no retorted dave shake he head we have see the uselessness of ask help from outside let 's supply we own help now then -- altogether shoulder the door a savage assault they hurl upon the door but they merely cause it to vibrate we can not do it gasp dan after the third trial considerable daylight filter in through the crack at top bottom and one side of the door further back in the shed there be less light let 's explore this old place in search of hope beg dave together they start back look about keenly in what appear to be a empty room say look at that cry dave suddenly he point to a solid look not very heavy ship 's spar what good will that thing do we ask farley rather dubiously let 's see if we can raise it to we shoulder propose dave darrin radiantly then well find out hurrah quiver dan dalzell bend over the spar at the middle up with it command darrin place himself at the head of the spar farley take hold at the further end up with it heave midshipman darrin right up the spar go it would have be a heavy job for three young man of they size in civil life but midshipman be constantly undergo the best sort of physical training now then -- a fast run and a hard bump call darrin at the door they rush bear the spar as a batter ram bump the door shake and shiver once more may do it cheer darrin back again they dash the head of they batter ram against the door it give way and climb through they race back to the pier but dan who have secure the lead stop with a groan point out over the water not a bit of good fellow there go the launch and we be the only fellow leave it be all up with we summer 's fun be it though shout dave spurt ahead come on and find out as they reach the front of the pier down at the edge of a landing stage they espy a little steam tender that boat have to take we out to the ` massachusett ' cry darrin desperately as he plunge down the step to the landing stage follow by he two chum -lrb- illustration : the three midshipman race toward the pier -rrb- who be the captain here call dave racing across the landing stage to the tender 's gangplank i be sir reply a portly red-faced englishman lean out of the wheel-house window what 'll you charge to land we in haste aboard the american battleship ` massachusett ' ask darrin eagerly half a sov will be about right sir reply the tender 's skipper touch he cap at sight of the american naval uniform good enough glow dave leap aboard cast off as quickly as you can captain or we 'll be in a heap of trouble with we discipline officer the english skipper be quick to act he route out two deckhand who quickly cast off almost while the deckhand be do this the skipper ring the engineer 's bell come into the wheel - ` ouse with I invite the skipper pleasantly which invitation the three middy accept now then young gentleman ` ow do it ` appen that you miss you own launch it be a mean trick -- a scoundrelly one cry darrin resentfully then he describe just what have happen the skipper 's own bronzed cheek burn to a deeper color i can ` ardly believe that a englishman would play such a trick on young h ` officer of a friendly power he declare but i tell you sir the fare out to you ship would be half a sov i lie if a nasty little cockney play such a trick on you it be my place as a decent englishman to take you out for nothing -- and that be the fare oh we 'll gladly pay the half sov protest darrin not on this craft you can not sir reply the skipper firmly look eagerly ahead the three middy see two of the launch go along side of the massachusett and discharge passenger as the sec
