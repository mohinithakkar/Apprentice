dibble in the office of the latter across the street it be decide that the flighty young girl should be make less expensive to she friend by temporary accommodation in a economical boarding-house and that the gospeler return to bumsteadville should persuade miss carowther to come and stay with she until the time for the reopen of the macassar female college subsequently with he homeless ward upon he arm the benignant old lawyer undergo a series of scathing rebuff from the various high-strung descendant of better day at whose once luxurious but now darken home he apply for the desire board time after time be he remind by unspeakably majestic middle-aged lady with bass voice that when a fine old family lose its former wealth by those vicissitude of fortune which bring out the noblest trait of character and compel the letting-out of a few damp room it be significant of a weak understanding or a depraved disrespect of the dignity of adversity to expect that such family shall lose money and lower they hereditary high tone by wait upon a parcel of young girl a few single gentleman desire all the comfort of a home would not be consider insulting unless they object to the butter and a couple of married childless gentleman with they wife might be pardon for respectfully apply but the idea of a parcel of young girl wherever he go the reproach of not be a few single gentleman or a couple of married childless gentleman with they wife abashed mr dibble into helpless retreat while flora 's increase guilty consciousness of the implacable sentiment against she as a parcel of young girl culminate at last in tear finally when the miserable lawyer be begin to think strongly of the house of the good shepherd or the orphan asylum as a last resort it suddenly occur to he that mr skammerhorn a distant widow aunt of he clerk mr bladam have be know to live upon boarder in bleecker street and thither he drag hastily the despise object on he arm be a widow without child and relieved of nearly all the weakness of she sex by the systematic refusal of the opposite sex to give she any encouragement in they mr skammerhorn be a relentless advocate of woman 's inalienable rights and only wish that man could just see himself in that contemptible light in which he be distinctly visible to one who sooner than be he legal slave would never again accompany he to the altar i tell you candidly dibble say she in answer to he application that if you have apply to be take yourself i should have say ` never ' and at once call in the police since skammerhorn die delirious i have always refuse to have he sex in the house and i tell you frankly that i consider it hardly human if this girl of yours however and the elderly female whom you say she expect to join she in a few day will make themselves generally useful about the house and try to be companion to I i can give they the very room where skammerhorn die perceive that flora turn pale she guardian whisper to she that she would not be alone in the room at any rate and then respectfully ask whether the late mr skammerhorn have ever be see around the house since he death to be frank with you answer the widow i do think that i come upon he once in the closet with he back to I as often i would see the weak creature in life go after a bottle on the top shelf but it be only he coat hang there with he boot stand below and my muff hang over to look like he head you think then say mr dibble inquiringly that it be such a room as two lady could occupy without awake at midnight with a strange sensation and think they feel a supernatural presence not if the bed be rightly search beforehand and all the joint well pepper with magnetic powder be the assure answer could we see the room madam if the shutter be open you could as they be not return the widow not offer to stir but ever since skammerhorn start up with a howl say ` here he come again red-hot ' and try to jump out of the window i have never open they for any single man and never shall i could not bear it dibble to see one of you sex in that room again and hope you will not insist break in spirit as he be by precede humiliation the old lawyer have not the heart to contest the point and it be agree that upon the arrival of miss carowther from bumsteadville she and flora should accept the memorable room in question upon they way back to the hotel guardian and ward meet mr bentham who from the moment of become a character in they story have be possess with that mysterious madness for open-air exercise which afflict every acquaintance of the late edwin drood and now salute they in the broiling street and solemnly besought they company for a long walk it have occur to I say the comic paper man who have resume he black worsted glove that mr dibble and miss pott may be willing to aid I in walking-off some of the darker suicidal inclination incident to first-class humorous journalism in america read the ` proof ' of a instalment of a comic serial now publish in my paper i contract such gloom that a frantic rush into the fresh air be my only hope of on escape from self-destruction let we walk if you please lead on in the profoundest melancholy by this chastened character mr dibble and the flowerpot be presently toiling hotly through a succession of grievous side-street and forlorn short-cut to dismal ferry the state of they conductor 's spirit incline he to find a certain refreshingly solemn joy in the horror of pedestrianism impose by obstruction of merchandise on side-walk and repeat climbing over skid extend from store door to dray inspire to a extraordinary flow of malignant animal spirit by the complexity of travel incident to the odorous maze of some hundred odd keg of salt mackerel and box of brown soap impressively stack before one very enterprising commission house mr bentham lighten the journey with anecdote of self-made commission man who have rise in life by break human leg and city ordinance and dwelt emotionally upon the scene in the city hospital where lady and gentleman be bring in with nail from the hoop of sugar-hogsheads sticking into they foot or limb dislocate from too-loftily pile firkin of butter fall upon they through incredible hardship and amongst astounding complication of horse-cars target company and barrel of everything mr bentham also amuse he friend with circuit of several of the fine public market of new york explain to they the relation of the various miasmatic smell of those quaint edifice with the various devastating disease of the day and expatiate quite eloquently upon the political corruption involve in the renting of the stall and the fine opening there be for cholera and yellow fever in the fish and vegetable department then as a last treat he lead he panting companion through several lively up-hill block of drug-mill and tobacco firm to where they have a distant view of a tenement house next door to a kerosene factory where as he vivaciously tell they in the event of a fire at least one hundred human being would be slowly do to a turn after which all three return from they walk firmly convinced that a unctuous vein of humor have be conscientiously work and abstractedly wish themselves dead -lrb- 1 -rrb- the exhilarating effect of the genial comic paper man upon flora do not indeed pass away until she and miss carowther be in they appoint quarter under the roof of mr skammerhorn whither they go immediately upon the arrival of the elder spinster from bumsteadville it could have be wish my good woman say miss carowther cast a rather disparage look around the death-chamber of the late mr skammerhorn that you have assign to educate single young lady like ourselves a apartment less suggestive of man in he wed aspect the spectacle of a pair of peg boot stick out from under a bed and a razor and a hone group on the mantle-shelf be not such as i should desire to encourage in the dormitory of a pupil under my tuition that be much to be deplore i be sure carowther return mr skammerhorn severely and sorry be i that i ever marry on that particular account i would not have do it if you would only tell I but see that i married skammerhorn and then he die delirious he boot and razor must remain just as he often wish to throw the former at I in he ravings once marry be enough say i and those who never be through have no proposal must bear with those who have and take thing as they come there be those i would have you know mr skammerhorn to whom proposal have be no inducement say miss carowther sharply or if be make and then withdraw have give we sex opportunity to prove in court of law that damage can still be get i be afraid of no man my good woman as a person name blodgett once learn from a jury but boot and razor be not what i would have familiar to the mind of one who never have a husband to die in rage torment nor yet have sue for breach miss pott be but a chicken i 'll admit retorted mr skammerhorn but you be not such carowther by many a good year on the contrary quite a hen then you be with she if the boot and razor make she think she see that poor weak skammerhorn a-ranging round the room when in he grave it be he place to be you have only get to say : ' a fool you be and always be ' -- as often i myself call at he in he lifetime -- and off he 'll go into he tomb again for fear of broomstick flora my dear say miss carowther turn with dignity to she pupil if i know anything of human nature the man who have once get away from here will stay away only single ghost have attachment for the house in which they once live so never mind the boot and razor darling which after all if see by peddler or man who come to fix the gas might keep we safe from robber as safe as any man himself young woman with pistol under he head that he would never dare to fire if robber be no more than cat rampage add mr skammerhorn enthusiastically with nothing but a old black hat of skammerhorn 's and walking-cane keep hang in the hall i have not lose a spoon by tramp or census taker for six mortal year so make yourselve at home i beg you both while i go down and cook the liver for we dinner you 'll find it tender as a chicken after what you have break you tooth upon in boarding-school though skammerhorn declare it make he bilious in the second year forget what he would drink with sugar to he taste beforehand thus be sweet flora pott introduce to she new home where but for look down from she window at the fashion making-up hundred of bow of ribbon for she neck and making-over all she dress she woman 's mind must have be a blank what time miss carowther tell she all day how she look in this or that style of wear she hair and read she to sleep each night with extract from the page of cheery hannah more as for the object nearest she young heart to say that she be wholly unruffled by it would be inaccurate but by address she keep it hide from all eye save she own -lrb- footnote 1 : ordinary reader while admire the heavy humor of this unexpected open-air episode may wonder what on earth it have to do with the the story but the cultivate few understand the ingenious mechanic of novel-writing will appreciate it as a most skilful and happy device to cover the interval between the hiring of mr skammerhorn 's room and the occupation thereof by flora and

hear what the other say while no young man can make he accompany young lady hear a single word unless he mouth be in close proximity to she ear this singular state of thing be doubtless due to the peculiar acoustical property of public building we manage however to hear a good deal of both young and middle-aged conversation of the follow improve type rural person i have hear most everybody that

own or be intend for any other purpose than the gratification of we palate but that be a mistake which i will try to rectify in order that the _ bon vivant _ may enjoy hereafter the pleasure of a mental and bodily feast conjointly most crab be hatch from egg and begin life in a very small way they float round in the water at first without really know what they be about they have but little sense to start with but after a while improve and begin to strike out in a blind instinctive way which after a few effort resolve itself into real genuine swimming they commence walk about the same time awkward straggle step to be sure but they get over the ground and that be the most they care for when they be about a month old they begin to feel that life have its reality and that they must do something towards the end for which they be make the thought be faint at first but by degree grow weightier till at last they can stand it no longer and make a great effort to throw off the incubus of babyhood that weigh so heavily upon they they burst open the back door of they shell and slowly creep out backwards it take about five minute for they to get entirely out head leg and all and then for a moment or two they gaze in stupefaction at they old shell amaze to find that they have by they own effort unaided and alone accomplish such a wonderful change the thought be overwhelming it fill

former size and they remain so they can not get back into the old shell now for it will not fit they and as there be no other for they to go into the only thing leave for they to do be to build another house it take three or four day before they get fairly to work and during this time they be call soft-shell crab this stage be particularly dangerous to the delicate creature for they in they tender beauty be so attractive to hungry fish that it be really a wonder any escape tender helpless innocent and beautiful they be almost sure to be victimize and gormandize some however escape the fate intend for they and in a few day begin to enjoy life in a crabbed sort of a way another month pass on they become restless and uneasy and feel that it will not do to stay too long in one place they think they have better make another change and so this time in a more self-confident manner they pack up and move out at the back door again they be no more provident now however than they be at first for after have give up the old house they have no new one to move into they be not trouble as we be with house-hunting they be good builder and can make one to suit themselves a wise provision
