suspend he murderous calisthenics at the door of a rustic hotel and there enter to secure a wayside meal the american country hotel or half-way house be perhaps one of the most depressing fiction ever encounter by stage-passenger or pedestrian afield : and depend so exclusively upon the imagination for any earthly distinction from the retire and neglect private hiding-place of some decay and morbid agricultural family that only the conventional swing sign-board before the door save the cognizant mind from a painfully dense confusion smell about equally of eternal wash-day casual cow-shed and pass feather-bed it sustain a lank middle-aged gristly man to come out at the same hour every day and grunt unintelligibly at the stage-driver a expressionless boy in a bandless straw-hat and no shoe to stare blankly from the doorway at the same old pole-horse he have mechanically thus inspect from infancy and one speckled hen of mature year to poise observingly on single leg at the head of the

night shall be crowd by wall which rub off into a faint feather-bed of the flavor and consistency of goose use whole and have for he feverish breakfast in the morning a version of broil ham as racy of

the cross-examination institute by the inevitable lank middle-aged gristly man before he could reconcile it with he duty as a cautious public character to reveal the treasure of the larder those bump on the head that swollen eye and nose come -- do they -- from swing this here club for exercise well he want to know now people generally use two of the club at once -- do they -- but one be enough for a beginner well he _ want _ to know now could he supply a couple of poached egg and a cup of milk no young man but a slice of corned pork and a bowl of tea be within the resource of the establishment when at length upon the road again the bruised youth resolve to follow a cattle-track across lot for the greater space in which to exercise with he indian club as he walk like any other novice in the practice he could not divest he mind of the impression that the frightful thump he continually receive in twirl the merciless thing around and behind he devoted head be due to some kind of crowd influence from the boundary on either side the way and it be to gain relief from such damaging contraction of area that he leave the highway for the wider wintry field go onward in these latter at a irregular pace sometimes momentarily stunned into a rangy stagger by a sound blow on the cerebrum or the cerebellum and again irritated almost to a run by contusion of shoulder-blade or funny-bone he finally become aware that two man be follow he through the lot and that with a closeness of attention indicate more than common interest to the perception of he keenly sensitive southern nature they at once become ribald yankee vandal hope for unseemly amusement from the detection of some awkwardness in the indian-club-play of a defeat but not conquer southern gentleman and in the haughty sectional pride of he contemptuous soul he indignantly determine to show not the least consciousness of they disrespectful observation twirl the club around and around he battered head with increase velocity he smile scornfully to himself nor deign a single backward glance at the one of he two follower who approach more rapidly than the other he hear the hindermost say to the foremost leave he alone i tell you and he 'll knock himself down in a minute and in a passionately reckless effort of sheer bravado to catch the club from one hand with the other while it yet circle swiftly over he skull he accidentally bring the ungovernable weapon into tremendous contact with the top of he head and dash himself violently to the earth do not i tell you he would do it cry the hindermost of the two stranger come up while the other coolly seat himself upon the prostrated victim these here indian club always throw a man if he be not get muscle in he arm and this here little chivalry

be the reply and it be we duty to take you back to the main road where a couple of you friend be wait for you stare from one to the other in speechless wonder at what this fresh outrage upon the down-trodden south could mean montgomery allow they to replace he indian club in he hand and conduct he back to the public road where to he increase bewilderment he find gospeler simpson and the ritualistic organist what be the matter gentleman he ask in great agitation : must i take the oath of loyalty or be i require by yankee philanthropy to marry a negress at the sound of he voice mr bumstead leave the shoulder of mr simpson upon which he have be lean with great weight and come forward in three long skip deliberately wind he right hand in the speaker 's neck-tie where be those

up and down the road a few time well then where 's that umbrella roar the organist who seem quite beside himself with grief and excitement mr bumstead pray be more calm implore the reverend octavius mr montgomery this agitate gentleman 's nephew have be mysteriously miss ever since he go out with you at midnight : also a alpaca umbrella upon my honor i know nothing of either ejaculate the unhappy southerner mr bumstead still hold he by the neck-tie cast a fiery and unsettled glance around at nothing in particular then grind he tooth audibly and scowl my boy 's miss he say hissingly -- y'

maddened uncle of the lose drood deliberately examine all the captive 's pocket in succession in one of they be a penknife which after thoughtfully try it upon he pink nail he abstractedly place in he own pocket search next the overwhelmed southerner 's travelling-satchel he find in it a apple which he first eye with marked suspicion and then bit largely into as though half expect to find in it some trace of he nephew i 'll keep this suspicious fruit he remark with a hollow laugh and bearing unreservedly upon the nearer arm of the hapless montgomery and eat audibly as he surge onward he start on the return march for bumsteadville not a word more be speak until after a cool christmas stroll of about eight and a quarter mile the whole party stand before judge sweeney in the house of the latter there when the story have be sorrowfully repeat by the gospeler mr bumstead exhibit the core of the apple and tickle the magistrate almost into hysteric by whisper very closely in he ear that it be a core curiously similar to that of the last apple eat by he nephew and have be find in a apple from the prisoner 's satchel might be useful in evidence judge sweeney wish to know if mr pendragon have any political relation or could influence any vote and upon be answer in the negative eye the young man sternly and say that appearance be decidedly against he he could not exactly commit he to jail without accusation although the apple-core and he political unimportance subject he to grave suspicion : but he should hold the gospeler responsible for the youth 's appearance at any time when he presence should be require mr bumstead whose eye be become very glassy then suggest that a handbill should be at once print and circulate to the effect that there have be lose or steal two black alpaca nephew about 5 foot 8 inch high with a bone handle light eye and hair and whalebone rib and that if the say edwin would return with a brass ferule slightly wear the finder should receive earnest thanks and be see safely to he home by j bumstead mr gospeler simpson and judge sweeney agree that a handbill should be issue : but think it might confuse the public mind if the miss nephew and the lose umbrella be not keep separate have either ' f you gen ` l'men ever be 'n uncle ask the ritualistic organist with dark intensity they shake they head _ then _ say mr bumstead

to the pond with a borrow hatchet he cut a bole in the thick ice lose the hatchet and after bathing he head in the water declare that he alpaca nephew be not there find a antique flask in one of he pocket he gradually remove all the liquid contents therefrom with a tubular straw but still could discern no trace of edwin drood all the live-long day he prosecute he research to the great discomposure of the populace : and with whitewash all over the back of he coat and very dingy hand have just seat himself at he own fireside in the evening when mr dibble come in this be a strange
