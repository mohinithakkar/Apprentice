the cause of the new reformation young lady some of they very attractive collect money from they brother and admirer states-men and bishop head the subscription-list and influential committee earnestly debate plan for spend the money which pour in faith in the efficacy of money handle by influential committee be one of the characteristic of the english people and in this particular case it seem as if they faith be to be justify by result most encouraging report be send to headquarters from gonnemara it appear that convert be flock in and that the school of the missionary be fill to overflow in the matter of education circumstance favor the new reformation the leonine john mchale the papal archbishop of tuam pursue a policy which drive the child of he flock into the mission school the only other kind of education available be that which some humorous english statesman have call ` national ' and it do not seem to the archbishop desirable that a irish boy should be beat for speak he own language or reward for call himself ' a happy english child ' he refuse to allow the building of national school in he diocese and thus leave the cleverer boy to drift into the mission school where they learn carefully select text of scripture along with the multiplication-table the best of they be push on through dublin university and crown the hope of they teacher by take holy order in the church of england there be still to be meet with in galway and mayo ancient peasant and broken-down inhabitant of workhouse who speak with a certain pride of ` my brother the minister ' there be also here and there in english rectory elderly gentleman who have almost forget the thatched cottage where they eat they earliest potato among these cleverer boy be one æneas conneally who be something more than clever he be also religious in a intense and enthusiastic manner which puzzle he teacher while it please they he ancestor have live for generation on a seaboard farm water by salt rain sweep by misty storm the famine and the fever that follow it leave he fatherless and brotherless the emigration scheme rob he and he mother of they survive relation the mission school and the missionary 's charity effect the half conversion of the mother and a whole-hearted acceptance of the new faith on the part of æneas unlike most of he fellow in the college classroom he refuse to regard a english curacy as the goal of he ambition it seem to he that he conversion ought not to end in he parade the street of liverpool in a black coat and a white tie he want to return to he people and tell they in they own tongue the gospel which he have find so beautiful the london committee meditate on he request and before they arrive at a conclusion he mother die have at the last moment make a tardy submission to the church she have deny she apostasy -- so the missionary call it -- confirm the resolution of she son and the committee at length agree to allow he to return to he native village as the first rector of the newly-created parish of carrowkeel he be provide with all that seem necessary to insure the success of he work they build he a gray house low and strong for it have to withstand the gale which sweep in from the atlantic they buy he a field where a cow could graze and a acre of bog to cut turf from a church be build for he gray and strong like he house it be fit with comfortable pew a pulpit a reading-desk and a movable table of wood decently cover with a crimson cloth beyond the church stand the school he have attend as a boy whitewash without and drape inside with map and illuminate text a salary not princely but sufficient be vote to mr conneally and he be give authority over a scripture-reader and a schoolmaster the whole group of mission building -- the rectory the church and the school -- stand like type of the uncompromising spirit of protestantism upon the bare hillside sweep by every storm batter by the atlantic spray below they carrowkeel the village cower in such shelter as the sandhill afford eastward lonely cottage faintly smoke dot in the landscape straggle away to the rugged basis of the mountain the rev æneas conneally enter upon he mission enthusiastically and the london committee await result there be scarcely any result certainly none that could be consider satisfactory the day for make conversion be past and the tide have set decisively against the new reformation a national school start by a clearsighted priest in spite of he archbishop leave the mission school almost without pupil the scripture-reader lose heart and take to seek encouragement in the public-house he find it and once when exalt -- he say spiritually -- parade the street cursing the virgin mary worse follow and the committee in london dismiss the man a diminish income force on they the necessity of economy and no successor be appoint for a few year mr conneally labor on then a sharp-eyed inspector from london discover that the schoolmaster take very little trouble about teaching but display great talent in prompt he child at examination he too be dismiss and the committee still bent on economy appoint a mistress in he place she be a pretty girl and after she have shiver through the stormy night of two winter in the lonely school-house mr conneally marry she afterwards the office of school-teacher be also leave vacant the whitewashed school fall gradually into decay and the committee effect a further saving after he marriage mr conneally 's missionary enthusiasm begin to flag he contact with womanhood humanize he the sternness of the reformer die in he and he neighbor who never could comprehend he religion come to understand the man they learn to look upon he as a friend to seek he sympathy and help in time they learn to love he two year pass and a son be bear the village people crowd upon he with congratulation and mother of wide experience praise the boy till mr conneally 's heart swell in she with pride he be christen hyacinth after a great pioneer and leader of the mission work the naming be mr conneally 's act of contrition for the forsaking of he enthusiasm he recognition of the value of a zeal which have not flag fail the attainment of greatness the next best thing be to dedicate a new life to a patron saint who have win the reward of those who endure to the end for two year more life in the glebe house be rapturously happy such bliss have in it no doubt a element of sin and it be not good that it should endure this be to be see afterwards in calmer time though hardly at the moment when the break come there be a hope of a second child a delightful time of expectation then a accident the blighting of the hope and in a few day the death of mr conneally she husband bury she digging the first grave in the rocky ground that lay around the little church for a time mr conneally be stun by he sorrow he stop work altogether cease to think even to feel man avoid he with instinctive reverence at first and afterwards with fear as he wander mutter to himself among the sandhill and along the beach after a while the power of thought and a sense of the outward thing of life return to he he find that a aged crone from the village have establish herself in he house and be care for hyacinth he let she stay and accord to she ability she cook and wash for he and the boy neither ask wages nor take order from he until she die hyacinth grow and throve amazingly from morning till evening he be in the village among the boat beside the little pier or in the field when the man work there everyone pet and love he from father moran the priest who have start the national school down to old shamus the cripple singer of interminable irish song and teller of heroic legend of the past it be when he hear the boy repeat a story of finn maccool to the old crone in the kitchen that mr conneally awake to the idea that he must educate he son he begin naturally enough with irish for it be irish and not english that hyacinth speak fluently afterwards the english alphabet follow though not for the sake of read book for except the bible and the prayer-book hyacinth be teach to read no english book he learn latin after a fashion not with nice attention to complexity of syntax but as a language mean to be use read and even speak now and then to father moran meanwhile the passage of the year bring change to carrowkeel the admiralty establish a coastguard station near the village and arrange for the greater security of the empire that man in blue-serge clothes should take it in turn to look at the atlantic through a telescope then the unquiet spirit of the congested district board possess the place for a while a young engineer design a new pier to shelter fishing-boat he galvanize the people into unwonted activity and though sceptical of good result they earn a weekly wage by build it boat come great able boat which fight the atlantic and the old curragh be leave to blister in the sun far up on the beach instructor from the isle of man teach new way of catch mackerel green patch between the cottage and the sea once the playground of pig and child or the marine parade of solemn line of goose be spread with brown net on may morning if the take be good long line of cart rattle down the road carry the fish to the railway at clifden and the place bear for a while the appearance of vitality a vagrant englishman discover that lobster could be have almost for the ask in carrowkeel the commercial instinct of he race be arouse in he he establish a trade between the villager and the fishmonger of manchester the price of lobster rise to the unprecedented figure of four shilling a dozen and it be suppose that even so the promoter of the scheme secure a profit to æneas conneally grow quietly old the change mean very little the coastguard be bind by one of the article of the british constitution come to church on Sunday morning with exemplary regularity and each man at fix interval bring a baby to be christen and a woman to be church otherwise they hardly affect mr conneally 's life the great official who visit carrowkeel to survey the benignant activity of the congested district board be man whose magnificent intellectual power raise they above any recognize form of christianity neither father moran 's ministration nor mr conneally be appeal to they the london committee of the mission to roman catholic make no inquiry about what be go on at carrowkeel they ask for no statistics expect no result but sign quarterly cheque for mr conneally presume one may suppose that if he have cease to exist they would somehow have hear of it by far the most important event for hyacinth and he father be the death of they old housekeeper in the changed state of society in carrowkeel it be find impossible to secure the service of another hyacinth at this time about fifteen year old take to the housework without feeling that he be do anything strange or unmanly he be familiar with the position of ` bachelor boy ' who have grow elderly under the care of a mother prefer afterwards the toil of they own kitchen to the uncertain issue of marry a girl to ` do for they ' life under they altered circumstance be simplify it seem unnecessary to carry a meal from the room it be cook in to another for the purpose of eat it so the front room of the house with they tattered furniture be leave to moulder quietly in the persistent damp one door be feel to be sufficient for the ingress and egress of two people from a house the kitchen door be at the back of the house be oftenest the sheltered one so the front door be bolt and the grass grow up to it one by one as hyacinth 's education require the latin and greek book be remove from the forsake study and take they place among the diminish array of plate and cup on the kitchen dresser the spreading and removal of a tablecloth for every meal come to be regard as foolish toil when room be require on the table for plate the book and papers be sweep on one side a pile of potato and the pan with bacon or a fish perhaps still frizzle in it be set in the place leave vacant morning and evening æneas conneally expect he son to join with he in prayer the two kneel together on the earthen floor face the window while the old man meditate aloud on divine thing there be break in he speech and long silence so that sometimes it be hard to tell when he prayer have really end these devotions form a part of he father 's life into which hyacinth never really enter at all he neither rebel nor mock he simply remain outside so when he father wander off to solitary place on the seashore and sit gaze into the sunset or a gathering storm hyacinth neither follow nor question he sometimes on winter night when the wind howl more fiercely than usual round the house the old man would close the book they read together and repeat aloud long passage from the apocalypse he voice weak and waver at first would gather strength as he proceed and the young man listen stir to vague emotion over the fall of babylon the great for the most part hyacinth 's time be he own even the hour of study be uncertain he read when he like and he father seem content with long day of idleness follow by other of application it be indeed only owe to he love of what he read that the boy learn at all often while he tramp from he home to the village at midday he heart be hot within he with some great thought which have spring to he from a hastily construe chorus of euripide sometimes he startle the fisherman when he go with they at night by chant homer 's roll hexameter through the darkness while the boat lay wait bear gunwale down to the black water with the drag of the net that have be shoot there be a tacit understanding that hyacinth like he father be to take holy order he matriculate in trinity college when he be eighteen and as be often do by poorer student remain at home merely pass the require examination until he take he degree and the time come for he enter the divinity school then it become necessary for he to reside in dublin and the first great change in he life take place the night before he leave home he and he father sit together in the kitchen after they have finish they evening meal for a long time neither of they speak hyacinth hold a book in he hand but scarcely attempt to read it he thought wander from hopeful expectation of what the future be to bring he and the new life be to mean to vague regret weight with misgiving which would take no certain shape there crowd upon he recollection of busy autumn day when the grain harvest overtake the belated hay-making and man toil till late in the field of long night in the springtime when he tug at the fishing-net and feel the mackerel slip and flap past he foot in the darkness of the longer winter night when he join the gathering of the boy and girl to dance jig and reel on the earthen floor of some kitchen it seem now that all this be past and over for he holiday time would bring he back to carrowkeel but would it be the same would he be the same he look at he father half hope for sympathy but the old man sit gaze -- it seem to hyacinth stupidly -- into the fire he wonder if he father have forget that this be they last evening together then suddenly without raise he eye the old man begin to speak and it appear that he too be think of the change ' i do not know my son what they will teach you in they school of divinity i have long ago forget all i learn there and i have not miss the knowledge it do not seem to I now that what they teach I have be of any help in get to know he ' he pause for a long time hyacinth be familiar enough with he father 's way of speech to know that the emphatic ` he ' mean the god whom he worship ` there be i be sure only one way in which we can become he friend _ these be they which have come out of great tribulation _ you remember that hyacinth that be the only way you may be teach truth about he but they matter very little you have already great thought burn thought but they will not of themselves bring you to he the other way be the only way shall i wish it for you my son shall i give it to you for my blessing may great tribulation come upon you in you life _ great tribulation _ see how weak my faith be even now at the very end i can not give you this blessing although i know very well that it be the only way i know this because i have be along this way myself and it have lead I to he ' again he pause it do not seem to hyacinth to be possible to say anything he be not sure in he heart that the friendship of the man of sorrow be so well worth have that he would be content to pay for it by accept such a benediction from he father ' i shall do this for you hyacinth : i shall pray that when the choice be give you the great choice between what be easy and what be hard the right decision may be make for you i do not know in what form it will come perhaps it will be as it be with I he make the choice for I for indeed i could not have choose for myself he set my foot upon the narrow way force I along it for a while and now at the end i see he face ' hyacinth have hear enough of the brief bliss of he father 's married life to understand he catch for the first time a glimpse of the meaning of the solitary life the long prayer and the meditation he be profoundly move but it do not even then seem to he desirable to choose such a way or to have such attainment thrust on he next morning the autumn sunlight chase the recollection of he emotion from he mind the fisherman stop he car as he drive through the street to shake hand with he they wife shout familiar blessing from the cabin door father moran come bare-headed to the gate of he presbytery garden and wave a farewell chapter ii there be that about the material fabric the actual stone and mortar of trinity college dublin which make a vivid appeal to the imagination of the common man the culture sentimentalist will not indeed be able to lave he soul in tepid emotion while he walk through these quadrangle as he may among the cloister and chapel of the oxford college the amateur of the past can not here stand at gaze before any single building as he do before the weather-beaten front of oriel trace in imagination the footstep of newman or arnold yet to the average man and far more to the newly emancipate schoolboy trinity college dublin make a appeal which can hardly be ignore in oxford and cambridge town and university be mix together shop jostle and elbow college in the street in dublin a man leave the city behind he when he enter the college pass completely out of the atmosphere of the university when he step on to the pavement the physical contrast be striking enough appeal to the ear and the eye the rattle of the traffic the jangling of cart bell the inarticulate babel of voice suddenly cease when the archway of the great entrance-gate be pass a immense silence take they place there be no longer any need for watchfulness nor risk of be hustle by the hurry crowd instead of footway and street cross there be broad walk untrodden stretch of smooth grass the heavy campanile be in front and height of gray building frown down on each side it need no education not even any imagination to appreciate the change it be not necessary to know that great scholar inhabit the place to recall any name or any man 's career the appeal be not to a recollected impression of the middle age or indeed of any past remote or near it be the spirit of scholarship itself abstract intangible which create this atmosphere knowledge a severe goddess awe while she beckon hyacinth conneally have submit himself to such emotion time after time when fresh from the wild of connemara he make he way to the examination-hall a outside student in a borrow cap and gown now when for the first time he enter into the actual life of the college could look up at window of room that be he own and reckon on he privilege of finger tome from the shelf of the huge library the spirit of the place awed he anew he neither analyze nor attempt a expression of what he feel but he first night within the wall be restless because of the inspiration which fill he yet this college do not fail to make a appeal also to the think mind only it be a strange appeal tend to sadness the sudden silence after the tumult of the street have come for some mind to be the symbol of a divorce between the knowledge within and the life without and this be not the separation which must always exist between thought and action the gulf fix between the student and the merchant it be a real divorce between the nation and the university between the two kind of life which ought like man and woman to complete each other through they very diversity but here have go hopelessly apart never once through all the century of ireland 's struggle to express herself have the university feel the throb of she life it be true that ireland 's greatest patriot from swift to davi have be she child but she have never understand they spirit never look on they as anything but stranger to she family they have be to she stray robber wasp to be drive from the hive while to the other they have seem cygnet among she duckling brood it be very wonderful that the university alone have be able to resist the glamour of ireland 's past and have fail to admire the persistency of she nationality there have surely be enough in every century that have pass since the college be found to win it over from alien thought and the ideal of the foreigner all this hyacinth come to feel afterwards and learn in bitterness of spirit to be angry at the university 's isolation from irish life at first quite other thought crowd upon he mind he feel a rebellion against he father 's estimate of what he be to learn it seem to he that he have come into vital touch with the greatest life of all he be to join the rank of those who besiege the ear of god for knowledge and leave behind they to successor yet unborn great tradition of the enigma they have guess in enter upon the study of theology he seem to become a soldier in the sacred band the élite of the army which win and guard truth already he be convince that there could be no greater science than the divine one no more inspiring moment in life than this one when he take he first step towards the knowledge of god he cross the quadrangle with he mind full of such thought and join a group of student round the door of one of the examination-hall it do not shock he sense of fitness that some of he fellow-student in the great science wear shabby clothes or that other scorn the use of a razor breed as he have be at home he feel no incongruity between dirty collar and the study of divinity it be not until he catch scrap of conversation that he experience a awakening from he dream one eager group surround a foresee youth who have write the date of the first four general council of the church upon he shirt-cuff ` read they out like a good man ' say one ` hold on a minute ' say another 'till i see if i have get they right i ground they up specially this morning nicæa 318 -- no hang it that be the number of bishop who be present 325 be the date be not it ' ` what be the row about at chalcedon ' ask a tall pale youth ` do not some monk or other go for cyril of alexandrium ' ` you 'll be stick anyhow tommy ' say a neat dapper little man with a very ragged gown hyacinth slip past the group and approach two better dress student who stand apart from the other ` be this ' he ask ` where the entrance examination to the divinity school be to be hold ' for answer he receive a curt ` yes ' and a stare apparently he suit of brown connemara homespun do not commend he to these aristocrat they turn they back on he and resume they conversation ` she be walk up and down the pier listen to the band with two of the rankest outsider you ever set eye on -- medical out of paddy dunn 's of course i could do nothing else but break it off ' ` oh you be engage to she then i do not know ' ` well i be and i be not anyhow i think it better to have a clear understanding she come up to I outside the door of patrick 's on Sunday afternoon just as if nothing have happen hullo bob say she i have not see you for age my name say i be mr bank -- just like that as cool as you please i could see she feel it i have call you bob say she very red in the face and you have call I maimie ever since we go to sunday-school together and i be not go to begin call you mr bank now my boy-o so do not you think it ' it be a relief to hyacinth when he be tap on the arm by a boy with a very pimply face who thrust a paper into he hand and distract he attention from the final discomfiture of maimie which mr bank be recount in a clear high-pitched voice as if he wish everyone in the neighborhood to hear it ' i hope you 'll come ' say the boy ` where ' ` it be all in the paper the student ' prayer-meeting hold every Wednesday morning at nine o'clock sharp special meeting to-morrow ' hyacinth be bewilder there be something quite unfamiliar in this prompt and business-like advertisement of prayer the student with the papers begin to be doubtful of he ` you be not high church be you ' he ask ` we be not we do not have print office with verse and respond and that sort of thing we have extempore prayer by member of the union ' ` no i be not high church ' say hyacinth -- ` at least i think not i do not really know much about these thing i 'll be very glad to go to you meeting ' ` that be right ' say the other ` all be welcome there will be special prayer to-morrow for the success of the british arm i suppose you hear that old kruger have send a ultimatum there will be war at once ' there be a sudden movement among the student gown be pull straight and cap adjust ` here he come ' say someone dr henry the divinity professor cross the square rapidly he be a middle-aged man stout almost ponderous in figure but he hold himself rigidly upright and walk fast across the square the extreme neatness of he clothes contrast with the prevail shabbiness of the student and the assistant lecturer who follow he yet he do not seem to be a man who give to externals more than they due share of consideration he broad forehead give promise of great intellectual power a promise half belie by the narrow gray eye beneath it these be eye which might see keenly and would certainly see thing just as they be though they be not likely to catch any glimpse of that greater world where object can not be focus sharply yet in they a odd contradiction there lurk a possibility of humorous twinkle the man be capable perhaps of the broad tolerance of the great humorist certainly of very acute perception of life 's minor incongruity he thin lip be habitually press together give a suggestion of strength to the set of he mouth a man with such a mouth can think and act but not feel either passionately or enduringly he will direct man because he know he own mind but be not likely to sway they because he will always be master of himself and will not become enslave to any great enthusiasm the student troop into the hall and the examination begin the assistant lecturer help in the work each student be call up in turn ask a few question and give a portion of the greek testament to translate for the most part they capacity be know beforehand there be some who have win honor in they university course before enter the divinity school for they the examiner be all smile and the business of the day be understand to be perfunctory other be recognize as mere pass man whom it be necessary to spur to some exertion a few like hyacinth be unknown these be the poorer student who have not be able to afford to reside at the university sooner than be absolutely necessary they knowledge generally scanty be receive by the examiner with undisguised contempt it fall to hyacinth 's lot to present himself to dr henry he do so tremulously the professor inquire he name and look he over coldly ` read for I ' he say hand he a greek testament the passage mark be st paul 's great description of charity it be very familiar to hyacinth and he read it with a serious feeling for the word dr henry who at first have occupy himself with some figure on a sheet of paper look up and listen attentively ` where be you at school ' he ask ` who teach you greek ' ` my father teach I sir ' ` ah you have get a very peculiar pronunciation and you have make a extraordinary number of mistake in accentuation and quantity but you have read as if st paul mean something now translate ' ` you have give I ' he say when hyacinth have finish ` the authorize version word for word can you do no better than that ' ' i can do it differently ' say hyacinth ` not better ' ` do you know any greek outside of the new testament ' hyacinth repeat a few line from homer ` that book of the odyssey be not in the college course ' say dr henry ` how do you come to read it ' hyacinth have no explanation to give he have read the book it seem without be force and without hope of get a prize he recite it as if he like it the remainder of the examination disclose the fact that he be lamentably deficient in the rudiment of greek grammar and have the very vaguest idea of the history of the church afterwards professor henry discuss the new class with he assistant as they cross the square together ` the usual lot ' say dr spenser -- ` half a dozen scholar perhaps one man among they with real brain the rest be either idler or what be worse duffer ' ' i hit on one man with brain ' say dr henry ` oh thompson i suppose i see that you take he he do well in he degree exam ' ` no ' say dr henry ` the man i mean have more brain than thompson he be a man i never hear of before he name be conneally he look as if he come up from the wild somewhere he have hand like a agricultural labourer and a brogue that i fancy come from galway but he be a man to keep a eye on he may do something by-and-by if he do not go off the line we must try and lick he into shape a bit ' hyacinth conneally know extremely little about the politics foreign or domestic of the english nation he father neither read newspaper nor care to discuss such rumor of the doings of government as happen to reach carrowkeel on the other hand he know a good deal about the history of ireland and the english be still for he the ` new foreigner ' whom keat describe he intercourse with the fisherman and peasant of the galway seaboard have intensify he vague dislike of the series of oscillation between bullying and bribery which make up the story of england 's latest attempt to govern ireland without in the least understand the reason for the war in south africa he feel a strong sympathy with the boer to he they seem a small people doom if they fail to defend themselves to something like the treatment which ireland have receive it be therefore with surprise almost with horror that he listen for the first time to the superlative imperialism of the protestant unionist party when he attend the prayer-meeting to which he have be invite the room be well fill with student who join heartily in the singing of ` onward christian soldier ' a hymn select as appropriate for the occasion a address by the chairman a dublin clergyman follow accord to this gentleman the boer be a psalm-singing but hypocritical nation addict to slave-driving england on the other hand be the pioneer of civilization and the nursing-mother of missionary enterprise it be therefore clear that all good christian ought to pray for the success of the british arm the speech bewildered rather than irritated hyacinth the mind gasp for a time when immerse suddenly in a entirely new view of thing and require time to adjust itself for pleasure or revolt just as the body do when plunge into cold water it have never previously occur to he that a irishman could regard england as anything but a pirate anger rapidly succeed he surprise while he listen to the prayer which follow it be apparently open to any student present to give utterance as occasion offer to he desire and a large number of young man avail themselves of the opportunity some speak briefly and haltingly some laboriously attempt to adapt the phraseology of the prayer-book to the sentiment of the moment a few have the gift of rapid and even eloquent supplication these last be the hardest to endure they preface they request with fantastic eulogy of england 's righteousness design apparently for the edification of the audience present in the flesh for they invariably begin by assure the almighty that he be well aware of the fact and generally apologize to he for recapitulate they hyacinth 's anger increase as he hear the fervent groan which express the unanimous conviction of the justice of the petition no one seem to think it possible that the right could be on the other side when the meeting be over the secretary whose name it appear be mackenzie greet hyacinth warmly ` glad to have you with we ' he say ' i hope you 'll always come i shall be delighted to propose you as a member of the union subscription one shilling to defray necessary expense in any case whether you subscribe or not we shall be glad to have you with we ' ' i shall never come again ' say hyacinth mackenzie draw back astonished ` why not do not you like the meeting i think it be capital -- so informal and hearty do not you think it be hearty but perhaps you be high church be you ' hyacinth remember that this identical question have be put to he the day before by the pimply-faced boy who distribute leaflet he wonder vaguely at the importance which attach to the nickname ' i be not sure ' he say ` that i quite know what you mean you see i have only just enter the divinity school and i hardly know anything about theology what be a high churchman ' ` oh it do not require any theology to know that it be the simplest thing in the world a high churchman be -- well of course a high churchman sing gregorian chant you know and put flower on the altar there be more than that of course in fact a high churchman ------ ' he pause and then add with a air of victorious conviction : ` but anyhow if you be high church you would be sure to know it ' ` ah well ' say hyacinth turn to leave the room ' i do not know anything about it so i suppose i be not high church ' mackenzie however be not go to allow he to escape so easily ` hold on a minute if you be not high church why will not you come to we meeting ' ` because i can not join in you prayer when i be not at all sure that england ought to win ' ` good lord ' say mackenzie it be possible to startle even the secretary of a prayer union into mild profanity ` you do not mean to tell I you be a pro-boer and you a divinity student ' it have not hitherto strike hyacinth that it be impossible to combine a sufficient orthodoxy with a doubt about the invariable righteousness of england 's quarrel afterwards he come to understand the matter better chapter iii mackenzie be not at heart a ill-natured man and he would have repudiate with indignation the charge of be a mischief-maker he feel after he conversation with hyacinth much as most man would if they discover a unsuspected case of small-pox among they acquaintance he first duty be to warn the society in which he move of the existence of a dangerous man a violent and wicked rebel he repeat a slightly exaggerated version of what hyacinth have say to everyone he meet the pleasurable sense of personal importance which come with have a story to tell grow upon he and he spend the greater part of the day in seek out fresh confidant to swell the chorus of he commination in england at the time public opinion be rouse to a fever heat of patriotic enthusiasm and the irish protestant unionist be eager to outdo even the music-hall in imperialist sentiment the student of trinity college be then as ever the ` death or glory ' boy of irish loyalty it be easy to imagine how hyacinth 's name be whisper shudderingly in the reading-room of the library how he sentiment be anathematize in the dining-hall at common how plot be hatch for the chastisement of he iniquity over the fire in the evening when pipe be light and tea be brew at the end of the week hyacinth be in a exceedingly uncomfortable position outside the lecture-room nobody would speak to he inside he find himself the solitary occupant of the bench he sit on -- a position of comparative physical comfort for the other seat be crowd but not otherwise desirable a great english poet have just compose a poem which a musician no doubt equally eminent have set to a noble tune it embody a appeal for fund for purpose not clearly specify and hazard the experiment of rhyme ` cook 's son ' with ` duke 's son ' which in less fervent time might have provoke the criticism of the captious it become the fashion in college to chant this martial ode whenever hyacinth be see approach it be thunder out by a choir who march in step up and down he staircase bar of it be softly hum in he ear while he try to note the important truth which the lecturer impress upon they class one night five musician relieved each other at the task of play the tune on a concertina outside he door they commence briskly at eight o'clock in the evening and the final sleepy version only die away at six the next morning dr henry who either do not know or choose to ignore the state of the student ' feeling advise hyacinth to become a member of the theological debate society the election to membership he say be a mere form and nobody be ever exclude hyacinth send he name to the secretary and be blackbean by a overwhelming majority of the member shortly afterwards the lord-lieutenant pay a visit to the college and the student seize the chance of display they loyalty to the throne and constitution they assemble outside the library which the representative of queen victorium be inspect under the guidance of the provost and two of the senior fellow it be the nature of the student of trinity college to shout while they wait for the development of interesting event and on this occasion even the library wall be insufficient to exclude the noise the excellent nobleman inside find himself oblige to cast round for original remark about the manuscript of the ` book of kell ' while the air be heavy with the verse which commemorate the departure of ` fifty thousand fight man ' to table bay when at length he emerge on the library step the tune change as be right and proper to ` god save the queen ' strangely enough hyacinth have never before hear the national anthem it be not play or sing often by the native of connemara and although the ocean certainly form part of the british empire the atlantic wave have not yet learn to beat out this particular melody so it happen that hyacinth without mean to be offensive omit the ceremony of remove he hat a neighbor joyful at the opportunity snatch the offend garment and skim it far over the head of the crowd a few hard kick awaken hyacinth more effectually to a sense of he crime and it be with a tear coat and many bruise that he escape in the end to the shelter of he room less inclined to be loyal than when he leave they after a few week it become clear that the british army in south africa be not go to reap that rich and unvarying crop of victory which the valor of the soldier and the ability of the general deserve the indomitable spirit of the great nation rise to the occasion and the position of those who entertain doubt about the justice of the original quarrel become more than ever unbearable hyacinth take to wander by himself through part of the city in which he be unlikely to meet any of he fellow-student he soul grow bitter within he the course of petty persecution to which he be subject harden he original sentimental sympathy with the boer cause into a clearly define hatred of everything english when he get clear of the college and the hateful sound of the ` cook 's son duke 's son ' tune he tramp along gloat quietly over the news of the latest ` regrettable incident ' he be very lonely and friendless for not even the discomfiture of he enemy can make up to a young man for the want of a friend to speak to a inexpressible longing for home come over he there be a shop in a by-street which expose photograph of galway scenery in its window for a time hyacinth use to go day by day to gaze at they the modest front of the gaelic league hyce be another haunt of he he use to stand debate he eye on the irish title of the book in the window and repeat the word he read aloud to himself until the passer-by turn to look at he once he enter a low-browed dingy shop merely because the owner 's name be post over the door in gaelic character it be one of those shop to be find in the back street of most large town which devote themselves to a composite business display newspaper apple tobacco and sweet for sale the afternoon light already grow feeble in the open air have almost desert the interior of the shop at first hyacinth see nothing but a untidy red-haired girl reading in a corner by the ught of a candle ho ask she for cigarette she rise and lay she book and the candle on the counter it be one of o'growney 's irish primer dirty and pencilled hyacinth 's heart warm to she at once be she not try to learn the dear irish which the barefooted girl far away at home shout to each other as they drag the seaweed up from the shore then from the far end of the shop he hear a man 's voice speaking irish it be not the soft liquid tongue of the connaught peasant but a language more regular and formal the man speak it as if it be a language he have learn comparatively slowly and with effort yet the sound of it seem to hyacinth one of the sweetest thing he have ever hear not even the shrink self-distrust which he have be teach by repeat snubbing and protracted ostracism could prevent he from make himself know to this stranger ` the blessing of god upon ireland ' he say there be not a moment 's hesitation on the part of the stranger the sound of the gaelic be enough for he he stretch out both hand to hyacinth ` be it that you also be one of we -- one of the gael ' he ask hyacinth seize the outstretched hand and hold they tight the feeling of offer friendship and companionship warm he with a sudden glow he feel that he eye be fill with tear and that he voice would break if he try to speak but he do not care at all he pour out a long gaelic greet scarcely know what he say perhaps neither the man whose hand he hold nor the owner of the shop behind the counter fully understand he but they guess at he feeling ` be it that you be a stranger here and lonely where be you home what name be there on you ' ` maiseadh i be a stranger indeed and lonely too ' say hyacinth ` you be a stranger no longer then we be all of we friend with each other you speak we own dear tongue and that be enough to make we friend ' the tobacconist it appear also speak irish of a kind he cast occasional remark into the conversation which follow less it seem to hyacinth with a view of give expression to any thought than for the sake of air some phrase which he have somewhat inadequately learn indeed it strike hyacinth very soon that he new friend be get rather out of he depth in he ` own dear tongue ' at last the tobacconist say with a smile : ` i be afraid we must ask mr conneally -- do not you say that conneally be you name -- to speak the beurlum i be clean beat with the gaelic and you can not go much further yourself cahal be not that the truth now ' ` and small blame to I ' say cahal -- in english charle -- maguire ` after all what be i but a learner and it be clear that mr conneally have speak it since ever he speak at all ' hyacinth smile and nod maguire go on : ` what be you do this afternoon what do you say to come round with I to see mary o'dwyer it be she at home day and i be just on my way there ' ` but ' say hyacinth ' i do not know she i can hardly go to she house can i ' ` oh i 'll introduce you ' say maguire cheerfully ` she allow I to bring anyone i like to see she she like to know anyone who love ireland and speak gaelic perhaps we 'll meet finolum too she be often there ' ` meet who ' ` finolum that be what we call miss goold -- augusta goold you know we call she finolum because she shelter the rest of we under she wing when the moyle get tempestuous you remember the story ' ` of course i do ' say hyacinth who have learn the tale of lir 's daughter as other child do jack the giant-killer ` and who be miss o'dwyer ' ` oh she write verse surely you know they ' hyacinth shake he head ` what a pity we all admire they immensely she have something nearly every week in the _ croppy _ she have just bring out a volume of lyric she brother work the publishing of it in new york he be mix up with literary people there you must have hear of he at all event he be patrick o'dwyer one of the few who stand by o'neill when he fight the priest he give up the parliamentary people after that no honest man could do anything else ' he conduct hyacinth to one of the old square on the north side of the city when the tide of fashion set southward spread terrace and villa from leeson street to killiney it leave behind some of the finest house in dublin nowadays for a comparatively low rent it be possible to live in a splendid house if you do not aspire to the glory of a smart address miss o'dwyer 's house for instance boast a spacious hall and lofty sitting-room with impressive ceiling and handsome fireplace yet she pay for it little more than half the rent which a cramped villa in clyde road would have cost she even so it be somewhat of a mystery to she friend how miss o'dwyer manage to live there a solicitor who have he office on the ground-floor probably pay the rent of the whole house but the profit of verse-making be small and a poetess like meaner woman require food clothes and fire indeed miss o'dwyer no longer be o would ' whose verse adorn the _ croppy _ but ` miranda ' serve a english paper as irish correspondent it be a pity that a pen certainly capable of better thing should have be employ in describe the newest costume of the lord lieutenant 's wife at punchestown or the confection of pale-blue tulle which drape round mr chesney adorn a castle ball miss o'dwyer herself be heartily ashamed of the work but it be or appear to she to be necessary to live and even with the aid of occasional remittance from patrick in new york she could scarcely have afford she friend a cup of tea without the guinea earn by torture the english language in a weekly chronicle of irish society 's clothes even with the help of such earnings poverty be for ever tap she on the shoulder and no one except mary herself and she one maid-servant know how carefully fire and light have to be economize in the splendid room where a extinct aristocracy have hold revel a century before hyacinth and he friend advance past the solicitor 's door and up the broad staircase as far as the drawing-room for a time they get no further than the threshold the opening of the door be greet with a long-drawn and emphatic ` hush ' from the company within maguire lay he hand on hyacinth 's arm and the two stand still look into the room what be leave of the feeble autumn twilight be almost exclude by half-drawn curtain no lamp be light and the fire cast only fitful ray here and there through the room it be with difficulty that hyacinth discerned figure in a semicircle and a slim woman in a white dress standing apart from the other near the fire then he hear a voice a singularly sweet voice as it seem to he recite with steady emphasis on the syllable which mark the rhythm of the poem : ` out there in the west where the heavy gray cloud be insistent where the sky stoop to gather the earth into mournful embrace where the country lie saturate sodden round saturate hamlet -- ` out there in the sunset where rage and surge atlantic and the salt be commingle with rain over desolate beach thy heart o beloved be still beat -- fitfully feebly ` be beat -- ah not as it beat in the squadron of sarafield exultantly joyously gladly expectant of battle with throb like the note of the drum when man gather for fight ` beat still but ah not as it beat in the latest fitzgerald nobly devote to he race 's most noble tradition or in emmet or davi or last on they list in o'brien ` beat fitfully feebly o desolate mother o erin when shall the pulse of thy life which but flutter in connaucht throb through thy meadow and bogland and mountain and city ' a subdue murmur of applause greet the close of the recitation and praise more sincere than that with which politeness generally greet the drawing-room performance of minor poet hyacinth join in neither it seem to he that the verse be too beautiful to speak about so sacred that praise be a kind of sacrilege perhaps some excuse may be find for he emotion in the fact that for week he have hear no poetry except the ode about ` wipe something off a slate ' the violence of the contrast benumb he critical faculty so a man who be oblige to gaze for a long time at the new church erect in belfast might afterwards catch himself in the act of admire the house which the congested district board build in connaught ' i be afraid i must have bore you ' it be miss o'dwyer who greet he ' i do not see you and mr maguire come in until i have commence my poor little poem i ought to have give you some tea before i inflict it on you ' ` oh ' say hyacinth ` it be beautiful be it really you own do you write it ' miss o'dwyer flush the vehement sincerity of he tone embarrass she though she be accustom to praise ` you be very kind ' she say ` all my friend here be far too kind to I but come now i must give you some tea ' the tea be nearly stone cold and weak with frequent watering the saucer and spoon possibly even the cup have be use by someone else before mr maguire secure for himself the last remain morsel of cake leave hyacinth the choice between a gingerbread biscuit and a tear slice of bread and butter none of these thing appear to embarrass miss o'dwyer they do not matter in the least to hyacinth ` do you know the west well ' he ask ` indeed i do not i have always long to go and spend a whole long summer there but i have never have the chance ' ` then how do you know it be like that i mean how do you catch the spirit of it in you poem ' ` do i ' she say ' i be so glad but i do not deserve any credit for it i write those verse after i have be look at one of jim tynan 's picture you know they of course no oh but you must go and see they at once if you love the west and you do do not you ' ` it be my home ' say hyacinth when he have finish he tea she introduce he to some of the people who be in the room afterwards he come to know they but the memory which miss o'dwyer 's verse call up in he make he absent and preoccupy he scarcely hear the name she speak soon the party break up and hyacinth turn to look for maguire ` i be afraid mr maguire have go ' say miss o'dwyer ` he have a lecture to attend this afternoon you must come here again mr conneally come next Wednesday -- every Wednesday if you like we can have a talk about the west i shall want you to tell I all sort of thing perhaps finola will be here next week she very often come i shall look forward to introduce you to she you be sure to admire she immensely we all do ' ` yes i have hear of she ' say hyacinth ` mr maguire tell I who she be ' ` oh but he could not have tell you half she be magnificent all the rest of we be only little child compare to she now be sure you come and meet she ' chapter iv ever since pitt and castlerea perpetrate they act of union two political party have struggle together in ireland both of they have be steadily prominent so prominent that they have sometimes attract the attention of the english public and draw to they contest a little quite unintelligent interest the simplest and most discernible line of division between they be a religious one the protestant party have hitherto be guide and lead by the gentry it have be steadily loyal to england and to the english government it have not be greatly concern about ireland or ireland 's welfare but have be consistently anxious to preserve its own privilege power and property it have not come well out of the struggle of the nineteenth century its church have be disestablish its privilege and power abolish and the last remnant of its property be be filch from it it be a curious piece of irony that this party should have hasten its own defeat by the very policy adopt to secure victory no doubt the irish aristocracy would have suffer less if they have be seditious instead of loyal the roman catholic party have be lead by ecclesiastic and have always include the bulk of the people its leader have not care for the welfare of ireland any more than the protestant party but they have always pretend that they do be in this respect much wiser than they opponent they have pull the string of a whole series of political movement and make puppet dance on and off the stage as they choose also they have understand how to deal with england unlike the protestant party they have never be loyal because they know from the first that england give most to those who bully or worry she they have keep one object steadily in view a object quite as selfish in reality as that of the aristocracy -- the aggrandisement of they church for this they have be prepare at any time to sacrifice the interest of ireland and be content at the present moment to watch the country bleed to death with entire complacency the leader of this party enter upon the twentieth century in sight of they promised land they possess all the power and nearly all the wealth of ireland if the bishop can secure the continuance of english government for the next half-century ireland will have become the church 's property she money will go to propagate the faith she child will supply the english-speaking world with a superfluity of priest and nun outside both party there have always be a few man unite by no tie of policy or religion unless as perhaps we may we call patriotism a kind of religion other land have be love sincerely devotedly passionately as mother wife and mistress be love ireland alone have be love religiously as man be teach to love god or the saint she lover have call themselves catholic or protestant : such distinction have not matter to these man they have scarcely ever be able to form themselves into a party never into a strong or a wise party they have be violent desperate frequently ridiculous but always sincere and unselfish they great weakness have lie in the fact that they have have no consistent aim some of they leader have look for a return to ireland 's constitution and build upon the watchword of the volunteer ` the king the lord and the common of ireland ' some have dream of a complete independence of a irish republic shape its own world policy some have wholly distrusted politics and give they strength to the intellectual spiritual or material regeneration of the people among these man have be find the sanest practical reformer and the wildest revolutionary dreamer on the outskirts of they company have hang all sort of people parliamentary politician have lean towards they and be drive straightway out of public life criminal have claim fellowship with they and bring discredit upon honorable man poet and man of letter have draw they inspiration from they striving and in return have deck they patriotism with imperishable splendor in the future no doubt the struggle will lie between this party and the hitherto victorious hierarchy with england for ally and the fight seem a wholly unequal one it be into a advanced and vehement group of patriot that mary o'dwyer introduce hyacinth he become a regular reader of the _ croppy _ and make the acquaintance of most of the contributor to its page he find they clever enthusiastic and agreeable man and woman but as he be force to admit to himself occasionally reckless one evening a discussion take place in mary o'dwyer 's room which startle and shock he excitement run high over the event of the war the sympathy of the ` independent irelander ' as they call themselves fiercely assertive even in they name be of course entirely with the boer and they receive every report of a english reverse with unmixed satisfaction when hyacinth enter the room he find four people there mary o'dwyer herself be make tea at a little table near the fire augusta goold -- the famous finolum -- be stretch in a deep chair smoking a cigarette she be a remarkable woman both physically and intellectually it be she delight to emphasize she splendid figure by drape it in brilliant red and yellow to anyone who care to speculate on such a subject it seem a mystery why she clothes remain on she when she walk the law of gravity seem to demand that they should loosen with she movement become detach and finally drop down nothing of the sort have ever happen so it must be presume that she have secret and unconventional way of fasten they similarly it be not easy to see why she hair stay upon she head it be arrange upon no recognize system and suggest that she have perfect the art know generally only to heroine of romance of twist she tress with a single movement into a loose knot that she affect white frill of immense complexity be frequently evident owe to the difficulty she experience in confine she long leg to feminine attitude she complexion put it in the power of she enemy to accuse she of familiarity with cosmetic -- a slander for she have be observe to turn green during a attack of sea-sickness she have great brilliant eye which be capable of express intensity of enthusiasm or hatred but no one have ever see they soften with any emotion like love she attitude towards social convention be symbolize by she clothes in the old day when the house of ` society ' have still be open to she she be accustom to challenge criticism by fondle a pet monkey at tea-party since she have lose caste by take up the cause of ` independent ireland ' the ape have be discard and the same result achieve by occasional bickering with the police she be a able public speaker and could convince she audience for a time of the reasonableness of opinion which next morning appear to be the outcome of delirium she write not like mary o'dwyer verse in which any sentiment may be excuse but incisive and vigorous prose occasionally even the castle official get glimmering of the meaning of one of she article and suppress the whole issue of the _ croppy _ in which it appear near she sit a much less remarkable person -- thoma grealy historian and archaeologist he have be engage for many year on a history of ireland but no volume of it have as yet appear he friend suspect that he have get permanently stick somewhere about the period of the introduction of christianity into the island he essay publish in the _ croppy _ dwelt with passionate regret on the depart glory of tara he hold strong view about the historical reality of the tuath-de-danaan and get irritated at the most casual mention of dr petrie 's theory of the round tower he have prove that king arthur be a irishman with whose reputation malory and tennyson have take unwarrantable liberty the name of dante bring a smile of contempt to he lip for he know that the ` purgatorio ' be steal shamelessly from the work of a monk of cong he nourish a secret passion for finolum he never venture to declare it but he imagination endowed every heroine from queen maev down to the foster daughter of the leinster farmer who marry king cormac with miss goold 's figure eye and hair it be perhaps the burning of this passion which render he so cadaverous that he clothes -- in other respects also they look as if they have be buy in far-off happier day -- hung round he like the covering of a broken-ribbed umbrella the fourth person present be timothy halloran who hover about mary o'dwyer 's tea-table he be what the country people call a ` spoilt priest ' destine by simple and pious parent to take holy order he get as far as the inside of maynooth college while there he have kick a fellow-student down the whole length of a long corridor for tell tale to the authority a committee of ecclesiastic consider the case and have come to the conclusion that he lack vocation for the priesthood send he home timothy be accustom to say that he violence might have be pass over but that he failure to appreciate the devotion to duty which inspire the tale-bearer mark he decisively as unfit for ordination he never regret he expulsion although he complain bitterly that he have be nearly choke before they cast he out he mean it be to be suppose that the effort to instil a proper reverence for dogma have almost destroy he capacity for think not that the finger of the reverend professor have actually close around he windpipe he subsequent experience have include a period of teaching in a english board school a brief but not wholly unsatisfactory career as a political organizer in new york and a return to ireland where he earn a precarious living as a journalist all four greet hyacinth warmly as he enter the room ` we be just discuss ' say mary o'dwyer ` the failure of we attempt to organize a field hospital and a staff of nurse for the boer it be a shame to have to admit that the english garrison in ireland can raise thousand of pound for they war fund and the irish can not be get to subscribe a few hundred ' ` the wealth of the country ' say grealy ` be in the hand of a minority -- the so-called loyalist ' ` nonsense ' say finolum sharply ` if you ever give a think to anything more recent than the high-king 's court at tara you would know that the landlord be not the wealthy part of the community any longer there be many a provincial publican call himself a nationalist who could buy up the nearest landlord and every protestant in the parish along with he i be a protestant myself bear and breed among the class you speak of and i know ' ` you be quite right miss goold ' say tim ` the people could have give the money if they like i attribute the failure of the fund to the apathy or treachery of the priest call it which you like there be not a protestant church in the country where the parson do not preach give give give to they people Sunday after Sunday and what be the result why they have raise thousand of pound ' ` after the poem you publish in last week 's _ croppy _ ' say hyacinth to mary o'dwyer ' i make sure the subscription would have come in you appeal be one of the most beautiful thing i ever read it would have touch the heart of a stone ' ` poetry be all well enough ' say tim ' i admire you verse mary as much as anyone but we want a collection at every church door after mass that be what we ought to have but it be exactly what we will not get because the priest be west briton at heart they would pray for the queen and the army to-morrow like cardinal vaughan if they be not afraid ' ' i believe ' say finola ` that we go the wrong way about the thing altogether we ask for a hospital and we appeal to the people 's pity for the wound boer nobody in ireland care a pin about the boer why on earth should we from all i can hear they be a narrow-minded intolerant set of hypocrite i would just as soon read the stuff some fool of a english newspaper man write about we brother the boer as listen to the maudlin sentiment we people talk we do not want to help the boer we want to hurt the english ' ` and you think -- ' say grealy ' i think ' go on finolum ` that we ought to have ask for volunteer to go out and fight instead of nurse to cocker up the man who be fool enough to get themselves shoot we would have get they ' ` you would not ' say tim ` the clergy would have be dead against you they would have nip the whole project in the bud without so much as make a noise in do it ' ` that be true ' say grealy ` remember miss goold it be the priest who curse tara and the monk who break the power of the irish king i have not work the thing out yet but i mean to show -- ' finolum interrupt the poor man ruthlessly : ` let 's try it anyway let 's preach a crusade ' ` not the least bit of good ' say tim ` every blackguard in the country be enlist already in the connaught banger or the dublin fusilier or some confound militia regiment there be nobody left but the nice respectable goody-goody boy who would not leave they mother or miss go to confession if you go down on you knee to they ' ` well then the irish troops ought to shoot they officer and walk over to the boer camp ' say finola savagely hyacinth half smile at what seem to he a monstrous jest then when he perceive that she be actually in earnest the smile freeze into a kind of grin he hand tremble with the violence of he indignation ` it would be devilish treachery ' he blurt out ` the name of irishman will never be disgrace by such a act ' augusta goold fling she cigarette into the grate and rise from she chair she stand over hyacinth she hand clench and she bosom heave rapidly she eye blaze down into he until they scorn cow he ` there be no treachery possible for a irishman ' she say ` except the one of fight for england any deed against england -- yes _ any _ deed -- be glorious and not shameful ' hyacinth be utterly quell he venture upon no reply indeed not only do she violence render argument undesirable -- and it seem for the moment that he would find himself in actual grip with a furious amazon -- but she word carry with they a certain conviction it actually seem to he while she speak as if a good defense might be make for irish soldier who murder they officer and desert to a enemy in the field it be not until hour afterwards when the vivid impression of finolum 's face have fade from he recollection when he have begin to forget the flash of she eye the poise of she figure and the glow of she drapery that he moral sense be able to reassert itself then he know that she have speak wickedly it might be right for a irishman to fight against england when he could it might be justifiable to seize the opportunity of england 's embarrassment to make a bid for freedom by strike a blow at the empire so far he conscience go willingly but that treachery and murder could ever be anything but horrible he refuse altogether to believe another conversation in which he take part about this time help hyacinth still further to understand the position of he new friend tim halloran and he be smoking and chat together over the fire when maguire join they ` what be the matter with you ' ask halloran ` you look as if you would be at you mother 's funeral ' ` you be not so far out in you guess ' say maguire grimly ' i spend the morning at my sister 's wedding would you like a bit of the cake ' he produce from he pocket a paper contain crushed fragment of white sugar and a shapeless mass of citron and currant ` with the compliment of the reverend mother ' he say ` try a bit ' ` what on earth do you mean ' say hyacinth ` oh i assure you the sister of pity do these thing in style ' say maguire ` it be a pretty fancy that of the wedding-cake be not it but you be a protestant conneally you do not understand this delicate playfulness i be present to-day at the reception of my only sister into the institute of the catholic sister of pity found by honorium kavanagh i have lose birdie maguire that be all the little girl that use to climb on to my knee and kiss I and instead of she there be a sister monica mary who will no doubt pray for my soul when she be let ' ` what be the figure in she case ' ask tim in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone ` six hundred pound ' say maguire ` it must have put the old man to the pin of he collar to pay it the only time he ever talk to I about he affair he tell I he have get four hundred pound put by for birdie 's fortune and that i be to have my medical course and whatever the old shop would fetch when he be go they must have put the screw on pretty tight to make he spring the extra two hundred i dare say i shall suffer for it in the end he must have borrow the money ' hyacinth feel intensely curious about this young nun like most protestant he have grow up to regard monasticism in all its form as something remote partly horrible wholly unintelligible ` why do she do it ' he ask ` what sort of a girl be she do you mind tell I ' ` not in the least ' say maguire ` only i be not sure that i know three year ago -- that be when i leave home -- she be the last sort of girl you could imagine go into a convent she be pretty fond of nice clothes and admiration as keen as every girl ought to be on a dance i never suppose she have a thought of religion in she head -- i mean beyond the usual confession and attendance at mass ' ' i suppose ' say hyacinth ` you people want it ' ' i do not think so ' say maguire ` perhaps my mother do i do not know ' ` you see conneally ' say tim halloran ` it be a sort of hall-mark of respectability among people like maguire 's to have a girl in a good convent a little lower down in the social scale in the class i come from the boy be make priest a doctor be a more expensive article to manufacture so maguire 's father select that line of life for he not that they could have make a priest of you maguire in any case you would have disgrace maynooth as i do ' ' i do not understand ' say hyacinth ' i think a vocation for the life be necessary ' ` oh so it be ' say tim halloran ` but you see there be the period of the novitiate give a girl at a impressionable age the proper convent atmosphere and a prize of six hundred pound for the order and it will go hard with the reverend mother if she can not work the girl up to a vocation it take a man a lifetime to make six hundred pound in a country shop but there be many a one who do it by hard work and self-denial then down come the nun and sweep it away and it be waste it ought to be invest in a local factory or in waterworks or gas-works or fifty other thing that would benefit the town it be make in it ought to be fructify and bear interest instead of which off it go to munich for stain glass or to italy for a marble altar be it any wonder ireland be cry out with poverty ' ` yes ' say maguire ` and that be not the worst of it i would be content to let they take the damned money and deck they church with it but the girl -- there be hundred of they catch every year for nun and sweep out of life it be not the irish convent alone that get they american nun come over and australian nun and they go round and round the country pick up girl here and there and carry they off there i do not want to talk too much about it the money be nothing but the girl and boy -- ' ` it seem strange to I ' say hyacinth ` that when you think that way you should go on belong to you church ' ` desert the church ' say maguire ` we 'll never do that how could we live without religion and what other religion be there i grant you that you priest would not rob we but -- but think of the cold of it you can not realize it conneally but think what it would mean to a catholic -- a religion without saint without absolution without sacrifice besides what we complain of be not catholicism it be a parasitic growth destroy the true faith defile the church ' ` yes ' say tim halloran ` and even from my point of view how should we be the better of a change you church be rule by old woman who think the name of englishman the most glorious in the world you preach loyalty and i believe you pray for the queen in you service a nice fool i would feel pray that the queen should have victory over she enemy ' for a long time afterwards this conversation dwelt in hyacinth 's mind tim halloran he know to be practically a freethinker but maguire regularly hear mass on sunday and often go to confession it be a puzzle how he could do so feel as he do about the religious order so insistent do the problem become to he mind that he find himself continually lead the conversation round to it from one side or another mary o'dwyer tell he that she also have a sister in a nunnery ` she teach girl to make lace and wonderful work they do she be perfectly happy i think she face be the sweetest and most beautiful thing i have ever see there be not a line on it of care or of fretfulness it seem to I as if she whole life might be describe as a quiet smile i always feel better by the mere recollection of she face for a long time after i have visit she oh i know it would not do for I i could not stand it for a week i should go mad with the quiet restraint of it all but my sister be happy i can not forget that i suppose she have a vocation ' ` vocation ' say hyacinth thoughtfully ` yes i can understand how that would make all the difference but how many of they have the vocation ' ` do not you think vocation might be learn i mean might not one grow into it if one wish to very much and if the life be constantly before one 's eye beautiful and calm ' it be almost the same thought which timothy halloran have suggest mary o'dwyer speak of grow into vocation tim of the working of it up be there any difference except a verbal one on another occasion he speak to dr henry about the position of the church of ireland in the country ` we have prove ' say the professor ` that the roman claim have no support in scripture history or reason we book remain unanswered because they be unanswerable we can do no more ' ` we might offer the irish people a church which they could join ' say hyacinth ` we do we offer they the church of st patrick the ancient historic church of ireland we offer they the two sacrament of the gospel administer by priest duly ordain at the hand of a episcopate which go back in a unbroken line to the apostle we present they the three great creed for they assent we use a liturgy that be at once ancient and pure the church of ireland have all this be beyond dispute a branch of the great catholic church of christ ' ` it may be all you say ' say hyacinth ` but it be not national in sentiment and sympathy it be english and not irish ' ' i know what you mean ' say dr henry ' i think i understand how you feel but i can not consent to the conclusion you want to draw there be no real meaning in the cry for nationality it be a sentiment a fashion and will pass even if it be genuine and enduring i hold it to be better for ireland to be a integral part of a great empire than a contemptible and helpless item among the nation of the world a prey to the intrigue of ambitious foreign statesman ' hyacinth sigh and turn to go but dr henry lay a hand upon he shoulder and detain he ` conneally ' he say kindly ` let I give you a word of advice do not mix yourself up with you new friend too much you will ruin you own prospects in life if you do there be nothing more fatal to a man among the people with whom you and i be to live and work than the suspicion of be taint with nationalist idea you can not be both a rebel and a clergyman you see ' he add with a smile ' i take enough interest in you to know who you friend be and what you be think about ' chapter v augusta goold 's scheme for enrol irish volunteer to help the boer be duly set forth in the next issue of the _ croppy _ it include two appeal -- one for money and one for man the detail be work out with the frank contempt for possibility which characterize some of the famous suggestion of dean swift she have the same faculty that he have for bring absurdity within the range of the commonplace but there be this difference between they -- miss goold quite believe in she own plan while the great dean no doubt grin over the proof-sheet of he ` modest proposal ' it happen most unfortunately that the appeal synchronize with another also for fund which be issue by mr o'rourke the leader of the parliamentary party since the death of john o'neill the purse of the party have be get lean the old tactic which use to draw plaudit and dollar from the united state as well as a tribute from every parish in ireland have lately be unsuccessful there be still violent scene in the house of common but they no longer produce anything except contemptuous smile member of parliament still succeed occasionally in get the chief secretary to imprison they but the glory of martyrdom be harder to win than in the old day latterly thing have come to such a pass that even the reduce stipend offer to the member fall into arrear the attendance at westminster drop away the government could afford to smile at mr o'rourke 's effort to make himself disagreeable and the opposition be frankly contemptuous of a people who could not profit they by more than a dozen vote in a critical division it become impossible to wring even a modest land bill from the prime minister and mr chesney now much at ease in the secretary 's office in the castle scarcely feel it necessary to be civil to deputation which want railway it be clear that something must be do or mr o'rourke 's business would disappear he decide to appeal for fund _ orbus et urbi _ the world -- in this case north america -- be to be visit exhorted and it be hope tax by some of he most eloquent lieutenant even canada with its leaven of orangeman be to be honor with the speech of a orator of second-rate power the city -- dublin of course -- be the choose scene of the leader 's personal exertion since he revolt against john o'neill o'rourke have be a little shy of dublin audience but the press nature of the present crisis almost force he to pay he court to the capital he find some comfort in the recollection that during the five year that have elapse since o'neill 's death he have miss no public opportunity of shed tear beside he tomb he remember too that he have put he name down for a large subscription towards the erection of a statue to the dead leader a work of art which the exist generation seem unlikely to have the pleasure of see thus it happen that on the very day of the publication of miss goold 's scheme mr o'rourke announce he intention of address a appeal for fund to a public meeting in the rotunda miss goold be disconcerted and irritated she be well aware that mr o'rourke 's appeal would give the respectable nationalist a excellent excuse for ignore hers and unfortunately the respectable people be just the one who have most money she be confident that she could rely on the extreme section of the nationalist and on that element in the city population which love and make a row but she could not count on the moneyed class they be so far as they word go very enthusiastic for the boer cause but when it come to write cheque it be likely that the counter-attraction of the parliamentary fund would prove too strong since it seem that mr o'rourke would certainly spoil she collection the obvious thing to do be to try to spoil he if he afford people a excuse for not pay the travel expense of she volunteer to lorenzo marque she would if possible suggest a way of escape from pay for he man 's journey to london after all no one really want to subscribe to either fund and it might be suppose that the public would very gladly keep they purse shut altogether for a irishman it be quite possible to be genuinely enthusiastic and at the same time able to see the humorous side of he own enthusiasm this be a reason why a irishman be never a bear unless to gain he private end he want to be even a irish advocate of total abstinence or a irish antivaccinationist if such a thing exist be not a bear because he will always trot out he conscientious objection with a half-humorous half-deprecating smile this same capacity for avoid the slavery of serious fanaticism enable a irishman to cease quite joyfully from the pursuit of he own particular fad in order to corner a obnoxious opponent thus augusta goold and she friend be genuinely desirous of strike a blow at england and really believe that they volunteer might do it but this do not prevent they from find infinite relish in the prospect of watch mr o'rourke squirm on the horn of a dilemma they take counsel together and the result of they deliberation be peculiar they propose to invite mr o'rourke to join he appeal to theirs to pool the money which come in and to divide it evenly between the volunteer and the member of parliament it be tim halloran who hit upon the brilliant idea augusta goold chuckle over it as she grasp its consequence mr o'rourke tim argue would be unwilling to accept the proposal because he want all the money he could get more than be at all likely to be collect he would be equally unwilling to reject it because he could then be represent as indifferent to the heroic struggle of the boer in the exist state of irish and american opinion a suspicion of such indifference would be quite sufficient to wreck he chance of get any money at all of course the obvious way of make such a proposal would have be by letter to mr o'rourke afterwards the correspondence -- he must make a reply of some sort -- could be send to the press and sufficient publicity would be give to the matter this be what tim halloran want to do but such a course do not commend itself to augusta goold it lack dramatic possibility and there be always the chance that the lead papers might refuse to take any notice of the matter or relegate the letter to a back page and small print besides a mere newspaper controversy would not make a strong appeal to the section of the dublin populace on whose support she chiefly rely a much more attractive plan suggest itself augusta goold with a few friend to act as aide-de-camp would present herself to mr o'rourke at he rotunda meeting and put the proposal to he then and there in the presence of the audience in the meantime the few day before the meeting be occupy in scatter suggestive seed over the hoarding and blank wall of the city one morning people be startle by the sight of a immense placard which ask in violent red letter ` what be ireland go to do ' public opinion be divide about the ultimate purpose of the poster the majority expect the announcement of a new play or novel a few hold that a pill or a cocoa would be recommend next morning the question become more explicit and the hypothesis of the play and the pill be exclude ` what ' the new poster run ` be ireland go to do for the boer ' the public be not intensely anxious to find a answer to the conundrum thrust thus forcibly on they attention but they become curious to know who the advertiser be who hunger for the information man bless by providence with sagacious-looking face make the most of they opportunity and inform they friend that the thing be a new dodge of o'rourke 's to get money they reputation suffer when the next placard appear the advertiser have apparently change they mind for what they now want to know be ` what be the irish mp 's go to do for the boer ' clearly mr o'rourke could have nothing to gain by insist on a answer to such a question the public be puzzle but please the bill-sticker of the city foresee the possibility of realize a competence for the next morning the satisfied inquirer publish the result of they investigation ` the em pee ' -lrb- it be thus that they now refer to the honorable member of parliament -rrb- ` be support the infamy of england ' it be at this point that the eye of a castle official be catch by one of the placard as he make he way to the kildare street club for luncheon he discuss the matter with a colleague and it occur to they that since they be pay for govern ireland they ought to give the public some value for they money and seize the opportunity of do something they send a series of telegram to mr chesney 's london house which be forward by he private secretary to the riviera the reply which follow keep the castle official in a state of pleasurable excitement until quite late in the evening at about eight o'clock large number of metropolitan police sally out of they barracks and tear down the last batch of placard next morning fresh one be post up each of which bear the single word ` why ' the bill-sticker be highly pleased and many of they be arrest for drunkenness mr o'rourke be much less pleased for he begin to guess what the answer be likely to be and how it would affect he chance of secure a satisfactory collection the official be perplex they suspect the ` why ' of contain within its three letter some hideous sedition but it be not possible to deal vigorously with what might after all be only the cunning novelty of some advertising manufacturer more telegram harry mr chesney but before any definite course of action have be decide on the morning of the rotunda meeting arrive and with it a answer to the multifarious ` why ' : because o'rourke want all the money to spend in the london restaurant ' there be a great deal of laughter and many people quite uninterested in politics determine to go to the meeting in hope of more amusement when mr o'rourke take the chair the hall be crowd to its utmost capacity under ordinary circumstance this would have augur well for the success of he appeal for it show that the public be at all event not apathetic on this particular occasion however mr o'rourke would have be better pleased with a smaller audience the placard have show he that something unpleasant be likely to occur though they afford no hint of the form which the unpleasantness would take when he rise to he foot he be greet with the usual volley of cheer and although some rude remark about the boer be make in the corner of the hall they do not amount to anything like a organize attempt at interruption he begin he speech cautiously feel the pulse of he audience and ply they with the well-worn platitude of the nationalist platform when these evoke the usual enthusiasm he wax bolder and shoot out some almost original epigram direct against the government work up to a really new gibe about official who sit like spider spin murderous web in dublin castle the audience be delighted with this but they joy reach its height when someone shout : ` you might speak better of the man who tear down the placard on Wednesday ' mr o'rourke ignore the suggestion and pass on to sharpen he wit upon the landlord he describe they as ` ill-omened tax-gatherer who suck the life-blood of the country and refuse to disgorge a penny of it for any useful purpose ' mr o'rourke be not a man who shrink from a mixed metaphor or pause to consider such trifle as the unpleasantness which would ensue if anyone who have be suck blood be to repent and disgorge it ` where ' he go on to ask ` do they spend they immense revenue be it in ireland ' here he make one of those dramatic pause for which he oratory be famous the audience wait breathlessly for the denunciation which be to follow they be treat unexpectedly to a well-conceived anticlimax a voice speak softly but quite clearly from the back of the hall : ` bedad and i should not wonder if it be in the london restaurant ' a roar of laughter follow the orator might no doubt have make a effective reply but every time he open he mouth minor wit rend like wolf the carcase of the original joke yell ` turtle-soup ' at he or ` champagne and oyster ' he get angry and consequently flurry he try to quell the tumult by thunder out the denunciation which he have prepare but the delight which the audience take in shriek the item of they imaginary bill of fare be too much for he he forget what he have mean to say flounder attempt to pull himself together and bring out the stale jest about provide each landlord with a single ticket to holyhead ` and that same ' say he original tormentor ` would be cheaper than give you a return ticket to london ' the audience be immensely tickled so far the entertainment if not precisely novel be better than anything they have hope for and everyone have a agreeable conviction that there be still something in the way of a sensation in store perhaps it be eagerness for the expect climax which induce they to keep tolerably quiet during the remainder of mr o'rourke 's speech he set forth at some length the glorious achievement of he party in the past and explain the opportunity of future usefulness which lay to be grasp if only the necessary fund be provide he sit down to make way as he assure the audience for certain try and trusty soldier of the cause who be wait to propose important resolution so far as these warrior be concern he might as well have remain stand they resolution be to this day unproposed and uncommended -- a secret joy no doubt to those who frame they but not endorse by any popular approval hyacinth conneally be not admit to the secret council of augusta goold and she friend he know no more than the general public what kind of a coup be meditate but he gather from miss o'dwyer 's nervous excitement and tim halloran 's air of immense and mysterious importance that something quite out of the common be likely to occur by arrive a hour and a half before the opening of the meeting he secure a seat near the platform he enjoy the discomfiture of o'rourke whom he have learn from the page of the _ croppy _ to despise as a mere windbag and to hate as the betrayer of o'neill a sudden thrill of excitement go through he when o'rourke sit down the whole audience turn they face from the platform towards the door at the far end of the hall and hyacinth without know exactly what he expect turn too there be a sway visible among the crowd near the door and almost immediately it become clear that someone be try to force a way through the densely-packed people curse be to be hear and even cry from those who be be trodden on at last a way be make augusta goold follow by grealy halloran and mary o'dwyer come slowly up the hall towards the platform those of the audience whose limb have not be crush or they foot mangled in preparation for she progress cheer she wildly indeed she make a regal appeal to they even amidst a crowd of man she height make she conspicuous and she have array herself for the occasion in a magnificent violet robe it flow from she shoulder in spacious fold and sweep behind she splendidly contemptuous of the part it play as scavenger amid the accumulate filth of the floor she bare arm shine out of the wide sleeve which hang around they she neck rise strong and stately over the silver clasp of a cloak which she have throw back from she shoulder she wear a hat which seem to hold she hair captive from fall loose around she one great tress alone escape from it and by some cunning manipulation be make to stand straight out as if blow by the wind from its fastening in comparison she suite look commonplace and mean poor miss o'dwyer be array -- ` gown ' she would have say herself in report the scene -- in vesture not want in splendor but which beside miss goold 's could not catch the eye thoma grealy awkward and stooped peer through he glass at the crowd tim halloran walk jauntily but he eye glance nervously from side to side he be certainly ill at ease possibly frighten at the position in which he find himself a hurry consultation take place among the gentleman on the platform which end in mr o'rourke step forward with a smile and a outstretched hand to welcome augusta goold as she ascend the step the expression of he face belie the smile which he have impress upon he lip he eye have the same look of furtive malice as a dog 's which want to bite but fear the stick augusta goold wave aside the proffer hand and step unaided on to the platform mr o'rourke place a chair for she but she ignore it and stand with she follower behind she face the audience o'rourke and two of he tried and trusty member of parliament approach she they stand between she and the audience and talk to she for some time apparently very earnestly augusta goold look past they over they sometimes it seem through they while they speak but make they no answer whatever at last mr o'rourke shrug he shoulder and withdraw to he chair with a sulky scowl ' i wish ' say augusta goold ` to ask a simple question of you chairman ' mr o'rourke rise ` this meeting ' he say ` be convene for the purpose of raise fund for the carry on of the national business in the house of common if miss goold 's question relate to the business in hand i shall be most happy to answer it if not i be afraid i can not allow it to be ask here at another time and in another place i shall be prepare to listen to what miss goold have to say and in the meantime if she will take she seat on the platform she will be heartily welcome ' ` my question ' say augusta goold ` be intimately connect with the business of the meeting it be simply this : be you mr o'rourke prepare to give any portion of the money entrust to you by the irish people to assist the boer in they struggle for freedom ' it be manifestly absurd to ask such a question at all mr o'rourke have no intention of collect money for the boer who seem to have plenty of they own and he could not without breach of trust have apply fund subscribe to feed and clothe member of parliament to arm volunteer nevertheless it be a awkward question to answer in the presence of a audience excite by augusta goold 's beauty and splendid audacity a really strong man like for instance o'rourke 's predecessor john o'neill might have face the situation and win if not the immediate cheer at least the respect of the irish people but mr o'rourke be not a strong man and besides he be out of temper and have lose he nerve he take perhaps the worst course open to he : he make a speech he appeal to he past record as a nationalist and to he publicly reiterate expression of sympathy with the boer cause he ask the audience to trust he to do what be right but he neither say yes nor no to the question he be ask augusta goold stand calm and impassive while he speak a sneer gather on she lip and indrawn nostril as he make he appeal for the people 's confidence when he have finish she say very slowly and with that extreme distinctness of articulation which woman speaker seem to learn so much more easily than man : ` be you prepare to give any portion of the money entrust to you by the irish people to assist the boer in they struggle for freedom ' mr o'rourke be goad into attempt another speech but the audience be in no mood to listen to he he be interrupted again and again with shout of ` yes or no ' ` answer the question ' the banter tone with which they have ply he earlier in the evening with suggestion for a menu have change now into angry insistence he pass he hand over he forehead with a gesture of despair and sit down at once the tumult cease and the people wait breathless for augusta goold to speak again ` be you prepare ' -- she seem to have learn she question off by heart -- ` to give any portion of the money entrust to you by the irish people to assist the boer in they struggle for freedom ' mr shea a red-headed member of parliament from co limerick be himself one of those most deeply interested in the contents of the party 's purse spring to he foot it be clear that he be in a condition of almost dangerous excitement for he stammer as he shout to the chairman : ` sir be this -- this -- this woman to be allow to interrupt the meeting i demand she immediate removal ' augusta goold smile at he it be really a very gracious almost a tender smile one might imagine the divine theodora in she earlier day smile with just such a expression on a plebeian lover whose passion she regard as creditable to he but hopeless ' i assure you mr shea that i shall not interrupt the business for more than a minute mr o'rourke have only get to say one word -- either yes or no be you prepare to give any portion of the fund entrust to you by the irish people to assist the boer in they struggle for freedom ' mr shea be not at all mollify either by the smile or the politeness of she tone ` we shall not permit the meeting to be interrupt any more ' he shout ` either you will withdraw at once or we shall have you remove by force ' she smile at he again -- a pity smile as if she regret the petulance of he manner and turn to the chairman ` be you prepare to give -- ' then mr shea 's feeling become too strong for he self-control he spring forward apparently with the intention of lay violent hand upon augusta groold hyacinth conneally start up to protect she and the same impulse move a large part of the audience there be a rush for the platform and a fierce threatening yell mr shea hang back frightened augusta goold hold up she hand and immediately the rush stop and the people be silent she go on with she question take it up at the exact word which mr shea have interrupt in the same level and exquisitely irritating tone ' -- any of the money entrust to you by the irish people to assist the boer in they struggle for freedom ' mr o'rourke have sit scowl silently since the failure of he last attempt to explain himself this final disjointed repetition of the galling question rouse he to the necessity of do something he be a pitiful sight as he rise and confront augusta goold there be blotch of purple red and space of pallor on he face he hand twist together a sweat have break out from he neck and make he collar limp he word be a stammering mixture of bluster and appeal ` you must not -- must not -- must not interrupt the meeting ' so far he try to assert himself then with a glance at the contemptuous face of the woman before he he relapse into the tone of a schoolboy who beg off the last stroke of a cane ` be this nice conduct be it ladylike to come here and attack we like this miss goold i be ashamed of you ' ' i be glad to hear ' say augusta goold depart for the first time from she question ` that there be anything leave in the world that mr o'rourke be ashamed of i do not think there be ' it be mr shea and not he leader who resent this last insult he lip draw apart leave he tooth bare in a ghastly grin he clench he fist and stand for a moment tremble from head to foot then he leap forward towards augusta goold the man who stand next hyacinth lurch suddenly forward wrench he right hand free of the crowd round he and fling it back behind he head hyacinth see that he hold a large stone in it ` you be a cowardly blackguard shea ' he yell -- ' a damned cowardly blackguard would you strike a woman ' shea turn on the instant see the hand stretch back to fling the stone he seize the chair behind he -- the very chair which while a appearance of politeness be still possible mr o'rourke have offer to augusta goold -- and fling it with all he force at the man with the stone one of the leg graze hyacinth 's cheek scrape the skin off the corner of the seat strike the man beside he full across the forehead just above he eye the blood pour out blinding and then as he gasp choke he he reel and huddle together helplessly he could not fall for the pressure of the crowd round he hold he up hyacinth feel he hand grope wildly as if for support and reach out he own to grasp he but the man want no help for himself as soon as he feel another hand touch he he press the stone into it ' i can not see ' he whisper hoarsely ` take it you and kill he kill he kill he smash he skull ' hyacinth take the stone the feel of the man 's blood warm on it and the fierce yell and stamp of the crowd fill he with a mad lust of hate against shea who stand as if suddenly paralyze within a few foot of he he wrench he hand free and with a mighty effort fling the stone he see it strike shea fair on the forehead in spite of the tumult around he he fancy he hear the dull thud of its impact he see shea fling up he hand and pitch forward he see augusta goold gather she skirt in she hand and sweep they swiftly aside lest the man should fall on they then the crowd press towards the platform sweep he off he foot and he be toss helplessly forward a giddy sickness seize he the pressure slacken for a instant and he fall someone 's boot strike he on the head he feel without any keen regret that he be likely to be trample to death then he lose consciousness chapter vi next morning the dublin daily papers lay themselves out to make the most of the sensational fight at the rotunda even the habitually cautious _ irish time _ feel that the occasion justify the expression of a opinion and that there would be no serious risk of alienate the sympathy of subscriber and advertiser by condemn the bloodsh it publish a exceedingly dignified and stodgy leading article draw the largest and finest word from the dictionary and weave they with extraordinary art into sentence which would have be creditable to anyone bent upon imitate the style of dr samuel johnson the british empire and the whole of civilized europe be call upon to witness the unspeakably deplorable consequence which invariably follow the habitual neglect of the cultivation of the elementary decency of public life the paper disclaim any sympathy with either of the belligerent party and point out with sorrowful solemnity that if the principle sedulously inculcate upon its reader in its own column be persistently flout and contemn by those who claim the position of national representative little else except a repetition at frequent interval of the painful and humiliating scene of the night before could possibly be anticipate by reasonable observer of the general trend of democratic institution the _ daily express _ openly exult over the rioter its leading article -- the staff may have dance in a ring round the office table while compose it -- declare that now at length the irish have prove to the world that they be all without a solitary exception irredeemably vicious corner-boy miss augusta goold be warmly praise for have demonstrate once for all that ` patriotism ' ought to be write ` pat riotism ' deep regret be express that those who attend the meeting have not be arm with revolver instead of stone and that the platform have not be defend with maxim gun instead of comparatively innocuous wooden chair have modern weapon of precision be use the _ daily express _ would have be able to congratulate mankind on get rid of quite a considerable number of irishman the _ freeman 's journal _ and the _ daily independent _ be awkwardly situate they sympathy be entirely with mr o'rourke and they be exceedingly angry with miss goold for interfere with the collection of fund for the parliamentary party at the same time they feel a difficulty in denounce she not for want of suitable language -- the irish nationalist press have a superb command of word which a self-respecting dictionary would hesitate to recognize -- but because they feel that push of the horn of the dilemma on which o'roun ` y-had be impale and they be oblige to sand they denunciation between layer of stoutest pro-boer sentiment all four papers contain report of the proceedings which be practically identical up to a certain point it be about the commencement of the actual bloodshed that they differ the _ irish time _ reporter believe that mr shea have begin the fray by striking augusta goold behind the ear with he clenched fist the _ daily express _ man claim to have overhear mr o'rourke urge he friend to brain a member of the audience with a chair the _ freeman 's journal _ hold that augusta goold 's supporter have come into the hall supply with huge stone which at a give signal they have fling at the inoffensive member of parliament who occupy the platform add as a corroborative detail that the lady who accompany augusta goold have twice kick the prostrate mr shea in the stomach the _ daily independent _ advance the ingenious theory that the contest have be precipitate by a malevolent student of trinity college who have fling a apple of discord -- on this occasion a jagged paving-stone of unusual size -- into the midst of a group of lady and gentleman who be peacefully discuss a slight difference of opinion among themselves beyond this point none of the papers give any account of the proceedings all four reporter have recognize that not be retain as war correspondent they be not call upon to risk they life on the battlefield the account all close with the information that the wound have be carry to jervi street hospital and be under treatment suitable to they injury hyacinth have suffer a slight concussion of the brain and a flesh wound other sufferer be in the same ward mr shea himself occupy a bed so that hyacinth have the satisfaction of see he stretch out a melancholy figure with a bandage conceal most of he red hair after the surgeon have finish he round for the morning a police official visit the sufferer and make a careful note of they name and address he inquire in a perfunctory manner whether any of they wish to swear a information no one except mr shea be sufficiently satisfy with he own share of the meeting to wish for more fame than be unavoidable as no further use be ever make of mr shea 's narrative it may be presume that the authority regard it as want in accuracy no blame however ought to be attach to the author for any petty deviation from the truth of which he may have be guilty no man 's mind be perfectly clear on the morning after he have be strike on the head with a stone and perhaps afterwards kick twice in the stomach by a lady journalist besides all member of parliament be in virtue of they office ` honorable gentleman ' a excited and sympathetic nurse provide hyacinth with copy of the four morning papers which he read with interest and a good deal of amusement only the account in the _ daily independent _ cause he any uneasiness no doubt as he fully recognize the suggestion about the trinity student be nothing but a wild guess on the part of the reporter it be highly unlikely that anyone would seriously consider a theory so intrinsically improbable still if the faintest suspicion of the part he have play reach the ear of the college authority he feel that he career as a divinity student be likely to be a extremely brief one he chief fear be that a prolonged absence from college would give rise to inquiry and that he bandage would excite suspicion when he reappear fortunately the house surgeon decide that he be sufficiently recover to be allow to leave the hospital early in the afternoon the boot which have put a end to he share in the riot have raise its bruise under he hair so he be able to remove the bandage from he head as soon as he get into the street there still remain a long strip of plaster mean to keep a dress of iodoform in its place over the cut on he cheek which mr shea 's chair-leg have inflict this he could not get off and think it wiser to make he entry into college after nightfall he seek a refuge in mary o'dwyer 's room he find the poetess lay on a sofa and clothe in a blue dressing-gown she stretch a hand of welcome to hyacinth and then before he have time to take it begin to laugh immoderately the laugh fit end in sob and then tear flow from she eye which she mop convulsively with a already damp pocket-handkerchief before she have recover sufficient self-possession to speak she sign to hyacinth to fetch a bottle of smelling-salt from the chimney-piece he hasten to obey and find himself kneel beside the sofa hold the bottle to she nose after a while she recover sufficiently to tell he that she have not sleep at all during the night and feel extremely unwell and quite unstrung in consequence another fit of immoderate and tearful laughter follow and hyacinth embarrassed and alarmed fetch a tumbler of soda-water from the syphon on the sideboard the lady refuse to swallow any and just as he have make up he mind to risk a external application recover again during the lucid interval which follow she inform he that he own conduct have be superb and heroic what seem to be a effort to celebrate he achievement in extemporary verse bring on another fit hyacinth determine to risk a appearance in the college square in broad daylight rather than continue he ministration while he be search for he hat miss o'dwyer become suddenly quite calm and begin to explain to he how immensely the cause of ireland 's independence have benefit by the demonstration in the rotunda hyacinth listen anxiously wait for the next explosion and experience very great relief when the door open and augusta goold walk in unlike mary o'dwyer she be entirely mistress of herself she cheek be not a shade paler than usual nor she hand at all less cool and firm she stretch herself after she usual fashion in the largest available chair and light a cigarette ` you look excited my dear mary ' she say -- ' a little overexcited perhaps have you have tea no perhaps you will be so kind as to ring the bell mr conneally ' mary o'dwyer repeat the information she have give hyacinth about she sleepless night and compliment augusta goold on she nerve ` as for poor little I ' she go on ` i be like a -- like a -- you remember the kind of thing do not you -- like a -- i be not sure if i know the name of the thing myself ' she relapse into a weak giggle and hyacinth stoop for the bottle of smelling-salt which have roll under the sofa augusta goold be much less sympathetic she fix she with a strong stare of amazement and disgust apparently this treatment be the right one for the giggle stop almost immediately ' i see you have get some sticking-plaster on you face mr conneally ' she say when mary o'dwyer have quiet down ` yes ' say hyacinth ` and a good-sized bump behind my ear ' ' i suppose this business will be very awkward for you in college will they turn you out ' ` i be sure they will if they find out that i throw that stone at shea ' ` you make a very good shot ' say augusta smile at the recollection ` but how on earth do you come to have a stone that size in the hall with you ' hyacinth tell the story of the man who have be fell by the chair and he murderous bequest ` that be the proper spirit ' say augusta ' i admire that man and he could not have pass he stone on to better hand than yours shea go down as if he have be shoot i be afraid of my life he would clutch at my skirt as he fall or squirm up against I after he be down but he lay quite still by the way mary i suppose you dress be ruin ' mary o'dwyer be quite subdue ` it be tear ' she say meekly enough ` have you another one ' ` of course i have i have three other besides some old one ' ` well then you would better go and put on one of they a old one will do it be disgust to see a woman slop about in a dressing-gown at this time of day i 'll have tea ready when you come back ' miss o'dwyer obey sulkily she wish very much that augusta goold have stop at home it would have be a great deal pleasanter to have go on practise hysteric with hyacinth as a sympathetic spectator when the door be shut augusta goold turn to hyacinth again ` that be the worst of woman ' -- apparently she do not consider herself as one of the sex -- ` they be all right at the time -lrb- nothing could have be better than mary 's behavior at the meeting -rrb- but they collapse afterwards in such idiotic way but i want to talk to you about yourself i owe you a good turn for what you do last night only for you i think shea would have dare to touch I and then very likely i should have kill he and there might have be trouble afterwards ' she speak quite calmly but hyacinth have very little doubt that she mean exactly what she say ` grealy of course be useless one might have expect he to give utterance to a ancient tribal war-cry but he do not even do that tim halloran get frighten when the row begin i notice he dodge about behind mary and I and i mean to let he know what i think about he it be you i have to thank and i will not forget it if you get into trouble over this business in college come to I and i will see you straight in fact if you like to give up the divinity student business at once i dare say i can put you in the way of earn a honester livelihood ' hyacinth be gratify at the way augusta goold speak to he since the evening on which he have give he opinion about the morality of desertion and murder he have be conscious of a coolness in she manner now he have apparently reinstate himself in she good grace praise even for a act he be secretly ashamed of and gratitude though he by no means recognize that he deserve it be pleasant to he he promise to remember the offer of help but decline for the present to commit he future to the keep of so bloodthirsty a patroness curiously enough hyacinth 's reception in college be a great deal more cordial after the rotunda meeting than it have ever be before for a while the battle which have be fight at they door supersede the remoter south african warfare as a topic of conversation among the student they sympathy be with augusta goold even member of the divinity class suffer themselves to be lure from they habitual worship of respectability so far as to express admiration for the dramatic picturesqueness of the part she play it be true that the lady herself be call by name universally resent by woman and that the broadest slander be circulate about she character still a halo of glory hang round she it be feel that she have do a surprisingly courageous thing when she face mr o'rourke on he own platform also she have behave with a certain dignity neither throw chair nor stone at she opponent then she be a undeniably beautiful woman a fact which make its inevitable appeal to the young man the mere expression of sympathy with this flamboyant and scandal-smeared heroine bring with it a delightful flavor of gay and worldly vice it be pretty well know that hyacinth be a friend of miss goold 's and it be rumor that he have earn he piece of sticking-plaster in she defense no one know exactly what he have do or how much he have suffer but a great many man be anxious to know very much to he own surprise he receive a number of visitor in he room man who have be the foremost of he tormentor come ostensibly to inquire for he health in reality to glean detail of the fight at the rotunda certain medical student of the kind which glory in any kind of row openly congratulate he on he luck in be present on such a occasion man who claim to be fast and try to impress they acquaintance with the belief that they indulge habitually in wild scene of revelry court hyacinth and boast afterwards of they second-hand acquaintance with miss goold it become the fashion to be see arm-in-arm with he in the quadrangle and to inquire from he in public for ` finolum ' this new popularity by no means pleased hyacinth he be not at all proud of he share in the rotunda meeting and live in daily dread of be recognize as the assailant of mr shea he know too that he be make no way with the better class of student the man whose face he like be more than ever shy of make he acquaintance the sub-lecturer and minor professor in the divinity school be coldly contemptuous in they manner and it seem to he that even dr henry be less friendly he become desperately anxious to get out of a position which he find more intolerable than the original isolation he apply himself with extreme diligence to he study even affect a interest unnatural for the most pious in the exposition give by learn doctor of the thirty-nine article at lecture on church history he make note about the vagary of heretic so assiduously that the professor begin to hope that there exist one student at least who take a interest in the christological controversy of the sixth century he never venture back again to the Wednesday prayer-meeting but he perform many attendance beyond the require minimum at the college chapel morning after morning he drag himself from he bed and hurry across the dusky quadrangle to take he part in the mutilate matins with which the college authority see fit to usher in the day he even go to hear the sermon deliver on Friday afternoon homily so painful that the preacher themselves recognize a extraordinary merit in endure they and allow that submission of the ear to one of they be to be reckon as equal to two ordinary act of devotion it be to be hope that hyacinth derive some remote benefit from the discipline to which he subject himself for the immediate result be not satisfactory he seem no nearer win the respect of the more serious student and dr henry 's manner show no sign of soften into friendliness he surfeit of theology breed in he a dislike of the subject the solemn platitude which be pose as exposition of the creed affect he mind much as the expurgated life history of maiden aunt do the newly-emancipated school-girl the relentless closing in of argument upon a single previously settle doctrine wake in he a desire to break through at some point and breathe again in the open he begin to fear that he be become hopelessly irreligious he morning devotions in the foggy atmosphere of the chapel do not touch the capacity for enthusiasm within he the vague splendor of he father 's meditation have leave he outside indeed but sure that within there lay a great reality but now religion have come to seem a altogether narrower thing a fence off well-ordered garden in which useful vegetable might be cultivate but very little inspiring to the soul the unwelcome attention of the student whose friendship he do not desire and he increase dislike for the work he be expect to do lead he to spend more and more of he time with augusta goold and she friend he find in they society that note of enthusiasm which he miss in the religion of the college he respond warmly to they passionate devotion to the dream of a independent irish republic he feel less conscious of he want of religion in they company with the exception of augusta goold herself the member of the coterie be professedly roman catholic but this make little or no difference in they intercourse with he what he find in they ideal be a substitute for religion a space where he enthusiasm might extend itself he become as he realize he own position clearly very doubtful whether he ought to continue he college course it do not seem likely that he would in the end be able to take holy order and to remain in the divinity school without that intention be clearly foolish on the other hand he shrink from inflict what he know would be a painful disappointment on he father it happen that before the term end he connection with the divinity school be cut in a way that save he from the responsibility of form a decision he be a regular attendant at the lecture of dr spenser who have never from the first disguise he dislike and contempt for hyacinth this gentleman be one day explain to he class the difference between evidence which lead to a high degree of probability and a demonstration which produce absolute certainty the subject be a dry one and quite unsuited to dr spenser whose heart be set on maintain a reputation for caustic wit he cast about for a illustration which would at once make clear the distinction and enliven he lecture he eye light upon hyacinth upon whose cheek there still burn a long red scar dr spenser 's face brighten ` for instance gentleman ' he say ` if i should reason from the fact that we friend mr conneally affect the society of certain charming lady of doubtful reputation like miss goold to the conclusion that mr conneally be himself a nationalist i should only have arrive at a probable conclusion the degree of probability might be very high still i should have no right to regard my conclusion as absolutely certain ' the class titter delightedly dr spenser proceed without heed a deep flush on hyacinth 's face which might have warn a wiser man that a explosion be come ` if i should then proceed to reason thus : all nationalist be rebel and potential murderer -- mr conneally be a nationalist therefore mr conneally be a rebel and potential murderer -- i should assume the truth of my minor premise have arrive at a certainty ' the syllogism be greet with loud applause hyacinth start to he foot for a time he could only gasp for breath to utter a reply and dr spenser secure in the conviction of he own intellectual and social superiority to the son of a parson from connemara determine to pursue he prey ` do mr conneally ' he ask with a simper ` propose to impugn the accuracy of my induction or the logic of my deduction ' the simper and the number of beautiful long word which dr spenser have succeed in collect together into one sentence provoke a sustained clapping of hand and stamp of foot from the class hyacinth rapidly regain he self-possession and be surprise at he own coolness when he reply : ' i should say sir that a man who make a induction hold up a lady to ridicule be probably a cad and that the cad who make a deduction confusing patriotism with murder be certainly a fool ' a report of hyacinth 's speech be hand to dr henry with a suggestion that expulsion from the divinity school be the only suitable punishment hyacinth do not look forward with any pleasure to the interview to which he be summon he be agreeably surprise when he enter the professor 's room dr henry offer he a chair ' i hear ' he say -- he tone be severe but a barely perceptible gleam of humorous appreciation flash across he eye as he speak -- ` that you have be exceedingly insolent to dr spenser ' ' i do not know sir whether you hear the whole story but if you do you will surely recognize that dr spenser be gratuitously insulting to I ' ` quite so ' say dr henry ' i recognize that but the question be what be i to do with you now what would you do if you be in my place i should like to know you view of the best way out of the situation ' hyacinth be silent ` you see ' dr henry go on ` we can not have we divinity lecturer call fool and cad before they class i should be afraid myself to deliver a lecture in you presence if i think i be liable to that kind of interruption ' ' i think sir ' say hyacinth ` that the best thing will be for I to leave the divinity school ' ' i think so too but leave we divinity school need not mean that you give up the idea of take holy order i have a very high opinion of you ability conneally -- so high that i should not like the church to lose you service at the same time you be not at present the kind of man whom i could possibly recommend to any irish bishop you nationalist principle be a absolute bar to you work in the church of ireland ' ' i wonder sir how you can call we church the church of ireland and in the same breath say that there be no room for a nationalist in she do not the two thing contradict each other ' dr henry 's eye twinkle again there spread over he mouth a smile of tolerant amusement ` my dear boy i be not go to let you trap I into a discussion of that question theoretically i have no doubt you would make out a excellent case national church national spirit national politics -- irish church irish nation irish idea they all go excellently together do not they and yet the fact be as i state they a nationalist clergyman in the church of ireland would be just as impossible as a english nonconformist in the court of loui quatorze after all in this life one have get to steer one 's course among fact and they be sharp thing which knock hole in the man who disregard they now what i propose to you be this : put off you ordination for three year or so take up schoolmastaring i will undertake to get you a post in a english school you politics will not matter over there because no one will in the least understand what you mean work hard think hard read hard mix with the bigger world across the channel see england and realize what england be and what she empire mean do not be angry with I for say that long before the three year be over you 'll have come to see that what you call patriotism be nothing else than parochialism of a particularly narrow and uninstructed kind then come back here to I and i 'll arrange for you ordination you 'll do the best of good work when you have grow up a bit and i 'll see you a bishop before i die ' ' i shall always be grateful to you ' say hyacinth ' i shall never forget you kindness and the way you have treat I but i can not do what you ask ' ` oh i be not go to take no for a answer ' say dr henry ` go home to the west and think it over talk to you father about you future write to I if you like about you plan and remember my offer be open six month or a year hence you 'll be the same man then that you be now -- i mean in character i be not afraid of you turn out badly you may think wrong-headedly but i be sure you 'll not act disgracefully ' chapter vii the December afternoon be grow dark when the weary car-horse surmount the last hill on the road from clifden and break into a shambling trot down the long straight stretch into carrowkeel soon as the distance dwindle the light which twinkle here and there in the village become distinguishable this -- hyacinth recognize it -- be the great hanging lamp in the window of rafferty 's shop that a softer glow come from the forge of killeen the smith that and that fainter and more uncertain light be from fire see through the open upper section of cottage door he could almost tell whose the cabin be where they shine the scene inside rise to the imagination a man with ragged clothes and a half-empty pipe be squeeze into the stone nook beside the blaze turf the kettle hang from its hook swing steam beside he the woman of the house barefooted sluttish in tear crimson petticoat and gray bodice pin across she breast move the red cinder from the lid of the pot-oven and peer at the browning cake within baby toddle or crawl over the greasy floor the car rattle into the village street man whom he know stop it to speak to he child play the last of they game in the fading light pause to stare at he father moran return to he presbytery wave he hand and shout a greet he pass the last house of the village and could see the fishing-boat dim and naked-looking ride at they anchor in the bay out beyond they grim and terrible in the twilight lay the hulk where the ice for fish-packing be store the thick stump of she one remain mast make a blacker bar against the black sky the pier be desert but he could see the bulky stack of fish-box pile on it and hear the water lap against it along its utmost edge lay a belt of gray white where the wave break as they surge round it he pass the pier and there lay before he the long hill that lead home the church and the ruin school stand out clearly on the skyline below they less clearly see be the rectory and hyacinth note that the lamp in the kitchen be light then the door be open and he see plain against the light a man 's figure he father 's no doubt the old man be watch and listen perhaps the sound of the wheel reach he through the evening air for in a few minute he come out and walk down the drive hyacinth see he fumble with the fastening of the rickety gate and at last open it slowly and with difficulty the car reach a gap in the loose stone wall a familiar gap for across it lay a short cut up a steeper part of the hill which the road go round hyacinth jump down and run up the path in another minute the greet of father and son be accomplish and the two be walk hand-in-hand towards the house hyacinth notice that he father tremble and that he foot stumble uncertainly among the loose stone and stiff weed when they enter the light room he see that he father seem older -- many year older -- than when he have say good-bye to he two month before he skin be very transparent he lip be tremulous he eye after the first long look at he son shift feebly to the fire the table and the floor ` my dear son ' he say ' i thank god that i have get you safe home again indeed it be good to see you again hyacinth for it have be very lonely while you be away i have not be able to do very much lately or to go out to the seashore as i use to perhaps it be only that i have not care to but i have try hard to get everything ready for you come ' he look round the room with evident pride as he speak hyacinth follow he gaze and it be with a sense of deep shame that he find himself notice the squalor of he home the table be stain and the book which litter half of it be thick with dust and grease-spot the earthen floor be damp and pit here and there so that the chair stand perilously among its inequality the fine white powder of turf ash lay thick upon the dresser the whitewash above the fireplace be blacken by the track of the smoke that have blow out of the chimney and climb up to the still blacker rafter of the roof hyacinth remember how he and not he father have be accustom to clean the room and wash the cup and plate he wonder how such matter have be manage in he absence and a great sense of compassion fill he eye with tear as he think of the painful struggle which the detail of life must have bring upon he father he note the evident preparation for he come there be two egg lie in a saucer ready to be boil a fresh loaf -- and this be not the day they get they bread -- and a small tin of cocoa beside he cup the hearth be pile with glowing turf and the iron tripod with a saucepan on it stand surround with red coal some sense of what hyacinth be feel pass into he father 's mind ` be not it all right my son i try to make it very nice for you i want to get maggie cassidy up from the village for the day but she baby have the chin-cough and she could not come ' he take hyacinth 's hand and hold it while he speak ` perhaps it look poor to you ' he go on ` after you college room and the house you friend live in but it be you own home son be not it ' hyacinth make a gulp at the emotion which have bring he near to tear ` it be splendid father -- simply splendid and now i be go to boil those two egg and make the cocoa and we 'll have a feast hallo you have get some jam -- jam and butter and egg and this be the month of December when there be hardly a hen lay or a cow milking in the whole parish ' he hold up the jam-pot as he speak it be wrap in dingy red paper and have a mouldy damp stain on one side hyacinth recognize the mark and remember that he have see the identical pot on the upper shelf of rafferty 's shop for year its label bear a inscription only vaguely prophetic of the contents -- ` irish household jam ' ` that be right father you be support home manufacture i declare i would not have taste it if it have come from england you see i be a greater patriot than ever ' old mr gonneally smile in a feeble wavering way he seem scarcely to understand what be be say to he but he find a quiet pleasure in the sound of he son 's voice he settle himself in a chair by the fireside and watch contentedly while hyacinth put the egg into the saucepan hang the kettle on its hook and cut slice of bread then the meal be eat hyacinth after he long drive find a relish even in the household jam he ply he father with question and hear what the old man know of the gossip of the village -- how thady durkan have break he arm and talk of give up the fishing how the police from letter-frack have find or say they find a whisky-still behind the old castle how a gaelic league organizer have come round persuade the people to sing and dance at the galway féis after supper hyacinth nerve himself to tell the story of he term in college and he determination to leave the divinity school more than once he make a effort to begin but the old man who brighten a little during they meal relapse again into dreaminess and do not seem to be listen to he they pull they chair near to the fire and mr conneally sit hold he son 's hand fast sometimes he stroke or pat it gently but otherwise he seem scarcely to recognize that he be not alone he eye be fix on the fire but they stare strangely as if they see something afar off something not in the room at all there be no response in they when hyacinth speak and no intelligence from time to time he lip move slightly as if they be form word but he say nothing after awhile hyacinth give up the attempt to tell he story and sit silent for so long that in the end he be startle when he father speak ` hyacinth my son i have somewhat to say unto you ' before hyacinth could reply to he he continue : ` and the young man answer and say unto he say on and the old man lift up he voice and say unto he son he that have ear to hear let he hear ' he speak as if he be read out of a book some narrative from the bible hyacinth realize suddenly that the communication which be to be make to he have be rehearse by he father alone again and again that statement question and reply would follow each other in due sequence from the same lip he feel that he father be still rehearse and have forget the real presence of he son he grasp the hand that hold he and shake it say sharply : ` father father i be here do not you know I ' ` yes yes my son surely i know you there be something i want to tell you i have want to tell it to you for many day i be glad that you be here now to listen to it ' he pause and hyacinth fear that he would relapse again into dreamy insensibility but he do not ' i think ' he say ` that i should like to pray before i speak to you ' he kneel down as hyacinth have see he kneel a thousand time before face the eastward-looking window now a black uncurtained square in the whitewashed wall what he say be almost unintelligible there be no petition nor even any sequence of idea which could be trace he pour forth a series of ejaculation expressive of intense and rapturous delight very strange to listen to in such a place and from a old man 's lip then the language he speak change from english into gaelic and there come a kind of hymn of adoration he sentence follow each other in metrical balance like the latin of the old liturgy and suit themselves naturally to a subdue melody half chant half cry like the mourning of the keener round a grave at last rise from he knee he speak and he voice become wholly unemotional devoid of fervor or excitement he tell he story as a man might relate some quite commonplace incident of daily life ` one evening i be sit here by the fire just as i always sit i remember that the lamp be not light and that the fire be low so that there be not much light in the room it come into my mind that it be just out of such gloom that the lord call samuel samuel and i wish that i be like samuel so innocent that i could hear the voice of the lord i do not remember what i thought of after that perhaps for a time i do not think at all then i feel that there be arm about my neck but not like you arm hyacinth when you be a child and clung to I these be arm which hold I lovingly strongly protectingly like -- do you remember hyacinth -- he right hand be under my head he left hand doth embrace I i sit quite still and do not move or speak or even breathe lest he should go away from I then after a long time -- i know afterwards that the time be long though then it seem only a minute for the joy that i have in it -- he tell I -- i do not mean that i hear a voice or any word i do not hear i _ feel _ he tell I -- the thing that be to be the last great fight the armageddon draweth very near all that be good be on one side in the fight and the captain over all what be bad be on the other side -- all kind of tyranny and greed and lust i do not hear these word but i feel the thing only without any fear for round I be the everlasting arm and the battlefield be ireland we dear ireland which we love all these century since the great saint die he have keep ireland to be he battlefield i understand then how we people have be save from riches and from power and from the opportunity of lust that we soil out of all the world might be fit for the foot of the great captain for the march of he horseman and he chariot not even when i know all this do i desire to share in the conflict i be old and feeble but that be not the reason why there be no desire on I for strength be in he power to give to whom he will i do not desire it because i be quite happy be safe with he ' for a long time after he cease speak there be silence for hyacinth have no comment to offer at last the old man speak again ` that be all i have no other word of revelation but i have wonder since how man be to be disentangle from they party and they church and they nation and gather simply into good and bad will all man who be good just know the captain when they see he and range themselves with he but why should we think about such thing as these doubtless he can order they but you hyacinth -- will you be sure to know the good side from the bad the captain from the enemy ' for a long time after he have go to bed hyacinth lay awake haunt by he father 's prophecy of a armageddon there be that in he nature which respond eagerly to such a call to battle in the presence of enthusiasm like he father 's or like augusta goold 's hyacinth catch fire he mind flame with the idea of a independent ireland resplendent with she ancient glory he embrace no less eagerly the thought of he father 's battle and he own part in it grope for point of contact between the two enthusiasm he catch at the conception of the roman church as the antichrist and she power in ireland as the point round which the fight must rage then with a sudden flash he see not rome but the british empire as the embodiment of the power of darkness he have learn to think of it as a force greedy materialistic tyrannous grossly hypocritical what more be require to satisfy the conception of evil that he seek for he remember all that he have ever hear from augusta goold and she friend about the shameless trickery of english statesman about the insatiable greed of the merchant about the degraded sensuality of the worker he recall the blatant boastfulness with which english demagogue claim to be the sole possessor of enlighten conscience and the tale of native race exploit gin-poisoned and annihilate by pioneer of civilization advance with bible in they hand but with all he capacity for enthusiasm there be a strain of weakness in hyacinth more than once after the glory of a independent ireland have be preach to he he have find himself grow suddenly cold and dejected smitten by a east wind of common-sense at the time when he first recognize the loftiness of he father 's religion he have revolt against be call upon to adopt so fantastic a creed so now when he mind grow weary with the endeavor to set a armageddon in array he begin to wish for a life of peaceful monotony a place to be quiet in where no high call or imperious demand would come to threaten he he cease to toss to and fro and gradually sink into a half-conscious sleep it seem to he at the time that he be still awake hold back from slumber by the great stillness of the country that silence which disturb ear long accustom to the continuous roar of town suddenly he start into perfect wakefulness and feel that he be in possession of all he faculty the room where he lay be quite dark but he strain he eye to see something in it he listen intently although no sound whatever meet he ear a great overmastering fear lay hold on he he try to reason with himself insist that there be nothing and could be nothing to be afraid of still the fear remain he lip grow stiff and painfully hot and when he try to moisten they he tongue be dry and move across they raspingly he struggle with the terror that paralyze he and by a great effort raise he hand to he forehead it be damp and cold and the hair above it be damp he have no way of know how much of the night have pass or even how long he lay rigid unable to breathe without a kind of pain but suddenly as it have come the terror leave he leave he without any effort on he part or any reason that he recognize then the window of he room shake and he hear outside the low moan of the rise wind some heavy drop of rain strike audibly on the roof and the first gust of the storm carry to he ear the sound of wave beat on the rock he sens strain no more he eye close and he sink quietly into a long dreamless sleep it be late when he wake so late that the winter sky be fully light the wind whose first gust have lull he to sleep have rise to a gale and the rain mix with salt spray beat fiercely against he window and on the roof he listen expect to hear he father move in the room below but within the house there be no sound he rise vaguely anxious and without wait to dress go into the kitchen everything lay untouched just as he have leave it the night before the lamp and the remnant of the meal be on the table the two chair stand side by side before the hearth where the fire which he have cover up smoulder feebly he turn and go to he father 's room he could not have explain how it be but when he open the door he be not surprise to see the old man lie quite still dead upon the bed he face be turn upward and on it be that strange look of emotionless peace which rest very often on the face of the dead it seem to hyacinth quite natural that the soul as it depart into unknown beatitude should have print this for the last expression on the earthly habitation which it leave behind he neither wonder nor at first sorrowed very much to see he father dead he sight be undimmed and he hand steady when he close the eye and compose the limb of the body on the bed afterwards it seem strange to he that he should have dress quietly arrange the furniture in the kitchen and blow the fire into a blaze before he go down into the village to tell he news and seek for help they bury æneas conneally beside he wife in the wind-swept churchyard the fisherman carry he coffin into the church and out again to the grave father moran himself stand by barehead while the clergyman from clifden read the prayer and sprinkle the coffin-lid with the clay which symbolize the return of earth to earth and dust to dust in the presence of death and with the recollection of the simple goodness of the man who be go priest and people alike forget for a hour the endless strife between he creed and theirs chapter viii in connaught the upper middle class clergy doctor lawyer police officer bank official and so forth be all stranger in the land each of they look forward to a promotion which will enable he to move to some more congenial part of ireland a dublin suburb be the ideal residence fail that the next best thing be a country town within easy reach of the metropolis most of they sooner or later achieve a promotion but some of they be so unfortunate as to die in they exile in either case they furniture and effect be auction no one ever remove he goods from con-naught because the cost of get thing to any other part of ireland be exorbitant and also because table and chair fetch very high price at auction thus it happen that a certain historic interest attach to the furniture of most middle-class house west of the shannon the dispensary doctor dine off a table which once grace the parlor of a parish priest the inspector of police boast of the price he pay for he easy-chair recently upholster at the auction of a depart bank manager the same mahogany frame have once support the portly person of a old-time protestant archdeacon it be to be suppose that the furniture originally import -- no one know how -- into connaught must have be of superlative quality article whose pedigree so to speak can be trace for nearly a hundred year be still in daily use unimpaired by change of scene and ownership a auction of any importance be a public holiday clergy doctor lawyer and police officer gather to the scene not unlike those beast of prey of whom we read that they readily devour the remains of a fall member of they own pack the native also collect together -- publican and shopkeeper in search of bargain in china glass and house-linen farmer bent on purchase such outdoor property as wheelbarrow scythe or harness when hyacinth to use the local expression ` call a auction ' shortly after he father 's death he be favor with quite the usual crowd of would-be buyer almost everyone with either money or credit within a radius of twenty mile come into carrowkeel for the occasion the preside auctioneer have do he duty beforehand by advertise old mr conneally 's mouldy furniture as ` magnificently upholstered suite ' and he battered edition of the classic as ' a valuable library of handsomely bind book ' it be not likely that anyone be really deceive by these announcement or expect to find in the little rectory anything sumptuous or splendid the people assemble mainly because they be exceedingly curious to see the inside of a house whose door have never be open to they during the lifetime of the owner it be always possible besides that though the ` magnificently upholstered suite ` exist only in the auctioneer 's imagination treasure of silver spoon or candlestick plate upon copper might be discover among the effect of a man who live as queer a life as mr conneally when man and woman put themselves to a great deal of inconvenience to attend a auction they do not like to return empty-handed a day be more obviously waste if one go home with nothing to show than if one bring a table or a bedstead purchase at twice its proper value thus the bidding at hyacinth 's auction be brisk and the price such as give sincere satisfaction to the auctioneer everything be sell except ` the valuable library ' it be in vain that the auctioneer make personal appeal to father moran and the rector of clifden as presumably the two most learn gentleman present neither of they want the venerable classic in fact neither of they could have read a line of the crooked greek type or construe a page of the latin author even the irish book in spite of the gaelic revival find no purchaser when all be over hyacinth wheel they away in barrowful wonder greatly what he be to do with they indeed the disposal of he library be not the chief of he perplexity he wonder also what he be to do with himself when the auctioneer send in he cheque and the london committee of the mission have pay over certain arrears of salary hyacinth find himself the possessor of nearly two hundred pound it seem to he quite a large fortune amply sufficient to start life with if only some suitable way of employ brain energy and money would suggest itself in order to consider the important topic at he leisure he hire the only lodging in carrowkeel -- the apartment -lrb- it be both bed and sit room -rrb- over mr rafferty 's public-house the furniture have suffer during the tenancy of a series of congested district board official a engineer who go to sleep in the evening over the fire have burn a round hole in the hearthrug a instructor in fish-curing a hilarious young man have crack the mirror over the mantelpiece and break many ornament include the fellow of the large china dog which now mourn its mate on the sideboard other gentleman have be responsible for dislocate the leg of two chair and a disorganization of the handle which make it impossible to shut the door from the inside the chief glory of the apartment however still remain -- a handsomely-framed document sign by earl spencer then lord lieutenant order the arrest of the present mr rafferty 's father as a person dangerous to the commonwealth the first thing which bring hyacinth 's meditation to a definite point be a letter he receive from dr henry ' i do not know ' the professor write ` and of course i do not wish to inquire how you be situate financially but if as i suppose be likely you be oblige in the near future to earn you living i may perhaps be of some help to youyou have take you ba degree and be so far qualify either to accept a post as a schoolmaster in a english preparatory school or to seek ordination from some bishop as you be probably aware none of we irish bishop will accept a man who have not complete he divinity course several english bishop however especially in the northern province be willing to ordain man who have nothing more than a university degree always suppose that they pass the require examination i shall be quite willing to give you a letter of recommendation to one of these bishop and i have no doubt that a curacy could be find for you in one of the northern manufacturing town where you would have a ample sphere for useful work ' the letter go on to urge the advisability of hyacinth 's suppress disguise or modify he political opinion which state nakedly be likely to beget a certain prejudice in the well-balanced episcopal mind and in any case would be quite out of place among the operative of yorkshire or lancashire hyacinth recognize and appreciate dr henry 's kindness he even try to bring himself to consider the offer seriously and carefully but it be no use he could not conceive himself as likely to be either useful or happy amid the hustle commercialism of the manchester street or the staid propriety of a anglican vicarage after he have spend about a week in he new lodging father moran call on he the priest sit beside the fire for more than a hour chat in a desultory manner he drink tea and smoke and it be not until he rise to go that the real object of he visit appear ' i do not know what you be think of do mr conneally and maybe i have no right to ask ' ' i would not have the least objection to tell you ' say hyacinth ` if i know myself but i have not my mind make up ' the priest put down he hat again and settle himself with he back to the fire and he hand in he pocket hyacinth sit down and during the pause which follow contemplate the wonderful number and variety of the stain on the black waistcoat in front of he ` then you have give up the idea of finish you divinity course ' say the priest ` i be not blame you in the least there be man that study suit and there be man that it do not i never be much of a one for book myself ' he sigh heavily perhaps at the recollection of he own struggle with the mystery of theology in he maynooth student day then he walk over and close the door return draw a chair close to hyacinth and speak in the tone of a man who impart a important secret ` do you hear that thady durkan 's give up the fishing since he break he arm he declare he 'll never step aboard the boat again you know the st bridget she be not one of the biggest boat but she be a very lucky one she make over five hundred pound last year besides the share the board take she be build at baltimore and the board spend over two hundred pound on she net and gear and all there be only one year more of instalment to pay off the price of she and thady have the rest of the man buy out there be nobody own a stick or a net or a sail of she except himself bar of course what be due to the board ' hyacinth be sufficiently acquaint with the system on which the congested district board provide the connaught fisherman with boat and net to understand father moran 's rather involve statement of durkan 's financial position he do not yet grasp why all this information should have be convey to he in such a solemn and mysterious tone ` you might have the _ st bridget _ ' say the priest ` for one hundred and fifty pound down ' he pause to let the full glory of the situation lay hold upon hyacinth perhaps he expect a outburst of delight and surprise but none come ` mind you ' he say ` there be other look for she the man that work with thady be think of make he a offer and i dare say the board would be glad enough to have the boat own among they but i can put in a word myself both with thady and the inspector faith the time be change since i be a young man i can remember when a priest be no more think of than a barefooted gossure out of a bog and now there be not a spalpeen of a government inspector but lift he hat to I in the street oh a note from I will go a good way with the board and you 'll not miss the chance for want of my good word -- i promise you that ' ` thank you ' say hyacinth ` mind you there be a good thing to be make out of she but sure you know that as well as i do myself and maybe better what do you say now ' ` i 'll think it over ' say hyacinth ` and whatever come of it i 'll be greatly oblige to you ' ` well do not be delay too long and look you here ' -- he voice sink almost to a whisper -- ` do not be talk about what i have say to you people be queer and if father joyce down in clifden come to hear that i be work for a protestant he would be sure to go talk to the archbishop and i would never get to the end of the fuss that would be make ' ` indeed it be very good of you especially consider who i be -- i mean my father be a convert and -- ' ` say no more ' say the priest -- ` say no more you father be a good man catholic or protestant i be not one of these bitter kind of priest mr con-neally i can be a good catholic without hate my neighbor i do not hold with all this bullyragging in newspaper about sourface and save maybe that be the reason that i be stick down here at the other end of nowhere all my life and never get promotion or praise but what do i care as long as they let I alone to do my work for the people i be not afraid to say it to you mr conneally for you will not want to get I into trouble but it be my belief that there be many of we priest would rather have grand church than contented people they be fonder of rome than they be of ireland ' ` really father moran ' say hyacinth smile ` if you go on like this i shall expect to hear of you turn protestant ' ` god forbid mr conneally i wish you well i wish you to be here among we and to be prosperous but the dearest wish of my heart for you be that i might see you back in the catholic church believe the creed of you forefather ' the priest 's suggestion attract hyacinth a great deal more than dr henry 's he like the sea and the fishing and he love the simple people among whom he have be bring up he experience in dublin have not encouraged he to be ambitious life in the great world -- it be thus that he think of the bickering of the dublin nationalist and the schoolboy enthusiasm of college student -- be not a very simple thing there be a complexity and a confusion in affair which make it difficult to hold to any cause devotedly it seem to he look back that miss goold 's ideal -- and she have ideal as he know -- be somehow vulgarize in they contact with the actual he have see something of the joy she find in she conflict with o'rourke and it do not seem to he to be pure or ennobling at one time he be on the verge of decide to do what the priest wish walk day by day along the shore or through the field he come to think that life might very well be spend without ambitious or extended hope in quiet toil and unexciting pleasure what hold he back be the recollection which never cease to haunt he of he father 's prophecy the thought of the great fight declare to be imminent stir in he a emotion so strong that the peace and monotony he half desire become impossible he never make it clear to himself that he either believe or disbelieve the prediction he certainly do not expect to see a actual gathering of armed man or that ireland be to be the scene of a battle like those in south africa but there be in he a conviction that ireland be awaken out of a long sleep be stretch she limb in preparation for activity he feel the quiver of a national strenuousness which be already shake loose the knot of the old binding-rope of prejudice and cowardice it seem to he that bone be come to dry bone and that sooner or later -- very soon it be likely -- one would breathe on these and they would live that contest should come out of such a renaissance be inevitable but what contest against whom be the new ireland to fight and who be truly on she side here be the puzzle insoluble but insistent it would not let he rest recur to he mind with each fresh recollection of he father 's prophecy it be while he be weary himself with this perplexity that he get a letter from augusta goold it be characteristic of she that she have write no word of sympathy when she hear of he father 's death and now when a letter do come it contain no allusion to hyacinth 's affair she tell he with evident delight that she have enlist no less than ten recruit for the boer army she have collect sufficient money to equip they and pay they travel expense it be arrange that they be to proceed to paris and there join a body of volunteer organize by a french officer a certain pierre de villeneuve about whom miss goold be enthusiastic she be in communication with a irishman who seem likely to be a suitable captain for she little band and she want hyacinth back in dublin to help she ` you know ' she write ` the people i have round I here poor old grealy be quite impracticable though he mean well he talk about nothing but the fianna and finn mccool and can not see that my fellow must have ride lesson and must be get somehow to understand the mechanism of a rifle tim halloran have be in a sulk ever since i tell he what i thought of he conduct at the rotunda he never come near I and mary o'dwyer tell I the other day that he call my volunteer a pack of blackguard i dare say it be perfectly true but they be a finer kind of blackguard than the sodden loafer the english recruit for they miserable army ' she go on to describe the series of boer victory which have come one after another just at christmas-time she be confident that the cause of freedom and nationality would ultimately triumph and she foresee the intervention of some continental power a great blow would be strike at the already totter british empire and then -- the freedom of ireland hyacinth feel strangely excite as he read she news the letter seem the first clear note of the trumpet summon he to he father 's armageddon politics and squabbling at home might be inglorious and degrading but the actual war which be be wage in south africa the struggle of a people for existence and liberty could be nothing but noble he see quite clearly what he own next step be to be and there be no temptation to hesitate about it he would place he money at miss goold 's disposal and go himself with she ten volunteer to join the brigade of the heroic de villeneuve chapter ix the prospect of join augusta goold 's band of volunteer and go to south africa to fight afford hyacinth great satisfaction for two day he live in a atmosphere of day-dream and delightful anticipation he have no knowledge whatever of the actual condition of modern warfare he understand vaguely that he would be call upon to endure great hardship he like to think of these picture himself bravely cheerful through long period of hunger heat or cold he have vision of night watch of sudden alarm of heart-stirring skirmish of scout work and stealthy approach to the enemy 's line he think out the detail of critical interview with commanding officer in which he with some choose comrade volunteer for incredibly dangerous enterprise he conceive of himself as wounded though not fatally and carry to the rear out of some bullet-swept firing-line he be just twenty-three year of age adventure have its fascination and the world be still a place full of splendid possibility at the end of he two day of dream he return flush with he great purpose to the reality of life he go to father moran to tell he that he would not buy durkan 's boat he laugh to himself at the thought of do such a thing be he to spend he life fishing mackerel round the rocky island of connemara when he might be fight like one of the ancient hero give he strength perhaps he life for a great cause the priest meet he at the presbytery door ` come in mr conneally -- come in and sit down i be expect you these two day what be you do at all walk away there along the rock by yourself the people be begin to say that you be get to be like you poor father and that nobody would ever get any good out of you but i know you would come back to I here i hope now it be to tell I that you 'll buy the boat you have come ' they enter the house and the priest open the door of the little sitting-room hyacinth know it well there be the dark mahogany table with the mark burn into it where hot dish be set down the shabby arm-chair the worn cocoanut-matting on the floor the dozen or so book in the hang shelf the tawdry sacred picture round the wall he have know it all and it all seem unchanged since he be a child ` sit you down -- sit you down ' say the priest ` and now about the boat ' ` i be not go in for she ' say hyacinth ` i be as thankful to you for suggest it as if i do buy she i hope you 'll understand that but i be not go to buy she ' he find it difficult to speak of he new plan to father moran ` do you tell I that now i be sorry for it and why would not you buy she what be there to hinder you ' hyacinth hesitate ` well now ' say the priest ' i can guess i think the auction turn out well for you but i never hear for certain and maybe you have not get the money for the boat whisht now my son and let I speak i be think the thing might be manage ' ` but father moran ------ ' ` ah now will you be quiet when i bid you i have not the money myself never a penny have i be able to save all my life with the call there be on I in a parish like this sure you know yourself how it be there be one will have a cow that have die on he and another will be want a lock of potato for seed in the springtime and if it be not that it 'll be something else and who would the creature go to in they trouble but the old priest that christen and marry the most of they but indeed thanks be to god thing be improve the fishing bring in a lot of money to the man and there be a better breed of cattle in the country now and the pig fetch a good price since we have the railway to clifden and maybe the last few year i might have save a little but i do not indeed i do not know where it be the money go at all but someway it be never at rest in my breeches pocket till it be up and off somewhere god forgive we it be more careful we ought to be ' ` but father moran i do not -- ' ` arrah then will you cease you talk for one minute and let I get a word in edgeway for you own good what be i say oh i be just after tell you i have not get the money to help you but maybe i might manage to get it the man in the bank in clifden know I i borrow a few pound off he two year ago when the cassidy ' house and three more beside it get blow away in the big wind father joyce put he name on the back of the bill along with my own and trouble enough i have to get he to do it for he say i ought to put a appeal in the newspaper and i would get the money give to I but i never be one to go beg round the country i say i would rather borrow the money and pay it back like a decent man and so i do every penny of it and i think the bank will trust I now with just you name and mine more especially as it be to buy a boat we want the money what do you say to that now ' he look at hyacinth triumphantly ` father moran you be too good to I -- you be too good altogether what do ever i do to deserve such kindness from you but you be all wrong i have get plenty of money ' ` and why in the name of all that be holy do not you tell I so at once and not keep I stand here twist my brain into hard knot with think out way of get what you do not want if you have get the money you 'll buy the boat what better could you do with it ' ` but i do not want to buy the boat i do not want to live here always i be go away out into the world i want to see thing and do thing ' ` out into the world will you listen to the boy be it america you be think of ah now there be enough go out and leave we lonely here be not the best of all the boy and girl go to work for the stranger in the strange land and why would you be go after they ' ` i be not go to america i be go to south africa i be go to join some young irishman to fight for the boer and for freedom ' ` you be go out to fight -- to fight for the boer what be it that be in you head at all hyacinth con-neally tell I now ' again hyacinth hesitate be it possible to give utterance to the thought and hope which fill he mind could he tell anyone about the furious fancy of the last few day or of that weird vision of he father 's which lay at the back of what he feel and dream could he even speak of the enthusiasm which move he to devote himself to the cause of freedom and a threaten nationality in the presence of a man of the world the very effort to express himself would have act as some corrosive acid and stain with patch of absurdity the whole fabric of he dream he look at father moran and see the priest 's eye light with sympathy he know that he have a listener who would not scoff who might perhaps even understand he begin to speak slowly and haltingly at first then more rapidly at last he pour out with breathless incoherent speed the strange story of the armageddon vision the hope that be in he the fierce enthusiasm the passionate love for ireland which burn in he soul he be not conscious of the gaping inconsequence of he train of emotion he do not recognize how ridiculous it be to connect the boer war with the apocalyptic battle of the saint or the utter impossibility of get either one or the other into any sort of relation with the exist condition of ireland a casual observer might have suppose that hyacinth have make a mistake in tell he story to father moran a smile threatening actual laughter hover visibly round the priest 's mouth he eye have a shrewd search expression difficult to interpret still he listen to the rhapsody without interrupt it till hyacinth stop abruptly smite with sudden self-consciousness terrify of imminent ridicule nor be the priest 's first word reassure ' i would not say now hyacinth conneally but there might be the makings of a fine man in you yet ' ' i might have know ' say hyacinth angrily ` that you would laugh at I i be a fool to tell you at all but i be in earnest about what i be go to do whatever you may think about the rest there be no laughing at that ' ` well you be just wrong then for i be not laugh nor mean to laugh at all god forbid that i should laugh at you and i mean it when i say that there be the makings of a fine man in you laugh at you it be little you know I listen now till i tell you something but do not you be repeat it this must be between you and I and go no further i be very much of you way of think myself once ' hyacinth gaze at he in astonishment the thought of father moran elderly rotund kindly of father moran with sugar-stick in he pocket for the school-child and a quaint jest on he lip for they mother of father moran in he ruffle silk hat and shabby black coat and baggy trousers -- of this father moran mount and armed face the british infantry in south africa be wholly grotesque he laugh aloud ` it be yourself that have the bad manners to be laugh now ' say the priest ` but small blame to you if it be out to the boer i be think of go the gray goose out there on the road might laugh -- and she be the solemnest mortal i know -- at the notion of I charge along with maybe a pike in my hand and the few gray hair that be leave on the side of my head blow about in the breeze i would make as i go prance to and fro but that be not what i mean when i say that once upon a time i be something of you way of thinking and sure enough i be but it be a long time ago now ' he sigh and for a minute or two he say no more hyacinth begin to wonder what he mean and whether the promise confidence would be forthcoming at all then the priest go on : ` when i be a young man -- and it be hard for you to think it but i be a fine young man never a better lad at the hurl than i be I that be a doddering old soggarth now -- when i be a boy as i be tell you there be a deal of go to and fro in the country and meeting at night and drilling too and plenty of talk of a rise -- no less little good come of it that ever i saw but i be not blame the man that be in it they be good man hyacinth conneally -- man that would have give the soul out of they body for the sake of ireland they would sure for they love ireland well but i have my own share in the doings of course it be before ever there be a word of my be a priest that come after thanks be to god for he mercy ' -- the old man cross himself reverently -- ` he keep I from harm and the sin that might have be lay on I but in those day there be great thought in I just as there be in you to-day faith i be of opinion that my thought be greater than yours for i be all for fight here in ireland for the poor old woman herself and it be out to some foreign war you would be go to fight for people that be not friend of yours by so much as one heart 's drop still the feeling in you be the same as the feeling that be in I not a doubt of it but indeed so far as i be concerned it be over and go i have not speak to a mortal soul about such thing these thirty year and i would not be do it now only just to show you that i be the last man in ireland that would laugh at you for what you have tell I ' ` i be glad i tell you what be in my heart ' say hyacinth ` i would like to think i have you blessing with I when i go ' ` well you will not get it ' say father moran ` so i tell you straight i 'll give you no blessing when you be go away out of the country just when there be need of every man in it i tell you this -- and you 'll remember that i know what i be talk about -- it be not man that 'll fight who will help ireland to-day but man that will work ' ` work ' say hyacinth -- ` work what work be there for a man like I to do in ireland ' ` do not i offer you the chance of buy thady durkan 's boat be not there work enough for any man in she ' ` but that be not the sort of work i ought to be do what good would it be to anyone but myself what good would it be to ireland if i catch boatload of mackerel ' ` do not be make light of the mackerel now he be a good fish if you get he fresh and split he down and fry he with a lump of butter in the pan there be worse fish than the mackerel as you 'll discover if you go to south africa and find yourself live on a bit of some ancient tough beast of a ostrich or whatever it may happen to be that they eat out there ' in he exalted mood hyacinth feel insult at the praise of the mackerel and the laughter in the priest 's eye when he suggest a dinner off ostrich he hold out he hand and say good-bye ` wait now -- wait ' say the priest ` do not be in such a tear hurry i 'll talk as serious as you like and not hurt you feeling if you 'll stay for a minute or two listen now be not the language die on the people 's lip they be talk the english more and more of they every day and do not you know as well as i do that when they lose they irish they 'll lose half the good that be in they what sort will the next generation of we people be with they own language go from they and they irish way forget and all the old tale and song and tune perish away like the froth of the wave that the storm blow up across the field the night you father die i 'll tell you what they 'll be -- just sham englishman and the lord know the real thing be not the best kind of man in the world but the copy of a englishman sure that be the poorest creature to be find anywhere on the face of god 's good earth and that be what we 'll be when the irish be go from we would not there be work enough for you to do now if you be to buy thady durkan 's boat and stay here and help to keep the people to the old tongue and the old way ' hyacinth shake he head he mood be altogether too heroic to allow he to think highly of what the priest say to he he love the irish language as he native speech -- love it too as a symbol and something more perhaps -- as a expression of the nationality of ireland but it do not seem to he to be a very essential thing and to spend he life talk it and persuade other people to talk it be a obscure kind of patriotism which make no strong appeal to he -- which indeed could not stand compare to the glory of draw the sword ` you have listen to what i have tell you father moran and you say that you understand what i feel but i do not think you really do or else you would not fancy that i could be satisfy to stay here what be it you ask of I to spend my time fishing and talk irish and dancing jig ah it be well enough i would like to do it do not think that such a life would not be pleasant to I it would be too pleasant that be what be the matter with it it be a temptation and not a duty that you be set before I ' ` maybe it be now -- maybe it be and if it be that way you think of it you be right enough to say no to I but for all that i understand you well enough who be this now come up to the house to see I ' he go over to the window and look out ` be not it a queer life a priest live in a place like this with never a minute of quiet peace from morning to night but somebody will be come interrupt and destroy it first it be you hyacinth conneally -- not that i grudge the time to you when you be go off so soon -- and now it be michael kavanagh indeed he be a decent man too like yourself come in michael -- come in do not be stand there pull at the old door-bell you know as well as myself it be break these two year it be heartbroken the thing be ever since that congested engineer put up the electric bell for I and little use that be see that biddy o'halloran -- that be my housekeeper mr conneally you remember she -- pour a jug of hot water into its inside the way it would not annoy she with ring so loud and why the noise of it vex she i could not say for she be as deaf as a post every time i speak to she ah you be there michael be you now what do you want ' a young farmer black-haired tall and straight stand in the doorway with he hat in he hand he have bring a paper for father moran 's signature it related to a bull which the congested district board propose to lend to the parish and of which kavanagh have be choose to be custodian a long conversation follow conduct in irish the newly-erected habitation for the animal be discuss then the best method of bring he home from clifden station then the kind of beast he be likely to turn out to be and the suitability of particular breed of cattle to the coarse brine-soaked land of carrowkeel kavanagh relate a fearful tale of a lot of ` foreign ` fowl which have be plant in the neighborhood by the board they be particularly nice to look at and setting of they egg be eagerly book long beforehand then one by one they sicken and die some people think they die out of spite be anger at the way they have be treat in the train kavanagh himself do not think so badly of they he be of opinion that they spirit be desolate in they with the way the rain come through the roof of they house and that they foot get sore with walk on the unaccustomed sea-sand however they death be to be explain he hope that the bull would turn out to be hardier father moran on he part hope that the roof of the bull 's house would turn out to be sounder in the end the paper be sign and kavanagh depart ` now there ' say the priest ` be a fine young man only for he i do not know how i would get on in the parish at all he be get a head on he shoulder and a notion of improve himself and he neighbor and it would do you good to see he dance a jig but why need i tell you that when you have see he yourself he be to be the secretary of the gaelic league when we get a branch of it start in carrowkeel and a good secretary he 'll make for he heart will be in the work i dare say now you have hear of the league when you be up in dublin well you 'll hear more of it by the time you be back here again -- now do not be say that you 'll not come back i 'll give you a year to get sick of fight for the boer and then there 'll be a hunger on you for the old place that will bring you back to it in spite of yourself ' ` good-bye father moran whatever happen to I i 'll not forget carrowkeel nor you either you have be good to I and if i do not take you advice and stay where i be it be not through want of gratitude ' the priest wring he hand ` you 'll come back it may be after i be dead and go but back you 'll come here or somewhere else in the old country you 'll spend you day work for ireland because you 'll have learn that work be better than fight ' chapter x when hyacinth get back to dublin about the middle of February the street be gay with amateur warrior the fever for volunteer which lay hold on the middle class after the series of regrettable incident of the winter rage violently among the irish loyalist nowhere be the recruiting officer more fervently besiege than in dublin youthful squireen who boast of be admirable snipe shot and possess a knowledge of all that pertain to horse struggle with prim youth out of bank for the privilege of serve as trooper the son of plump grazier in the west make up party with footman out of they landlord ' mansion and arrive in dublin hopeful of enlistment light-hearted undergraduate of trinity draper ' assistant of dubious character and the crowd of nondescript whose time be spend in prepare for examination which they fail to pass leap at the opportunity of win glory and perhaps wealth in south africa those who be fortunate enough to be select be send to the curragh to be break in to they new profession they be clothe to they own intense delight in that peculiar shade of yellow which be suppose to be a help to the soldier in he effort not to be shoot they leg be screw into putty and breeches incredibly tight round the knee which expand rapidly higher up and hang round they hip in voluminous fold they jacket be cover with a multiplicity of quaint little pocket sew on in unexpected place and each provide with a flap which button over it the name of the artist who design this costume have perish nor do there remain any write record of the use which these tightly-secured pocket-cover be suppose to serve augusta goold suggest that perhaps they be mean to prevent the trooper ' money from fall out in the event of any commanding officer order he man to receive the enemy standing on they head ' in the light of the intelligence display by the english general up to the present ' she say ` the war office be quite right to be prepare for such a thing happen ' it seem possible to procure almost any amount of leave from the curragh and the yeomen delighted to spend it in promenade the fashionable street of the metropolis the tea-shop reap a rich harvest from the regal way in which they treat they female relative and friend indeed they presence must have seriously disorganize the occupation by which young woman earn they living it be difficult to imagine that the sick in the hospital could have be properly look after or the letter of solicitor typewrite so great be the number of damsel who attach themselves to these attractive hero the philosophic observer find another curious subject for speculation in the fact that this parade of military splendor take place in a city whose population sympathize intensely with the boer cause and be accustom to receive the news of a british defeat with delight the dublin artisan view the yeomen much as the french in paris must have look upon the ally troops who enter they city after waterloo the very name by which they be call have a anti-national sound and suggest the performance of other amateur horse-soldier in wexford a century earlier the little band whose writings fill the page of the _ croppy _ be more than anyone else enrage at the flaunting of imperialism in they street they have rejoice quite openly after christmas and call attention every week in prose and poetry to the moribund condition of the british empire even boast as if they themselves have bear a part in its humiliation they be still in a position to assert that the boer be victorious and that the volunteer be likely to do no more than exhaust the prison accommodation at pretorium they could and do compose bite jest but they very bitterness witness to a deep disappointment it be not possible to deny that the despise english garrison in ireland be display a wholly unlooked-for spirit no one could have expect that west briton and ` seoninus ' would have want to fight very likely when the time come they would run away but in the meanwhile here they be swagger through the street of dublin outward and visible sign of a force in the country hostile to the hope of the _ croppy _ a force that some day republican ireland would have to reckon with augusta goold herself be more tolerant and more philosophic than she friend she look at the yeoman with a certain admiration they exuberant youthfulness they strutting and they obvious belief in themselves make a strong appeal to she imagination ` look at that young man ' she say to hyacinth point out a volunteer who pass they in the street ' i happen to know who he be in fact i know he people very well indeed at one time and spend a fortnight with they once when that young man be a toddler and sometimes sit on my knee -- at least he may have sit on my knee there be a good many child and at this distance of time i can not be certain which of they it be that use to worry I most during the hour before dinner the father be a landlord in the north and come of a fine old family he be a strong protestant and english of course in all he sympathy well a hundred year or so ago that boy 's great-grandfather be swagger about these same street in a uniform just as he descendant be do now he help to drag a cannon into the phoenix park one day with a large placard tie over its muzzle -- we rights or -- who do you think he be threaten just the same england that this boy be so keen to fight for to-day ' ` ah ' say hyacinth ` you be think of the volunteer movement of 1780 ' ` afterwards ' she go on ` he be one of the incorruptible you 'll see he name on jonah barrington 's red list he stand out to the last against the union would not be bribe and fight two duel with castlereagh 's bravo the curious thing be that the present man be quite proud of that ancestor in a queer inconsistent sort of way say the only mark of distinction he family can boast of be that they do not get a union peerage strange be not it ' ` it be strange ' say hyacinth ` the irish gentry of 1782 be man to be proud of yet look at they descendant to-day ' ` it be very sad do you know i sometimes think that ireland will never get she freedom till those man take it for she almost every struggle that ireland ever make be captain by she aristocracy think of the geraldine and the o'neill think of sarsfield and the wild goose think of the man who wrench a measure of independence from england in 1782 think of lord edward and smith o'brien no we may talk and write and agitate but we 'll _ do _ nothing till we get the old family with we ' hyacinth laugh it seem to he that miss goold be deliberately talk nonsense rejoicing in a paradox ` we be likely to wait if we wait for they look at those ' he wave he hand towards a group of yeoman who be chat at the street corner ` they be go to stamp out a nation in south africa be it likely that they will create one here ' ` it be not likely ' -- she sigh as she speak -- ` yet stranger thing than that have happen have you ever consider what the present english policy in ireland really be do you understand that they be try to keep we quiet by bribe the priest they think that the protestant be powerless or that they will be loyal no matter what happen but think : these protestant have be accustom for generation to regard themselves as a superior race they conceive themselves to have a natural right to govern now they be be snub and insult there be not a english official from they lord lieutenant down but think he be quite safe in ignore the protestant and be only anxious to make himself agreeable to the priest that be the begin very soon they 'll be bully as well as snub they will stand a good deal of it because like most strong people they be very stupid and slow at understand but do you suppose they will always stand it ' ` they be english and not irish ' say hyacinth ' i suppose they like what they own people do ' ` it be a lie they be not english though they say it themselves in the end they will find out that they be irish some day a last insult a particularly barefaced robbery or a intolerable oppression will awake they then they 'll turn on the people that betray they they will discover that ireland -- they ireland -- be not mean to be a cabbage-garden for manchester nor yet a _ crêche _ for suck priest ah it will be good to be alive when they find themselves we shall be within reach of the freedom of ireland then ' hyacinth be amaze at she vehement admiration for the class she be accustom to anathematize he turn she word over and over in he mind they recall as so many different thing seem to do he father 's vision of a armageddon amid the confusion of irish politics this thought of a protestant and aristocratic revolt be strangely attractive only it seem to be wholly impossible he bewilder himself in the effort to arrange the piece of the game into some reasonable order what be to be think of a priesthood who contrary to all the tradition of they church have nurse a revolution against the rights of property or of a people amazingly quick of apprehension idealistic of temperament who time after time submit themselves blindfold to the tyranny of a single leader worship a man and ask no question about he policy how be he to place a aristocracy who refuse to lead and persist in whine about they wrong to the inattentive shopkeeper of english town gentleman not want in honor and spirit court a contemptuous bourgeoisie with ridiculous flattery in what reasonable scheme of thing be it possible to place protestant blatant in they boast about liberty who hug subjection to a power which deliberately foster the growth of a ecclesiastical tyranny where amid this crazy dance of self-contradictory fanatic and fool be a sane man to find a place on which to stand how above all be ireland a nation to evolve itself he turn with relief from these perplexity to the work that lay before he however a man might worry and befog himself over the confused issue of politics it be at all event a straightforward and simple matter to fight and hyacinth be go to the front as the eleventh irish volunteer to do miss goold justice she have be extremely unwilling to enrol he and have refuse to take a penny of he money she conscience such as it be after year of patriotic endeavor rebel against commit a young man whom she really like to the companionship of the man she have enlist and the care of they commander captain albert quinn this gentleman whom she daily expect in dublin belong to county mayo he represent himself as a member of a ancient but impoverished family boast of he military experience and profess to be profoundly skilled in all matter relate to horse miss goold 's inquiry elicit the fact that he hold a undefined position under he brother a respectable manufacturer of woollen goods he military experience have be gather during the few month he hold a commission in the militia battalion of the connaught ranger a honorable position which he have resign because he brother officer persistently misunderstand he method of win money at card no one however be find to deny that he really do possess a wonderful knowledge of horse the worst that miss goold 's correspondent could suggest with regard to this third qualification be that he know too much none of these drawback to the captain -- he have assume the title when he accept the command of the volunteer -- weigh with miss goold indeed she admit to mary o'dwyer in a moment of frankness that if she man be not more or less blackguard she could not expect they to go out to south africa she do not speak equally plainly to hyacinth she recollect that he have display a very inconvenient kind of morality when she first know he and she believe he quite capable of break away from she influence altogether if he discover the kind of man she be willing to work with she do she best to persuade he to give up the idea of join the force by point out to he that he be quite unfitted for the work that would have to be do ` you know nothing about horse ' she say ' i do not suppose you have ever be on the back of one ' hyacinth admit that this be true the inhabitant of carrowkeel rarely ride they shaggy pony and when they do it be sit sideways just above the creature ' tail with two creel for turf or seaweed in the place where the saddle ought to be ` and i do not suppose you know much about shoot ' hyacinth be depress for he have never pull a trigger in he life in the west of ireland a man be not allow to possess a gun unless a resident magistrate will certify to he loyalty and harmless-ness therefore the inhabitant of village like carrowkeel be debar from shooting either snipe or seal and the british empire stand secure the difficulty about he horsemanship hyacinth endeavor to get over he arrange with a car-driver of he acquaintance to teach he to groom and harness he horse the man possess two quadruped which he describe as ` the yellow pony ' and ` the little mare ' hyacinth begin with the yellow pony the oldest and staidest of the two the little mare who have a temper of she own give he more trouble she dislike he way of put the crupper under she tail and one day to she owner 's great delight ` rise the divil on they ' when she new groom get the shaft of the car stick through she collar the want of experience in shooting be more difficult to get over grealy own a antiquated army rifle which he lend to hyacinth it be of course entirely different from the mauser and it be impossible to get a opportunity for firing it off however there be some comfort to be find in handle the thing and take long and careful aim at a distant church spire through a window in the face of such enthusiasm miss goold could not refuse she recruit she talk to he freely about she plan and be eloquent about the spirit and ability of m de villeneuve who be to take charge of she soldier after they join he in pari on the subject of captain quinn she be much more reticent and she refuse altogether to introduce hyacinth to he ten fellow trooper ` there be not the least necessity ' she say ` for you to meet they until the time for start come in fact i may say it be safer for none of you to know each other ' hyacinth experience a thrill of agreeable excitement he feel that he be engage in a real conspiracy ` for fear of informer ' he ask ` yes one never can be quite sure of anyone of course they can every one of they give information against I you can yourself if you like but no one can betray anyone else and as long as the man be safe it do not matter what happen to I ' it be one of miss goold 's weakness that she imagine herself to be a object of hatred and dread to the government and nothing irritated she more than a suspicion that she be not be take seriously the first glimpse that hyacinth get of the character of the man among whom he be to serve come to he through tim halloran tim be still sore from the scolding he have be give for he conduct at the rotunda meeting and miss no opportunity of scoffing -- not of course publicly but among he friend -- at miss goold and she volunteer hyacinth avoid he as much as possible but one evening he walk up against he on the narrow footway at the corner of george 's street halloran be delighted and seize he by the arm ` you be the very man i want to see ' he say ` have you hear about doherty ' hyacinth know no one call doherty he say so and try to escape but halloran hold he fast ` not know doherty how 's that i think you be in all dear finolum 's secret faith i hear you be go out to fight for the boer yourself i do not believe it of course you would not be such a fool but i think you would know that doherty be one of the ten precious recruit or rather _ be _ one of they ' he laugh loudly ` he 'll fight on the other side now if he fight at all ' ` what do you mean -rrb- ' ask hyacinth uneasily he be not at all sure what view the authority in dublin castle might take of recruit for the boer service and miss goold 's hint about informer recur to he mind alarmingly perhaps this doherty be a informer ` well ' say halloran ' i be in one of the police-court this morning do my work for the _ evening star _ you know i report the police news for that rag do not you well i do my column be call the doom of the disorderly rather a good title that for a column of the kind there do not appear to be anything particular on just a few ordinary drunk until this fellow doherty be bring in i think i recognize he and when i hear he name i be certain of my man he have not do anything very bad -- assault a tram-conductor or some such trifle -- and would have get off with a fine however a military man turn up and claim he as a deserter he real name it appear be johnston he desert six week ago from the dublin fusilier ' ` how on earth do he impose on miss goold ' ask hyacinth halloran look at he curiously ` oh i should not say he exactly impose upon finolum she be not precisely a fool you know and she have pretty accurate information about most of the people she deal with ' ` but surely ------ ' halloran shrug he shoulder ` my dear fellow i do not want to shatter you ideal but the beautiful finolum want to work a revolution and you can not do that sort of thing without soil you hand however whether he impose on she or not there be no doubt about it that he be a deserter why it appear that the fool be tattoo all over the arm and chest and the military people have a list of the design they have a perfectly plain case and indeed doherty make no defense ' ` what will they do with he ' say hyacinth still uneasy about the possibility of doherty 's volunteer information ' i do not know ' say halloran ' i should think the best punishment would be to send he out to ladysmith i dare say the boer would pass he in if the circumstance be explain to they by the way it would be rather funny if he meet the other nine out there on a kopje would not it he might take they prisoner or they might capture he either way the situation would have its comic possibility ' chapter xi miss goold live that part of she life which be not spend at political meeting or in the office of the _ croppy _ in a villa at killiney a house agent would have describe it as a most desirable residence standing in its own grounds overlook the sea its window open upon one of the best of the many beautiful view of dublin bay its half-acre of pleasure ground -- attend to by a job gardener once a week -- be trim and flowery its brown gate shone with frequently renew paint and the drive up to the door be neatly rake inside miss goold 's want be minister to by a eminently respectable man-servant he wife who cook and a maid the married couple be fixture and have be with miss goold since she start housekeeping the maid vary they never quarrel with they mistress but they find it impossible to live with they fellow-servant mr and mr ginty be north of ireland protestant of the severest type ginty himself be a strong orangeman and he wife profess and enforce a strict code of moral it do not in the least vex miss goold to know that she servant ' quarter be decorate with portrait of the reign family in gilt frame or that king william iii prance on a white charger above the kitchen range nor have she any objection to she butler invoke a nightly malediction on the pope over he tumbler of whisky-and-water unfortunately she maid -- the first three be roman catholic -- find that they religious conviction be outraged and leave after stormy scene the red-haired protestant from the north who follow they be indifferent to the eternal destiny of leo xiii but decline to be dictate to by mr ginty about the conduct of she love affair miss goold to whom the quarrel be refer plead the damsel 's cause and suggest privately that not even a policeman -- she have a low opinion of the force -- could be sweep away from the path of respectability by a passion for so ugly a girl mr ginty point out in reply that red hair and freckle be no safeguard when a flirtation be carry on after dark there seem no answer to this and the maid return indignantly to ballymena she be succeed by a anaemic and wholly incompetent niece of mr ginty 's who live in such terror of she aunt that peace settle upon the household miss goold suspect that this girl do little or no work -- be in fact wholly unfit for she position but so long as she herself be make comfortable it do not seem to matter who tidy away she clothes or dust she bedroom miss goold in fact have so far master the philosophy of life as to understand that the only real use of money be to purchase comfort and freedom from minor worry she have deliberately cut herself adrift from the social set to which she belong by birth and education and so have little temptation to spend she substance either in give party or enjoy they the lady who flutter round the lord lieutenant 's hospitable court would as soon have think of call on a music-hall danseuse as on miss goold they husband brother and son take liberty with she reputation in the smoking-room of the kildare street club and profess to be in possession of private information about she life which place she outside the charity of even they tolerant morality the little circle of revolutionary politician who gather round the _ croppy _ be not the sort of people who give dinner-party and there be in spite of the gospel precept a certain awkwardness nowadays in continually ask people to dinner who can not afford a retributive invitation occasionally however miss goold do entertain a few of she friend and it be generally admit among they that she not only provide food and drink of great excellence but arrange the appointment of she feast luxuriously on the very day after he interview with tim halloran hyacinth receive a invitation to dinner at the killiney villa captain quinn the note inform he have arrive in dublin and be anxious to make the acquaintance of he future comrade-in-arm it seem to hyacinth thinking over the story of doherty unlikely that the whole corps would be ask to meet they captain round a dinner-table but he hope that some of they would be there they presence would reconcile he to the awkwardness of not possess a dress-suit grealy who have occasionally dine at the villa warn he that a white shirt-front and black trousers would certainly be expect of he and hyacinth make a unsuccessful effort to hire garment for the night which would fit he in the end since it seem absurd to purchase even a second-hand suit for a single evening he brush he Sunday clothes and buy a pair of patent-leather shoe he arrive at the platform of westland row station in good time for the train he mean to catch he be soon join by miss o'dwyer who appear with she head and neck swathe in a fluffy shawl and the train of a silk skirt gather in she hand the view of several flounce of nebulous white petticoat confirm hyacinth in he conjecture that she be bind for miss goold 's party no one who could be suppose to be a member of captain quinn 's corps appear on the platform and hyacinth become painfully conscious of the shortcoming of he costume he think that even miss o'dwyer glance at it with some contempt he wish that fail a dress-suit he could have imitate the imperial yeoman who parade the street and don some kind of uniform he discomfort reach a climax when ginty receive they at the door pass miss o'dwyer on to the incompetent niece and solemnly extract the new shoe from they brown-paper parcel miss goold stand chat to captain quinn when hyacinth enter the drawing-room she move forward to meet he radiant and splendid he think beyond imagination the rustle of she drapery the faint scent that hang around she and the glitter of the stone on she throat bewilder he it be not till after he have be present to he commander that he be able to take he eye off she then in spite of he embarrassment he experience surprise and disappointment he have form no clear idea of what he expect captain quinn to be like but he have a vague mental picture of a furiously-moustachioed swashbuckler a man of immense power and hirsute hand instead there stand before he a slim small man clean shave with shiny black hair smoothly brush he clothes be so well cut and he linen so glossy that he seem fittingly place even beside the magnificent finolum he hand when hyacinth shake it seem absurdly small and he foot in they neat pump be more like a woman 's than a man 's then when he turn to resume he conversation with he hostess hyacinth be able to watch he face he notice the man 's eye they be small and quick like a bird 's and shift rapidly never rest long on any object he mouth be seldom close and the lip like the eye move incessantly though very slightly there be strange line about the cheek and jaw which somehow suggest that the man have see a good deal of the evil of the world and not altogether unwillingly he voice be wonderfully soft and clear and he speak without a trace of any provincial accent during dinner captain quinn take the largest share in the conversation it appear that he be a man of considerable knowledge of the world he have be a sailor in he time and have make two voyage to melbourne as apprentice in a large sailing-ship he story be interesting and humorously tell though they all deal with experience of he own he never allow himself to figure as anything of a hero he recount for instance how one night in melbourne dock he have run from a half-drunken swede arm with a knife and have spend hour dodge round the deck of a ship and call for help before he could get he assailant arrest he career as a officer in the mercantile navy be cut short by a period of imprisonment in a small town in madagascar he do not specify he offence but give a vivid account of life in the gaol ` there be twenty of we altogether ' he say -- ` nineteen nigger and myself there be no nonsense about discipline or work we just sit about all day in a open courtyard with nothing but a big iron gate between we and liberty all the same there be very little chance of escape there be always four black soldier on guard truculent scoundrel with curly sword a sort of missionary man get wind of my be there and use to come and visit I one day he give I a tract call gideon i read the thing because i have absolutely nothing else to read in the end it turn out a extremely useful tract for it occur to I that the old plan for defeat the midianite might work with the four black soldier i organize the other prisoner and divide they into three band we rake up a pretty fair substitute for pitcher and lamp then one night we play off the stratagem and flurry the sentry to such a extent that i get clear away i rather fancy one or two other get off too but i do not know i get into a rather disagreeable tramp steamer and volunteer as stoker it be so difficult to get stoker in the tropics that the captain take he risk and keep I i must say i be sorry afterwards that i have not stay in the gaol ' the story be properly appreciate by the audience and hyacinth begin to feel a liking for the captain ` do you know ' say miss goold when they laughter have subside ' i believe i know that identical tract i once have a evangelical aunt a dear old lady who go about she house with a bunch of key in a small basket she use to give I religious literature i never be reduce to read it but i distinctly remember a picture of gideon with he mouth open wave a torch on the front page could it have be the same ' ` it must have be ' say the captain ` mine have that picture too gideon have nothing on but a sort of nightshirt with a belt to it and only one sleeve by the way if you be up in tract perhaps you know one call the rock of horeb ' miss goold shake she head ` ah well ' say the captain after appeal to mary o'dwyer and hyacinth ` it can not be help but i must say i should like to meet someone who have read the rock of horeb i once sail from peru in a exceedingly ill-found little barque load with guano we have a very dull time go through the tropics and absolutely the only thing to read on board be the first half of the rook of horeb there be at least two page miss i read it until i nearly know it off by heart and ever since i have be try to get a complete copy to see how it end ' some of he story deal with more civilized life he delight miss goold with a account not at all unfriendly of the humor of the third battalion of the connaught ranger he quote one of mary o'dwyer 's poem to she and pleased hyacinth by he enthusiastic admiration of the connemara scenery good food good wine and a companion like captain quinn gladden the heart and the little party be very merry when ginty deposit coffee and cigarette and finally depart in miss goold 's house it be not the custom for the lady to desert the dinner-table by themselves very often the hostess be the only lady present and she have the greatest dislike to leave a conversation just when it be likely to become really interesting moreover miss goold smoke not because it be a smart or emancipated thing to do but because she like it and -- a curious note of femininity about she -- she object to she drawing-room smell of tobacco when ginty have disappear and the serious business of enjoy the food be complete the talk of the party turn on the south african campaign and the prospects of the irish volunteer captain quinn display a considerable knowledge of the operation both of the boer and the british general for the latter he express what appear to hyacinth to be a exaggerated contempt but the two lady listen to it with evident enjoyment he delight miss goold by he extreme eagerness to be off ' i do not see ' he say ` why we should not start to-morrow ' ` i be afraid that be out of the question ' say augusta goold be de villeneuve arrange to send I a wire when he be ready for we man and i can not well send they sooner ' ` ah ' say the captain ` but it seem to I the frenchman be incline to dawdle do not you think that if we go over it might hurry he up a bit ' she agree that this be possible but represent the difficulty of keep the man suitably employ in pari for perhaps three week or a month ` you see ' she say ` they be all right here in dublin where i can keep a eye on they besides they have all get some sort of employment here and i do not have to pay they i have not get money enough to keep they in pari and they will not get anything from dr leyd until you have they on board the steamer ' captain quinn seem satisfied but later on in the evening he return to the subject ' i can not help feeling that it would be better for I at all event to go over to pari at once i should not ask to draw any pay at present i have enough by I to keep I go for a few week ' ` but what about the man will you come back for they ' ` no i think that would be foolish and unnecessary there be no use in attract attention to we movement we can not have a public send-off with cheer and that sort of thing in any case or march through the street like those ridiculous yeomen we fellow have get to slip away quietly in two and three we can not tell whether we be not be watch this minute ' there be a note of sincerity in the captain 's voice which convinced hyacinth that he be genuinely frighten at the thought of have a policeman on he track miss goold too look appropriately solemn at the suggestion as a matter of fact the authority in dublin castle do occasionally send a detective in plain clothes to walk after she it be not conceivable that they suspect she of want to blow up nelson 's pillar or assassinate a judge probably they merely wish to exercise the member of the force and in the absence of any actual crime in the country feel that no harm could come to anyone through the ` shadow ' of miss goold the plan though the authority probably do not consider this have the incidental advantage of gratify the lady herself she be perfectly acquaint with most of the officer who be put on she track and be always in good spirit when she recognize one of they wait for she in westland row station captain quinn keep a watch on she face with he sharp shift eye while he speak and he be quick to realize that he have hit on a way of flattering she ` you be a person miss goold of whose action the government be bind to take cognisance i dare say they have they suspicion of I and if you and i be see together in dublin during the next week or two there will certainly be inquiry whereas if i go over to pari at once there will be no reason to watch you or anybody else ' augusta goold hesitate ` what do you say mr conneally ' she ask hyacinth be puzzle at this extreme eagerness to be off a suspicion cross he mind that the captain meditate some kind of treachery he make what appear to he to be a brilliant suggestion ` let I go with captain quinn i can start to-morrow if necessary i should like to see something of pari and you know miss goold i have plenty of money ' he think it likely that the captain would object to this plan if he meditate any kind of crooked deal when he get to pari though hyacinth fail to see any motive for treachery he would not want to be saddle with a companion the answer he receive surprised he ` delightful i shall be glad to have a friend with I in the interval of military preparation we can have a gay time -- not too gay of course miss goold i shall keep mr conneally out of serious mischief when we have a little spare cash we may as well enjoy ourselves we sha not want to carry money about with we in the transvaal we mean to live at the expense of the english out there ' augusta goold smile almost maternally at hyacinth ` my dear boy ' she say ` what seem plenty of money to you will not go very far in paris what be it let I see you say two hundred pound and you want to buy you outfit out of that keep a little by you in case of accident ' ` well ' say the captain ` that be settle and if we be really to start to-morrow we ought to get home to-night mr conneally may be ready to start at a moment 's notice but he must at least pack up he tooth-brush may we see you safe back to town miss o'dwyer remember we shall expect a valedictory ode in the next number of the _ croppy _ write we something that will go to a tune something with a swing in it and we 'll sing it beside the camp fire on the veldt miss goold ' -- he hold out he hand as he speak -- ` i be a plain fellow ' -- he do not look in the least as if he think so -- ` i have lead too rough a life to be any good at make pretty speech but i be glad i have see you and talk to you if i be knock on the head out there i shall go under satisfied for i have meet a woman fit to be a queen -- a woman who be a queen the queen of the heart of ireland ' it be likely that augusta goold though she be certainly not a fool be a little excited by the homage for she refuse to say good-bye declare that she would see the boat off next morning it be a promise which would cost she something to keep for the mail steamer leave at 8 be and miss goold be a lady who appreciate the warmth of she bed in the morning especially during the early day of march when the wind be likely to be in the east chapter xii captain quinn make himself very agreeable to mary o'dwyer during the short journey back to dublin at westland row he see she into a cab which he pay for he last word be a reminder that he would expect to have she war-song music and all send after he to paris then he turn to hyacinth ` that be all right we have do with she it be better to pay the cab for she else she might have scruple about take one and we should have be oblige to go home with she in a beastly tram come along i be stay at the gresham it be always as well to go to a decent place if you have any money you come with I and we 'll have a drink and a talk ' there be two priest and a bishop in earnest conference round the fire in the hall of the hotel when they enter when he discover that they talk be of the iniquity of the national board of education and therefore likely to last beyond midnight captain quinn lead the way into the smoking-room which be unoccupied a sufficient supply of whisky and a syphon of soda-water be set before they the captain stretch himself in a comfortable chair and light he pipe ' a fine woman miss goold ' he say meditatively hyacinth murmur a assent ' a very fine woman and apparently pretty comfortably off i wonder why on earth she do it ' he look at hyacinth as if he expect some sort of explanation to be forthcoming ` do what ' ask hyacinth at length ` oh all this revolutionary business : the _ croppy _ seditious speech and now this rot about help the boer what do she stand to gain by it i do not suppose there be any money in the business and a woman like that might get all the notoriety she want in she own proper set without stump the country and talk rot ' this way of look at augusta goold 's patriotism be new to hyacinth and he resent it ' i suppose she believe in the principle she profess ' he say the captain look at he curiously and then take a drink of he whisky-and-soda ` well ' he say ` let 's suppose she do after all she motive be nothing to we and she be a damned fine woman whatever she do it for ' he drink again ` it would have be very pleasant now if she would have spend the next few week with I in paris you will not mind my say that i would rather have have she than you conneally as a companion in a little burst however i see at once that it would not do anyone with a eye in he head could tell at a glance that she be not that sort ' he sigh hyacinth be not quite sure that he understand the suggestion be so calmly make and reason on that it seem impossible that it could be as iniquitous as it appear ` there be no one such a utter fool about woman ' go on the captain ` as you respectable married man who never do anything wrong himself i would hear of miss goold as everybody have and listen to discussion about she character you know just as well as i do the sort of thing they say about she ' hyacinth do know very well and flare up in defense of he patroness ` they be vile lie ' ` that be just what i be say those respectable people who tell the lie be such fool they think that every woman who do not mew about at afternoon party must be a bad one now anyone with a little experience would know at once that miss goold -- what be this the other one call she oh yes finola -- that finolum may be a fool but she be not _ that _ ' he pull himself together as he speak evidently he plume himself on he experience and the faculty for judge it have bring he ` now i would just as soon have ask my sister-in-law to come to pari with I for a fortnight as finolum you do not know mr jame quinn i think that be a pity she be the most domesticated and virtuous _ haus-frau _ in the world ' he pause and then ask hyacinth ` why be you do it ' again hyacinth be reduce by sheer surprise to a futility ` do what ' ` oh go out to fight for the boer now do not like a good fellow say you be act on principle it be all well enough to give finola credit for that kind of thing she be as we agree a splendid woman but you must not ask I to believe in the whole corps in the same way ' hyacinth meditate a reply it be clearly impossible to assert that he want to fight for liberty to give he life to the cause of a oppressed nationality it would be utterly absurd to tell the story of he father 's vision and say that he look on the south african war as a skirmish preliminary to the armageddon sit opposite to this cynical man of the world and listen to he talk hyacinth come himself to disbelieve in principle he feel that there must be some baser motive at the bottom of he desire to fight only for the life of he he could not remember what it be he could not even imagine a good reason -- good in the estimation of he companion -- why anyone should do so foolish a thing as go out to the transvaal the captain be not at all impatient he sit smoking quietly until there seem no prospect of hyacinth answering then he say : ` well if you do not want to tell I i do not mind only i think you be foolish you see little accident happen in these affair there be such thing as bullet and one of they might hit you somewhere that would matter then it would be my duty to send home you last word to you sorrowing relative and it would be easier to do that if i know exactly what you have do the death-bed repentance of the prodigal be always most console to the elder brother -- much more console in fact than the prodigal 's return now how the deuce be i to make up a plausible repentance for you if i do not know what you have do ' ` but i have not do anything ' say hyacinth ineffectively the captain ignore he ` come now it can not be anything very bad at you age have you get into a mess with a girl or ' -- he brighten up at the guess -- ` be you hopelessly enamour of the beautiful finolum that would be most suitable the bold bad woman send the minstrel boy to he death with he wild harp sling behind he i could draw tear from the stoniest-hearted elder brother over that ' if he could have think of a crime at the moment hyacinth would probably have confess it but he be bewildered and could hit on nothing better than : ' i have no elder brother -- in fact no relation of any sort ' ` lucky man now i have a perfect specimen of a brother -- jame quinn esquire of ballymoy he be a churchwarden think of that if it should be you melancholy duty to send the message home to he -- in case that bullet hit I i mean -- tell he ------ oh there be no false pride about I fill you glass again i do not in the least mind you know that i would not go a step to fight for boer or briton either if it be not for a little affair connect with some horse and a cheque you see the war office people send down a perfect idiot to buy remount for the cavalry in galway and mayo he be the sort of idiot that would tempt a archbishop to swindle he i rather overdo it i be afraid and now the matter be likely to come out ' for all he boast power of observation captain quinn fail to notice the disgust and alarm on hyacinth 's face ' i stick the fool ' he go on ` with every old screw in the country i get broken-winded mare from the plough i collect a regular hospital of spavined knock-kneed beast and he take they from I without a word at thirty pound apiece it would have be all right if i have go no further but hang it all i get to the end of my tether i declare to you i do not believe there be another screw leave in the whole county of mayo and unless i take to sell he the ass i could not go on then i hear of this plan of you friend finolum 's and i determine to make a little coup and clear i alter a cheque the idiot be on he way to a out-of-the-way corner of connemara look for mount infantry cob i know he would not see he bank-book for at least a week so i chance it that be the reason why i be so uncommonly anxious to get clear at once if i once get off it will be next door to impossible to get I back again general joubert will hardly give I up i be not the least afraid of those ridiculous policeman who walk about after finolum but i be very much afraid of be tap on the shoulder for reason quite non-political i can tell you i have be on the jump ever since yesterday when i cash the cheque and i sha not feel easy till i have leave france behind I i fancy i be safe for the present the idiot be sure to try fifty way of get he account straight before he light on my little cheque and when he do i have cover my track pretty well my dear brother have not the slightest notion what be become of I i dare say he 'll stop make inquiry as soon as the police begin poor old chap he 'll feel it about the family name and so on ' he smile at he own reflection in the mirror over the chimneypiece he be evidently well satisfy with the performance he have narrate then at last hyacinth find himself able to speak again as when he have defeat dr spenser in the college lecture-room he own coolness surprise he ` you be a infernal blackguard ' he say captain quinn look at he with a surprise that be perfectly genuine he doubt if he could have hear correctly ` what do you say ' ' i say ' repeat hyacinth ` you be a infernal blackguard ' ` do you really suppose that i would be go on this fool of a expedition if i be not ' ' i shall tell miss goold the story you have just tell I i shall tell she to-morrow morning before the boat sail ' ` very well ' say the captain ` but do not suppose for a moment that you 'll shock finolum she do not know this particular story about I but i expect she know another every bit as bad and i dare say she will regard the whole thing as a justifiable spoiling of the egyptian by the way ' -- there be a note of anxiety in he voice -- ' i hope you will not find it necessary to repeat anything i have say about the lady herself _ that _ might irritate she ' ` be it likely ' say hyacinth ` that i would repeat that kind of talk to any woman ' ` quite so i admire you attitude such thing be entirely unfit for repetition but seriously now what on earth do you expect to happen when you tell she i be perfectly certain that every single volunteer she be get be just as great a blackguard -- you word my dear fellow -- as i be and finola know it perfectly well ' hyacinth hesitate the phrase in miss goold 's letter in which she have originally describe she man as blackguard recur to he mind he remember the story of doherty he anger begin to give way to a sick feeling of disgust ` think now ' say the captain : ` be it likely that you could enlist a corps of sunday-school teacher for this kind of work i 'll give you credit for the highest motive though i be blest if i understand they but how can you suppose that there be anyone else in the whole world that feel the way you feel or want to act as you be do ' ' i dare say you be right ' say hyacinth feebly ` of course i be right -- perfectly right ' hyacinth try to lift he glass of whisky-and-water to he lip but he hand tremble and he be oblige to put it down captain quinn watch he wipe the spilt liquid off he hand and then settle down in he chair with he head bow and he eye half shut ` sit up man ' he say ` it be all right you have do nothing to be ashamed of at all event but look here you ought not to come with we at all it be no job for a man like you you back out of it do not turn up to-morrow morning i 'll explain to finola if she be there and if not i 'll write she a letter that will set you straight with she i be really sorry for you conneally ' hyacinth look up at he ` i be sorry i call you a blackguard ' he say ` you be not any worse than everyone else in the world ' ` nonsense ' say captain quinn ` do not take it like that from you point of view you be quite right to call I a blackguard and mind you there be plenty of people in the world who be not blackguard there be my brother for instance he be a bit of a prig -- in fact he be as priggish as he well can be -- but he be never do anything but run straight i do not suppose he could go crooked if he try ' hyacinth get up ` good-night ' he say ` and good-bye i sha not go with you ' ` wait a minute ' say captain quinn ' i think i have do you one good turn to-night in stop you go to south africa now i 'll do you another and one at the same time to that brother of mine i leave he in a hurry i tell you that but i do not think i mention that i be in he employment he run a woollen factory down in mayo i own a share in the business once but that go long ago and the whole thing belong to jame now i be a sort of clerk and general agent i be not really the least use for i never do any work jame be for ever complain but i be bind to say he stick to I i 'll give you a letter to he and i dare say you may get the job that i have chuck it be not much of a thing but it may suit you for a while sit down till i write my letter ' hyacinth obey since he anger evaporate a sort of numbness have creep over he mind he scarcely understand what be say to he he have a vague feeling of gratitude towards captain quinn and at the same time a great desire to get away and be alone he feel that he require to adjust he mind to the new thought which have be crowd into it when he receive the letter he put it into he pocket and rise again to go the captain see he to the door ` good-bye ' hyacinth hear he but he voice seem far off and he word meaningless ` take my advice and run down to ballymoy at once do not hang about finola any more she be a splendid woman but she be not for you if you marry she you would be perfectly miserable not that i think she would ever marry you still she might woman do such odd thing if by any chance she do you 'll have to be very careful give she she head and take she easy up to the jump do not try to hustle she and for god 's sake do not begin saw at she mouth i would very much like to be here to see you in the character of mr augusta goold ' he sigh ` but of course i can not the british isle will be too hot for I for a while however who can tell what might happen if i win a good medal from old kruger and capture a few british general i might act best man for you yet if you 'll wait a year or two ' when hyacinth get home to he lodgings the first object that meet he eye be grealy 's ancient rifle he tie a label round its barrel address to the owner then he pack he few belongings carefully and strap he bag so far he be sure of himself he have no doubt whatever that he must leave dublin at once he feel that he could not endure a interview with augusta goold she might blame he or might pity he either would be intolerable she might even justify herself to he might beat he into submission by sheer force of she beauty and she passion as she have do once before he would run no such risk he feel that he could not sacrifice he sense of right and wrong could not allow himself to be drag into the moral chaos in which it seem to he now miss goold live he be unconscious of any divine lead or even of any direct reliance on the obligation of honor he could not himself have tell why he cling with such desperate terror to he plan of escape from he surroundings simply he could not do certain thing or associate as a friend with people who do they to get away from dublin be the first necessity for a moment it occur to he that he might go to dr henry tell he the whole story and ask for advice and help but that be impossible how could he confess the degradation of he ideal how could he resist the inevitable reminder that he have be warn beforehand besides not even now after all that he have see could he accept dr henry 's point of view he still believe in ireland still hope to serve she still look for the come of he father 's captain to lead the saint to the final victory miss goold have fail he but he be not yet ready to enrol himself a citizen of england no he must leave dublin but where to go he lamp burnt dim and expire as he sit think he fire have long ago go out he shiver with cold and misery while the faint light of the dawn steal into he room he hear the first twitter of the bird in the convent garden behind he lodging then come the noise of the earliest traffic the unnaturally loud rattle of the dust-cart on they round a steamer hoot far away down the river and a early bell ring the neighbouring nun to prayer hyacinth grow desperate could he go home back to the fishing-boat and simple people of carrowkeel a great desire for the old scene seize upon he he fight against it with all he might he have reject the offer of the home life once now no doubt it would be close against he the boat that might have be he be sell long ago he would not go back to confess himself a fool and a failure gradually he mind work back over the conversation in the hotel with captain quinn the recollection of the latter part of it which have mean nothing at the time grow clear he feel for the letter in he pocket and draw it out after all why should he not offer himself to jame quinn ballymoy be remote enough to be a hiding-place it be in county mayo the captain have say he have never hear of the place and it seem likely that no one else except its inhabitant know of it either at least there be no reason that he could see why he should not go there he brain refuse to work any longer either at plan or remember he lip form the word ballymoy he repeat it again and again he seem to go on repeat it in the troubled sleep which come to he chapter xiii the irish get credit even from they enemy for be a quick-witted imaginative and artistic people yet they display astonishingly little taste or originality in they domestic architecture in connaught where the celtic genius may be suppose to have the freest opportunity for express itself the town be all exactly alike and they resemblance consist in the absence of any beauty which can please the eye a english country town although the english bucolic be notoriously as stupid as a ox have certain feature of its own so have a swiss cottage or a french village it be possible to represent these upon christmas card or the lid of chocolate-box without label they english swiss or french any moderately well educate young lady will recognize they at once and exclaim without hesitation ` how truly english ' or ` how sweetly swiss ' but no one can depict a irish town with any hope of have it recognize unless he idealize boldly introduce a highly-intelligent pig or a man in knee-breeches kiss a fancifully-attired colleen and then after all he might as well have label it irish at once in good plain print and save himself the trouble of draw the symbolic figure to describe ballymoy therefore mountain river and such like natural eccentricity be leave out of the count be to describe fifty other west of ireland town there be a railway-station bleak gray and windswept situate for the benefit of local car-owner a mile and a half from the town and the road which connect the two be execrable there be a workhouse in ballymoy as everywhere else in this lost land the most prominent building there be a convent immense and wonderfully white with row and row of stare window and a far-seen figure of the bless virgin poise in a niche above the main door there be a roman catholic church gray-walled gray-roofed and unspeakably hideous but large and like the workhouse and the convent obtrude itself upon the eye it seem as if the inhabitant of the town must all of they be force and that at no distant date either into religion or pauperism just as small body float in a pond be suck into connection with one or other of the log which lie among they the shop in the one tortuous street block the footpath in front of they door with pile of empty packing-case the passenger be salute here by a buffet in the face from a waterproof coat suspend outside a draper 's there by a hot breath of whisky-laden air two shop out of every three be public-house these occupy a very beautiful position in the economic life of the town they profit go to build the church to pay the priest and to fill the coffer of the nun the making of the profit fill the workhouse a little aloof stand the protestant church austere to look upon express in all its line a grim reproach of the people 's life beyond it among scanty stooped tree be the rectory gray as everything else be wear like a decayed lady the air of have live through better day such save for one feature be ballymoy as the traveller see it as hyacinth conneally see it when he arrive there one gusty afternoon the one unusual feature be mr jame quinn 's woollen mill it stand a gaunt and indeed somewhat dilapidated building at the bottom of the street in the angle where the river turn sharply to flow under the bridge the water just above the bridge be sweep into a channel and force to turn the wheel which work some primitive machinery within in the center of the mill 's front be a archway through which cart pass into the paved square behind here be the weighbridge and here great bundle of heavy-smelling fleece be unloaded off the square be the office where mr quinn sit pay for the wool and enter the weight of it in damp ledger here on saturday two or three man and a score of girl receive they wages the business be a peculiar one you may bring you wool to mr quinn in fleece just as you sheer it off the sheep 's back he will pay you for it more or less accord to the amount of trouble you have take with you sheep this be the way the younger generation like to treat its wool if you be older and be bless with a wife able to card and spin you deal differently with mr quinn for many evening after the shear you wife sit by the fireside with two carding-comb in she hand and wipe off they wonderfully soft roll of wool afterwards she fetch the great wheel from its nook and you watch she pull out a endless gray thread while she step back and forwards across the floor the girl watch she too but not as you do with sleepy admiration they emotion be amuse contempt nevertheless you kitchen wall be gradually decorate with bunch of great gray ball when these have accumulate sufficiently you take they to mr quinn a certain number of they become he property out of the rest he will weave what you like -- coarse yellow flannel good for bawneen and when it be dye crimson for petticoat or blanket -- not fluffy like the blanket that be buy in shop but warm to sleep under when the winter come or perhaps frieze very thick and rough the one fabric that will resist the winter rain this portion of he business mr quinn find to be decrease year by year fewer and fewer woman care to card and spin the wool the younger man find it more profitable to sell it at once and to wear instead of the old bawneen shirt call flannel which be bring over from cotton-spinning lancashire and sell in the shop the younger woman think that they look prettier in gown make artfully by the local dressmaker out of feeble material get up to catch the eye if now and then for the sake of real warmth one of they make a petticoat of the old crimson flannel it be keep so short that save in very heavy rain it can be conceal unfortunately while these old-fashioned profit be vanish mr quinn find it very hard to increase the other branch of he business the fabric which he make be good so good that he find it difficult to sell they in the tooth of competition the country shop be flood with what he call ` shoddy ' a army of eager commercial traveller push showy goods on the shopkeeper and the public at half he price even the farmer in remote district be begin to acquire a taste for smartness some thing in which he use to do a useful trade be now scarcely worth make there be hardly any demand for the check head-kerchief the woman prefer hat and bonnet deck with cheap ribbon or artificial flower and these bring no trade to mr quinn 's mill still he manage to hold on the lancashire people though they have invent flannelette can not as yet make a passable imitation of frieze and there be a dublin house which buy annually all the blanket he can turn out it be true that even there and for the best class of customer price have to be cut so as to leave a bare margin of profit yet since there be a margin mr quinn hold on though not very hopefully hyacinth leave the bulk of he luggage -- a packing-case contain the book which the auctioneer have fail to dispose of in carrowkeel -- at the station and walk into ballymoy carry he bag he have little difficulty in make he way to the mill and find the owner of it in he office it be difficult at first to believe that jame quinn could be any relation to captain albert the traveller horse-dealer soldier and thief this man be tall though he stoop when he stand to receive he visitor he movement be slow he fair hair lay thin across he forehead and be touch above the ear with gray he blue eye be very gentle and have a way of look long and steadily at what they see a glance at he face leave the impression that life perhaps by no very gentle means have teach he patience ` this letter will introduce I ' say hyacinth ` it be from you brother captain or mr albert quinn ' jame quinn take the letter and turn it over slowly then without open it he lay it on the table in front of he he eye travel from it to hyacinth 's face and rest there it be some time before he speak and then it be to correct hyacinth upon a trivial point ` my half-brother ' he say ` my father marry twice and albert be the son of he second wife you may have notice that he be a great deal younger than i be ' ` he look younger certainly ' say hyacinth for the other be wait for a reply ` nearly twenty year younger albert be only just thirty ' the exact age of the captain be uninteresting and seem to be beside the purpose of the visit hyacinth shift he chair and fidget uncertain what to do or say next ` albert give you this letter to I be he a friend of yours ' ` no ' jame quinn look at he again steadily it seem -- but this may have be fancy -- that there be a kindlier expression in he eye after the emphatio repudiation of friendship with albert at length he take up the letter and read it through slowly ` why do my brother give you this letter ' the question be a puzzling one hyacinth have never think of try to understand the captain 's motive then the conversation in the hotel recur to he ` he say that he want to do a good turn to I and to you also ' ` what have you do for he ' ` nothing whatever ' apparently jame quinn be not in the least vex at the brevity of the answer he receive or disturb because he cross-examination be obviously disagreeable to hyacinth ` in this letter ' he go on refer to the document as he speak ` he describe you as a young man who be certainly honest probably religious and possibly intelligent i presume you know my brother and if you do you may be surprise to hear that i be quite prepared to take he word for all this i have very seldom know albert to tell I lie and i do not know why he should want to deceive I in this case still i be a little puzzle to account for he give you the letter can you add nothing in the way of explanation to what you have say ' ' i do not know that i can ' say hyacinth ` will you tell I how you meet my brother and what he be do now or where he be ' ' i do not think i should be justify in do so ' ` ah well i can understand that in certain circumstance albert would be very grateful to a man who would hold he tongue he might be quite willing to do you a good turn if you undertake to answer no question about he ' he smile as he speak a little grimly but there be laughter lurk in the corner of he eye a puritan will sometimes smile in such a way at the thought of a sinful situation too solemn to be laugh at openly but appeal to a not entirely atrophy sense of humor hyacinth feel reassure ` indeed ' he say ' i make no promise of silence it be only that -- well i do not think -- ' jame quinn wait patiently for the conclusion of the sentence but hyacinth never arrive at it ` in this letter ' he say at last ` my brother ask I to give you the place he lately hold in my business now i do not want to press you to say anything you do not want to but before we go further i must ask you this be you implicate in the affair yourself ' ' i beg you pardon i do not quite understand what you mean ' ` well i suppose that since my brother be anxious that you should hold you tongue he have do something that will not bear talk about be you implicate in -- in whatever the trouble be ' ` certainly not ' say hyacinth ` in fact it be on account of what you speak of as trouble that i decline to have anything more to do with you brother ' ` that be probably very much to you credit and in the light of my brother 's estimate of you character i may say that i entirely believe what you say be i to understand that you be a applicant for the post in my business which albert hold and which this letter tell I i may consider vacant ' ` that be what bring I down here ' say hyacinth ` have you any other recommendation or testimonial as to character to show I ' ` no but there be several people who would answer question about I if you write to they : dr henry of trinity college would or miss augusta goold or father moran of carrowkeel in county galway ' ` you have give I the most remarkable list of reference i ever come across in my life i do not suppose anyone ever before be recommend for a post by a protestant divinity professor a notoriously violent political agitator a roman catholic priest and a -- well we will not describe my brother how do you come to be mix up with all these people who be you ' ' i be the son of æneas conneally rector of carrowkeel who die last christmas ' ` well ' say jame quinn ' i suppose if all these people be prepare to recommend you you character must be all right now tell I do you know what the post be you be apply for ' ` no ' say hyacinth ` and i may as well say that i have have no experience or business training whatever ' ` so i should suppose from the way you have come to I well my brother be clerk and traveller for my business he be suppose to help I to keep account and to push the sale of my goods among the shopkeeper in connaught as a matter of fact he never do either the one or the other when he be at home he do nothing when he be on the road he buy and sell horse i pay he eighty pound a year and he travel expense i also promise he a percentage on the profit of the sale he effect now do you think this work would suit you ' ' i might not be able to do it ' say hyacinth ` but i should very much like to be allow to try i can understand that i shall be very little use at first and i be willing to work without any salary for a time perhaps six month until i have learn something about you business ' ` come now that be a business-like offer i 'll give you a trial if it be only for the sake of you list of reference i will not keep you six month without pay you if you turn out to be any good at all and i think there must be something in you for you have go about get this job in the queerest way i ever hear of would you like any time to make up you mind finally before accept the post ' ` no ' say hyacinth ' i accept at once ' they walk together through the mill and look at the machine and the worker the girl smile when mr quinn stop to speak to they and look with frank curiosity at hyacinth the three or four man who do the heavier work stop and chat for a few minute when they come to they evidently there be no soreness or distrust here between the employer and the employ when they have go through the room where the work be go on they climb a staircase like a ladder and come to the loft where the wool be store hyacinth handle it as he be direct and endeavor to appreciate the difference between the good and the inferior quality they pass by a unglazed window at the back of the mill and mr quinn point out he own house it stand among tree and shrub now for the most part bare but give promise of shady privacy in summertime long window open out on to a lawn stretch down to the watercourse which feed the millwheel a gravel path skirt one side of the house lead to a bridge and thence to a doorway in a high wall beyond which lay the road as they look the door open and a woman with two little girl come through they cross the bridge and walk up to the house ` that be my wife ' say mr quinn ` and my two little girl ' he stretch out between the bar of the window and shout to they all three look back mrs quinn wave she hand and the two child shout in reply then a light appear in one of the window and hyacinth catch a glimpse of a trim maid-servant pull the curtain across it ` we shall be have tea at half-past six ' say mr quinn ` will you come and join we by the way where be you stay ' hyacinth accept the invitation and confess that he have not as yet look for any place to lay he head ` ah better go to the hotel for to-night it be not much of a place but you will have to learn to put up with that sort of accommodation tomorrow we 'll try and find you some decent lodgings ' the hotel strike even hyacinth as of inferior quality though it boast great thing in the timetable advertisement and call itself ` imperial ' in large gold letter above its door a smell of whisky and tobacco greet he as he enter and a waiter with a greasy coat in answer to inquiry about a bed send he down a dark passage to seek a lady call miss sweeney at the bar large leather case with broad strap and waterproof-covered basket block the passage and hyacinth stumble among they for some time before he discover miss sweeney read a periodical call _ spicy bit _ among she whisky-bottle she be a young woman of would-be fashionable appearance and act apparently in the double capacity of barmaid and clerk on hearing that hyacinth require not whisky but a bedroom she request he to go forward to the office indicate a glass case at the far end of the bar counter here he repeat he request to she through a small opening in the glass and receive she assurance give with great condescension that no 42 be vacant and further that there be a fire in the commercial room a boy whom she summon carry hyacinth 's bag to a extremely dirty and ill-furnished bedroom and afterwards conduct he to the promise fire two other guest be seat at it when he enter who after a long stare make room for he apparently there be no one else stop in the hotel and the whole mass of cumbrous baggage which block the passage to the bar must belong to they hyacinth realize with a feeling of disgust which he could not account for that these be two member of he new profession -- fellow-traveller in the voyage of commerce he gather -- for they talk loudly without regard he presence -- that they represent two manchester firm which be rival in the wholesale drapery business very much of what they say be unintelligible to he though the word be familiar he know that ` line ' could be ` quote ' but not apparently in the same sense in which they discuss these operation and it puzzle he to hear of muslin be ` do at one and seven-eighths ' he sit for a time wonder at the waste of money and energy involve in send these man to remote corner of ireland to search for customer then he leave they and make he way down the muddy street to mr quinn 's house the room into which he be show be different from any he have ever see it be light by a single lamp with a dull glass globe and a turf fire which burnt brightly two straight-backed leather-covered chair stand one on either side of the tiled hearth near one stand a little table cover with neatly-arranged book and rise from among they a reading-lamp as yet unlit beyond the other be a work-table strew with reel and scissors on which lay a child 's frock and some stocking the table be lay for tea on it be plate pile up with floury scone delicate beleek saucer full of butter pat thin into the shape of shell and jam in color glass dish case in silver filigree a large home-baked loaf of soda bread on a wooden platter stand at one end of the table and near it a sponge-cake at the other end be a array of cup and saucer with silver spoon that glitter a jug of cream and one of milk two of the cup be larger than the other and have those curious bar across they which be design to save man from wet they moustache when they drink no room and no preparation for a meal could have offer a more striking contrast to augusta goold 's dining-room she group of wineglass multiplicity of heavy-handled knife and fork and she candle shroud in silk nor be the dainty neatness less remote from the crack delf and huddle sordidness of he old home long before hyacinth have realize a impression of the scene before he mr quinn greet he and lead he to the fire she two little girl who lay on the hearthrug with a picture-book between they be bid to make room for he when she husband appear she bustle off and in a minute or two she and the maid come in bring toast and tea and hot water hiss in a silver urn as the evening pass hyacinth begin to realize that he have enter into a home of peace he feel that these people be neither greatly anxious to be rich nor much afraid of be poor they seem in no way fret that there be other higher in the social scale cleverer or more brilliant than they be he understand that they be both of they religious in a way quite different from any he have know they neither speak of mystery like he father nor be eager about disputing like the man who have be he fellow-student they be live a very simple life of which faith and a wide charity form a part as natural as eat or sleep when the child 's bedtime come it seem to he a very wonderful thing that they should kneel in turn beside they father 's knee and say they prayer aloud when he a stranger be in the room it seem to he less strange because then he have be two hour longer in the company of the quinn that before leave he too should kneel beside he hostess and listen while he new employer repeat the familiar word of some of the old collect he have hear he father read in church chapter xiv on Sunday the third day after he arrival in ballymoy hyacinth go to church he could hardly have avoid do so even if he have want to for mr quinn invite he to share she pew there be no real necessity for such hospitality for the church be never even under the most favourable circumstance more than half full the four front seat be reserve for a mr stack on whose property the town of ballymoy stand but this gentleman prefer to live in surrey and even when he come over to ireland for the shooting rarely honor the church with he presence a stone tablet bear the name of this magnate 's father a cork pawnbroker who have purchase the property for a small sum under the encumber estate court act adorn the wall beside the pulpit the management of the property be in the hand of a dublin firm so the parish be deprive of the privilege of a resident land agent the doctor recently appoint to the district be a roman catholic of plebeian antecedent which reduce the resident gentry of ballymoy to the quinn a bank manager and the rector canon beecher a few farmer mr stack 's gamekeeper and the landlady of the imperial hotel make up the rest of the congregation the service be not of a very attractive or inspiriting kind canon beecher -- he title be a purely honorary one not even involve the duty of preach in the unpretending building which in virtue of some forget history be dignified with the name of killinacoff cathedral -- read slowly with somewhat ponderous emphasis he thirty year in holy order have slightly harden a originally luscious dublin brogue but there remain a certain gentle aspiration of the _ d 's _ and _ t 's _ and a tendency to omit the labial consonant altogether he read a immense number of prayer gather as it seem to hyacinth the longest one from the four corner of the prayer-book at interval he allow himself to be interrupt with a hymn but resume afterwards the steady flow of supplication the eldest miss beecher -- the canon have altogether two daughter and three son -- play a harmonium the other girl and the three boy with the assistance of a uncertain bass from mr quinn give utterance to the congregation 's praise hyacinth try to join in the first hymn which happen to be familiar to he but quaver into silence towards the end of the second verse discover that the eye of mr beecher from she pew of the canon from the reading-desk of the vocal miss beecher and she brother be fix upon he the sermon prove to be long and uninteresting it be about melchizedek and be so far appropriate to the priest and king that it have no recognisable beginning and need not apparently have ever have a end perhaps no one unless he be specially train for the purpose could have follow right through the quiet meander-ing of the canon 's thought this kind of sermon however have the one advantage that the listener can take it up and drop it again at any point without inconvenience and hyacinth be able to give he attention to some section of it there be no attempt at eloquence or any kind of learn display but he understand as he listen where the quinn get they religion or at least how they religion be keep alive certain very simple thing be reiterate with a quiet earnestness which leave no doubt that the preacher believe exactly what he say and live by the light of he faith one evening shortly afterwards canon beecher call upon hyacinth the conversation during the visit resolve itself into a kind of catechism which curiously enough be quite inoffensive the canon learn by degree something of hyacinth 's past life and he career in trinity college he shake he head gravely over the friendship with augusta goold whom he evidently regard as almost beyond the reach of the grace of god hyacinth be force to admit with a increase sense of shame that he have never sign a temperance pledge do not read the organ of the church missionary society be not a member of a young man 's christian association or even of a gleaner ' union he feel as he make each confession sorrowfully that he be lose all hope of the canon 's friendship and be most agreeably surprise when the interview close with a warm invitation to a mid-day dinner at the rectory on the follow Sunday mrs quinn who take a sort of elder sister 's interest in he going out and coming in be delight when she hear that he be go to the rectory and assure he that he would like both mr beecher and the girl she confide afterwards to she husband that the influence of a christian home be likely to be most beneficial to the ` poor boy ' the rectory display none of the sign of easy comfort which have charm hyacinth in the quinn ' house the floor of the square hall be cover with a cheap well-worn oilcloth its wall be damp-stained and the only furniture consist of a wooden chair and a somewhat rickety table in the middle of the wall hang a large olive-green card with silver letter ` christ be the unseen guest in this house ' hyacinth read ` the sharer in every pleasure the listener to every conversation ' a fortnight before he would have turn with disgust from such a advertisement but now since he have know the quinn and listen to the canon 's wander sermon he look at it with different eye he feel that the word might actually express a fact and that a family might live together as if they believe they to be true ` yes ' say the canon who have come in with he and see he gaze at it ` these motto-card be very nice i buy several of they last time i be in dublin and i think i have a spare one leave which i can give you if you like it have silver letter like that one but print on a crimson ground ' evidently the design and the coloring be what strike he as noticeable the motto itself be a commonplace of christian live the expression of a basal fact quite naturally hang where it would catch the eye of chance visitor in the drawing-room mr beecher and she two daughter still in they hat and glove stand round a turf fire they make a place at once for hyacinth and one of the girl draw forward a rickety basket-work chair cover with fade cretonne he be formally introduce to they miss beecher and miss elsie beecher have both the latter very recently reach the dignity of young womanhood and wear long dress the three boy who be younger be make known afterwards when they go into the dining-room the canon select the soundest of a miscellaneous collection of chair for hyacinth and seat he beside mr beecher then the elder girl -- miss beecher 's name he learn be marion -- enter in a long apron carry a boil leg of mutton follow by she sister with dish of potato and mash parsnip ` you see ' say mrs beecher and there be no note of apology in she voice as she make the explanation ` my girl be accustom to do a good deal of the house-work we have only one servant and she be not very presentable when she have just cook the dinner ' hyacinth glance at marion beecher who smile at he with frank friendliness as she take she seat beside she father he see suddenly that the girl be beautiful he have not notice this in church there he have no opportunity of observe the subtle grace with which she move and the half-light leave unrevealed the lustrous purity of she complexion the radiant red and white which only the warm damp of the western seaboard can give or preserve she eye he have see even in the church but now first he realize what unfathomable gentleness and what a wonder of frank innocence be in they the canon look round the table at he child and there be a humorous twinkle in he eye when he turn to hyacinth and quote : ` you son shall grow up as young plant and you daughter shall be as the polished corner of the temple ' perhaps nine-tenth of civilized mankind would regard five child as five misfortune under any circumstance as quite overwhelming when they have be shower on a man with a very small income who be oblige to live in a remote corner of ireland apparently the canon do not look upon himself as a afflict man at all there be a unmistakable sincerity about the way in which he complete he quotation : ` lo thus shall the man be bless that feareth the lord ' it dawn on hyacinth that quite possibly the canon 's view of the situation might be the right one it be certainly wonderfully pleasant to see the girl move through the room and it seem to he that they actually realize the almost forget ideal of serviceable womanhood the talk at dinner turn first on the ailment of a old woman who be accustom to clean the church but be now suspect of be past she work then by a abrupt transition on the new hat which the bank-manager 's wife have bring home from dublin and finally the connection of thought be again far from obvious on the hymn which have be sing that morning it be at this point that hyacinth be include in the conversation marion beecher announce that one of the hymn be a special favorite of hers because she remember she mother singing the younger child to sleep with it when they be baby she catch hyacinth look at she while she speak and say to he : ` do you sing mr conneally ' ' i do a little ' ` oh then you must come and help we in the choir ' ` choir ' seem a grandiose name for the four beecher and mr quinn but marion who have little experience of anything better have no misgiving ' i hope you sing tenor i always long to have a tenor in my choir why we might have one of barnby 's anthem at easter and we have not be able to sing one since mr nash leave the bank ' hyacinth have never sing a part in he life and could not read music but he grow bold and profess to have a excellent ear say he be willing to learn the prospect of a long series of choir practice conduct by marion beecher seem to he just then a extremely pleasant one after dinner while the two girl clear away the plate and dish canon beecher invite hyacinth to smoke ' i never learn the habit myself ' he say ` it be not so much the fashion in my young day as it be now but i have no objection whatever to the smell ' hyacinth light a cigarette apologetically it seem to he almost a wicked thing to do but he host evidently wish he to be comfortable they talk after the girl have leave the room turn on politics hyacinth 's confession of he friendship with augusta goold have impress the canon and he deliver himself of a very kindly little lecture on the duty of loyalty and the sinfulness of contention with the power that be he way of put the matter neither irritated hyacinth like the flamboyant imperialism of the trinity student nor drive he into self-assertion like dr henry 's contemptuous reasonableness still he feel bind to make some sort of defense of the opinion which be still he own ` surely ' he say ` there must be some limit to the duty of loyalty if a government have no constitutional right to rule be a man bind to be loyal toit ' ' i think ' say the canon ` that the question be decide for we be it not mr conneally render unto caesar -- you remember the verse even if the government be as unconstitutional as you appear to think it would not be more so than the roman government of judaea when these word be speak ' hyacinth ponder this answer it open up to he a entirely new way of look at the subject and he could see that it might be necessary for a christian to acquiesce without a attempt at resistance in any government which happen to exist he remember other verse in the new testament which could be quote even more conclusively in favor of this passive obedience yet he feel that there must be a fallacy lurk somewhere it be on the face of it a obvious absurdity to think that a man because he happen to be a christian be therefore bind to submit to any form of tyranny or oppression ` suppose ' he say -- ' i only say suppose -- that a government do immoral thing that it rob or allow evil-disposed people to rob would it still be right to be loyal ' ' i think so ' say the canon quietly hyacinth look at he in astonishment ` do you mean to say that you yourself would be loyal under such circumstance ' ' i prefer not to discuss the question in that personal way but the church to which you and i belong be loyal still although the government have rob we of we property and we position and although it be now allow we people to be rob still further ' ` you mean by the disestablishment and the land act ' ` yes i think it be we great glory that we loyalty be imperishable that it survive even such treatment as we have receive and be receive ' ` that be very beautiful ' say hyacinth slowly ' i see that there be a great nobility in such loyalty although i do not even wish to share it myself you see i be a irishman and i want to see my country great and free ' ' i suppose ' say the canon ` that it be very natural that we should love the spot on earth in which we live i think that i love ireland too but we must remember that we citizenship be in heaven and it seem to I that any departure from the law of the king of that country dishonor we and even dishonor the earthly country which we call we own ' hyacinth say nothing there flash across he a recollection of augusta goold 's hope that some final insult would one day goad the irish protestant into disloyalty clearly if canon beecher be to be regard as a type she have no conception of the religious spirit of the church of ireland but be there anyone else like this clergyman he do not know but he guess that he friend the quinn would think of the matter in somewhat the same way it seem to he quite possible that in scatter and remote parish this strangely unreasonable conception of christianity might survive after a pause the canon go on : ` you must not think that i do not love ireland too i look forward to see she free some day but with the freedom of the gospel it will not be in my time i know but surely it will come to pass we people have still the simple faith of the early age and they have many very beautiful virtue they only want the dawn of the dayspring from on high to shine on they and then ireland will be once more the island of saint -- _ insulum sanctorum _ ' he dwell tenderly on the two word ' i do not think it will matter much then what earthly government bear rule over we but come i see that you have finish you smoke and i must go to my study to think over my sermon ' when hyacinth enter the drawing-room the girl surround he ask he for answer to a print list of question it appear that the committee of a bazaar for some charity in which it be right to be interested have issue a sort of examination-paper and promise a prize to the best answerer the question be all of one kind : ` what be the modern athen -- the eternal city -- the city of the tribe who be the wizard of the north -- the bulwark of the protestant faith the earlier name on the list present little difficulty to hyacinth marion take down he answer whilst elsie murmur a pleasant chorus of astonishment at he cleverness suddenly he come to a dead stop ` who be the martyr of melanesium ' ' i have never hear of he ' say hyacinth ` never hear of the martyr of melanesium ' say elsie ` why we know that at once ' ` yes ' say marion ` there be a article on he in last month 's _ gleaner _ surely you read the _ gleaner _ mr conneally ' hyacinth feel marion 's eye fix on he with something of a reproach in they he wrestle with a vague recollection of have somewhere hear the name of the periodical for a moment he think of risk cross-questioning and say that he have only miss the last number then he suddenly remember the card with silver letter which hang above he coat in the hall and tell the truth with even a quite unnecessary aggravation ` no i never remember see a copy of it in my life i do not even know what it be about ' ` oh ' say the girl round-eyed with horror ` just think and we all have collecting-box ' ` it be a missionary periodical ' say marion ` it have news in it from every corner of the mission-field and every month a list of the station that specially need we prayer ' hyacinth leave the rectory that night with three well-read number of the _ gleaner _ in he pocket afterwards he have many talk with canon beecher and the quinn about the work of the missionary society he learn to he surprise that really immense sum of money be subscribe every year by member of the church of ireland for the conversion of the heathen in very remote part of the world it could not be deny that these contribution represent genuine self-denial young man go without a sufficiency of tobacco and refrain from buy sorely-needed new tennis-racquet lady with the smallest means at they command rear marketable chicken and sell they own marmalade and cake in such way and not from the superfluity of the rich many thousand of pound be gather annually it be still more wonderful to he to discover that large number of young man and woman and these the most able and energetic devoted themselves to this foreign service and that they brother and sister at home be band together in union to watch they doings and to pray for they he find himself entirely untouch by this enthusiasm in spite of the beautiful expression it find in the life of he new friend but it astonish he greatly that there should be this potent energy in the irish church the utter helplessness of its bishop and clergy in irish affair the total indifference of its people to every effort at national regeneration have lead he to believe that the church itself be moribund now he discover that there be in it a amazing vitality a capacity of give birth to enthusiastic soul the knowledge bring with it first of all a feeling of intense irritation it seem to he that all religion be in league against ireland the roman church seize the scanty savings of one section of the people and squander they in buy german glass and italian marble be the protestant any better when they spend # 20000 a year on chinaman and negro the roman catholic take the best of they boy and girl to make priest and nun of they the protestant be do the same thing when they ship off they young man and young woman to spend they strength among savage both be rob ireland of what ireland need most -- money and vitality he would not say even to himself that all this religious enthusiasm be so much ardor waste no doubt the roman priest do good work in chicago as the protestant missionary do in uganda only it seem to he that of all land ireland need most the service and the prayer of those of she child who have the capacity of self-forgetfulness afterwards when he think more deeply he find a great hope in the very existence of all this altruistic enthusiasm he have a vision of all that might be do for ireland if only the splendid energy of she own child could be use in she service he try more than once to explain he point of view mr quinn meet he with blank disbelief in any possible future for ireland ` the country be doom ' he say ` the people be lazy thriftless and priest-ridden the best of they be fly to america and those that remain be die away drift into lunatic asylum hospital and workhouse there be a curse upon we in another twenty year there will be no irish people -- at least none in ireland then the english and scotch will come and make something of the country ' from canon beecher he meet with scarcely more sympathy or understanding ` yes ' he admit ` no doubt we ought to make more effort than we do to convert we fellow-countryman but it be very difficult to see how we be to go to work there be one society which exist for this purpose its friend be full of the very kind of enthusiasm which you describe i could point you out plenty of its agent whose whole soul be in they work but you know as well as i do how completely they be fail ' ` but ' say hyacinth ' i do not in the least mean that we should start more mission to roman catholic it do not seem to I to matter much what kind of religion a man profess and i should be most unwilling to uproot anyone 's belief what we ought to do be throw we whole force and energy into the work of regenerate ireland it be possible for we to do this and we ought to try ' ` well well ' say the canon ' i must not let you make I argue with you conneally but i hope you will not preach these doctrine of yours to my daughter i think it be better for they to drop they penny into missionary collecting-box and leave the tangled problem of irish politics to those better able to understand they than we be ' chapter xv there be certain profession in themselves honest useful and even estimable for which society have agree to entertain a feeling of contempt it be for instance very difficult to think of a curate as anything except a butt for satirist or to be respectful to the profession of tailor although many a man for private pecuniary reason be meek before the particular individual who make he clothes yet the novelist and the playwright who hold the mirror up to modern humanity be occasionally kind even to curate and tailor there be a youthful athlete in holy order who thrash to we immense admiration the village bully bewilder he victim and he admirer with he mastery of what be describe a little vaguely as the ` old oxford science ' once at least a glamour of romance have be shed over the son of a tailor and it become imaginable that even the chalker of unfinished coat may in the future be pose as heroic there be still however a profession which no eccentric novelist have ever venture to represent as other than entirely contemptible the commercial traveller be beneath satire and outside the region of sympathy if he appear at all in fiction or on the stage he be irredeemably vulgar he be never heroic never even a villain rarely comic always poor man objectionable this be a peculiar thing in the literature of a people like the english who be not ashamed to glory in they commercial success and be always ready to cheer a politician who profess to have the interest of trade at heart amid the current eulogy of the work man and the apotheosis of the being call ` captain of industry ' the bagman surely ought to find at least a apologist without he it seem likely that many article would fail to find a place in the window of the provincial shopkeeper without he large section of the public would probably remain ignorant for year of new brand of cigarette and dyspeptic people might never come across the food which american prepare for they use also the individual bagman be often not without he charm he know if not court and prince at least hotel and railway company he be on term of easy familiarity with every ` boot ' in several county he can calculate to a nicety how long a train be likely to be delay by a fair ` somewhere along the line ' he be also full of information about local politics in connaught for instance a experienced member of the profession will gauge for you the exact strength of the exist league in any district he know what publican may be regard as ` priest 's man ' and who have leaning towards independence he knowledge be frequently minute and he can prophesy the result of a district council election by reckon up the number of lead man who read the _ unite irishman _ and weigh they against those who delight in the page of the _ leader _ the man who can do these thing be themselves local they reside in they district and as a rule push the sale and collect the debt of local brewer and flour-merchant the representative of the larger english firm only make they round twice or three time a year and be less interesting they pay the penalty of be cosmopolitan and tend to become superficial in they judgment of man and thing hyacinth like most member of the public be ignorant of the greatness and interest of he new profession he enter upon it with some misgiving and view he trunk of sample blanket and shawl with disgust even a new overcoat though warm and weatherproof afford he little joy be itself a sample of mr quinn 's frieze one thought alone cheer he and even generate a little enthusiasm for he work it occur to he that in sell the produce of the ballymoy mill he be advance the industrial revival of ireland he know that other people quite heroic figure be work for the same end a government board find joyous scope for the energy of its official in give advice to people who want to cure fish or make lace it earn the blessing which be to rest upon those who be revile and evil speak of for no one except literary people who write for english magazine ever have a good word for it there be also those -- they activity take the form of letter to the newspaper -- who desire to utilize the artistic capacity of the celt and to enrich the world with beautiful fabric and carpentry they too be worker in the cause of the revival then there be great lady the very cream of the anglo-irish aristocracy who pet tweeds and stocking and offer magnificent prize to industrious cottager they earn quite large sum of money for they protégés by hold sale in place like belfast and manchester where title can be judiciously cheapen to a wealthy bourgeoisie and the wife of ship-builder and cotton-spinner will spend cheerfully in return for the privilege of shake hand with a countess a crowd of minor enthusiast foster such industry as sprigging and there be one man who believe that the future prosperity of ireland might be secure by teach people to make doll it be altogether a noble army and even a commercial traveller might hold he head high in the world if he count himself one of its soldier hitherto result have not be at all commensurate with the amount of printer 's ink expend in magazine article and advertisement yet something have be accomplish nunnery here and there have be induce to accept present of knitting-machine and people have begin to regard as somehow sacred the word ` technical education ' the national board of education have also spend a large sum of money in revive among its teacher the almost forget art of make paper boat hyacinth very soon discover that he patriotic view of this work do not commend itself to he brother traveller he find that they have no feeling but one of contempt for people whom they regard as meddling amateur occasionally when some convent under a bustling mother superior advance from the region of half-charitable sale at exhibition into the competition of the open market contempt become dislike and wish be express in quite unsuitable language that the good lady would mind they own proper business until hyacinth learn to conceal he hope of ireland 's future as a manufacturing country he be regard with suspicion no one of course object to he make what use he could of patriotism as a advertisement but he be give to understand that like other advertisement it could not be quote among the initiate without a serious breach of good manners even as a advertisement it be not rate highly there be a elderly gentleman stout and somewhat bibulous who superintend the consumption of certain brand of american cigarette in the province of connaught hyacinth meet he in the exceedingly dirty railway hotel at knock since there be no other guest and the evening be wet the two be throw upon each other 's society in the commercial-room ' i do not think ' say mr hollywell in reply to a remark of hyacinth 's ` that there be the least use try to drag patriotic sentiment into business of course since you represent a irish house -- woollen goods i think you say -- you be quite right to run the fact for all it be worth i do not in the least blame you only i do not think you 'll find it pay ' he sip he whisky-and-water -- it be still early and he have only arrive at he third glass -- and then proceed to give he personal experience ` now i work for a american firm if there be any force in the patriotic idea i should not sell a single cigarette my people be in the big tobacco combine you must have read the sort of thing the newspaper write about we when we start from any point of view british imperial or irish national we should have be boycott long ago if patriotism have anything to do with trade but look at the fact we chief rival in this district be two irish firm they advertise in gaelic which be a mistake to start with because nobody can read it they get the newspaper people to write article recommend a great home industry to public support they get local branch of all the different league to pass resolution pledge they member to smoke only irish tobacco but until quite lately they simply do not have a look in ' ` why ' ask hyacinth ` be you thing cheaper or better ' ` no ' say the other ' i do not think they be either you see price be bind to come out pretty even in the long run and i should say that if anything they sell a slightly better article it be hard to say exactly why we beat they when competition be really keen a lot of little thing that you would hardly notice make all the difference for one thing i get a free hand in the matter of subscribe to local bazaar and race-meeting i have often take as much as a pound 's worth of ticket for a five-pound note that some priest be raffle in aid of a new chapel it be wonderful the order you can get from shopkeeper in that kind of way then we get we thing up better look at that ' he hand hyacinth a highly-glazed packet with a picture of a handsome brown dog on it ` keep it ' say mr hollywell ' i give away twenty or thirty of those packet every week now look inside what have you oh hm _ majestic _ that be one of a series of photo of britain 's first line of defense lot of people go on buy those cigarette just to get a complete collection of the photo we supply a album to keep they in for one and sixpence there be another of we make which have picture of actress and pretty woman they be extraordinarily popular they be perfectly all right of course from the moral point of view but one in every ten be in tights or sit with she leg very much cross just to keep up the expectation it be very queer the people who go for those photo you would expect it to be young man but it be not ' the subject be not particularly interesting to hyacinth but since he companion be evidently anxious to go on talk he ask the expect question ` young woman ' say mr hollywell ' i find it out quite by accident i get a lot of complaint from one particular town that we cigarette have no photo with they i discover after a while that a girl in one of the principal shop have hit on a dodge for get out the photo without apparently injure the packet the funny thing be that she never touch the ironclad or the type of the soldier of all nation which you might have think would interest she but she collar every single actress and have duplicate of most of they and she be not a exception most girl goad they young man to buy these cigarette and make collection of the photo queer be not it i can not imagine why they do it ' ` you say just now ' say hyacinth ` that latterly you have not do quite so well do you run out of actress and battleship ' ` no but one of the irish firm take to offer prize and enclose coupon you collect twenty coupon and you get a silver-backed looking-glass -- girl again you see -- or two thousand coupon and you get a new bicycle it be a old dodge of course but somehow it always seem to pay however all this do not matter to you all i want be to show you that there be no use rely on patriotism the thing to go in for in any business be attractive novelty cheap line and in the country shop long credit ' it be not very long before hyacinth begin to realize the soundness of mr hollywell 's contempt for patriotism in the town of clogher he find the wall placard with the advertisement of a ultra-patriotic draper ` féach annseo ' he read ` the irish house support home manufacture ' another placard be even more vehement in its appeal ` why curse england ' it ask ` and support she manufacture ' try o'reilly the one-price man ' the sentiment be so admirable that hyacinth follow the advice and try o'reilly the shop be crowd when he enter for it be market day in clogher the irish country-people whose manners otherwise be the best in the world have one really objectionable habit in the street or in a crowded building they push they way to the spot they want to reach without the smallest regard for the feeling of anyone who happen to be in the way sturdy country-women carry basket which double the passage room they require hustled hyacinth into a corner and for a time defeat he effort to emerge get he case of sample safely between he leg he amuse himself watch the patriot shopkeeper and he assistant conduct they business it be perfectly obvious that in one respect the announcement of the attractive placard depart from the truth : o'reilly be not a ` one-price man ' he charge for every article what he think he customer be likely to pay the result be that every sale involve prolonged bargaining and heated argument in most case no harm be do the country-woman be keenly alive to the value of they money and evidently enjoy the process of beat down the price by halfpenny until the real value of the article be reach then mr o'reilly and he assistant be accustom to close the haggle with a beautiful formulum : ` to _ you _ ' they say with confidential smile and flattering emphasis on the pronoun -- ` to _ you _ the price will be one and a penny but really there will be no profit on the sale ' occasionally with timid and inexperienced customer o'reilly 's method prove its value hyacinth see he sell a dress-length of serge to a young woman with a baby in she arm for a penny a yard more than he have charge a moment before for the same material another thing which strike he as he watch be the small amount of actual cash which be pay across the counter most of the woman even those who seem quite poor have account in the shop and do not shrink from increase they once or twice a stranger present some sort of a letter of introduction and be at once accommodate with apparently unlimited credit at length there be a lull in the business and hyacinth succeed in spread he goods on a vacant counter and attract the attention of mr o'reilly he begin with shawl ' i hope ' he say ` that you will give I a good order for these shawl ' mr o'reilly finger they knowingly ` price ' he say hyacinth mention a sum which leave a fair margin of profit for mr quinn o'reilly shake he head and laugh ` can not do it ' hyacinth reduce he price at once as far as possible ` no use ' say mr o'reilly compare with the suave oratory to which he treat he customer this extreme economy of word be striking ` see here ' he say produce a bundle of shawl from a shelf beside he ' i get these for twenty-five shilling a dozen less from thompson and taylor of manchester ' hyacinth look at they curiously each bear a prominent label set forth a name for the garment in large letter surround with wreath of shamrock ` the colleen bawn ' he read ` erin 's own ' ` the kathleen mavourneen ' ` the cruiskeen lawn ' the appropriateness of this last title be not obvious to the mere irishman but the color of the garment be green so perhaps there be a connection of think in the maker 's mind between that and ` lawn ' ` cruiskeen ' he may have take for the name of a place ` be these ' ask hyacinth ` what you advertise as irish goods ' mr o'reilly clear he throat twice before he reply ` they be get up specially for the irish market ' in the interest of he employer hyacinth keep he temper but the effort be a severe one ` these ' he say ` be half cotton mine be pure wool they be really far better value even if they be double the price ' mr o'reilly shrug he shoulder ' i do not say they be not but i should not sell one of yours for every dozen of the other ' ` try ' say hyacinth ` give they a fair chance tell the people that they will last twice as long tell they that they be make in ireland ' ` that would not be the slightest use they would simply laugh in my face my customer do not care a pin where the goods be make i have never in my life be ask for irish manufacture ' ` then why on earth do you stick up those advertisement ' say hyacinth point to the ` féach annseo ' which appear on a hoard across the street mr o'reilly be perfectly frank and unashamed ` the other drapery house in the town be own by a scotchman and of course it pay more or less to keep on say that i be irish besides i mean to stand for the urban council in march and those sort of ad be useful at a election even if they be no good for business ' ` i 'll tell you what i 'll do ' say hyacinth shirk a discussion on the morality of advertising : ` i 'll let you have a dozen shawl at cost price and take back what you can not sell if you give I you word to do you best for they ' similar discussion follow the display of serge and blanket it appear that nice-looking goods could be send over from england at lower price it be vain for hyacinth to press the fact that he thing be better mr o'reilly admit as much ` but what be i to do the people do not want what be good they want a cheap article which look well and they do not care a pin whether the thing be make in england ireland or america take my advice ' he add as hyacinth leave the shop : ` get you boss to do inferior line -- cheap cheap and showy ' so far mr hollywell 's opinion be entirely justified the appeal of the patriotic press to the public and the shopkeeper on behalf of the industrial revival of ireland have certainly not affect the town of clogher hyacinth be bitterly disappointed but hope when it be bear of enthusiasm die hard and he be greatly interested in a speech which he read one day in the ` mayo telegraph ' it have be make at a meeting of the league by a ardnaree shopkeeper call dowl a trade rival -- the fact of the rivalry be not emphasize -- have advertise in a scotch paper for a milliner dowling be exceedingly indignant he quote emigration statistics show the number of girl who leave mayo every year for the united state he point out that all of they might be employ at home as milliner or otherwise if only the public would boycott shop which sell english goods or employ scotch milliner he more than suspect that the obnoxious advertisement be part of a organize attempt to effect a new plantation of connaught -- ` worse than cromwell 's be ' the fact that connaught be the only part of ireland which cromwell do not propose to plant escape the notice of both mr dowling and he audience the speech conclude with a passionate peroration and a verse no doubt declaim soundingly of ` the west 's awake ' hyacinth make a expedition to ardnaree and call hopefully on the orator he reception be depress in the extreme the shop which be large and impose be stock with goods which be obviously english and mr dowling curtly refuse even to look at the sample of mr quinn 's manufacture hyacinth quote he own speech to the man and be amaze at the cynical indifference with which he ignore the dilemma ` business be one thing ' he say ` and politics be something entirely different ' hyacinth lose he temper completely ' i shall write to the papers ' he say vand expose you i shall have you speech reprint and along with it a account of the way you conduct you business ' a mean hard smile cross mr dowling 's mouth before he answer : ` perhaps you do not know that my wife be the archbishop 's niece ' hyacinth stare at he for a minute or two he entirely fail to understand what mr dowl 's relationship to a great ecclesiastic have to do with the question at last a light break on he ` you mean that a editor would not print my letter because he would be afraid of offend a roman catholic archbishop ' the expression ` roman catholic ' catch mr dowling 's attention ` be you a protestant ' he ask ` you be -- a dirty protestant -- and you dare to come here into my own house and insult I and trample on my religious conviction i be a catholic and a member of the league what do you mean you souper you sour-face by talk to I about irish manufacture get out of this house and go to the hell that be wait for you ' as hyacinth turn to go there flash across he mind the recollection of miss goold and she friend who write for the _ croppy _ ` there be one paper in ireland anyhow ' he say ` which be not afraid of you wife nor you archbishop i 'll write to the _ croppy _ and you 'll see if they will not publish the fact ' mr dowling grin ' i do not care if they do ' he say ` the priest be dead against the _ croppy _ and there be hardly a man in the town read it go up there now to hely 's and try if you can buy a copy i tell you it be not on sale here at all and whatever they publish will do I no harm ' when hyacinth return to the hotel he find mr holywell seat with the inevitable whisky-and-water beside he in the commercial-room ` well mr conneally ' he say ` and how be patriotism pay you find people ready to buy what be irish ' hyacinth boil over with indignation related he experience with mr dowling ` what do i tell you ' say mr hollywell ` but anyhow you be just as well out of a deal with that fellow i would not care to do business with he myself i happen to know and you may take my word for it ' -- he voice sink to a confidential whisper -- ` that he be very deep in the book of two english firm and that he dare not -- simply dare not -- place a order with anyone else they would have he in the bankruptcy court to-morrow if he do i should not feel easy with mr dowling 's cheque for a account until i see how the clerk take it across the bank counter you mark my word there 'll be a fire in that establishment before the year 's out ' the prophecy be fulfil as hyacinth learn from the _ mayo telegraphy _ and mr dowling 's whole stock of goods be consume there be rumor that a sceptical insurance company make difficulty about pay the compensation demand but the inhabitant of ardnaree mark they confidence in the husband of a archbishop 's niece by present he with a address of sympathy and a purse contain ten sovereign most of hyacinth 's business be do with small shopkeeper in remote district the country-people who live out of reach of such centre of fashion as ardnaree and clogher be sufficiently unsophisticated to prefer thing which be really good hat and bonnet be not quite universal among the woman in the mountain district far back where they speak irish and mr quinn 's head-kerchief be still in request even the younger woman want garment which would keep they warm and dry and hyacinth often return well satisfy from a tour of the country shop sometimes he doubt whether he ought to trust the people with more than a few pound ' worth of goods but he gradually learn that unlike the patriotic mr dowling they be universally honest he discover too that these people with they imperfect english and little knowledge of the world be exceedingly shrewd they have very little real confidence in oratorical politician and they interest in public affair go no further than vote consistently for the man they priest recommend but they quickly understand hyacinth 's argument when he tell they that the support of irish manufacture would help to save they son and daughter from the curse of emigration ` faith sir ' say a shopkeeper who keep a few blanket and tweeds among he flour-sack and porter-barrel ` since you be talk to the boy last month i could not induce one of they to take the foreign stuff if i be to offer he a shilling along with it ' chapter xvi when he return to ballymoy after he interview with mr dowling hyacinth set himself to fulfil he threat of write to the _ croppy _ he spend Saturday afternoon and evening in he lodgings with the paper contain the blatant speech spread out before he he blow he anger to a white heat by go over the evidence of the man 's grotesque hypocrisy he write and rewrite he article it be he first attempt at express think on paper since the day when he seek to satisfy examiner with disquisition on dryden 's dramatic talent and other topic suit to the undergraduate mind this be a different business it be no longer a question of fill a sheet of foolscap with grammatical sentence discover synonym for word hard to spell now thought be hot in he and the art lay in find word which would blister and scorch time after time he tear up a page of bombast or erase ridiculous flamboyancy late at night with a burning head and ice-cold foot he make he last copy fold it up and distrust the cooler criticism of the morning go out and post it to the _ croppy _ a letter from miss goold overtake he the follow Thursday in the hotel at clogher ' i be delighted to hear from you again ' she write ' i be afraid you have cut I altogether go over to the respectable people and forget poor ireland captain quinn tell I that you and he have quarrel and i gather that you rather disapprove of he well he be a bit of a blackguard but after all one do not expect a man who take on a job of that kind to be anything else i never think it would suit you and you will do I the justice of remember that i never want you to volunteer now about you article it be admirable these cheap patriot ' -- it be thus the article be head -- ` be just the creature we want to scarify dowling and he kind be the worst enemy ireland have to-day we 'll publish anything of that kind you send we and remember we be not the least afraid of anybody it be a grand thing for a paper to be as impecunious as the _ croppy _ no man but a fool would take a libel action against we with any hope of get damages a jury might value dowling 's character at any fantastic sum they choose but it would be a poor penny the _ croppy _ would pay still we be not so hard up that we can not give we contributor something and next week you 'll get a small cheque from the office i hope it may encourage you to send we more do not be afraid to speak out if anything peculiarly seditious occur to you write it in irish i know it be all the same to you which language you write in do we half a column every fortnight or so on western life and politics ' hyacinth be absurdly elate by miss goold 's praise he make up he mind to contribute regularly to the _ croppy _ and have vision of a great future as a journalist or perhaps a literary exponent of the idea of independent ireland meanwhile he become very intimate both with the quinn and with canon beecher 's family mr quinn be a enthusiastic gardener and early in the spring hyacinth help she with she flowerbed he learn to plait the foliage of fade crocus and pin they tidily to the ground with little wooden fork he gather suitable earth for the box in which begonia make they earliest sprout-ing and learn to know the daffodil and tulip by they name later on he help mr quinn to mow the grass and mix a potent weed-killer for the gravel walk there come to be a understanding that whenever he be not absent on a journey he spend the latter part of the afternoon and the evening with the quinn as the day lengthen the family tea be push back to later and later hour to give more time out of door there be something about the very occupation of gardening which be deadening to enthusiasm perhaps a man learn patience by familiarity with grow plant nature be never in a hurry in a garden and there be no use in try to hustle a flower whereas a great impatience be the very life-spirit of enthusiastic patriotism there have probably never be a revolutionary gardener or even a strong radical who work with open-air flower of course in greenhouse thing can be force and the spirit of the ardent reformer may find expression in the nurture of premature bloom perhaps also the constant stooping which gardening necessitate especially in the early spring when the weed grow plentifully tend to destroy the stiff mental independence which must be the attitude of the militant patriot it be very difficult for a man who have stoop long enough to have conquer he early cramp and ache to face the problem of politics with uncompromising rigidity hyacinth recognize with a curious qualm of disgust that he thought turn less and less to ireland 's wrong and ireland 's future as he learn to care for the flower and the grass no doubt too the atmosphere of the quinn ' family life be not congenial to the spirit of the irish politician mr quinn be totally uninterested in politics and except a prejudice in favor of what she call loyalty have absolutely no view on any question which do not directly affect she home and she child mr quinn have a coldly-reasonable political and economic creed which act on the luxuriant fancy of hyacinth 's enthusiasm as he weed-killer do on the tender green of the path he decline altogether to see any good in support irish manufacture simply because they be irish the story of o'reilly 's attitude towards he shawl move he to no indignation ' i think he be perfectly right ' he say ` if a man can buy cheap shawl in england he would be a fool to pay more for irish one business can not be run on those line i be not a object of charity and if i can not meet fair competition i must go under and it be right that i should go under ' hyacinth have no answer to give he shirk the point at issue and attack mr quinn along another line in the hope of arouse he indignation ` but it be not fair competition that you be call upon to face do you call it fair competition when the government subsidize a woollen factory in a convent ' ` ah ' say mr quinn ` you be think of the four thousand pound the congested district board give to the convent at bobeen but it be hardly fair to hold the government responsible for the way that body waste eighty thousand pound a year ' ` the government be ultimately responsible and you must admit that after such a gift and in view of the other which will certainly follow you be call upon to meet most unfair competition ' ` yes i admit that but be not that exactly what you want to make general there do not seem to I any difference between give a bounty to one industry and impose a protective tariff in favor of another and if you preference for irish manufacture mean anything it mean a sort of voluntary protection for every business in the country if you object to the robeen business be subsidize you can not logically try to insist on mine be protect ' it be puzzling to have the table turn on he so adroitly hyacinth be reduce to feeble threat ` just wait a while till the nun get another four thousand pound and perhaps four thousand pound more after that and see how it will affect you ' mr quinn smile ` i be not much afraid of nun as trade competitor or for the matter of that of the congested district board either if the yorkshire people would only import a few mother superior to manage they factory and take the advice of member of we board in they affair i would cheerfully make they a present of any reasonable subsidy and beat they out of the market afterwards ' there be another influence at work on hyacinth 's mind which have as much to do with the decay of he patriotism as either the gardening or mr quinn 's logic marion beecher and she sister be very frequently at the mill house during the spring and summer there be one long afternoon which be spend in the mark out of the tennis-ground mr quinn have theory involve calculation with a pencil and piece of paper about the surest method of secure right angle at the corner and parallel line down the side of the court hyacinth and marion work obediently with a tape measure and the garden line one of the boy mess cheerfully with a pail of liquid whitening afterwards the gardening be somewhat desert and hyacinth be instruct in the game it take he a long time to learn and for many afternoon he and marion be regularly beat but she would not give up hope of he often the excuse of she come to the quinn be the necessity of practise some new hymn or chant for Sunday hyacinth work as hard at the music as at the tennis under she tuition and there come a time when he could sing a easy tenor part with fair accuracy then in the early summer when the evening be warm hymn be sing on the lawn in front of the house there seem no incongruity in marion beecher 's company in pass without a break from lawn-tennis to hymn-singing and mr quinn be always ready to do he best at the bass with a serious simplicity as if it be a perfectly natural and usual thing to close a afternoon 's amusement with ` rock of age ' hyacinth be not conscious of any definite change in he attitude towards religion he still believe himself to be somehow outside the inner shrine of the life which the beecher and the quinn live just as he have be outside he father 's prayer but he find it increasingly difficult after a hour or two of companionship with marion beecher to get back to the emotion which have sway he during the week of he intimacy with miss goold to write for the _ croppy _ after sit beside marion in church on Sunday evening be like pass suddenly from a quiet wood into a heated saloon where people wrangle a wave of the old passionate feeling when it return affect he as raw spirit would the palate of a boy one day early in summer -- the short summer of connaught which be glorious in June and dissolve into windy mist and warm rain in the middle of July -- hyacinth be invite by canon beecher to join a boat party on the lake the river whose one useful function be the turning of mr quinn 's millwheel wound away afterwards through marshy field and grove of willow-tree into the great lake at its mouth the beecher keep they boat a cumbrous craft very heavy to row but safe and suit to carry a family in comfort the party start early -- canon beecher hyacinth and one of the boy very early for they have to walk the two mile which separate ballymoy from the lake shore mr beecher the girl the two other boy and the basket of provision follow a little later on the rectory car pack beyond all possibility of comfort the canon himself pull a oar untiringly but without the faintest semblance of style and the party ripple with joy when they discover that hyacinth also could row ` now ' say elsie ` we can go anywhere we can go on rowing and rowing all day and see place we have never see before ' ` my dear girl ' say she mother ` remember that mr conneally and you father be not machine you must not expect they to go too far ' ` oh but ' say elsie ` father say he never get tired if he have only one oar to pull ' the canon be prepare for he toil the old coat in color now almost olive green be fold and use as a cushion by marion in the bow he white cuff stow inside he hat be commit to the care of mr beecher he roll he gray shirtsleeve up to the elbow and unbutton he waistcoat ` now ' he say ` i be ready if i be not hurry i 'll pull along all day but what about you conneally you be not accustom to this sort of thing ' but hyacinth for once be self-confident he might be a poor singer and a contemptible tennis player but he know that nothing which have to do with boat could come amiss to he he look across the sparkling water of the lake ` i 'll go on as long as you like you will not tire I when there be no tide and no wave this be a very different business from get out the sweep to pull a nobby five mile against the strength of the ebb with a heavy ground swell run ' about eleven o'clock they land on a island and eat biscuit the canon tell hyacinth the story of the ruin under whose wall they sit ` it belong to the lynott the welshman of tyrawley they be at feud with the burke and one night in winter -- ' the girl wander away carry they biscuit with they it be likely that they have hear the story every summer as long as they could remember mr beecher alone still maintain a attitude of admiration for she husband 's antiquarian knowledge the more creditable because she must have be familiar with the onset of the macwilliam burke before even marion be old enough to listen to hyacinth the story be both new and interesting it stir he to think of the lynott fight hopelessly or beg mercy in the darkness and the cold just where he sit now saturate with sunlight and with life he gaze across the mile of shine water which separate the castle from the land and try to realize how the irish servant-girl swam from the island with a infant lynott on she back and save the name from perish how the snow must have beat in she face and the lake-waves choke she breath it be a great story but the girl shout from the water 's edge remind he that he be out to pull a oar and not to sentimentalize he and the canon rise half smile half sighing and take they place in the boat they penetrate before luncheon time to a bay hitherto unknown to the beecher a chorus of delight greet its discovery the water shone bright green and very clear above the slab of white limestone the shore far inland be almost verdure-less broad flat rock lay bake in the sunshine and only the scantiest grass struggle up between they edge sometimes they overlap each other and rise uke a immense staircase fifty yard or so from the land be a tiny island entirely overgrow with stunt bush the boat be push up to it and a landing-place seek but the shrub be too thick and it be decide to picnic among the rock on the land then marion in the bow make a discovery a causeway about a foot under water lead from the island to the shore the whole party lean over to examine it every stone be visible in the clear water and it be obvious that it have be plan and build and be no merely accidental formation of the rock the canon have hear of a similar device resort to by a island hermit to insure the privacy of he cell hyacinth speak vaguely of the settlement of primitive community of lake-dweller the three boy plan a expedition across the causeway after luncheon ` we 'll carry we shoe and stocking with we ' they say ` and then explore the island perhaps there be a hermit there still or a primitive lake-dweller what be a primitive lake-dweller mr conneally ' hyacinth be uncertain but hazard a suggestion that the lake-dweller be the people who bury each other in rath the canon whose archaeology do not go back beyond st patrick offer no correction tea be make later on in yet another bay this time on the eastern shore of the lake a oak wood grow down almost to the water 's edge and the branch overhang a sandy beach more golden than any sea-strand the whole party collect dead wood and broken twig for the fire then while the girl unpack the basket and secure the kettle amidst the smoke hyacinth lay back luxuriously and watch the sun set behind the round-shouldered mountain opposite the long steep slope shine bright green while the sun still rest in view above the summit then suddenly when the topmost rim of it have dip out of sight the whole mountainside turn purple and a glory of gold and crimson hung above it on the motionless streak of cloud slowly the splendor fade the purple turn gray and a faint breeze flutter across the lake the day be the first of many which hyacinth give to such expedition the work of mr quinn 's office be not so press as to necessitate he spending every day there when he be in ballymoy and a holiday be always obtainable the lake scenery remain vivid in he memory in after-year and have its influence upon he even while he enjoy it unconscious of anything except the present pleasure there be something besides the innocent gaiety of the girl and the simple sincerity of the canon 's platitude something about the lake itself which remove he to a spiritual region utterly remote from the fiery atmosphere of miss goold 's patriotism many thing which once loom very large before he sink to insignificance as he drink to the full of the desolation around he the past in which no doubt man strive and hope hate and love and fear have leave the just recognisable ruin of some castle and the causeway build by a unknown hermit or the prehistoric lake-dweller a few thatched cabin faintly smoking and here and there a cairn of stone gather laboriously off the wretched field be the evidence of present activity now and then a man hoot to he dog as it bark at the sheep on the hillside or a girl drive a turf-laden donkey inland from the boggy shore otherwise there be no sign of human life a deep sense of monotony and inevitableness settle down upon hyacinth he come for the first time under the great enchantment which paralyze the spirit and energy of the celt he know himself to be as he people be capable of spasm of enthusiasm the victim of transitory burning of soul but the curse be upon he -- the inevitable curse of feeling too keenly and see too clearly to be strenuous and constant the flame would die down the enthusiasm would vanish -- it be vanish from he as he know well -- and leave he not indeed content with common life but patient of it and to the very end sad with the sense of possibility unrealized yet it be not without many struggle and period of return to the older emotion that hyacinth surrender he enthusiasm there still recur to he memory of he father 's vision of a armageddon and the conception of he own part in it sometimes wake very early in the morning he become vividly conscious of he own feebleness of will and he fall away from great purpose the conviction that he be call to struggle for ireland 's welfare to sacrifice if necessary he life and happiness for ireland be strong in he still he feel himself affect profoundly by the influence which surround he but he have not cease to believe that the idea of self-sacrificing labor be for he a high vocation he writhe he limb twist involuntarily when these thought beset he and often he be surprise to discover that he be actually utter aloud word of self-reproach then he would write fiercely brutally catch at the excuse of some hypocrisy or corruption or else denounce selfishness and easy-going patriotic sentiment finding subject for he satire in himself he article bring he letter of praise from miss goold ` you have it ' she write once ` the thing we all seek for the power of beat red-hot think into sword-blade write more like the last ' but the praise always come late the violent mood the self-reproach the bitterness be past he life be wrapt round again with softer influence and he read he own word with shame when they reach he in print afterwards for a while if he write at all it be of the peasant life of quaint custom half-forgotten legend and folklore these article appear too but bring no praise from miss goold once she reproach he when he lapse into gentleness for many consecutive week ` you ought not to waste yourself there be fifty man and woman can do the sort of thing you be do now we do not want you to take it up it be fight man we need not maunder sentimentalist ' chapter xvii it be during the second year of hyacinth 's residence in ballymoy that the station-master at clogher die the poor man catch a cold one February night while wait for a train which have break down three mile outside he station from the cold come first pneumonia and then the end now far to the east of clogher on a different branch of the railway-line be a town with which the people of mayo have no connection whatever in it be a very flourishing masonic lodge almost every male protestant in the town and the neighborhood belong to it and the rector of the parish be its chaplain among its member at that time be a intelligent young man who occupy the position of goods clerk on the railway the masonic brethren as in duty bind use they influence to secure he promotion and bring considerable pressure to bear on the director of the company to have he make station-master at clogher it be say with some appearance of truth that no appointment in ireland be ever make on account of the fitness of the candidate for the post to be fill whether the lord lieutenant have to nominate a local government board inspector or a urban council have to select a street scavenger the principle act on be the same no investigation be make about the ability or character of a candidate question may be ask about he political opinion he religious creed and sometimes about the social position of he wife but no one care in the least about he ability the matter really turn upon the amount of influence which he can bring to bear so it happen that john crawford freemason and protestant be appoint station-master at clogher of course nobody really care who get the post except a few senior of john crawford 's who want it for themselves probably even they would have stop grumble after a month or two if it have not happen that a lead weekly newspaper then at the height of its popularity and influence be just inaugurate a crusade against protestant and freemason the case of john crawford become the subject of a series of bitter and vehement article it be point out that although roman catholic be beyond all question more intelligent better educate and more upright than protestant they be condemn by the intolerance of highly-paid official to remain hewer of wood and drawer of water it be show by figure which admit of no controversy that irish railway bank and trading company be without exception on the verge of bankruptcy entirely owe to the apathy of shareholder who allow they interest to be sacrifice to the bigotry of director it be urge that a public meeting should be hold at clogher to protest against the new appointment the meeting be convene and father fahey consent to occupy the chair he be support by a dispensary doctor anxious to propitiate the board of guardian with a view to obtain a summer holiday a lead publican who have a son at maynooth a grazier who dread the possible partition of he ranch by the congested district board and mr o'reilly who see a hope of draw custom from the counter of he rival draper the scotchman father fahey open the proceedings with a speech he assure he audience that he be not actuate by any spirit of religious bigotry or intolerance he wish well to he protestant fellow-countryman and hope that in the bright future which lay before ireland man of all creed would be unite in work for the common good of they country these sentiment be not receive with vociferous applause the audience be perfectly well aware that something much more to the point be come and reserve they cheer father fahey do not disappoint they he proceed to show that the appointment of the new station-master be a deliberate insult to the faith of the inhabitant of clogher ` be we ' he ask ` to submit tamely to have the worst evil of the old ascendancy revive in we midst ' he be follow by the dispensary doctor who also begin by declare he freedom from bigotry he confuse the issue slightly by complain that the new station-master be entirely ignorant of the irish language it be perfectly well know that in private life the doctor be in the habit of express the greatest contempt for the gaelic league and that he could not if he life depend on it have translate even mr o'reilly 's advertisement but he speech be greet with tumultuous cheer he proceed to harrow the feeling of he audience by describe what he have hear at the railway-station one evening while wait for the train as he pace the platform he attention be attract by the sound of a piano in the station-master 's house he listen and to he amazement and disgust hear the tune of a popular song ' a song ' -- he bring down he fist on the table as he utter the awful indictment -- ` import from england ' ' i ask ' he go on -- ' i ask we venerated and beloved parish priest i ask you father of innocent family i ask every right-thinking patriot in this room be we ear to be insult we moral corrupt we intellect depraved by sound like these ' he close he speech by propose a resolution require the railway company to withdraw the obnoxious official from they midst the oratory of the grazier who second the resolution be not inferior it fill he heart with a sense of shame so he say to think of he cattle poor innocent beast of the field be handle by a protestant they have be breed these bullock of he by catholic feed by catholic be own by a catholic buy with catholic money at the fair and yet they be tell that in all ireland no catholic could be discover fit to put they into a train neither the resolution itself nor the heart-rending appeal of the grazier produce the slightest effect on the railway company john crawford continue to sell ticket even to father fahey himself and appear entirely unconcerned by the fuss about a fortnight after the meeting hyacinth spend a night in clogher mr holywell the cigarette man happen to be in the hotel and as usual get through a good deal of desultory conversation while he drink he whisky-and-water quite unexpectedly and apropo of nothing that have be say he plump out the question : ` what religion be you conneally ' the inquiry be such a unusual one and come so strangely from mr holywell who have always seem a gallio in matter spiritual that hyacinth hesitate ` i be a baptist myself ' he go on apparently with a view to palliate he inquisitiveness by a show of candor ' i find it a very convenient sort of religion in connaught there be not a single place of worship belong to my denomination in the whole province so i be always able to get my sunday to myself i do not want to convert you to anything or to argue with you but i have a fancy that you be a church of ireland protestant ' hyacinth admit the correctness of the guess and wonder what be come next ` ever spend a Sunday here ' ` never ' say hyacinth ' i always get back home for the end of the week if i can ' ` ah well do you know if i be you i should spend next Sunday here and go to mass ' ' i shall not do anything of the sort ' ` well it be you own affair of course only i just think i should do it if i be you good-night ' ` wait a minute ' say hyacinth ' i want to know what you mean ' mr holywell sit down again heavily ` be round you customer here lately ' ` no i only arrive this evening and have do nothing yet i mean to go round they to-morrow ' ` you may just as well go home by the early train for all the good you 'll do ' hyacinth restrain himself with a effort he reflect that he be more likely to get at the meaning of these mysterious warning if he refrain from direct question after a minute of two of silence mr hollywell go on : ` they have a meeting here a little while ago about the appointment of a protestant station-master they do not take much by it so far as the railway company be concerned but i happen to know that word have go round that every shopkeeper in the town be to order he goods as far as possible from catholic now everybody know you boss be a protestant but the people be a little uncertain about you they have never see you at mass which be suspicious but on the other hand the way you gas on about irish manufacture make they think you can not be a protestant the proper thing for you to do be to lie low till you have put in a appearance at mass and then go round and try for order ' ` that be the kind of thing ' say hyacinth ` that i could not do if i have no religion at all but it happen that i have conviction of a sort and i do not mean to go against they ' ` oh well as i say before it be you own affair only better protestant than you have do as much why i do it myself constantly and everyone know that a baptist be the strongest kind of protestant there be ' this reasoning curiously enough prove unconvincing ' i can not believe ' say hyacinth ` that a religious boycott of the kind be possible people will not be such fool as to act clean against they own interest consider that nine-tenth of the drapery goods in the country come from england and be sell by protestant traveller i do not see how the shopkeeper could act as you say ' ` oh of course they will not act against they own interest i have never come across a religion yet that make man do that they will not attempt to boycott the english firm because as you say they could not but they can boycott you everything you boss make be turn out just as well and just as cheap or cheaper by the nun at robeen perhaps you do not know that these holy lady have hire a traveller well they have and he be a middling smart man too -- quite smart enough to play the trump that be put into he hand and he be get a fine flush of they now what with the way that wretched rag of a paper which start all the fuss go on rampage and the amount of feeling that be get up over the station-master the peaceablest people in the place would be afraid to deal with a protestant at the present moment the robeen man have the game in he own hand and i be bind to say he would be a fool if he do not play it for all it be worth i would do it myself if i be in he shoe ' hyacinth discover next day that mr holywell have sum up the situation very accurately no point-blank question be ask about he religion but he could by no means persuade he customer to give he even a small order every shop-window be fill with goods placard ostentatiously as ` make in robeen ' every counter have tweeds blanket and flannel from the same factory no one be in the least uncivil to he and no one assign any plausible reason for refuse to deal with he he be simply bow out as quickly as possible from every shop he enter he return home disgusted and irritated and tell he tale to he employer mr quinn recognize the danger that threaten he for the first time he admit that he business be be seriously injure by the competition of robeen he take hyacinth into he confidence more fully than he have ever do before and explain what seem to be a hopeful plan ' i may tell you conneally that i have very little capital to fall back upon in my business year ago when thing be better than they be now i have a few thousand put by but most of it go on buy my brother albert 's share of the mill lately i have not be able to save and at the present moment i can lay hand on very little money still i have something and what i mean to do be this : i shall give up all idea of make a profit for the present i shall even sell my goods at a slight loss and try to beat the nunnery out of the market i think this religious animosity will weaken after a while and if we offer the cheapest goods we must in the end get back we customer ' hyacinth be not so sanguine ` you forget ' he say ` that these people have government money at they back and be likely to get more of it if you sell at a loss they will do so too and ask for a new grant from the congested district board to make good they deficiency ' mr quinn sigh ` that be quite possible ' he say ` but what can i do i must make a fight for my business ' hyacinth hesitate ` perhaps i have no right to make the suggestion but it seem to I that you be bind to be beat would it not be better to give in at once do not risk the money you have safe keep it and try to sell the mill and the business ' ' i shall hold on ' say mr quinn ` ought you not to think of you wife remember what it will mean to she if you be beat in the end when you savings be go and you business unsaleable ' for a moment there be sign of waver in mr quinn 's face the finger of he hand twist in and out of each other and a pitiable look of great distress come into he eye then he unclasp he hand and place they flat on the table before he ' i shall hold on ' he say ' i shall not close my mill while i have a shilling leave to pay my worker with ' ` well ' say hyacinth ` it be for you to decide at least you can count on my do my best my very best ' chapter xviii mr quinn carry on he struggle for nearly a year although from the very first he might have recognize its hopelessness time after time hyacinth make he tour and visit the shopkeeper who have once be he customer occasionally he succeed in obtain order and a faint gleam of hope encourage he but he have no steady success mr quinn 's original estimate of the situation be so far justified that after a while the religious animosity die out shopkeeper even explain apologetically that they give they order to the robeen convent for purely commercial reason ` they goods be cheaper than yours and that be the truth mr conneally ' hyacinth recognize that mr quinn be be beat at he own game he have attempt to drive the nun out of the market by undersell they and now it appear that they too be prepare to face a loss it be obvious that they loss must be great much greater than mr quinn 's rumor be rife of large loan raise by the mother superior of mortgage on the factory building and the machinery these story bring very little consolation for as hyacinth know mr quinn be very nearly at the end of he resource he refuse to borrow ` when i be force to close up ' he say ' i shall do so with a clear balance-sheet i have no wish for bankruptcy ' ' i should like ' say hyacinth vindictively ` to see the reverend mother reduce to pay a shilling in the pound ' ' i be afraid ' say mr quinn ` you will not see that the convent be a branch of a immense organization no doubt if it come to a pinch fund will be forthcoming ' ` yes and they will not draw on they own purse till they have get all they can out of the congested district board i have no doubt they be count on another four thousand pound to start they clear when they have beat you ' one day quite accidentally hyacinth come by a piece of information about the working of the robeen factory which startle he he be travel home by rail it happen to be Friday and as usual in the early summer the train be crowd with emigrant on they way to queenstown the familiar melancholy crowd wait on every platform old woman weep openly and man with face ridiculously screw and pucker in the effort to restrain the rise tear cling to they son and daughter pitiful little box and carpet bag be pile on the platform friend cling to hand outstretch through the carriage-window while the train move slowly out then come the long mournful wail from those leave behind and the last waving of farewell at the robeen station the crowd be no less than elsewhere the carriage set apart for the emigrant be full and at the last minute two girl be hustle into the compartment where hyacinth sit a woman they mother mumble and slobber over they hand a old man too old to be they father shout broken benediction to they two young man -- lover perhaps or brother -- stand red-eyed desolate and helpless without speak after the train have start hyacinth look at the girl one of they a pretty creature of perhaps eighteen year old weep quietly in the corner of the carriage beside she lay she carpet bag and a brown shawl on she lap be a orange and she hold a crumpled paper bag of biscuit in she hand there be nothing unusual about she she be just one instance of heartbreak the heart-break of a whole nation which love home as no other people have ever love it and yet be doom as it seem inevitably to leave it she be just one more waif throw into the whirlpool of the great world to toil and struggle succeed barrenly or pitifully fail but through it all through even the possible loss of faith and ultimate degradation fate to cling to a love for the gray desolate fatherland the other girl be different hyacinth look at she with intense interest she be the older of the two and not so pretty as she sister she face be thin and pale and a broad scar under one ear show where a surgeon 's knife have cut she sit with she hand fold on she lap gaze dry-eyed out of the window beside she there be no sign of sorrow on she face nothing but a kind of sulky defiance after a while she take the paper bag out of she sister 's hand open it and begin to eat the gingerbread biscuit it contain hyacinth speak to she but she turn she head away and would not answer he he voice seem to rouse the younger sister who stop cry and look at he curiously he try again and this time he speak in irish at once the younger girl brighten and answer he apparently she have no fear that malice could lurk in the heart of a man who speak she own language in a few minute she be chat to he as if he be a old friend he learn that the two girl be on they way to new york they have a sister there who have send they the price of they ticket yes the sister be in a situation be get good wages and have clothes ` as grand as a lady 's ' she have send home a photograph at christmas-time which they mother have show all round the parish these two be to get situation also as soon as they arrive oh yes there be no doubt of it : bridgy have promise there be four of they leave at home -- three boy and a girl no doubt in time they would all follow bridgy to america -- all but seuma he be to have the farm no the girl could not get marry because they father be too poor to give they fortune there be nothing for they but to go to america but they mother have not want they to go the clergy and the nun be against the girl go indeed they nearly have they persuade to send bridgy 's money back ` but onny be set on go ' she glance at she sister in the corner of the carriage hyacinth turn to she ` why do you want to leave ireland ' but onny remain silent sulky at it seem it be the younger girl who answer he ` they say it be a fine life they have out there there be good money to be earn and might not we be come home some day with a fortune ' ` but be not you sorry to leave ireland ' again he look at the elder girl and this time be reward with a flash of defiant bitterness from she eye ` sorry be it no but i be glad ' ` onny be always say that there be nothing to be earn in the factory and she get more than the rest of we be not she the first girl that sister mary aloysius pick out of the school when the young lady from england come over to teach we she be the best worker they have ' ` it be true what she say ' say onny ' i be the best worker they have i work for they for three year and all i be get at the end of it be six shilling a week why would i be work for that when i might be get wages like bridgy 's in america what sense would there be in it ' ` but why do you work for such wages ' ` well now ' say the younger girl ` how could we be refuse the reverend mother when she come round the town herself and give warn that we would all be want ' ` there be few ' continued onny without notice she sister ` that earn as much as i do many a girl work there and have no more than one and ninepence to take home at the end of the week ' hyacinth begin to understand how it be that mr quinn be be hopelessly beat this be no struggle between two trade rival to be win by the side with the longer purse nor be it simply a fight between a independent manufacturer and a firm feed with government bounty mr quinn 's rival could count on a unlimited supply of labor at starvation wages while he have to hire man and woman at the market value of they service he have be sorry for the two girl when they get into the train now he feel almost glad that they be leave ireland it appear that they have certainly choose the wiser part he arrive at home dejected and sit down beside the fire in he room to give himself up to complete despair he find no hope anywhere irish patriotism so he see it be a matter of word and fine phrase no one really believe in it or would venture anything for it politics be a game at which sharper cheat each other and the people the leader be bold only in sordid personal quarrel the mass of the people be utterly untouched by the idea of nationality in earnest about nothing but huckster and petty gain over all be the grip of a foreign bureaucracy and a selfish church tighten slowly squeeze out the nation 's life grasp and hold fast its wealth no man any longer make any demand except to be allow to earn what would buy whisky enough to fuddle he into temporary forgetfulness of the present misery and the imminent tyranny the slatternly maid-servant who bring he he meal and make he bed tap at the door ` please sir jimmy loughlin 's after come with a letter from mr quinn and he be wait to know if you 'll go ' hyacinth read the note which ask he to call on he employer that afternoon ` tell he i 'll be there ' ` will you have you dinner before you go the chop be in the pan below or will i keep they till you come back ' ` oh i have time enough bring they as soon as they be cook and for goodness ' sake see that the potato be properly boil ' he take up a great english weekly paper with copy of which canon beecher supply he at irregular interval and prop it against the dish-cover while he eat the article which catch he attention be head ` angel in connaught ' it contain a idealized account of the work of the robeen nun from whose shoulder it seem to the writer likely that wing would soon sprout there be a description of the once miserable cabin now transform into homestead so comfortable that english labourer would not disdain they the people share in the elevation of they surroundings man and woman lately half-naked savage starve and ignorant have rise in the scale of civilization and intelligence to a level which almost equal that of a hampshire villager the double stream of emigration to the united state and migration to the english harvest-field be stop a earthly paradise have be create in a howling wilderness by the self-denying labor of the holy lady aid by the statesmanlike liberality of the congested district board there be another page of the article but hyacinth could stand no more he stand up and glance at he watch it be already nearly five o'clock he push he way down the street where the country-people have complete they week 's marketing be load donkey on the footpath or cart push backwards against the kerbstone woman drag they heavily-intoxicated husband from the public-house and girl damp and bedraggled stand in group wait for they parent he turn into the gloomy archway of the mill unlock the iron gate and cross the yard into the quinn ' garden the lamp burn brightly in the dining-room and he could see mr quinn in she chair by the fireside sew she child sit on the rug at she foot he see they face turn up to hers gravely intent no doubt she be tell they some story he stand for a minute and watch they while the peaceful joy of the scene enter into he heart this no doubt a home full of such love and peace be the best thing life have get to give it be god 's most precious benediction ` lo thus shall a man be bless who feareth the lord ' he turn and pass on to the door the servant show he in not as he expect to the sitting-room he have just gaze at but to mr quinn 's study it be a desolate chamber a plain wooden desk like a schoolmaster 's stand in one corner and upon it a feeble lamp a bookcase surmount a row of cupboard along one wall its contents -- hyacinth have often look over they -- be a many-volumed encyclopedia macaulay 's ` history of england ' foxe 's ` book of martyr ' a series entitle ` hero of the reformation ' and some bind volume of a trade journal above the chimneypiece hang two trout-rod a landing-net and a old gun the grate be tireless it be a room obviously not love by its owner neither pleasure nor comfort be look for in it it be simply a place of escape from the attraction of quiet ease when business overflow the proper office hour mr quinn rise from he desk when hyacinth enter ' i be very glad to see you ' he say ' i want to have a talk with you ' hyacinth wait while he arrange and rearrange some papers on the desk in front of he mr quinn although he have specially send for hyacinth seem in no hurry to get to the subject of the interview when he do speak it be evident from he tone that the important topic be still postpone ` how do you get on this week ' hyacinth have nothing good to report he take from he pocket the note-book in which he enter he order and go over it it contain a attenuate list moreover the harvest have be bad and old debt very difficult to collect mr quinn listen apparently not very attentively and when the reading be over say : ` what you report this week be simply a repetition of the story of the last six month i do not expect it to be different it make the decision i have to make a little more inevitable that be all mr conneally we have be very good friend and since you have be in my employment i have be satisfy with you in every way now i be unable to employ you any longer i be give up my business ' hyacinth make a effort to speak but mr quinn hold up he hand and silence he ` this week ' he continue ' i receive news which settle the matter for I jameson and thorpe the big draper in dublin be my best customer for certain goods last Monday they write that they have a offer of blanket at a figure a long way below mine i do not believe that article equal in quality to mine could be produce at the price and write a hint to that effect i receive -- nothing could have be more courteous -- a sample of the blanket offer well i admit that it be at least equal to what i could supply in every way i write again ask as a favor to be supply with the name of the compete firm i get the answer to-day mr thorpe write himself the robeen convent have undersell I ' hyacinth make another attempt to speak ` let I finish ' say mr quinn ' i have foresee of course that this be come i have no more capital to fall back upon i do not mean to run into debt there be nothing for I but to dismiss my employées and shut up ' ` yes ' say hyacinth ` and then -- ' he know he have no right to ask a question about the future but the thought of mr quinn and she child as he have see they in the dining-room almost force he to inquire what be to happen to they a spasm of extreme pain cross mr quinn 's face ` you be think of my wife it will be hard -- yes very hard she love this place she friend here she garden and all the quiet peaceful life we have live well there be to be a end of it but do not look so desperate ' he force himself to smile as he speak ` we shall not starve or go to the workhouse i have a knowledge of woollen goods if i have nothing else and i dare say i can get a appointment as foreman or traveller for some big drapery house but i may not be reduce to that there be a secretary want just now in the office of one of the dublin charitable society i mean to apply for the post canon beecher and we bishop be both member of the committee and i be sure will do they best for I the salary be not princely -- a hundred and twenty pound a year i think but there i ought not to be talk all this time about myself i must try and do something for you ' ` never mind I ' say hyacinth ' i shall be all right but i can not bear to think of you and mr quinn poverty like that in dublin have you think what it mean a shabby little house in a crowded street off at the back of somewhere dirt and stuffiness and vulgarity all around you she can not be expect to stand it -- or you either ' ` my dear boy ' say mr quinn ` my wife and i have be try all we life to be christian shall we receive good at the lord 's hand and not evil also however it may be with I i know that she will not fail in the trial ' he face light up as he speak and the smile on it be no longer force but clear and brave hyacinth know that he be once again in the presence of that mysterious power which enable man and woman to meet and conquer loss and pain against which every kind of misfortune beat in vain he eye fill with tear as he take mr quinn 's hand and bid he good-night chapter xix hyacinth have three month ' work to do before he actually leave mr quinn 's employment he know that at the end of that time he would be leave absolutely without income and that it be necessary for he to look out for some other situation he reckon up the remains of he original capital and find himself with little more than a hundred pound to fall back upon yet he do nothing from time to time he bestir himself ponder the newspaper advertisement of vacant situation and mentally resolve to commence he search at once always some excuse offer itself to justify put the unpleasant business off and he allow himself to slip back into the quiet routine of life as if no catastrophe threaten he he be indeed far more troubled about the quinn ' future than he own and when at the end of April canon beecher return from dublin with the news that he have secure the secretaryship of the church of ireland scriptural school society for mr quinn hyacinth feel that he mind be relieve of a great anxiety that no such post have be discover for he do not cost he a think in spite of he spasmodic effort to goad himself into a condition of reasonable anxiety for he future there remain half consciously present in he mind a conviction that somehow a way of get sufficient food and clothes would offer itself in due time the conviction be justify by the event it be on Saturday evening that the canon return with he good news and on Sunday morning hyacinth receive a letter from miss goold ` you have no doubt hear ' she write ` that we have get a new editor for the croppy -- patrick o'dwyer mary 's brother of course you remember mary and she unpoetical hysteric the morning after the rotunda meet the new editor be a splendid man he have be on the staff of a new york paper for the last five year and thoroughly understand the whole business but that be not the best of he he hate england worse than i do i be only a child beside he burst out into fit of temper now and then and cool off again he hate steadily quietly and intensely but even that be not all that be to be say he have get brain -- brain enough my dear hyacinth to make fool of you and I every day and all day long he have devise a new policy for ireland the plan be simplicity itself like all really great plan and it _ must _ succeed i will not go into it now because i want you to come up to dublin and see o'dwyer he tell I that he need somebody else besides himself on the staff of the _ croppy _ which by the way be to be enlarged and improve he want a man who can write a column a week in irish as well as a article now and then in good strong plain english i suggest you name to he and show he some of the article you have write he be greatly please with the one about o'dowd 's cheap patriotism and like one or two of the other he just ask one question about you : do mr conneally hate england and the empire and everything english from the parliament to the police barrack it be this hatred which must animate the work i say i think you do i tell he how you have volunteer to fight for the boer and about the day you nearly kill that blackguard shea he seem to think that be good enough and ask I to write to you on the subject we can not offer you a big salary the editor himself be only to get a hundred pound a year for the present and i be guarantee another hundred for you i be confident that i sha not have to pay it for more than six month the paper be sure to go as it never go before and in a few year we shall be able to treble o'dwyer 's salary and double yours nothing like such a chance have ever offer itself in irish history before everything go to show that this be we opportunity england be weaker than she have be for century be cling desperately to the last tatters of she old prestige she have not a single statesman capable of think or act vigorously she parliament be the laughingstock of europe she irish policy may be sum up in four word -- intrigue with the vatican in ireland the power of the faithful garrison be go the protestant in the north be sick of be fool by one english party after another the landlord or what be left of they be begin to discover that they have be buy and sell the bishop england 's last line of defense be overreach themselves and we be within measurable distance of the day when the church will be put into she proper place there be not so much as a shoneen publican in a country town leave who believe in the ranting of o'rourke and he litter of blind whelp ireland be simply cry out for light and lead and the _ croppy _ be go to give both you always want to serve ireland now i be offer you the chance i do not say you ought to thank I though you will thank I to the day of you death i do not say that you have a opportunity of become a great man i know you and i know a better way of make sure of you than that i say to you hyacinth conneally that we want you -- just _ you _ and nobody else ireland want you ' the letter especially the last part of it be sufficiently ridiculous to have move hyacinth to a smile but it do no such thing on the contrary its rhetoric excited and touch he the flattery of the final sentence elate he the absurdity of the idea that ireland need he a fifth-rate office clerk a out-of-work commercial traveller who have fail to sell blanket and flannel do not strike he at all the figure of augusta goold rise to he mind she flash before he a apocalyptic angel splend and terrible trumpet-calling he to the last great fight he forget in a instant the quinn and they trouble the year of quietness in ballymoy the daily intercourse with gentle people the atmosphere of the religion in which he have live fall away from he suddenly he sit absorb in a ecstasy of joyful excitement until the jangling of canon beecher 's church bell recall he to common life again it speak for the strength of the habit he have form in ballymoy that he rise without hesitation and go to take he part in the morning service he sit down as usual beside marion beecher and she harmonium he listen to she playing until she father enter he find himself gaze at she when she stand up for the opening word of the service he feel himself strangely affect by the gentleness of she face and the slender beauty of she form when she kneel down he could not take he eye off she there come over he a inexplicable soften a relaxation of the tense excitement of the morning he think of she kneel there in the fade shabby church Sunday after Sunday for year and year when he be work at hot pressure far away he know just how she eye would look calmly trustfully up to the god she speak to how she soul would grow in gentleness how love would be the very atmosphere around she and all the while he would struggle and fight with no inspiration except a bitter hate suddenly there come on he a feeling that he could not leave she the very think of separation be a fierce pain a desire of she seize on he like uncontrollable physical hunger wherever he might be whatever life might have in store for he he know that he heart would go back to she restlessly and remain unsatisfied without she he understand that he love she canon beecher 's voice come to he as if from a immense distance : ' o god make speed to save we ' then he hear very clearly marion 's sweet voice reply : ' o lord make haste to help we ' there be a faint shuffling and the congregation rise to they foot he eye be still on marion and now he whole body quiver with the force of he newly-found love she half turn and look at he for one instant they eye meet and he see in hers a flash of recognition then a strange look of fear and she turn away from he flush and tremble he see that she have read he heart and know he love ` glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost ' read the canon heavily hyacinth 's heart swell in he he whole be seem to throb with exultation and he respond in a voice he could not recognize for he ` as it be in the beginning be now and ever shall be world without end aman ' marion stand silent she head be bow down and she hand clasp tight together of the remainder of the morning 's service hyacinth could never afterwards remember anything no doubt canon beecher read the psalm and lesson and prayer no doubt he preach probably also hymn be sing and marion play they but he could not imagine how it seem quite impossible that she could have touch the key with she finger or that she could have utter any sound yet no one have remark the absence of hymn or even notice any peculiarity in they performance not till after the service be over do he regain full consciousness of himself and he surroundings then he become exceedingly alert he watch the canon disappear into the vestry hear the congregation trample down the aisle listen to marion play a final voluntary it seem to he as he sit there wait for she to stop that she play much longer than usual he could hear mr beecher and mr quinn talk in the porch and every moment he expect the canon to appear at last the music cease and the lid of the harmonium be close and lock he step forward and take marion 's hand in he ` marion ' he say ' i love you it be only this morning that i find it out but i know -- oh i know -- that i love you far far more than i can tell you ' the hand which lay in he grow cold and the girl 's head be bow so that he could not see she face he feel she tremble ` marion marion i love you love you love you ' then very slowly she raise she head and look at he he stoop to kiss she lip and feel she face flush and glow when he touch it then she draw she hand from he and flee down the church to she mother hyacinth stand agape with wonder at the word which he have speak the knowledge of he love have come on he like a sudden gust and he only half realize what he have do he walk back to he lodgings go over and over the amazing word recall with flush astonishment the kiss then a chill doubt beset he suddenly do marion know how poor he be never in he life have the fear of poverty or the desire of gain determine hyacinth 's plan he know very well that no such consideration would have in any way affect he conduct towards marion once he realize that he love she the confession of he love be quite inevitable yet he feel vaguely that he might be judge blameworthy he have read a few novel and he know that even the writer whose chief business it be to glorify the passion of love do not dare to represent it as independent of money he know too that many penniless hero win admiration -- he do not in the least understand why they should -- by silently desert affectionate woman he know that kiss be immoral except for those who possess a modest competence these authorize ethic of marriage engagement be wholly incomprehensible to he and it in no way disquiet he conscience that he have bind marion to he with he kiss yet he feel that she have a right to know what income he hope to earn and what kind of home he would have to offer she a hundred pound a year might be deem insufficient and he know that not be either a raven or a lily he could not count on find food and clothes ready when he want they the daughter of the irish church clergy even of the dignitary be not bring up in luxury still they be most of they accustom to a daily supply of food -- plain perhaps but sufficient -- and will look for as much in the home of they husband a girl like marion beecher do not expect to secure a position which will enable she to send she own clothes to a laundress or hire a cook who can make pastry but it be not fair to ask she to wash the family 's blanket or to boil potato for a pig probably she friend would think she lucky in marry a curate or a dispensary doctor with one hundred and fifty pound a year and the prospect of one-third as much again after a while but hyacinth remember that he be poorer than any curate he determine to put the matter plainly before marion without delay the rectory door be open for he by elsie beecher and in spite of she wonder protest hyacinth walk into the dining-room and ask that marion should be send to he the room be empty as he expect he stand and wait for she derive faint comfort and courage from the threadbare carpet patch tablecloth and poor crazy chair they be strange property for a scene with possibility of deep romance in it but they make he confession of poverty easier marion enter at last and stand beside he he neither take she hand nor look at she ` when i tell you to-day that i love you ' he say ' i ought to have tell you that i be very poor ' ' i know it ' she say ` but i be poorer even than you know i be not in mr quinn 's employment any more i have no settled income and only a prospect of earn a very small one ' he pause ' i shall have to go away from ballymoy i must live in dublin i do not think it be fair to ask you to marry I i shall have no more to live upon than -- ' she move a step nearer to he and lay she hand on he arm ` look at I ' she say he raise he eye to she face and see again there as he have see in church the wonderful shine of love which be stronger than all thing and hold poverty and hardship cheap ` keep look at I still ' she say ` now tell I : do you really think it matter that you be poor do you think i care whether you have much or little tell I ' he could not answer she although he know that there be only one answer to she question ` do you think that i love money do you doubt that i love you ' she voice sink almost to a whisper as she speak and she eye fall from look into he just as when he kiss she in the church she flush suddenly but this time she do not try to escape from he instead she cling to he arm and hide she face against he shoulder he put he arm round she and hold she close ' i know ' he say ' i be a fool to come here think that my be poor would matter i might have know indeed i think i do know even before i speak to you ' she have no answer except a long soft laugh which be half smother in he arm chapter xx on Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon canon beecher enjoy the privilege of a fire in he study he be suppose to be engage at these season in the preparation of he sermon a serious and exacting work which demand solitude and profound quiet in earlier year he really have prepare he sermon painfully but long practice bring to the preacher a certain fatal facility old idea be not improve by be clothe in new phrase and of new idea -- a new idea will occasionally obtrude itself even on the christian preacher -- the canon be exceedingly mistrustful the study be a unexciting and comparatively comfortable room the firelight on winter afternoon play pleasantly on the dim gold back of the work of st augustine a fine folio edition bequeath to mr beecher by a scholarly uncle which repose undisturbed along a lower shelf adventurous ray occasionally explore a fade print of the good shepherd which hang above the book and gleam upon the handle of the safe where the parish register and church plate be store the quiet and the process of digest he mid-day dinner frequently tempt the canon to indulge in a series of pleasant nap on Sunday afternoon when hyacinth tap at the study door and enter the room be almost dark and the sermon preparation if proceed at all can have get no further than the preliminary concatenation of idea the canon however be aggressively perhaps suspiciously wide awake ` who be that ' he ask ` oh conneally it be you i be very glad to see you curiously enough i thought of go down to call on you this afternoon i want to have a talk with you i dare say you have come up to consult I ' hyacinth be astonished how could anyone have guess what he come about have marion tell she father already ` it be a sad business ' the canon go on -- ' very distressing and perplexing indeed but so far as you personally be concerned conneally i can not regard it as a unmixed misfortune you be mean for something better if i may say so than sell blanket now i have a plan for you future which i talk over last week with a old friend of yours now that something have be settle about the quinn we must all give we mind to you affair ' then hyacinth understand that canon beecher expect to be consult about he future plan and even have some scheme of he own in mind ` yes ' he reply ' i shall be very glad of you help and advice although i think i have decide about what i be go to do it be not on that subject i come to speak to you to-day but on another more important i think for you and for I and for marion ' ` for marion ' ' i ought to tell you at once that i love you daughter marion and i be sure that she love I i want to marry she ' ` my dear boy i have not the slightest idea of this it be one of the most extraordinary thing -- or perhaps extraordinary be not exactly the proper word -- one of the most surprising thing i -- ' the canon stop abruptly and sit stroke he chin with he forefinger in the effort to adjust he mind to the new situation present to it it be characteristic of the man that the thought of hyacinth 's poverty be not the first which present itself indeed canon beecher be one of those unreasonable christian who be actually convince of the truth of certain paradoxical saying in the gospel about wealth and poverty he believe that there be thing of more importance in life than the possession of money fortunately such christian be rare for they absurd creed form a standing menace to the existence of church and sect alike fortunately also ecclesiastical authority have sufficient wisdom to keep these eccentric in the background confine they as far as possible to remote and obscure place if ever a few of they escape into the open and find means of express themselves the whole machinery of modern religion will become dislocated and the church will very likely relapse into the barbarity of the apostolic age ' i believe conneally ' say the canon at last ` that you be a good man i do not merely mean that you be moral and upright but that you sincerely desire to follow in the footstep of the master ' he look as if he want some kind of answer at least a confirmation of he belief fresh from he interview with marion and have the canon 's eye upon he it do not seem impossible to hyacinth to answer yes even the thought of the work he be to engage in with miss goold and patrick o'dwyer seem to offer no ground for hesitation be he not enlist with they to take part in the great battle he have never cease to believe he father 's word : ` and the battlefield be ireland -- we dear ireland which we love ' he feel for the moment that he be altogether prepare to make the confession of faith the canon require ` yes ' he say ' i be on he side ' ` and you love marion be you quite sure of that be you certain that this be not a pass fancy ' this time hyacinth have no doubt whatever about he answer ' i be as certain of my love as i be of anything in the world ' ' i be glad i be very glad that this have happen -- for you sake because i have always like you also for marion 's sake i shall see you happy because you love one another and because you both love the lord i ask no more than those two thing but i must go and tell my wife at once she will be glad too ' he rise and go to the door with he hand stretch out to open it he stop strike by a sudden thought ` by the way i ought to ask you -- if you mean to be marry -- have you any -- i mean it be necessary -- i hope you will not think i be lay undue stress upon such matter but i really -- i mean we really ought to consider what you be to live upon ' it be the prospect of impart the news to he wife which force this speech from he mr beecher be indeed the least worldly of woman do she not marry the canon then a mere curate on the slenderest income and bear he successively five baby in defiance of common prudence but it have fall to she lot to order the affair of the household and she have learn that the people who give you bread and beef demand after a interval more or less money in exchange it be likely that after she first rapture have subside she would make some inquiry about hyacinth 's income and prospects the canon feel he ought to be prepare ` of course i have lose my position with mr quinn you know that but i have a offer of work which i hope will lead on to something better and will enable I in a short time to earn enough money to marry on you know -- or perhaps you do not for i be afraid i never tell you ' -- he remember that he have carefully conceal he connection with the _ croppy _ from he friend at ballymoy and pause -- ' i have do some little write oh nothing very much -- not a book or anything like that only a few article for the press well a friend of mine have get I the offer of a post in connection with a weekly paper it be not a very great thing in itself just now but it may improve and there be always the prospect of pick up other work of the same kind ' the canon who have never see even a abstract of one of he own sermon in print have a proper reverence for the man who guide the world 's think through the press ` that be very good conneally -- very satisfactory indeed i always know you have brain but why do you never tell I what you be do i should have be deeply interested in anything you write ' hyacinth 's conscience smite he ` the truth be that i be sure you would not approve of the paper i write for it be the _ croppy _ the organ of the extreme left wing of the nationalist party it be miss goold -- augusta goold -- who now offer I work on that paper she say -- but you have better read what she say for yourself then you will know the worst of it ' he take the letter from he pocket the canon light a candle and read it through slowly and attentively when he have finish he lay it upon the table and sit down hyacinth wait in extreme anxiety for what be to come ' i do not like the cause you mean to work for or the people you call you friend i would rather see my daughter 's husband do almost anything else in the world i would be happier if you propose to break stone upon the roadside you know what my political opinion be i regard the _ croppy _ as a disloyal and seditious paper bent upon foster a dangerous spirit ' hyacinth listen patiently he have steel himself against the hearing of some such word and be determine not to be move to argument or self-defence except as a last resort ' i hope ' he say ` that you will at least give I credit for honestly act in accordance with my conviction ' ' i be sure -- quite sure -- that you be honest and believe that you cause be the right one i recognize too though this be a very difficult thing to do that you have every right to form and hold you own political opinion it seem to I that they be very wrong and very mischievous but it be quite possible that i be mistaken and prejudiced in any case i be not call upon to refuse you my affection or to separate you from my daughter because we differ about politics ' hyacinth breathe a great sigh of relief he look at the canon in wonder and admiration it have be beyond hope that a man grow gray in a narrow faith a faith in which for century religion and politics have be inextricably blended could have rise in one clear flight above the mire of prejudice it seem even after he have speak impossible that in ireland where political opponent believe each other to be thief and murderer there could be find even one man and he from the least emancipated class of all who could understand and practice tolerance ' i say ' go on the canon speak very slowly and with evident difficulty ` that i have no right to put you away from I because of you political opinion but there be something here ' -- he touch miss goold 's letter -- ' from which i must by all means try to save you will you let I speak to you not as marion 's father not even as you friend but as christ 's ambassador set here to watch for you soul but i need not excuse myself for what i be about to say you will at least listen to I patiently ' he take up miss goold 's letter and search through it for a short time then he read aloud : ` he just ask one question about you : do mr conneally hate england and the empire and everything english from the parliament to the police barrack for it be this hatred which must animate we work i say i think you do now consider what those word mean you be to dedicate you power the talent god have give you to preach a gospel of hate this be not a question of politics i be ready to believe that in the contest of which we unhappy country be the battle-ground a man may be either on you side or mine and yet be a follower of christ it be impossible to think that anyone can deliberately with he eye open accept hatred for the inspiration of he life and still be true to he ' hyacinth be greatly move by the solemnity with which the canon speak there be that in he which witness to the truth of what he hear yet he refuse to be convince when he speak it be clear that he be not address he companion for he eye be fix upon the picture of the good shepherd faintly illuminate by the candle light he desire to order he own thought on the dilemma to justify if he could he own position to himself ` it be true that the gospel of christ be a gospel of love yet there be circumstance in which it be wrong to follow it be it possible to rouse we people out of they sordid apathy to save ireland for a place among the nation except by preach a mighty indignation against the tyranny which have crush we to the dust ' he feel that canon beecher 's eye never leave he for a moment while he speak he look up and see in they a intense plead there steal over he a desire to yield to submit himself to this appealing tenderness he defend himself desperately against he weakness ' i be not choose the pleasanter way it would be easier for I to give up the fight for ireland to desert the beaten side to forget the lose cause ' he turn to canon beecher speaking almost fiercely : ` do you think it be a small thing for I to surrender you friendship and perhaps -- perhaps to lose marion be there not _ some _ of the nobility of sacrifice in refuse to listen to you ' ' i can not argue with you no doubt you be cleverer than i be but i _ know _ this -- god be love and only he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in god ' ` but i do love : i love ireland ' ` ah yes but he say love you enemy ' ` then ' say hyacinth ' i will not have he for my god ' hardly have he speak than he start and grow suddenly cold it be no doubt some trick of memory but he believe that he hear very faintly from far off a remembered voice : ` will you be sure to know the good side from the bad the captain from the enemy ' they be the last word he father have say to he they have pass unregarded when they be speak but linger unthought of in some recess of he memory now they come on he full of mean insistent for a answer ` you have choose ' say the canon he have choose could he be sure that he have choose right that he know the good side from the bad ` you have choose and i have no more to say only before it become impossible for you and I to kneel together i ask you to let I pray with you once more you can do this because you still believe he hear we although you have decide to walk no more with he ' they kneel together and hyacinth numbly indifferent feel he hand grasp and hold ' o christ ' say canon beecher ` this child of thine have choose to live by hatred rather than by love do thou therefore remove love from he lest it prove a hindrance to he on the way on which he go let the memory of the cross be blot out from he mind so that he may do successfully that which he desire ' hyacinth wrench he hand free from the grasp which hold it and fling himself forward across the table at which they kneel except for he sob and he choke effort to subdue they there be silence in the room canon beecher rise from he knee and stand watch he he lip move with unspoken supplication at last hyacinth also rise and stand calm suddenly ` you have conquer I ' he say ` my son my son this be joy indeed all along i know he could not fail you but i have not conquer you the lord jesus have save you ' ' i do not know ' say hyacinth slowly ` whether i have be save or lose i be not sure even now that i know the good side from the bad but i do know that i can not live without the hope of be love by he whether it be the better part to which i resign myself i can not tell no doubt he know as for I if i have be force to make a great betrayal if i be to live hereafter very basely -- and i think i be -- at least i have not cut myself off from the opportunity of loving he ' chapter xxi canon beecher take no notice of hyacinth 's last speech he have return with amazing swiftness and ease from the region of high emotion to the commonplace excursion to the shine peak of mystical experience be for most man so rare that the glory leave they with dazzle eye and they walk stumblingly for a while along the dull road of the world but canon beecher in the course of he plead with hyacinth have be only in place very well know to he the presence chamber of the king be to he also the room of a familiar friend it be no breathless descent from the green hill of the cross to the thoroughfare of common life ` now my dear boy ' he say ` we really must go and talk to my wife and marion besides i must tell you the plan i have make for you -- the plan i be just go to speak about when you put it out of my head with the news of you love-making ' for hyacinth a great effort be necessary before he could get back to he normal state he hand be tremble violently he forehead and hair be damp with sweat he whole body be intensely cold he mind be confuse and he listen to what be say to he with only the vaguest apprehension of its mean the canon lay a firm hand upon he arm and lead he away from the study in the passage he stop and ask hyacinth to go back and blow out the candle which still burn on the study table ` and just put some turf on the fire ' he add ' i do not want it to go out ' the pause enable hyacinth to regain he self-command and the performance of the perfectly ordinary act require of he help to bring he back again to common life when they enter the drawing-room it be evident that mr beecher have already hear the news and be in fact discuss the matter eagerly with marion she spring up and hasten across the room to meet they ' i be so glad ' she say -- ` so delighted i be sure you and marion will be happy together ' she take hyacinth 's hand in hers and hold they while she speak then draw nearer to he and look up in he face expectantly a fearful suspicion seize he that on a occasion of the kind she might consider it right to kiss he it be with the greatest difficulty that he suppress a wholly unreasonable impulse to laugh aloud apparently the need of such affectionate stimulant be strong in mr beecher when hyacinth hang back she leave he for she husband put she arm round he neck and kiss he heartily on both cheek ` be not it fortunate ' she say ` that you see dr henry last week while you be in dublin you little think how important that talk with he be go to turn out -- i mean of course important for we it always be important for mr -- i mean for hyacinth ' the canon seem a little embarrassed he clear he throat somewhat unnecessarily and then say : ' i have not mention that matter yet ' ` not mention dr henry 's offer then what have you be talk about all this time ' it do not seem necessary to tell mr beecher all that have be say or to repeat the scene in the study for she benefit the canon clear he throat again ' i be in dublin last week attend a meeting of the scriptural school society and i meet dr henry we be talk about the quinn i tell you that mr quinn be to be the new secretary of the society do not i dr henry know mr quinn slightly and be greatly interested in he you name naturally be mention dr henry seem to have take a warm interest in you when you be in college and to have a very high opinion of you ability he do not know what have become of you and be very pleased to hear that you be a friend of ours ' hyacinth know at once what be come -- know what canon beecher 's plan for he future be and why he be please with it understand how mr beecher come to describe this conversation with dr henry as fortunate he wait for the rest of the recital vaguely surprise at he own want of feeling ' i tell he ' the canon go on eye hyacinth doubtfully ` that you have lose you employment here i hope you do not object to my have mention that i be sure you would not if you have hear how sympathetically he speak of you he assure I that he be most anxious to help you in any way in he power he just ask one question about you ' hyacinth start where have he hear those identical word before oh yes they be in miss goold 's letter patrick o'dwyer also have just ask one question about he he smile faintly as the canon go on : ` be he fit spiritually fit to be ordain for it be the desire to serve god which must animate we work i say i think you be i tell he how you sing in we choir here and how fond you seem of we quiet life and what a good fellow you be you see i do not know then that i be praise the man who be to be my son-in-law he ask I to remind you of a promise he have once make and to say that he be ready to fufil it i understand he to mean that he would recommend you to any bishop you like for ordination ' hyacinth remain silent he feel that in surrender he work for the _ croppy _ he surrender also he right to make any choice he be ready to be shepherd into any position like a sheep into a pen and he have no particular wish to resist he see a simple satisfaction in mr beecher 's face and a beautiful joy in marion 's eye it be impossible for he to disappoint they he smile a response to mr beecher 's kindly triumph ` be not that splendid now you and marion will be able to be marry quite soon and i do dislike long engagement of course you will be very poor at first but no poorer than we be and marion be not afraid of be poor -- be you dear ' ` that be just what i have be say to he ' say marion ` be not it hyacinth of course i be not afraid i have always say that if i ever marry i should like to marry a clergyman and if one do that one be sure to be poor ' evidently there be no doubt in either of they mind that hyacinth would accept dr henry 's offer nor have he any doubt himself the thing seem too inevitable to be anything but right only on canon beecher 's face there linger a shadow of uncertainty hyacinth see it and relieved he mind at once ' i shall write to dr henry to-night and thank he i shall ask he to try and get I a curacy as soon as possible ' ` thank you ' say the canon ' i think ' add hyacinth ` that i should prefer get work in england ' ` oh why ' say mr beecher ` would not it be better to stay in ireland and then we might have marion somewhere within reach ' ` my dear ' say the canon ` we must let hyacinth decide for himself i be sure he know what be wisest for he to do ' hyacinth be not at all sure that he know what be wisest and he be quite certain that he have not decide for himself in any matter of the slightest importance he have suggest a english curacy in the vague hope that it might be easier there to forget he hope and dream for ireland it seem to he too that a voluntary exile of which he could not think without pain might be a kind of atonement for the betrayal of he old enthusiasm the canon follow he to the door when he leave ` my dear boy ' -- there be a break in he voice as he speak -- ' my dear boy you have make I very happy i be sure that you will not enter upon the work of the ministry from any unworthy motive the call will become clearer to you by degree i mean the inward call the outward call the lead of circumstance have already make abundantly plain the way you ought to walk in the other will come -- the voice which bring assurance and peace when it speak ' hyacinth look at he wistfully there seem very little possibility of anything like assurance for he and only such peace as might be gain by smother the cry with which he heart assail he the canon hold he hand and wring it ' i can understand why you want to go to england you political opinion will interfere very little with you work there here of course it would be different yes you choice be certainly wise for nothing must be allow to hinder you work lay aside every weight you remember let we run the race yes i understand ' it be perfectly clear to hyacinth that the canon do not understand in the least it be not likely that anyone ever would understand gradually he despondency give way before the crowding in of thought of satisfaction he be to have marion to live with she to love she and be love by she as long as they both live he see life stretch out before he a sunlit pleasant journey in marion 's company it do not seem to he that any trouble could be really bad any disappointment intolerable any toil oppressive with she love for a atmosphere round he he believe too that the work he be undertake be a good work perhaps the highest and noblest kind of work there be to be do in the world from this conviction also come a glow of happiness yet there keep recur chill shuddering of self-reproach something within he keep whisper that he have barter he soul for happiness ' i have choose the easier and therefore the baser way ' he say ' i have shrink from toil and pain i have refuse to make the sacrifice demand of I ' he go back again to the story of he father 's vision for a moment it seem quite clear that he have deliberately refuse the call to the great fight that he have judge himself unworthy be cowardly and selfish in he heart then he remember that the captain of whom he father have tell he be no one else but christ the same christ of whom canon beecher speak the good shepherd whose love he have discover to be the greatest need of all ' i must have he ' he say -- ' i must have he -- and marion ' again with the renew decision come a glow of happiness and a sense of rest until there rise as if to smite he the thought of ireland -- of ireland poor deride of stranger desert by she son rope in as a prize-ring where selfish man struggle ignobly for sordid gain the child of the land flee from it sick with despair its desert house be full of all doleful thing cormorant and the daughter of the owl lodge in the lintel of they sullen desolation be on the threshold while satyr cry to they fellow across tract of brown rush-grown land alien come to hiss and pass by wag they hand over all be the monotony of the gray sky descend and still descend with cloud that come upon the land mistily folding it in close embrace of death voice sound far off and unreal through the gloom the final convulsive struggle of the nation 's life grow feebler and fewer of all cause ireland 's seem the most hopelessly lose be he too go to forsake she he feel that in spite of all the good promise he there would always hang over he life a gloom that oven marion 's love would not disperse the heavy shadow of ireland 's calvary for marion there would be no such darkness nor would marion understand it but surely christ understand word of he crowd to the memory ` when he behold the city he weep over it say oh jerusalem jerusalem ' most certainly he understand this as he understand all human emotion he too have yearn over a nation 's fall have feel the heartbreak of the patriot ' i have choose he ' he say at last ` once have catch a glimpse of he i could not do without he he understand it all and he have give I marion ' chapter xxii it be a brilliant July day and the convent at robeen be deck for a festival the occasion be a very great one cloth of gold hang in the chapel the entrance-hall be splendid with flower and the whole white front of the building have put on sign of holiday indeed this festival be unique the very greatest day in the history of the sisterhood easter christmas and the saint ' day recur annually in they proper order and the emotion they bring with they be no doubt familiar to holy lady whose business it be to live in close touch with the other world but on this day the great of the earth being much more unapproachable as a rule than the saint be to visit the convent honor be to be pay to lady whose magnificence be guarantee by worldly title to the proconsul of the far-off imperial power holder of the purse-string of the richest nation upon earth to judge accustom to sit in splendid robe and awful head-dress pronounce the doom of malefactor to a member of the cabinet a very mighty man though untitled and quite possibly -- a glitter hope -- to the lord lieutenant himself it be therefore no wonder that the nun have deck they convent with all possible splendor on each side of the iron gateway be a flag-post from the top of one flutter the green banner of ireland with its gold harp and a great crown over it from the other hang the union jack emblem of that marriage of nationality for whose consummation eight century have not suffice it be hoist upside down -- not with intentional disrespect but because sister gertrude who superintend this part of the decoration have long ago renounce the world and do not remember that the tangled cross have a top or a bottom to they between the post hang a festoon of signalling flag long point strip of bunt with red ball or blue on they the central streamer just tip as it flutter the top of the iron cross which mark the religious nature of the gateway the straight gravel walk inside be cover with red baize and on each side of it be plant taper pole round which crimson and white muslin circle in alternate stripe give they the appearance of huge old-fashioned sugar-stick these add to the gaiety of the scene though it can not be suppose that they be of any actual use the most bewildered visitor be hardly likely to stray off the red baize or miss he way to the door in front of he within the great entrance-hall be palm and flowering shrub in pot or tub the mosaic flooring import from italy and a source of pride to all the sister shine with much wash and polish the madonna with the blue eye and the golden crown

the occasion they be dress in neat violet petticoat and white blouse with shawl throw back from they head a glorified presentment of the mayo woman 's work dress here and there a touch of realism creditable to the reverend mother 's talent for stage management one sit in bare foot -- not of course dust or mud stain as bare foot be apt to be in connaught but clean the careful observer of detail might have be lead to suppose that the sister improve upon the practice of the holy father himself and daily wash the foot of the poor everywhere fresh-complexioned gentle-faced nun flit silently

the eye of beholder with a dress make of one of the convent tweeds sir gerald follow she awkward and unwilling he have be drag with difficulty from he book and the society of he child and be doubtful whether a cigar in a nunnery garden might not be count sacrilege with they be a wonderful person -- a english priest : it be thus he describe himself -- whom lady geoghegan have meet in yorkshire he charming manners and good church principle have win she favor and earn he the holiday he be enjoy at clogher house he be array in a pair of gray trousers a white shirt and a blazer with the arm of brazenose college embroider on the pocket he sacerdotal character be mark only by he collar he leap gaily from the car which bring they from the station and as he assist he hostess to alight amaze the little crowd around the gate by chaff the driver in a entirely unknown tongue the good man have a ear for music and plume himself on he ability to pick up any dialect he hear -- scotch yorkshire or irish brogue the driver be bewildered but smile pleasantly he realize that the gentleman be a foreigner and since the meaning of he speech be not clear it be quite likely that he might be hazy about the value of money and the rate of car hire the duchess of drummin come in she landau like lady geoghegan she mark the national and industrial nature of the occasion in she attire at much personal inconvenience for the day be warm she wear a long cloak of rich brown tweed adorn with row of large leather-covered button lady josephine maguire flutter after she she have bid she maid disguise a dress neither irish nor homespun with as much carrickmacross lace as could be attach to it lord eustace who represent he father appear in all the glory of a silk hat and a frock-coat he eye sir gerald 's baggy trousers and shabby wideawake with contempt and turn away he eye from behold the vanity of obviously bad form when he come face to face with the english priest in he blazer a smile nun take charge of each party as it arrive lady geoghegan ply hers with question and receive a series of quite uninforming answer she husband follow she bent principally upon escape from the precinct if he could already he be bore and he know that speech from great man be in store for he if he be force to linger the duchess of drummin eyed each object present to she notice gravely through long-handled glass but give she attendant nun very little conversational help lady josephine make every effort to be intelligent and inquire in a dormitory where the looking-glass be she be amaze to hear that the nun do or fail to do they hair -- the head-dress conceal the result of they effort -- without mirror lord eustace be preoccupy amid he unaccustomed surroundings he walk uncertain whether to keep he hat on he head or hold it in he hand the english priest whose name be austin get detach from lady geoghegan and pick up a stray nun for himself she take he by he own request straight to the chapel he cross himself with elaborate care on enter and knelt for a moment before the altar the nun be delighted ` so you too be a catholic ' ` certainly ' he reply briskly -- ` a english catholic ' ` ah many of we priest go to england perhaps you have meet father o'connell he be on a london mission ' ` no ' say mr austin ' i do not happen to have meet he my church be in yorkshire ' the nun gaze at he in amazement ` you church then you be -- ` yes ' he say ' i be a priest ' she eye slowly travel over he they begin at the gray trousers pass to the blazer rest a moment on the college arm which certainly suggest the ecclesiastical and remain fix on he collar after all why should she a humble nun doubt he word when he say he be a priest perhaps he might belong to some order of which she have never hear eccentricity of costume might be force on the english clergy by protestant intolerance she smother she uncertainty and take he at he word they go together into the garden mr austin take off he hat before the tarnished madonna and cross himself again the nun 's doubt vanish ' i think ' he say ` that i should like to buy some of this tweed be it for sale ' ` oh certainly sister aloysium will sell it to you we be so glad so very glad when anyone will buy what we poor worker make it be all a help to the good cause ' ` now this ' say mr austin finger a bright-green cloth ` would make a nice lady 's dress do not you think so ' the nun cast down she eye ' i do not know father about dress sister aloysia the reverend father want to buy tweed to make a dress for ' -- she hesitate perhaps it be he niece but he look young to have a full-grown niece -- ` for he sister ' sister aloysium look round she puzzle she see no reverend father ` this ' say the other ` be father -- father -- ' ` austin ' he help she out ` father austin ' add the nun ` and you wish ' say sister aloysia ` to buy a dress for you sister ' ` not for my sister ' say mr austin -- ` for my wife ' both nun start back as if he have try to strike they ` you wife you wife then you be a protestant ' ` certainly not ' he say ' i detest all protestant i be a catholic -- a anglo-catholic ' neither of the nun have ever hear of a anglo-catholic before what manner of religion such people might profess be doubtful and unimportant one thing be clear -- this be not a priest in any sense of the word which they could recognize they distrust he as a wolf not certainly in the clothing but use the language of a sheep the situation become embarrassing mr austin prepare to bow himself away ' i think ' he say ' i shall ask lady geoghegan ' -- he roll the title out emphatically it form a salve to he wounded dignity -- ' i shall ask lady geoghegan to purchase the tweed for I i must be on the look-out for a friend who promise to meet I here this afternoon -- a young man whom i contemplate engage as my curate i be most particular in the choice of a curate and should of course prefer a public school and ` varsity man i need scarcely say that i refer only to oxford and cambridge as the university as a rule i do not care for irishman but on the recommendation of my friend dr henry i be willing to consider this mr conneally ' it seem to mr austin that a preference for the english university the friendship of a distinguished professor a contempt for the mere irishman and a title hostess ought to restore the respect he have forfeit by the mention of he wife curiously enough and this show the disadvantage of a monastic seclusion from the world the nun remain unimpressed the conception of a married priest be too much for they as he walk away mr austin hear sister aloysium murmur : ` how very indecent ' meanwhile the train from dublin have arrive and mr austin when he return after he interview with hyacinth find that even the two nun he have victimize have forget he in the excitement of gaze at more important visitor mr justice saunder a tall stout man with a florid face make a tour of the factory under the charge of one of the senior sister he take little notice of what he be show be mainly bent on explain to he escort how he come to be know in legal circle as ` satan saunder ' afterwards he add a tale of how he have once bluff a crowd in a out-of-the-way country town into give three cheer for the queen ` you be all loyal here ' he say ' i see the union jack fly over the gate as i come in ' the nun smile a slow enigmatic smile and the judge watch she be strike by she innocence and simplicity ' ` surely ' she say ` the church must always be loyal ' ` well i be not so sure of that i have meet a few firebrand of priest in my time ' ` oh those ' she say with a shrug of she shoulder ` you must not think of they it will always be easy to keep they in order when the time come they spring from the cabin what can you expect of they but the church -- can the church fail of respect for the sovereign ' mr clifford and mr davi follow judge saunder they be member of the congested district board and it be clear from the manner of the nun who escort they that they be guest of very considerable importance in she estimation mr clifford be a englishman who have be import to assist in govern ireland because he be marry to the sister of the chief secretary 's wife he be otherwise qualify for the task by possess a fair knowledge of the point of a horse he believe that he know ireland and the irish people thoroughly he colleague mr davi be a man of quite a different stamp the son of a presbyterian farmer in county tyrone he have join the irish parliamentary party and make himself particularly objectionable in westminster he have devote he talent to discover and publish the principle upon which appointment to lucrative post be make by the official in dublin castle it be find convenient at last to provide he with a salary and a seat on the congested district board thus he find himself engage in ameliorate the lot of the connaught peasant mr clifford use to describe he as ' a bit of a bounder -- in fact a complete outsider -- but no fool ' he estimate of mr clifford be perhaps less complimentary ` every business ' he use to say ` must have at least one gentleman in it to do the entertaining and the dine out we have mr clifford he be a first-rate man at one of the lord lieutenant 's ball ' a professor from trinity college be one of the two guest conduct by the reverend mother herself nominally this learn gentleman exist for the purpose of impress upon the world the beauty of latin poetry but he be best know to fame as a orator on the platform of the primrose league and a writer of magazine article on irish question he be a man who owe he success in life largely to he faculty for always keep beside the most important person present the lord lieutenant be slightly indispose have be unable to make a early start so the most honorable stranger be mr chesney the chief secretary to he professor cairn attach himself and receive a share of the reverend mother 's blandishments mr chesney himself be dapper and smile as usual even the early hour at which he have be oblige to leave home have neither ruffle he temper nor wither the flower in he buttonhole he spend he money generously at the various stall in the garden address friendly remark to the woman in the factory and ask the question with which mr davi have prime he in the train quite a crowd of minor people follow the great statesman there be barrister who hope to become county court judge and lady who enjoy a novel kind of occasion for display they clothes hope to see they name afterwards in the newspaper account of the proceedings there be a few foreman from lead dublin shop who foresee the possibility of a fashionable boom in robeen tweeds and flannel there be also reporter from the dublin papers and a representative -- miss o'dwyer -- of a syndicate which supply lady ' journal with account of the clothes wear at fashionable function the supreme moment of the day arrive when the company assemble to listen to word of wisdom from the orator select to address they seat have be provide by cart in form from the neighbouring national school a handsomely-carved chair of ecclesiastical design await mr chesney he open he speech by assure he audience that there be no occasion for he to address they at all a truth which strike home to the heart of sir gerald who be try to arrange himself comfortably at a desk design for a class of infant ` fact ' mr chesney explain himself ` be more eloquent than word you have see what i could never have describe to you -- the contented worker in this factory and the artistic design of the fabric they weave many of you remember what robeen be a few year ago -- a howling wilderness we be tell on high authority that even the wilderness shall blossom as a rose ' he bow in the direction of the reverend mother possibly with a feeling that it be suitable to acknowledge she presence when quote holy writ possibly with a vague idea that she might consider herself a spiritual descendant of the prophet isaiah ` you see it now a hive of happy industry ' he observe with pleasure that the reporter be busy with they note-book and he know that these editor of public utterance might be rely on to unravel a tangled metaphor before publish a speech he go on light-heartedly confident that in the next day 's papers he wilderness would blossom into something else and that the hive if it appear at all would be arrive at by some other process than blossom the habit of roll out agreeable platitude to audience force to listen be one which grow on public man as dram-drinking do on the common herd mr chesney be evidently enjoy himself and there seem no reason why he should ever stop he could and perhaps would have go on for hour but for the offensive way in which judge saunder snap the case of he watch at the end of every period there be really no hurry for the special train which be to bring they back to dublin would certainly wait until they be ready for it mr chesney feel aggrieved at the repeat interruption and close he speech without give the audience the benefit of he peroration the judge come next and begin with remind he hearer that he be know as ` satan saunder ' a account of the origin of the name follow and be enjoy even by those who have listen to the judge 's oratory before and therefore know the story there be something piquant almost _ risqué _ in the constant repetition of a really wicked word like ` satan ' in the hall of a nunnery the audience laugh reassuringly and the judge go on to supply fresh pabulum for mirth by suggest that the reverend mother should clothe she nun in they own tweeds he be probably right in suppose that the new costume would add a gaiety to the religious life other jest follow and he sit down amid a flutter of applause after promise that when he next preside over the winter assize in a draughty court-house he would send for a robeen blanket and wrap he leg in it mr clifford who follow the judge begin by wonder whether anyone present have ever be in lancashire after a pause during which no one own to have cross the channel he say that lancashire be the home of the modern factory there every man and woman earn good wages wear excellent clothes and live in a house fit with hot and cold water tap and a gas-meter it be he hope to see mayo turn into another lancashire when lady of undoubted commercial ability like the lady abbess who preside over the robeen convent -- lady abbess sound well and mr clifford be not strong on ecclesiastical title -- take the matter up success be assure all that be require for the development of the factory system in mayo be capital and that ` we the congested district board be in a position to supply ' with the help of some prompt from mr davi he proceed to lay before the audience a few figure purport to explain the board 's expenditure professor cairn be evidently anxious to follow mr clifford if only in the humble capacity of the proposer of a vote of thanks but id name be not on the program and mr chesney be already engage in a whisper conversation with the reverend mother ignore the professor almost rudely he announce that the company in general be invite to tea in the dining-room the refreshment provide if not substantial be admirable in quality there happen just then to be a young lady engage at the expense of the county council in teaching cookery in a neighbouring convent she be send over to robeen for the occasion and make a number of delightful cake at extremely small expense the worker in the factory have give the butter she require as a thank-offering and the necessary egg come from another convent where the nun with financial assistance from the congested district board keep a poultry-farm the reverend mother dispense she hospitality with the same air of generosity with which mr clifford have speak of provide capital for the future ecclesiastical factory chapter xxiii the reverend mother bow out the last of she guest and retire to she own room well satisfied she be assure of further support from the congested district board and certain debt which have grow uncomfortably during she struggle with mr quinn need trouble she no longer she goods would be extensively advertise next morning in the daily press she house would obtain a celebrity likely to attract the most eligible novice -- those that be to say who would bring the largest sum of money as they dowry there arise before she mind a vision of almost unbounded wealth and all that might be do with it

herself before the altar and lay passive in a glow of warm emotion for god for the mother of god for the catholic church she have labor and suffer and dare now she be well within sight of the end the golden reward the fulfilment of hope that have never be altogether selfish she thought sanctify now by the presence on the altar drift out again on to the shine sea of the future what she a humble nun have do other would do a countless army of missionary man and woman march from the irish shore would conquer the world 's conqueror regain for the church the anglo-saxon race once in the far past irish man and woman have christianize europe and ireland have win she glorious title ` island of saint ' now the great day be to dawn again the great race to be reborn for this end have ireland be keep faithful and pure for century just that she might be at last the witness to the spiritual in a materialize world for this end have the church in ireland go through the storm of persecution suffer the blight of the world 's contempt that she might emerge in the end entirely fit for the bloodless warfare ` and i be one of the race a daughter of ireland and i be a worker -- nay one who have accomplish something -- in the vineyard of the church ah god ' she be sweep forward on a wave of emotion think cease expire in the ecstasy of a communion which transcend think then suddenly sharp as a unexpected pain a accusation shot across she soul shatter the color glory of the trance in a instant ` who be i that i should boast ' the long year of introspection the discipline of hundred of heart-searching confession the hardly-learned lesson of self-distrust make it possible for she to recognize the vain-glory even with the halo of devotion shine round it she abase herself in penitence

saloon-carriage and puff contentedly at he cigar it might be he part occasionally -- indeed frequently -- to talk like a fool but the man be shrewd enough it really seem that he have hit on the true method of govern ireland nationalist member of parliament could be muzzle not by the foolish old method of coercion but by win the goodwill of the bishop no irish member dare open he mouth when a priest bid he keep it shut or give a vote contrary to the wish of the hierarchy and the bishop be reasonable man they look at thing from a point of view intelligible to englishmen there be no ridiculous sentimentality about they demand for so much money they would silence the clamor of the parliamentary party for so much more they would preach a modify loyalty would assert before the world that the irish people be faithful servant of the sovereign for a good lump sum down they would undertake to play ` god save the king ' or ` rule britannium ' on the organ at maynooth of course the money must be pay : mr chesney be begin to understand that and feel the drawback it would have be much pleasanter and simpler if the bishop would have be content with promise there be a certain difficulty in obtain the necessary fund without announce precisely what they-were for but after all a man can not be call a great statesman without do something to deserve the title and british statesmanship be the art of hoodwink the taxpayer that be all -- not too difficult a task for a clever man mr chesney reckon on no power in ireland likely to be seriously troublesome the upper class be either helpless and sulking or helpless and smile artificially they might grumble in private or try to make themselves popular by join the chorus of the church 's flatterer either way they influence be inconsiderable be there anyone else worth consider the orangeman be still a noisy faction but they organization appear to be break up they be more bent on devour they own leader than interfere with he there be a number of people anxious to revive the irish language who at one time have cause he some little uneasiness he have find it quite impossible to understand the gaelic league and be a englishman arrive gradually at the comfortable conclusion that what he could not understand must be foolish now he have great hope that the bishop might capture the movement if once it be safely under the patronage of the church he have nothing more to fear from it no doubt resolution would be pass but resolution ------ mr chesney smile there be of course the impossible people connect with the _ croppy _ mr chesney do not like they and in the bottom of he heart be a little nervous about they they seem to be very little afraid of the authority of the church and he doubt if the authority of the state would frighten they at all still there be very few of they and they abominable spirit of independence be spread slowly if at all ` they will not ' he say to himself ` be of any importance for some year to come at all event and five year hence -- ' in five year mr chesney hope to be prime minister or perhaps to have migrate to the house of lord at least he expect to be out of

well pleased ireland so they understand mr chesney be to be make happy and contented peaceful and prosperous it follow that there must be board under the control of dublin castle -- more and more board a endless procession of they there be no way devise by the wit of man for secure prosperity and contentment except the creation of board if board then necessarily official -- official with salary and travel allowance nice gentlemanly man with villa at dalkey and killiney would perform duty not too arduous in connection with the board and carry out the benevolent policy of the government

and a smoke unattainable for she in the convent or the train be much to be desire she leave the road at the foot of the hill and pick she way along the rough bohireen which lead upward along the course of the stream after awhile even this track disappear the stream tumble noisily over rock and stone the bog-stained water glowing auburn-coloured in the sunlight the ling and heather be springy under she foot and the air be sweet with the scent of the bog-myrtle she spy round she for a rock which cast a shade upon the kind of heathery bed she have set she heart to find she eye light upon a

of a friend he feel that he could have bear she anger better no doubt if he have make he confession to augusta goold he would have be overwhelm with passionate wrath or wither by a superb contemptuous stare then he could have work himself to anger in return but this ` you will never speak to any of we again ' she go on you will be ashamed even to read the _ croppy _ you will wear a long black coat and gray glove you will learn to talk about the irish problem and the inestimable advantage of belong to a world-wide empire and about the great heart of the english people i see it all -- all that

hyacinth ' miss o'dwyer 's catalogue of catastrophe be curiously mixed perhaps the comedy in it tend to obscure the utter degradation of the ruin she describe but the freakish incongruity of the speech do not strike hyacinth he find in it only two note -- pity that such a fate await he and contempt for the man who submit to it ' i can not help myself will you not make a effort to understand i

the _ croppy _ and lock they in the box in which he store the few papers of interest he possess the sorrowful judgment pronounce on he conduct affect he but only in a dull way like a additional blow upon a limb already bruise to numbness he accept he new duty and perform they without any feeling of enthusiasm and after a little while without any definite hope of do any good he get no further in understand the people he have to deal with and he be aware that even those of they who come most frequently into contact with he regard he as a stranger a young doctor whose wife take a fancy to marion try to make friend with he the result be unsatisfactory owe to hyacinth 's irresponsiveness he could not without yawn piteously spend a evening discuss the performance of the local cricket club nor do he conduct improve when the two lady suspend they talk and sacrifice a hour to play four-handed halma with they husband a unmarried solicitor attract by marion 's beauty and friendliness adopt the habit of call at hyacinth 's little house about nine or ten o'clock in the evening he be a man full of anecdote and simple mirth and he often stay quite happily till midnight every week he bring a illustrated paper as a offering to marion and recommend the short story in it to she notice he often ask hyacinth 's advice and help in solve the conundrum set by the prize editor he take a mild interest in politics and retail gossip pick up at the conservative club after a while he give up come to the house hyacinth blame himself for be cold and unfriendly to the man mr austin treat hyacinth with kindness and some consideration much as a wise master treat a upper servant he be anxious that he curate should perform many and complicated ceremony in church be seriously intent on the wear of correctly-coloured stole and ` run ' as he express it himself a very large number of different organization of each of which the objective appear to be a tea-party in the parochial hall hyacinth accept he tuition bow low at the time when mr austin like to bow watch for the season when stole bloom white and gold change to green or fade down to violet he try to make himself agreeable to the ` united mother ' and the rest when they assemble for tea-drinking mr austin assert that these be the method by which the english people be be teach the catholic faith hyacinth do not doubt it nor do he permit himself to wonder whether it be worth while teach they to marion the new life be full of many delight the surpliced choir-boy gratify she aesthetic sense and she enter herself as one of a band of volunteer who scrub the chancel tile and polish a brass cross she smile kiss and pet hyacinth out of the fit of depression which come on he manage he small income with wonderful skill and write immensely long letter home to ballymoy chapter xxvi it be very hard for a poor man to travel from one side of england to the other side of ireland because railway company even when to allure the public they advertise extraordinary excursion charge a great deal for they ticket the journey become still more difficult of accomplishment when the poor man be marry then there be two ticket to be buy and very likely most of the money which might have buy they have be spend secure the safe arrival of a baby -- a third person who in due time will also require a railway-ticket this be hyacinth 's case for two summer he have no holiday at all and it be only by the most fortunate of chance that he find himself during the third summer in a position to go to ballymoy he sublet he house to a freshly-arrived supervisor of inland revenue who want six week to look about for a suitable residence with the nine pound pay in advance by this gentleman hyacinth and marion have with they they baby a perambulator and much other luggage set off for ballymoy the journey be not a very pleasant one because it be make over the line of three english railway company whose train refuse to connect with each other at junction and because st george 's channel be generally rough the discomfort of third-class carriage be more acutely feel when the irish shore be reach but the misery of have to feed and tend a year-old child last the whole journey through therefore marion arrive in dublin dishevelled weary and for all she natural placidness incline to be cross the steamer come to port at a hour which leave they just the faint hope of catch the earliest train to ballymoy disappointment follow the nervous strain of a rush across dublin two long hour intervene before the next train start and the people who keep the refreshment-room in broadstone station be not early riser marion without tea or courage settle herself and the baby in the draughty waiting-room hyacinth be also dishevelled dirty and tired have bear he full share of strife with the child 's worst mood but the sight of ireland from the steamer 's deck fill he with a strange sense of exultation he wish to shout with gladness when the gray dome of the custom house rise to view immense above the low blanket of mist even the incredibly hideous iron grate of the railway viaduct set he pulse beat joyfully he draw deep breath inhale various abominable smell delightedly the voice of the sleepy porter on the quay rouse in he a craving for the gentle slovenliness of irish speech he fuss and hustle marion beyond the limit of she endurance pretend eagerness to catch the early train caring in reality not at all whether any train be catch or miss fill only with a kind of frenzy to keep move somehow further into ireland in the cab he give utterance to ridiculous pleasantry he seize the child from marion and hold he wail piteously half out of the window that he eye might rest on the great gilt character which adorn the office of the gaelic league it be with rapture that he read irish name write and spell in irish above the shop and see a banner proclaim the annual festival of irish ireland hang oveus the door of the rotunda the city have grow more irish since he leave it there be no possibility now even in the early morning with few people but scavenger and milkman in the street of mistake for a english town while marion sit torpid in the waiting-room he pace the platform eagerly from end to end he see the train push slowly into position beside the platform watch porter sweep the accumulate débris of yesterday 's traffic from the floor of the carriage and rub with filthy rag the brass doorhandle little group of passenger begin to arrive -- first a company of cattle-jobber four of they red-faced man with keen crafty eye bind for some western fair then a laugh party of tourist woman in short skirt and exaggeratedly protective veil man with fierce tweed knickerbockers drag stuff hold-all and yellow bag these be evidently english they clear high-pitched voice proclaim contempt for they surroundings and leave no doubt of they nationality one of they address a bewildered porter in cheerful song : ` be you right there michael be you right have you get the parcel there for mr white ' he feel and he companion sympathize that he be enter into the spirit of irish life then herald by a obsequious guard come a great man proconsular in mien and gait bag and rug be wheel beside he in he hand be a despatch-box bear the tremendous initial of the local government board he take complete possession of a first-class smoking carriage scribble a telegram perhaps of international importance hand it to the guard for instant despatch and light a finely-odorous cigar hyacinth humble by the mere view of this incarnation of the imperial spirit go meekly to the waiting-room to fetch marion and he child he lead they across the now crowd platform towards a third-class carriage ' i will not go with you in you first-class carriage father lavelle so that be flat nor i will not split the difference and go second either if that be what you be go to propose to I be it spend what would keep the family of a poor man in bread and tea for a week for the sake of ease my back with a cushion get away with you the plain deal board 's good enough for I and moreover i doubt very much if i have the money to do it if i be ever so willing i be afraid to look into my purse to count the few copper that be leave in it after pay that murder bill in the hotel you take I to gresham indeed a place where they be not ashamed to charge a poor old priest three and sixpence for he breakfast and I not able to eat the half of what they put before I ' hyacinth turn quickly two priest stand together near the bookstall the one a young man handsome and well-dressed he do not know the other he recognize at once it seem to be the same familiarly shabby black coat which he wear the same many-stained waistcoat the identical silk hat ruffle and rain-spot the same pad of flesh hang flaccid from he jaw the red crack knuckle of he hand well remember be enormous still only the furrow on the face seem to be plough deeper and wider and a few more stiff hair curl over the general bushiness of the grizzled eyebrow ` father moran ' cry hyacinth ' i be father moran you be right there but who _ you _ be or how you come to know I be more than i can tell but wait a minute i have a sort of recollection of you voice will you speak to I again and maybe i 'll be able to put a name on you ' hyacinth say a few word rapidly in irish ' i have you now ' say the priest ` you be hyacinth conneally the boy that go out to fight for the boer father lavelle this be a friend of mine that i have know ever since he be bear and i have not lay eye on he these six year or more you be go west mr conneally but of course you be where else would you be go we 'll travel together and talk if it be second-class you be go father lavelle will have to lend I the money to pay the extra on my ticket so as i can go with you seemingly it be a protestant minister you have grow into well now who would have think it and you so set on fight the battle of armageddon and all it be a come-down for you so it be but never mind you might have get yourself kill in it there be many a one kill or maim for life in smaller fight than it it be better to be a minister any day than a corpse or a cripple and as you be a minister it be likely to be third-class you be travel time be change since i be young it be the priest travel third-class then if they travel at all and the minister be cock up on the cushion look down on the likes of we out of the window with the little red curtain half-drawn across they now it 'll be father lavelle there with he grand new coat that he say be irish manufacture -- but i do not believe he -- who 'll be do the gentleman but come along mr conneally -- come along and tell I all the battle you fight and the general you make prisoner of and how it be you take to preach afterwards ' hyacinth somewhat shyly introduce the priest to marion then a ticket-collector drive they into they carriage and lock the door father moran begin to catechize hyacinth before the train start and draw from he as they go westwards the story of he disappointment doubt hope veering and final despair hyacinth speak unwillingly at first give no more than necessary answer to the question then because he find that reticence call down on he fresh and more detailed inquiry and also because the priest 's evident and sympathetic interest redeem a prying curiosity from offensiveness he tell he tale more freely very soon there be no more need of question and father moran 's share in the talk take the form of comment interrupt a narrative of captain albert quinn he say : ` i have hear of he and a nice kind of a boy he seem to have be i suppose he fight when he get there he be just the sort that would be splendid at the fight well god be good and i suppose it be to do the fight for the rest of we that he make the likes of captain quinn do you hear that they want to make he a member of parliament well they do nothing less would please they but what good would that be when he could not set foot in the country for fear of be arrest ' later on he be move to laughter ` to think of you go on the road with a bag full of blanket and shawl i never hear of such a thing and all the grand notion you head be full of why do not you come my way i would have make rafferty give you a order i would have buy the makings of a frieze coat from you myself -- i would indeed ' afterwards he become grave again ' i will not let you say the hard word about the nun mr conneally do not do it now there be plenty of good convent up and down through the country -- more than ever you 'll know of be the black protestant you be and the one that ruin you business -- suppose they do ruin it and i have only you word for that -- what right have you to be blame they they be try to turn a honest penny by a honest trade and that be just what you and you friend mr quinn be do yourselve ' hyacinth conscious of a failure in good taste shift he ground only to be interrupted again ` oh you may abuse the congested district board to you heart 's content i never could see what the government make all the board for unless it be to keep the people out of mischief as long as there be a board of any kind about the country every blackguard will be so busy throw stone at it that he will not have time nor inclination leave to annoy decent people and i 'll say this for the congested district board : they mean well indeed they do not a doubt of it there be one good thing they do anyway if there be not another and that be when they come to carrowkeel and buy the big curragh farm that never support a christian but two herd and some bullock ever since the famine clearance they fetch the people down off the mountain and put they on it be not that a good thing now sure all government board do more wrong than right it be the nature of that sort of confederation but it be all the more thankful we ought to be when once in a while they do something useful ' hyacinth come to tell of the choice which canon beecher offer he and dwell with tragic emphasis on he own decision the priest listen a smile on he lip a look of pity which belie the smile in he eye ` so you think ireland would be lose altogether unless you write article for miss goold in the _ croppy _ it be no small opinion you have of yourself hyacinth conneally and you think you would save you soul by go to preach the gospel to the english people be that it now ' ` it be not ' say hyacinth ` and you know it be not ' ` of course it be not what be i thinking of to forget the young lady that be in it a fine wife you have get any way god bless she and make you a good husband to she by the look of she she be better than you deserve i suppose it be to get money you go to england so as to buy she pretty dress and a beautiful house to live in do you think you would grow rich over there ' ` indeed i do not ' say hyacinth bitterly ' i know we would never be rich ' ` well then could not you as well have be poor in ireland and better for everybody 's poor here but there i know well enough it be not money you be after do not be get angry with I now it be not for the sake of save you soul you go nor to get you nice wife though a man might go a long way for the likes of she i do not know why you go and it be my belief you do not know yourself but you make a mistake whatever you do it for go off on that english mission be it a mission you call it when you be a protestant i do not think it be but it do not matter you make a mistake why do not you come back again ' ` god know i would if i could it be hungry i be to get back -- just sick with hunger and the great desire that be on I to be back again in ireland ' ` well what be to hinder you let I tell you this : there be be four man in you father 's place since he die never a one of the first three would stay they tell I the pay 's small and the place be desolate to they for the want of protestant there be none you may say but the coastguard after the third of they leave it be long enough before they get the fourth i hear they go scour and scrape round the four coast of the country with a trawl-net try to get a man and now they have get he he be all for go away he say there be no work to do and no people to preach to but you would find work if you be there i would find you work myself -- work for the people you know since you be bear that be in the way at last of get to be the man and woman they be mean to be and that want all the help can be get for they why do not you come back ' ` indeed father moran i would if i could ' ` if you could what be the use of talk be not you wife 's father a canon and would not that professor in the college that you use to tell I of do something for you what be the good of have fine friend like that if they will not get you send to a place like carrowkeel that never another minister but yourself would as much as cat he dinner in twice if he could help it ' hyacinth glance doubtfully at marion the child lay quiet in she arm she sleep uncomfortably it be clear that she have not care to listen to the conversation of the two man
