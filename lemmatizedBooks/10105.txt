man you do not find lay round loose nowadays to any great extent it be a pity he brain be not preserve in a glass case where the imbecile lunatic at washington could take a whiff occasionally it would do 'em good we be tell that as a boy daniel be stupid but this have be say of so many great man that it be get stale some talented man be undoubtedly stupid boy but it do not follow that every idiotic youth will make a eminent statesman but there be plenty of vacancy in the statesman business a great many man go into it but they fail for want of capital if they would only stick to they legitimate business of clam-digging or something of that sort we should appreciate they and they obituary notice would be a thing to love because ` twould be short but d webster be not one of this sort he do not force nature he forget enough every day to set five modern politician up for life when he open he mouth to speak it do not act upon the audience like chloroform nor do the senate-chamber look five minute after like a receive tomb with the body lay round promiscuously i should say not he could wade right into the middle of a dictionary and drag out some idea that be wholesome yes when daniel in

constitution hon john morrissey be also a great ex-pounder even greater than webster for the constitution of the united state be a trifling affair compare with the constitution of jc heenan mr morrissey be a very able man and make he mark early in life before he could write he name i be tell no man have make more brilliant hit and he speech be concise and full of originality i 'll take mine straight no sugar for I & c have become as household word a man like this though he may be vilify and slander for awhile will eventually come in on the home stretch with a right bower to spare that be a nice place john have get at saratoga fit up so elegantly and with so much money in it it look like a fairy bank with the fairy gambol upon the green it be all very pretty no doubt but excuse I if i pass george francis train this gentleman be yet destine to send a thrill of joy to we heart and flood we soul with a calm and tranquil joy this will come off when he funeral take place he be not bear like other people he be make to order for the position of common scold in a country sewing-circle but he be not satisfy he want to be a eminent lunatic and find private mad-house and so he begin to lecture he use to rehearse in a graveyard and it be a common thing for a newly-buried corpse to organize a private resurrection and make for the wood howl dismally a village out west be singularly unfortunate last summer in the first place the cholera rage then they have a earthquake and then gf train lecture three night owe to this accumulation of horror the village be no longer to be find on the map train 's second night do the business for 'em the once happy villager be now aimless wanderer and one poor old man be find in the churchyard study a war map of pari and vicinity in a late new york paper it be say that train have he eye on the white house and be indeed a shrewd far-seeing man when he visit europe and kiss all the little irish girl could he have have in he mind the time when they as naturalized american female suffrager would cast they vote for gf train as president that the mind of the reader may not become hopelessly daze by contemplate this last paragraph i will stop mother goose i can not close these memoirs without a simple tribute to this remarkable woman who have probably do more to mould the destiny of this republic than any other man put together she be a eminently pious woman devoted body and soul to foreign mission and to the great work of send the gospel to new jersey but it be as a composer that she brilliant talent stand preeminent mozart beethoven and a host of other excel in this respect but they all lack that exquisite pathos and graceful rhetoric which so distinguish this queen of literature the beautiful creation of that fruitful brain be as a pass panorama of constant delight she style be singularly free from affectation and while we be at one moment rapt in wonder at she chaste and vigorous description of the annoyance of a female in the autumn of life training up a large family in the limited accommodation afford by a common shoe we can not but feel a twinge of compassion for the singular mr hubbard and she lovely dog who have none only to have those tear chase away by the arch and guileless portrayal of the eccentric john horner that we can not to-day gaze upon the classic lineament of she who weld such a facile pen be a source of the most poignant regret it be a cry shame for i think i be correct when i say that there do not exist on the civilized globe a statue of this peerless woman but she will always live as long as there be infant mind to form or tender recollection of childhood to remember p -- i forget to say that i hold a copyright of old granny goose 's work i have just get it renewed and it be as vigorous as a kicking-mule send in you order contribution to the old gal 's statue will be duly acknowledge and deposit with my tailor \* \* \* \* \* the play and show janauschek be a bohemian and with the bohemian propensity for pick up thing have pick up the english language the public be somewhat divide in its estimate of she skill in speak english one-half of she average audience insist that she speak better english than nine-tenth of we native actress : the other half assert that she be at time nearly unintelligible neither of these statement necessarily contradict the other they might both be easily true the fact be however that she speak english like a foreigner mud itself -- or a sun editorial -- could not be plainer than this definition of she exact proficiency in we unmelodious tongue if we go to see she play lady macbeth we meet evidence at every step of she want of familiarity with english or at all event with american custom we find she playing at the academy and we at once remark that no one but a unnecessarily foreign actress would dare to awaken the sepulchral echo of that dismal tomb we find too that at the very threshold of the house she defy the one of the most time-honored institution of we stage by employ a pleasant and courteous door-keeper -- instead of the snarl cerberus who lie in wait at the door of other theater we find again that she outrage the public by the presence of decent and civil usher who neither insult the male spectator by they surly impudence nor annoy the lady visitor by color she train with tobacco juice so that before the curtain rise we be prepare to lament over she unfamiliarity with american custom and to predict she ignorance of the american as well as the english language diver well-meaning person repeat the dialogue of the earlier scene of the play there be a good deal of dramatic force in the leg of mr montgomery who play macbeth much animation in the feather which mr studley 's macduff wear in he hat and a foreshadowing of ghostly peculiarity in the solemn stride of mr de vere 's banquo we listen to these gentleman with polite patience wait for the appearance of lady macbeth when at length that strong-mind female stride across the stage we hail she with rapturous applause and listen for the strident voice with which the average lady macbeth read she husband 's letter we do not hear it however for janauschek read in a tone as low as that which a sensible woman who be plot treason and murder would be apt to use why lady macbeth should proclaim she deadly purpose at the top of she lung be quite incomprehensible except upon the theory that stage tradition have confound the scotch with the irish and that the macbeth husband and wife -- be the typical fenian of the period be accustom to roar they secret to the listen world be that as it may we be constrain to note the actress 's unfamiliarity with the language as evince in the tone in which she read the letter and also in the way in which she urge she husband onward in the path of crime the usual lady macbeth go for she weakminded spouse and drive he by threat and strong-language to consent to she little game janauschek on the contrary do not raise a broom-stick or even she voice at macbeth but actually coax he to be so good as to kill the king so that she can bring all she relation to court and appoint they surveyor and internal revenue collector and foreign minister this be not the tone of other actress in the same part and we therefore at once charge she departure from the common standard to she ignorance of english we listen with fortitude to the dismal singing of the witch and they friend in mask and domino the music we be tell be locke 's music what be the proper key for locke 's music be a question which we have never attempt to solve but we heartily wish that the key be lose forever since by its aid the singer open vista of musical dreariness which be dishearten to the last degree but we sustain we spirit with the thought of the bloody murder that be come talk as we ill we all enjoy we murder whether we read of they in the _ sun _ and the _ police gazette _ or witness they upon the stage when janauschek come upon macbeth with he bloody hand and explain to he that it be now too late to repent either of murder or matrimony she furnish we with more instance of she unfamiliarity with the language she night-dress be not at all the sort of thing which a english-speaking woman would be willing to sleep in we be confident upon this point and we have on we side the testimony of a married man who have live four year in chicago and have be annually marry with great regularity if he do not know what the average female regard as the proper thing in night-dress it would be difficult to find a man who do then too she gross ignorance of english be show in she back hair which be a foot longer than the average hair of previous lady macbeth and be as thick and massive as a lion 's mane wicked and punnish person go so far as to call it she mane attraction they be wrong however janauschek do not draw by the force of capillary attraction by the bye do any one ever notice the fact that while a painter can not be consider a artist unless he draw well a actress may be the greatest of artist and not be able to draw a hundred people but this be wander owe to the imperfection of she english janauschek do not indulge in drinking from the gilded pasteboard goblet which grace the banquet scene she also show she lingual weakness in the sleep-walking scene for instance when after have reign queen of scotland for several month the happy thought of wash she hand strike she she commit the absurdity of scrub they with she hair on the other hand she pronounce the word damned spot with a perfection of accent that constrain we to believe that she must have take at least a few lesson in pronunciation from some of the lead member of wallack 's company still she way of walk blindly into the table and fall over casual chair ought to convince the most skeptical person that she english accent be not yet what it should be and in general she walk and conversation in this scene demonstrate that even the most carefully simulated somnambulism may not resemble in all respects the most approved oxford pronunciation but when we be free from the depressing influence of the academical crypt we forget all but we admiration of janauschek 's superb acting and the exceptional command which she have gain over a language so vexatious in its villanous consonant as we own and we express to every available listener the earnest hope that skebach and fechter will profit by she success and at once begin the study of english with the view of devote they effort hereafter to the american stage matador \* \* \* \* \* poisoning the plug a rampant virginium editor propose to kill off the yankee by put poison in chewing-tobacco so that we shall
