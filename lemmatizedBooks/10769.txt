: its construction the city of the miracle -- the marble companion -- twilight and immensity -- arnolfo di cambio -- dante 's seat -- ruskin 's shepherd -- giotto the various -- giotto 's fun -- the indomitable brunelleschus -- maker of florence -- the present façade all visitor to florence make first for the duomo let we do the same the real name of the duomo be the cathedral of s maria del fiore or st mary of the flower the flower be the florentine lily florence herself be call the city of flower and that in the spring and summer be a happy enough description but in the winter it fail a name appropriate to all the season would be the city of the miracle the miracle be the renaissance for though all over italy trace of the miracle be apparent florence be its very home and still can point to the greatest number of its achievement giotto -lrb- at the beginning of this quicken movement -rrb- may at assisus have be more inspired as a painter but here be he campanile and here be he s marium novellum and s croce fresco fra angelico and donatello -lrb- in the midst of it -rrb- be never more inspired than here where they work and die michelangelo -lrb- at the end of it -rrb- may be more surprising in the vatican but here be he wonderful medicus tomb how it come about that between the year 1300 and 1500 italian soil -- and chiefly tuscan soil -- throw up such master not only with the will and spirit to do what they do but with the power too no one will ever be able to explain but there it be in the history of the world two century be suddenly give mysteriously to the activity of italian man of humane genius and as suddenly the divine gift be withdraw and to see the very flower of these two century it be to florence we must go it be best to enter the piazza del duomo from the via de ' martellus the via de ' cerretanus the via calzaiolus or the via pecori because then one come instantly upon the campanile too the upper window -- so very lovely -- may have be visible at the end of the street with brunelleschus 's warm dome high in the sky beside they but that be not to diminish the effect of the first sight of the whole duomo and campanile make as fair a couple as ever builder bring together : the immense comfortable church so solidly set upon the earth and at its side this delicate slender marble creature all gaiety and lightness which as surely spring from root within the earth for one can not be long in florence look at this tower every day and many time a day both from near and far without be perfectly certain that it grow -- and from a bulb i think -- and be never really build at all whatever the record may aver the interior of the duomo be so unexpected that one have the feeling of have enter by some extraordinary chance the wrong building outside it be so garish with its color marble under the southern sky outside too one 's ear be fill with all the shatter noise in which florence be a adept and then one step and behold nothing but vast and silent gloom this surprise be the more emphatic if one happen already to have be in the baptistery for the baptistery be also color marble without yet within it be color marble and mosaic too : there be no disparity whereas in the duomo the wall have a northern gray and the column be brown austerity and immensity join force when all be say the chief merit of the duomo be this immensity such work of art as it have be not very noticeable or at any rate do not insist upon be see but in its vastness it overpower great as be some of the church of florence i suppose three or four of they could be pack within this one and mere size with a dim light and a savor of incense be enough : it carry religion no need for mass and chant or any ceremony whatever : the world be shut out one be on term with the infinite a forest exercise the same spell among mountain one feel it but in such a cathedral as the duomo one feel it perhaps most of all for it be the work of man yet touch with mystery and wonder and the knowledge that man be the author of such a marvel add to its greatness the interior be so dim and strange as to be for a time sheer terra incognita and to see a bat flit from side to side as i have often do even in the morning be to receive no shock in such a twilight land there must naturally be bat one think the darkness be due not to lack of window but to time the window be there but they have become opaque none of the color one in the aisle allow more than a filtration of light through it there be only the plain circular one high up and those rich color circular one under the dome to do the work in a little while however one 's eye not only become accustomed to the twilight but be very grateful for it and begin to look inquiringly about as they ever do in this city of beauty they observe just inside a instant reminder of the antiseptic quality of italy for by the first great pillar stand a receptacle for holy water with a pretty and charming angelic figure upon it which from its air of newness you would think be a recent gift to the cathedral by a grateful florentine it be six hundred year old and perhaps be design by giotto himself the emptiness of the duomo be another of its charm nothing be allow to impair the vista as you stand by the western entrance : the floor have no chair the great column rise from it in the gloom as if they too be root the wall too be bare save for a few tablet the history of the building be briefly this the first cathedral of florence be the baptistery and s john the baptist be still the patron saint of the city then in 1182 the cathedral be transfer to s repara which stand on part of the site of the duomo and in 1294 the decision to rebuild s reparata magnificently be arrive at and arnolfo di cambio be instruct to draw up plan arnolfo whom we see not only on a tablet in the left aisle in relief with he plan but also more than life size seat beside brunelleschus on the palazzo de ' canonicus on the south side of the cathedral face the door be then sixty-two and a architect of great reputation bear in 1232 he have study under niccolo pisano the sculptor of the famous pulpit at pisa -lrb- now in the museum there -rrb- of that in the cathedral in siena and of the fountain at perugium -lrb- in all of which arnolfo probably help -rrb- and the designer of many building all over italy arnolfo 's own unaided sculpture may be see at its best in the ciborium in s paolo fuorus le mura in rome but it be chiefly as a architect that he be now know he have already give florence she extended wall and some of she most beautiful building -- the or san michele and the badium -- and simultaneously he design s croce and the palazzo vecchio vasarus have it that arnolfo be assist on the duomo by cimabue but that be doubtful the foundation be consecrate in 1296 and the first stone lay on September 8th 1298 and no one be more interested in its early progress than a young grave lawyer who use to sit on a stone seat on the south side and watch the builder little think how soon he be to be drive from florence for ever this seat -- the sasso di dante -- be still to be see when wordsworth visit florence in 1837 for he write a sonnet in which he tell we that he in reverence sate there too and for a moment fill that empty throne but one can do so no longer for the place which it occupy have be build over and only a slab in the wall with a inscription -lrb- on the house next the palazzo de ' canonicus -rrb- mark the site arnolfo die in 1310 and thereupon there seem to have be a cessation or slacken of work due no doubt to the disturbed state of the city which be in the throe of costly war and embroilment not until 1332 be there definite news of its progress by which time the work have pass into the control of the arte della lana but in that year although florentine affair be by no means as flourish as they should be and a flood in the arno have just destroy three or four of the bridge a new architect be appoint in the person of the most various and creative man in the history of the renaissance -- none other than giotto himself who have already receive the commission to design the campanile which should stand at the cathedral 's side giotto be the son of a small farmer at vespignano near florence he be instruct in art by cimabue who discover he draw a lamb on a stone while herd sheep and take he as he pupil cimabue of whom more be say together with more of giotto as a painter in the chapter on the accademia have die in 1302 leave giotto far beyond all living artist and giotto between the age of fifty and sixty be now reside in cimabue 's house he have already paint fresco in the bargello -lrb- introduce he friend dante -rrb- in s marium novellum s croce and elsewhere in italy particularly in the upper and lower church at assisus and at the madonna dell ' arena chapel at padua when dante be stay there during he exile in those day no man be painter only or architect only a all-round knowledge of both art and craft be desire by every ambitious youth who be attract by the wish to make beautiful thing and giotto be a universal master it be not then surprising that on he settle finally in florence he should be invite to design a campanile to stand for ever beside the cathedral or that he should be appoint superintendent of the cathedral work giotto do not live to see even he tower complete -- it be the unhappy destiny of architect to die too soon -- but he be able during the four year leave he to find time for certain accessory decoration of which more will be say later and also to paint for s trinità the picture which we shall see in the accademia together with a few other work since perish for the badium and s giorgio he die in 1336 and be bury in the cathedral as the tablet with benedetto da maiano 's bust of he tell he be also to be see full length in stone in a niche at the uffizus but the figure be mislead for if vasarus be to be trust -lrb- and for my part i find it amusing to trust he as much as possible -rrb- the master be insignificant in size giotto have suffer i think in reputation from ruskin who take he peculiarly under he wing persistently call he the shepherd and make he appear as something between a sunday-school superintendent and the creator the morning in florence and giotto and he work in padua so insist upon the artist 's holiness and conscious purpose in all he do that he genial worldliness shrewdness and humor as bring out by dante vasarus sacchettus and boccaccio be utterly exclude what we see be a intense saint where really be a very robust man sacchettus 's story of giotto one day stumble over a pig that run between he leg and remark and serve I right for i have make thousand with the help of pig ' bristle and never once give they even a cup of broth help to adjust the balance while to he friend dante he make a reply so witty that the poet could not forget he admiration in answer to he question how be it that giotto 's picture be so beautiful and he six child so ugly but i must leave the reader to hunt it for himself as these be modest page better still for its dry humor be he answer to king robert of naple who have command he to that city to paint some scriptural scene and visit the artist while he work on a very hot day remark giotto if i be you i should leave off painting for a while yes reply giotto if i be you i should to giotto happily we come again and again in this book enough at present to say that upon he death in 1336 he be bury like arnolfo in the cathedral where the tablet to he memory may be study and be succeed as architect both of the church and the tower by he friend and assistant andrea pisano whose chief title to fame be he baptistery door and the carve which we be soon to examine of the scene round the base of the campanile he too die -- in 1348 -- before the tower be finish francesco talentus be next call in again to superintend both building and not only to superintend but to extend the plan of the cathedral arnolfo and giotto have both work upon a smaller scale talentus determine the present floor dimension the revise façade be the work of a committee of artist among they giotto 's godson and disciple taddeo gaddus then busy with the ponte vecchio and andrea orcagna whose tabernacle we shall see at or san michele and so the work go on until the main structure be complete in the thirteen-seventies another longish interval then come in which nothing of note in the construction occur and the next interesting date be 1418 when a competition for the design for the dome be announce the work to be give eventually to one filippo brunelleschus then a ambitious and nervously determine man well know in florence as a architect of forty-one brunelleschus who again accord to vasarus be small and therefore as different as may be from the figure which be seat on the clergy house opposite the south door of the cathedral watch he handiwork be bear in 1377 the son of a well-to-do florentine of good family who wish to make he a notary the boy however want to be a artist and be therefore place with a goldsmith which be in those day the natural course as a youth he attempt everything being of a pertinacious and inquire mind and he be also a great debater and student of dante and take to sculpture he be one of those who as we shall see in a later chapter compete for the commission for the baptistery gate it be indeed he failure in that competition which decide he to concentrate on architecture that he be a fine sculptor he competitive design now preserve in the bargello and he christ crucify in s marium novellum prove but in lead he to architecture the star undoubtedly do rightly it be in 1403 that the decision give ghibertus the baptistery commission be make when brunelleschus be twenty-six and donatello destine to be he life-long friend be seventeen and when brunelleschus decide to go to rome for the study of he new branch of industry architecture donatello go too there they work together copying and measure everything of beauty brunelleschus have always before he mind the problem of how to place a dome upon the cathedral of he native city but have a shrewd knowledge of human nature and immense patience he do not hasten to urge upon the authority he claim as the heaven-born architect but contented himself with smaller work and even assist he rival ghibertus with he gate join at that task donatello and luca dellum robbium and give lesson in perspective to a youth who be to do more than any man after giotto to assure the great day of painting and become the exemplar of the finest master -- masaccio it be not until 1419 that brunelleschus 's persistence and belief in he own power satisfy the controller of the cathedral work that he might perhaps be as good as he word and be the right man to build the dome but at last he be able to begin -lrb- 1 -rrb- for the story of he difficulty tell minutely and probably with sufficient accuracy one must go to vasari : it be well worth reading and be a lurid commentary on the suspicion and jealousy of the world the building of the dome without scaffolding occupy fourteen year brunelleschus 's device embrace two dome one within the other tie together with stone for material support and strength it be because of this inner dome that the impression of its size from within the cathedral can disappoint meanwhile in spite of all the wear and tear of the work the satisfy of incredulous busy-body and the removal of such a incubus as ghibertus who because he be a superb modeller of bronze relief be make for a while joint architect with a salary that brunelleschus feel should either be he own or no one 's the little man find time also to build beautiful church and cloister all over florence he live to see he dome finish and the cathedral consecrate by pope eugenius iv in 1436 die ten year later he be bury in the cathedral and he adopted son and pupil buggiano make the head of he on the tablet to he memory brunelleschus 's lantern the model of which from he own hand we shall see in the museum of the cathedral be not place on the dome until 1462 the copper ball above it be the work of verrocchio in 1912 there be still want many yard of stone border to the dome of the man himself we know little except that he be of iron tenacity and live for he work vasarus call he witty but give a not good example of he wit he seem to have be philanthropic and a patron of poor artist and he grieve deeply at the untimely death of masaccio who paint he in one of the carmine fresco together with donatello and other florentine as one walk about florence visit this church and that and peer into cool cloister one 's mind be always intent upon the sculpture or painting that may be preserve there for the delectation of the eye the tendency be to think little of the architect who make the building where they be treasured ask to name the greatest maker of this beautiful florence the ordinary visitor would say michelangelo giotto raphael donatello the della robbias ghirlandaio and andrea del sarto : all before brunelleschus even if he name he at all but this be wrong not even michelangelo do so much for florence as he michelangelo be no doubt the greatest individualist in the whole history of art and everything that he do grip the memory in a vice but florence without michelangelo would still be very nearly florence whereas florence without brunelleschus be unthinkable no dome to the cathedral first of all no s lorenzo church or cloister no s croce cloister or pazzus chapel no badium of fiesole honor where honor be due we should be sing the praise of filippo brunelleschus in every quarter of the city after brunelleschus the chief architect of the cathedral be giuliano da maiano the artist of the beautiful intarsium woodwork in the sacristy and the uncle of benedetto da maiano who make the s croce pulpit the present façade be the work of the architect emilio de fabris whose tablet be to be see on the left wall it be finish in 1887 five hundred and more year after the abandonment of arnolfo 's original design and three hundred and more year after the destruction of the second one begin in 1357 and demolish in 1587 of arnolfo 's façade the primitive seat statue of boniface viii -lrb- or john xxii -rrb- just inside the cathedral be with a bishop in one of the sacristy the only remnant while of the second façade for which donatello and other early renaissance sculptor work the giant s john the evangelist in the left aisle be perhaps the most important relic other statue in the cathedral be also there while the central figure -- the madonna with enamel eye -- may be see in the cathedral museum although not great the group of the madonna and child now over the central door of the duomo have much charm and benignancy the present façade although attractive as a mass of light be not really good its pattern be trivial its painting and statue commonplace and i personally have the feeling that it would have be more fitting have giotto 's marble be supply rather with a contrast than a imitation as it be it be not till giotto 's tower soar above the façade that one can rightly -lrb- from the front -rrb- appreciate its roseate delicacy so strong be this rival chapter ii the duomo ii : its association dante 's picture -- sir john hawkwood -- ancestor and descendant -- the pazzus conspiracy -- squeamish montesecco -- giuliano de ' medici die -- lorenzo 's escape -- vengeance on the pazzus -- botticellus 's cartoon -- high mass -- luca della robbia -- michelangelo near the end -- the miracle of zenobius -- east and west meet in splendor -- marsilio ficino and the new learning -- beautiful glass of the four man most concern in the structure of the duomo i have already speak there be other man hold in memory there and certain painting and statue of which i wish to speak now the picture of dante in the left aisle be paint by command of the republic in 1465 one hundred and sixty-three year after he banishment from the city lecture on dante be frequently deliver in the church of florence during the fourteenth and fifteenth century and it be interesting for those attend they to have a portrait on the wall this picture be paint by domenico di michelino the portrait of dante be prepare for he by alessio baldovinettus who probably take it from giotto 's fresco in the chapel of the podestá at the bargello in this picture dante stand between the inferno and a concentrated florence in which portion of the duomo the signorium the badium the bargello and or san michele be visible behind he be paradise in he hand be the divine comedy i say no more of the poet here because a large part of the chapter on the badium be give to he near the dante picture in the left aisle be two donatello -- the massive s john the evangelist seat who might have give idea to michelangelo for he mose a century and more later and nearer the door between the tablet to de fabris and squarciaparello the so-called poggio bracciolinus a witty italian statesman and humanist and friend of the medicus who however since he be much younger than this figure at the time of its exhibition and be not know to have visit florence till later probably do not sit for it but it be a powerful and very natural work although its author never intend it to stand on any floor even of so dim a cathedral as this the s john i may say be bring from the old façade -- not arnolfo 's but the committee 's façade -- where it have a niche about ten foot from the ground the poggio be also on this façade but higher it be poggio 's son jacopo who take part in the pazzus conspiracy of which we be about to read and be very properly hang for it of the two picture on the entrance wall so high as to be imperfectly see that on the right as you face it have peculiar interest to english visitor for -lrb- paint by paolo uccello whose great battle piece enrich we national gallery -rrb- it represent sir john hawkwood a english free-lance and head of the famous white company who after some successful raid on papal territory in provence put he sword he military genius and he bravo at the service of the highest bidder among the warlike city and province of italy and eventually pass wholly into the employment of florence -lrb- after harry she for other pay-master for some year -rrb- deliver she very signally from she enemy in 1392 hawkwood be a essex man the son of a tanner at hinckford and be bear there early in the fourteenth century he seem to have reach france as a archer under edward iii and to have remain a free-booter pass on to italy about 1362 to engage joyously in as much fighting as any english commander can ever have have for some thirty year with very good pay for it although by all account a very salomon brazenhead hawkwood have enough dignity to be appoint english ambassador to rome and later to florence which he make he home and where he die in 1394 he be bury in the duomo on the north side of the choir and be to have repose beneath a sumptuous monument make under he own instruction with fresco by taddeo gaddus and giuliano d'arrigo but something intervene and uccello 's fresco be use instead and this some sixty year ago be transfer to canvas and move to the position in which it now be see hawkwood 's life briskly tell by a full-blooded hand would make a fine book one pleasant story at least be related of he that on be beset by some beg friar who preface they mendicancy with the word god give you peace he answer god take away you alms and on they protest remind they that such peace be the last thing he require since should they pious wish come true he would die of hunger one of the daughter of this fire-eater marry john shelley and thus become a ancestress of shelley the poet who as it chance also find a home for a while in this city almost within hail distance of he ancestor 's tomb and portrait and here write not only he ode to the west wind but he caustic satire peter bell the third hawkwood 's name be steep sufficiently in carnage but we get to the scene of bloodshed in reality as we approach the choir for it be here that giuliano de ' medicus be assassinate as he attend high mass on April 26th 1478 with the connivance if not actually at the instigation of christ 's vicar himself pope sixtus iv florentine history be so eventful and so tortuous that beyond the bare outline give in chapter v i shall make in these page but little effort to follow it assume a certain amount of knowledge on the part of the reader but it must be state here that periodical revolt against the power and prestige of the medicus often occur and none be more desperate than that of the pazzus family in 1478 act with the support of the pope behind all and with the co-operation of girolamo riario nephew of the pope and salviatus archbishop of pisa the pazzus who be not only oppose to the temporal power of the medicus but be they rival in business -- both family be banker -- wish to rid florence of lorenzo and giuliano in order to be greater both civically and financially girolamo wish the removal of lorenzo and giuliano in order that hostility to he plan for add forlus and faenza to the territory of imolum which the pope have successfully win for he against lorenzo 's opposition might disappear the pope have various political reason for wish lorenzo 's and giuliano 's death and bring florence always headstrong and dangerous to heel while as for salviatus it be sufficient that he be archbishop of pisa florence 's ancient rival and foe but he be a thoroughly bad lot anyway assassination also be in the air for galeazzo marium sforza of milan have be stab in church in 1476 thus to some extent pave the way for this murder since lorenzo and sforza when act together have be practically unassailable in 1478 lorenzo be twenty-nine giuliano twenty-five lorenzo have be at the head of florentine affair for nine year and he be steadily grow in strength and popularity hence it be now or never the conspirator ' first idea be to kill the brother at a banquet which lorenzo be to give to the great-nephew of the pope the youthful cardinal raffaello riario who promise to be a amenable catspaw giuliano however have hurt he leg be not well enough to be present but as he would attend high mass the conspirator decide to act then that be to say it be then in the cathedral that the death of the medicus brother be to be effect meanwhile another detachment of conspirator under salviatus be to rise simultaneously to capture the signorium while the armed man of the party who be outside and inside the wall would begin they attack on the populace thus at the same moment medicus and city would fall such be the plan the actual assassin be francesco de ' pazzus and bernardo bandinus who be nominally friend of the medicus -lrb- francesco 's brother guglielmo have marry bianca de ' medici lorenzo 's sister -rrb- and two priest name maffeo da volterra and stefano da bagnone a professional bravo name montesecco be to have kill lorenzo but refuse on learn that the scene of the murder be to be a church at that he say he draw the line : murder anywhere else he could perform cheerfully but in a sacred building it be too much to ask he therefore do nothing but subsequently confess make the guilt of all he associate doubly certain when high mass begin it be find that giuliano be not present and francesco de ' pazzus and bandinus be send to persuade he to come -- a judas-like errand indeed on the way back it be say one of they affectionately place he arm round giuliano -- to see if he wear a shirt of mail -- remark to cover the action that he be get fat on he arrival giuliano take he place at the north side of the circular choir near the door which lead to the via de ' servus while lorenzo stand at the opposite side at the give signal bandinus and pazzus be to stab giuliano and the two priest be to stab lorenzo the signal be the breaking of the eucharistic wafer and at this solemn moment giuliano be instantly kill with one stab in the heart and nineteen elsewhere francesco so overdo he attack that he severely wound himself too but lorenzo be in time to see the beginning of the assault and make a movement to escape he prevent the priest from do aught but inflict a gash in he neck and spring away dash behind the altar to the old sacristy where certain of he friend who follow he bang the heavy bronze door on the pursue foe those in the cathedral mean-while be in a state of hysterical alarm the youthful cardinal be hurry into the new sacristy guglielmo de ' pazzus bellow forth he innocence in loud tone and he murderous brother and bandinus get off order be restore lorenzo be lead by a strong bodyguard to the palazzo medicus where he appear at a window to convince the momentarily increase crowd that he be still live meanwhile thing be go not much more satisfactorily for the pazzus at the palazzo vecchio where accord to the plan the gonfalonier cesare petruccus be to be either kill or secure the archbishop salviatus who be to effect this manage he interview so clumsily that petruccus suspect something those be suspicious time and instead of submit to capture himself turn the key on he visitor the pazzus faction in the city meanwhile hope that all have go well in the palazzo vecchio as well as in the cathedral -lrb- as they think -rrb- be run through the street call viva la libertà to be meet with counter cry of palle palle -- the palle be the ball on the medici escutcheon still to be see all over florence and its vicinity and on every curtain in the uffizus the truth gradually spread the city then rise for the medicus and justice begin to be do the archbishop be hand at once just as he be from a window of the palazzo vecchio francesco de ' pazzus who have get home to bed be drag to the palazzo and hang too the mob meanwhile be not idle and most of the pazzus be account for together with many follower -- although lorenzo publicly implore they to be merciful poliziano the scholar-poet and friend of lorenzo have leave a vivid account of the day with he own eye he see the hang salviatus in he last throe bite the hang francesco de pazzi old jacopo succeed in escape but not for long and a day or so later he too be hang bandinus get as far as constantinople but be bring back in chain and hang the two priest hide in the benedictine abbey in the city and for a while evade search but be find they be tear to piece by the crowd montesecco have confess be behead in the courtyard of the bargello the hanging of the chief conspirator be keep in the mind of the short-memoried florentine by a representation outside the palazzo vecchio by none other than the wistful spiritual botticellus while three effigy life size of lorenzo -- one of they with he bandaged neck -- be make by verrocchio in color wax and set up in place where prayer might be offer commemorative medal which may be see in the bargello be also strike and the family of pazzus be banish and its name remove by decree from the city 's archive poor giuliano who be generally beloved for he charm and youthful spirit be bury at s lorenzo in great state i have often attend high mass in this duomo choir -- the theater of the pazzus tragedy -- but never without thinking of that scene luca della robbia 's door to the new sacristy which give the young cardinal he safety have be finish only eleven year donatello be to have design they but he work at padua be too press the commission be then give to michelozzo donatello 's partner and to luca della robbia but it seem likely that luca do nearly all the door be in very high relief thus differ absolutely from donatello 's at s lorenzo which be in very low luca 's work here be sweet and mild rather than strong and the panel derive they principal charm from the angel who in pair attend the saint above the door be place at the time of lorenzo 's escape the beautiful cantorium also by luca which be now in the museum of the cathedral while above the door of the old sacristy be donatello 's cantorium commonplace new one now take they place in the semicircle over each door be a color relief by luca : that over the bronze door be the resurrection and the other the ascension and they be interesting not only for they beauty but as be the earliest-known example in luca 's newly-discovered glaze terra-cotta medium which be to do so much in the hand of himself he nephew andrea and he follower to make florence still lovelier and the legend of the virgin mary still sweeter but of the della robbias and they exquisite genius i shall say more later when we come to the bargello as different as would be possible to imagine be the genius of that younger sculptor the author of the pietà at the back of the altar near where we now stand who when luca finish these bronze door in 1467 be not yet bear -- michelangelo buonarrotus this group which be unfinished be the last the old and weary titan ever work at and it be mean to be part of he own tomb vasarus to whose life of the painter we shall be indebted as this book proceed for so much good human nature and who speak of michelangelo with peculiar authority since he be he friend pupil and correspondent tell we that once when he go to see the sculptor in rome near the end he find he at work upon this pietà but the sculptor be so dissatisfied with one portion that he let he lantern fall in order that vasarus might not see it say : i be so old that death frequently drag at my mantle to take I and one day my person will fall like this lantern the pietà be still in deep gloom as the master would have like but enough be reveal to prove its pathos and its power in the east end of the nave be the chapel of s zenobius contain a bronze reliquary by ghibertus with scene upon it from the life of this saint so important in florentine religious history it be however very hard to see and should be illuminate zenobius be bear at florence in the reign of constantine the great when christianity be by no mean the prevail religion of the city although the way have be pave by various martyr after study philosophy and preach with much acceptance zenobius be summon to rome by pope damasus on the pope 's death he become bishop of florence and do much say butler to extirpate the kingdom of satan the saint live in the ancient tower which still stand -- one of the few survivor of florence 's hundred of tower -- at the corner of the via por s marium -lrb- which lead from the mercato nuovo to the ponte vecchio -rrb- and the via lambertesca it be call the torre de ' girolamus and on s zenobius ' day -- may 25th -- be decorate with flower and since never be so many flower in the city of flower as at that time it be a sight to see the remains of the saint be move to the duomo although it have not then its dome from s lorenzo in 1330 and the simple column in the center of the road opposite ghibertus 's first baptistery door be erect to mark the event since on that very spot it be say stand a dead elm tree which when the bier of the saint chance to touch it immediately spring to life again and burst into leaf even the enthusiastic chronicler add into flower the result be that the tree be cut completely to piece by relic hunter but the column by the baptistery the work of brunelleschus -lrb- erect on the site of a earlier one -rrb- fortunately remain as evidence of the miracle ghibertus however do not choose this miracle but another for representation for not only do zenobius dead restore animation but while he be himself live he resuscitate two boy the one be a ward of he own the second be a ordinary florentine for whom the same modest boon be crave by he sorrowing parent it be one of these scene of resuscitation which ghiberti have design in bronze while ridolfo ghirlandaio paint it in a picture in the uffizus we shall see s zenobius again in the fresco by ridolfo 's father the great ghirlandaio in the palazzo vecchio while the portrait on the first pillar of the left aisle as one enter the cathedral be of zenobius too the date of the pazzus conspiracy be 1478 a few year later the same building witness the extraordinary effect of savonarolum 's oratory when such be the terrible picture he draw of the fate of unregenerate sinner that he listener ' hair be say actually to rise with fright savonarolum come towards the end of the renaissance to give it its death-blow by contrast there be a tablet on the right wall of the cathedral in honor of one who do much to bring about the paganism and sophistication against which the impassioned reformer utter he fiercest denunciation : marsilio ficino -lrb- 1433-1491 -rrb- the neo-platonist protegé of cosimo de ' medicus and friend both of piero de ' medicus and lorenzo to explain marsilio 's influence it be necessary to recede a little into history in 1439 cosimo de ' medici succeed in transfer the scene of the great council of the church to florence at this conference representative of the western church centre in rome meet those of the eastern church centre in constantinople which be still christian for the purpose of discuss various matter not the least of which be the protection of the eastern church against the infidel not only be constantinople continually threaten by the turk and in need of arm as well as sympathy but the two branch of the church be at enmity over a number of point it be as much to heal these difference as to seek temporal aid that the emperor john palaeologus the patriarch of constantinople and a vast concourse of noble priest and greek scholar arrive in italy and after sojourn at venice and ferrara move on to florence at the invitation of cosimo the emperor reside in the peruzzus palace now no more near s croce the patriarch of constantinople lodge -lrb- and as it chance die for he be very old -rrb- at the ferrantinus palace now the casa vernaccia in the borgo pintus while pope eugenius be at the convent attach to s marium novellum the meeting of the council be hold where we now stand -- in the cathedral whose dome have just be place upon it all ready for they the council fail in its purpose and as we know constantinople be lose some year later and the great empire of which john palaeologus be the last ruler cease to be that however at the moment be beside the mark the interesting thing to we be that among the scholar who come from constantinople bring with they number of manuscript and system of thought wholly new to the florentine be one georgius gemistho a greek philosopher of much personal charm and comeliness who talk a bland and beautiful platonism that be extremely alluring not only to he youthful listener but also to cosimo himself gemistho be however a greek and cosimo be too busy a man in a city of enemy or at any rate of the envious to be able to do much more than extend he patronage to the old man and despatch emissary to the east for more and more manuscript but discerning the allurement of the new gospel cosimo direct a florentine enthusiast who know greek to spread the serene creed among he friend who be all ripe for it and this enthusiast be none other than a youthful scholar by name marsilio ficino connect with s lorenzo cosimo 's family church and the son of cosimo 's own physician to the young and ardent marsilio plato become a god and gemistho not less than divine for bring the tiding he keep a lamp always burn before plato 's bust and later found the platonic academy at which plato 's work be discuss oration deliver and new dialogue exchange between such keen mind as marsilio pulcus landinus giovannus cavalcantus leon battista alberti the architect and scholar pico dell a mirandolum the precocious disputant and aristocratic mystic poliziano the tutor of lorenzo 's son and lorenzo the magnificent himself it be thus from the greek invasion of florence that proceed the stream of culture which be know as humanism and which no doubt in time be so largely concern in bring about that indifference to spiritual thing which lead to general laxity and indulgence fill savonarolum with despair i be not concern to enter deeply into the subject of the renaissance but this must be say -- that the new painting and sculpture particularly the painting of masaccio and the sculpture of donatello have show the world that the human being could be make the measure of the divine the madonna and christ have be relate to life the new learning by lead these keen tuscan intellect so eager for reasonableness to the greek philosopher who be so wise and so calm without any of the consolation of christianity naturally set they wonder if there be not a religion of humanity that be perhaps a finer thing than the religion that require all the machinery and intrigue of rome and when as the knowledge of greek spread and the minute examination of document ensue it be find that rome have not disdain forgery to gain she end a blow be strike against the church from which it never recover -- and how much of this be due to this florentine marsilio sit at the foot of the greek gemistho who come to florence at the invitation of cosimo de ' medici the cathedral glass as i say be mostly overladen with grime but the circular window in the dome seem to be magnificent in design they be attribute to ghibertus and donatello and be lovely in color the green in particular be very striking but the jewel of these circular window of florence be that by ghibertus on the west wall of s croce and here i leave the duomo with the counsel to visitor to florence to make a point of enter it every day -- not as so many florentine do in order to make a short cut from the via calzaiolus to the via de ' servus and vice versâ but to gather its spirit it be different every hour in the day and every hour the light enter it with new beauty chapter iii the duomo iii : a ceremony and a museum the scoppio del carro -- the pazzus beneficent -- holy Saturday 's program -- April 6th 1912 -- the fly palle -- the nervous pyrotechnist -- the influence of noon -- a little sister of the duomo -- donatello 's cantorium -- luca della robbia 's cantorium in the last chapter we see the pazzus family as very black sheep although there be plenty of student of florentine history who hold that any attempt to rid florence of the medicus be laudable in this chapter we see they in a kindlier situation as benefactor to the city for it happen that when pazzo de ' pazzi a founder of the house be in the holy land during the first crusade it be he proud lot to set the christian banner on the wall of jerusalem and as a reward godfrey of boulogne give he some flint from the holy sepulchre these he bring to florence and they be now preserve at ss apostolus the little church in the piazza del limbo off the borgo ss apostolus and every year the flint be use to kindle the fire need for the right preservation of easter day gradually the ceremony enlarged until it become a spectacle indeed which the pazzus family for century control after the pazzus conspiracy they lose it and the signorium take it over but on be pardon the pazzus again resume the carro be a car contain explosive and the scoppio be its explosion this car after be draw in procession through the street by white ox be ignite by the sacred fire bear to it by a mechanical dive liberate at the high altar of the duomo and with its explosion easter begin there be still a pazzus fund towards the expense but a few year ago the city become responsible for the whole proceedings and the ceremony as it be now give under civic management know as the scoppio del cairo be that which i see on holy Saturday last and be about to describe first however let I state what have happen before the proceedings open in the piazza del duomo at six o'clock mass begin at ss apostolus last for more than two hour at its close the celebrant be hand a plate on which be the sacred flint and these he strike with a steel in view of the congregation thus ignite a taper the candle in a ancient copper porta fuoco surmount by a dive be then light and the procession of priest start off for the cathedral with they precious flame escort by a civic guard and various standard bearer they route be the piazza del limbo along the borgo ss apostolus to the via por s marium and through the vacchereccium to the piazza della signoria the via condotta the via del proconsolo to the duomo through whose central door they pass deposit the sacred burden at the high altar i should add that anyone on the route in charge of a street shrine have the right to stop the procession in order to take a light from it while at ss apostolus woman congregate with taper and lantern in the hope of get these kindle from the sacred flame in order to wash they baby or cook they food in water heat with the fire meanwhile at seven o'clock the four ox which be keep in the cascine all the year round and do no other work have be harness to the car and have draw it to the piazza del duomo which be reach about nine the ox be then tethered by the pisano door of the baptistery until need again after some haggle on the night before i have secure a seat on a balcony face ghibertus 's first baptistery door for eleven lira and to this place i go at half-past ten the piazza be then fill up and at a quarter to eleven the tram run between the cathedral and the baptistery be stop in this space be the car the present one which date from 1622 be more like a catafalque and unless one see it in motion with the massive white ox pull it one can not believe in it as a vehicle at all it be some thirty foot high all black with trumpery coloured-paper festoon -lrb- conceal firework -rrb- upon it : trumpery as only the roman catholic church can contrive it stand in front of the duomo some four yard from the baptistery gate in a line with the duomo 's central door and the high altar the door be open seat be place on each side of the aisle the whole distance and people make a solid avenue down this avenue be to come the clergy and above it be to be stretch the line on which the dive be to travel from the altar with the pazzus fire to ignite the car the space in front of the cathedral be clear at about eleven and cocked hat and red-striped trousers then become the most noticeable feature the crowd be jolly and perhaps a little cynical picture-postcard hawker make most of the noise and for some reason or other a forlorn peasant take this opportunity to offer for sale two equally forlorn hedgehog each moment the concourse increase for it be a fateful day and every one want to know the issue : because you see if the dive run true light the car and return as a good dive should to the altar ark there will be a prosperous vintage and the pyrotechnist who control the sacred bird 's movement will receive he wages but if the dive run defectively and there be any hitch every one be dismayed for the harvest will be bad and the pyrotechnist will receive nothing once he be imprison when thing go astray -- and quite right too -- but the florentine have grow more lenient at about a quarter past eleven a procession of clergy emerge from the duomo and cross the space to the baptistery first boy and youth in surplice then some scarlet hood waddle then purple hood and other color a little paunchier waddle more and lastly the archbishop very sumptuous all have disappear into the baptistery through ghibertus 's second gate which i never see open before the dive 's wire be stretch and fasten a matter need much care and the crowd begin to surge the cocked hat and officer have the space all to themselves with the car the fireman the pyrotechnist and the few privileged and very self-conscious civilian who be allow inside a curious incident which many year ago might have be magnify into a portent occur while the ecclesiastic be in the artistry some one either buy and liberate several air balloon or the string hold they be surreptitiously cut but however it happen the ball escape and suddenly the crowd send up a triumphant yell at first i could see no reason for it the baptistery intervene but then the ball swim into we ken and steadily float over the cathedral out of sight amid tremendous satisfaction and the portent well as they move against the blue sky they form themselves into precisely the pattern of the palle on the medicus escutcheon that be all but think what that would have mean in the fifteenth century the nod and frown it would have occasion the dispersal of the medicus the loss of power and all the rest of it that it would have presage at about twenty to twelve the ecclesiastic return and be swallow up by the duomo and then excitement begin to be acute the pyrotechnist be not free from it he fuss about nervously he test everything again and again he crawl under the car and out of it he talk to official he inspect and re-inspect photographer begin to adjust they distance the detach man in bowler look at they watch the cocked hat draw nearer to the duomo door and then we hear a tear noise all eye be turn to the great door and out rush the dive emit a wake of spark enter the car and be out again on its homeward journey before one realize what have happen and then the explosion begin and the bell -- silent since Thursday -- break out how many explosion there be i do not know but they seem to go on for ten minute this be a great moment not only for the spectator but for all florence for in myriad room mother have be wait with they baby on they knee for the first clang of the belfry because if a child 's eye be wash then it be unlikely ever to have weak sight while if a baby take its first step to this accompaniment its leg will not be bow at the last explosion the pyrotechnist now a calm man once more and a proud one approach the car the fireman pour water on smoulder part and the work of clear up begin then come the patient oxen they horn and hoof gilt and great mass of flower on they head and red cloth with the lily of florence on it over they back -- much to be regret since they obliterate they beautiful white skin -- and slowly the car lumber off and the cocked hat relent the crowd pour after it and the scoppio del carro be over the duomo have a little sister in the shape of the museo di santa maria del fiore or the museo dell ' opera del duomo situate in the piazza opposite the apse and we should go there now this museum which be at once the smallest and with the exception of the natural history museum the cheapest of the florentine museum for it cost but half a lira be notable for contain the two cantorie or singing gallery make for the cathedral one by donatello and one by luca della robbia a cantorium by donatello we shall soon see in its place in s lorenzo but that beautiful as it be can not compare with this one with its procession of merry dancing child its massiveness and grace its joyous ebullition of gold mosaic and blue enamel both the cantorie -- donatello 's begin in 1433 and finish in 1439 and luca 's begin in 1431 and finish in 1438 -- fulfil they melodious function in the duomo until 1688 when they be ruthlessly clear away to make room for large wooden balcony to be use in connexion with the nuptials of ferdinand de ' medicus and the princess violante of bavarium in the year 1688 taste be at a low ebb and no one think the depose cantorie even worth preservation so that they be break up and occasionally levy upon for cornice and so forth the fragment be collect and take to the bargello in the middle of the last century and in 1883 signer del moro the then architect of the duomo -lrb- whose bust be in the courtyard of this museum -rrb- reconstruct they to the best of he ability in they present situation it have to be remember not only that with the exception of the figure the gallery be not as they artist make they lack many beautiful accessory but that as vasarus tell we donatello deliberately design he for a dim light none the less they remain two of the most delightful work of the renaissance and two of the rarest treasure of florence the dancing boy behind the small pillar with they gold chequere the bracket and the urn of the cornice over the second pair of pillar from the right be all that remain of donatello 's own handiwork all else be new and conjectural it be suppose that bronze head of lion fill the two circular space between the bracket in the middle but although the loss of the work as a whole be to be regret the dancing boy remain to be for ever a inspiration and a pleasure the luca della robbia cantoria opposite be not quite so triumphant a masterpiece but from the point of view of suitability it be perhaps better we can believe that luca 's child hymn the glory of the lord as indeed the inscription make they whereas donatello 's romp with a gladness that might easily be purely pagan luca 's design be more formal more conventional donatello 's be rich and free and fluid with personality the two end panel of luca 's be supply in the cantorium by cast the original be on the wall below and may be carefully study the animation and fervor of these chorister be unforgettable it be well while enjoy donatello 's work to remember that prato be only half a hour from florence and that there may be see the open-air pulpit build on the corner of the cathedral which donatello with michelozzo he friend and colleague make at the same time that the cantorium be in progress and which in its relief of happy child be very similar although not i think quite so remarkable it lack also the peculiarly naturalistic effect gain in the cantorium by set the dancing boy behind the pillar which undoubtedly as comparison with the luca show assist realism the row of pillar attract the eye first and the boy be thus throw into a background which almost move although the cantorie dominate the museum they must not be allow to overshadow all else a marble relief of the madonna and child by agostino di duccio -lrb- 1418-1481 -rrb- must be seek for : it be no 77 and the child be the merriest in florence another memorable madonna and child be no 94 by pagno di lapo portigiani -lrb- 1406-1470 -rrb- who have interest for we in this place as be one of donatello 's assistant very possibly on this very cantoria and almost certainly on the prato pulpit everything here it must be remember have some association with the duomo and be bring here for careful preservation and that whoever have fifty centime might take pleasure in see it but the great silver altar be from the baptistery and be make for that temple be naturally dedicate to the life of john the baptist although much of it be the work of not the greatest modeller in the second half of the fourteenth century three master at least contribute later : michelozzo add the statue of the baptist pollaiuolo the side relief depict he birth and verrocchio that of he death which be consider one of the most remarkable work of this sculptor whom we be to find so richly represent at the bargello before leave this room look for 100 ^ 3 a unknown terra-cotta of the birth of eve which be both masterly and amusing and 110 ^ 4 a very lovely intaglio in wood i might add that among the few painting all very early be a s sebastian in whose sacred body i count no fewer than thirty arrow which within my knowledge of picture of this saint -- not inconsiderable -- be the highest number the next room be give to model and architectural plan and drawing connect with the cathedral the most interesting thing be brunelleschus 's own model for the lantern on the stair be a series of fine bas-relief by bandinellus and giovannus dell ' opera from the old choir screen of the duomo and downstairs among many other piece of sculpture be a bust of brunelleschus from a death-mask and several beautiful dellum robbium design for lunette over door chapter iv the campanile and the baptistery a short way with veronese critic -- giotto 's miss spire -- donatello 's holy man -- giotto as encyclopaedist -- the seven and twenty relief -- ruskin in american -- at the top of the tower -- a sea of red roof -- the restful baptistery -- historic stone -- a ex-pope 's tomb -- andrea pisano 's door -- ghibertus 's first door -- ghibertus 's second door -- michelangelo 's praise -- a gentleman artist it be in 1332 as i have say that giotto be make capo-maestro and on July 18th 1334 the first stone of he campanile be lay the understanding be that the structure be to exceed in magnificence height and excellence of workmanship anything in the world as some further indication of the glorious feeling of patriotism then animate the florentine it may be remark that when a veronese who happen to be in florence venture to suggest that the city be aim rather too high he be at once throw into gaol and on be set free when he time be do be show the treasury as a object lesson of the wealth and purposefulness of florence at that time in spite of the disastrous bellicose period she have be pass through villanus the historian who write history as it be be make give a excellent account which macaulay summarize in he vivid way thus : the revenue of the republic amount to three hundred thousand florin a sum which allow for the depreciation of the precious metal be at least equivalent to six hundred thousand pound sterling a larger sum than england and ireland two century ago yield to elizabeth the manufacture of wool alone employ two hundred factory and thirty thousand workman the cloth annually produce sell at a average for twelve hundred thousand florin a sum fully equal in exchangeable value to two million and a half of we money four hundred thousand florin be annually coin eighty bank conduct the commercial operation not of florence only but of all europe the transaction of these establishment be sometimes of a magnitude which may surprise even the contemporary of the baring and the rothschild two house advance to edward iii of england upward of three hundred thousand mark at a time when the mark contain more silver than fifty shilling of the present day and when the value of silver be more than quadruple of what it now be the city and its environs contain a hundred and seventy thousand child inhabitant in the various school about ten thousand child be teach to read twelve hundred study arithmetic six hundred receive a learn education giotto die in 1386 and after he death as i have say andrea pisano come in for a while to be follow by talentus who be say to have make considerable alteration in giotto 's design and to be responsible for the happy idea of increase the height of the window with the height of the tower and thus add to the illusion of spring lightness the topmost one so bold in size and so lovely with they spiral column almost seem to lift it the campanile to-day be 276 foot in height and giotto propose to add to that a spire of 105 foot the florentine complete the façade of the cathedral in 1887 and be now spend enormous sum on the medicus chapel at s lorenzo why should they not one day carry out they greatest artist 's intention the campanile as a structure have be finish in 1387 but not for many year do it receive its statue of which something must be say although it be impossible to get more than a vague idea of they so high be they a captive balloon should be arrange for the use of visitor those by donatello on the baptistery side be the most remarkable the first of these -- that nearest to the cathedral and the most striking as see from the distant earth -- be call john the baptist always a favorite subject with this sculptor who since he more than any at that thoughtful time endeavor to discover and disclose the secret of character be curiously unfortunate in the accident that have fasten name to these figure this john for example bear no relation to he other baptist nor do the next figure represent david as be generally suppose but owe that error to the circumstance that when the david that originally stand here be move to the north side the old plinth bear he name be leave behind this famous figure be state by vasarus to be a portrait of a florentine merchant name barduccio cherichinus and for century it have be know as il zuccone -lrb- or pumpkin -rrb- from its baldness donatello accord to vasarus have a particular liking for the work so much that he use to swear by it while when engage upon it he be say to have so believe in its reality as to exclaim speak speak or may a dysentery seize thee it be now generally consider to represent job and we can not too much regret the impossibility of get near enough to study it next be the jeremiah which accord to vasarus be a portrait of another florentine but which since he bear he name on a scroll may none the less be take to realize the sculptor 's idea of jeremiah it be -lrb- accord to the photograph -rrb- a fine piece of rugged vivacity and the head be absolutely that of a real man on the opposite side of the tower be the magnificent abraham 's sacrifice from the same strong hand and by it habakkuk who be no less near life than the jeremiah and job but a very different type at both or san michele and the bargello we be to find donatello perhaps in a finer mood than here and comfortably visible for most visitor to florence and all disciple of ruskin the chief interest of the campanile -lrb- the shepherd 's tower as he call it -rrb- be the series of twenty-seven relief illustrate the history of the world and the progress of mankind which be to be see round the base the design it be suppose of giotto execute by andrea pisano and luca dellum robbium to andrea be give all those on the west -lrb- 7 -rrb- south -lrb- 7 -rrb- east -lrb- 5 -rrb- and the two eastern one on the north to luca the remain five on the north ruskin 's fascinating analysis of these relief should most certainly be read -lrb- without a total forgetfulness of the shepherd 's other activity as a painter architect humorist and friend of prince and poet -rrb- but equally certainly not in the american pirate edition which the florentine bookseller be so ready -lrb- to they shame -rrb- to sell you only ruskin in he best mood of fury could begin to do justice to the misspelling and mispunctuation of this terrible production ruskin i may say believe several of the carving to be from giotto 's own chisel as well as design but other and more modern authority disagree although opinion now incline to the belief that the design for pisano 's baptistery door be also he such thoroughness and ingenuity be all in giotto 's way and they certainly suggest he active mind the campanile series begin at the west side with the creation of man among the most attractive be i think those devote to agriculture with the spirited ox to astronomy to architecture to weave and to pottery giotto be even so thorough as to give one relief to the conquest of the air and he make noah most satisfactorily drunk note also the florentine fleur-de-lis round the base of the tower every fleur-de-lis in florence be beautiful -- even those on advertisement and fire-plug -- but few be more beautiful than these i climb the campanile one fine morning -- 417 step from the ground -- and be well repay but i think it be wiser to ascend the tower of the palazzo vecchio because one be higher there and since the bulk of the dome which intrude from the campanile be avoid one have a better all-round view florence see from this eminence be very red -- so uniformly so that many tower rise against it almost indistinguishably particularly the bargello 's and the badium 's one see at once how few straight street there be -- the ricasolus stand out among they as the exception and one realize how the city have develop outside with its boulevard where the wall once be leave the gate isolate and its cincture of factory the occasional glimpse of cloister and verdure among the red be very pleasant one of the object cut off by the cathedral dome be the english cemetery but the modern jewish temple stand out as noticeably almost as any of the ancient building the pittus look like nothing but a barracks and the porta ferdinando have prominence which it get from no other point the roof of the mercato centrale be the ugliest thing in the view while i be there the midday gun from the boboli fortress be fire instantly have its punctual double effect of send all the pigeon up in a gray cloud of simulated alarm and start every bell in the city those wish to make either the campanile or duomo ascent must remember to do it early the close hour for the day be twelve no one be allow to start up after about a quarter past eleven : a very foolish arrangement since florence and the surround apennine under a slanting sun be more beautiful than in the morning glare and the ascent would be less fatiguing as it be on descend after be so long at the top i be severely reprimand by the custodian who have previously mark I down as a barbarian for refuse he offer of field-glass but the palazzo vecchio tower be open till five the baptistery be the beautiful octagonal building opposite the cathedral and once the cathedral itself it date from the seventh or eighth century but as we see it now be a product chiefly of the thirteenth the bronze door opposite the via calzaiolus be open every day a circumstance which visitor baffle by the two set of ghibertus door always so firmly close be apt to overlook all child bear in florence be still baptize here and i watch one afternoon a old priest at the task a tiny florentine be bring in to receive the name of tosca which she do with less distaste than most consider how thorough be he sprinkle the baptistery be rich in color both without and within the floor alone be a marvel of intricate inlay include the sign of the zodiac and a gnomic sentence which read the same backwards and forwards -- en gire torte sol ciclo et roterigne on this very pavement dante who call the church he beautiful san giovannus have walk over the altar be a gigantic and primitive christ in mosaic more splendid than spiritual the mosaic in the recess of the clerestory -- gray and white -- be the most soft and lovely of all i believe the baptistery be the most restful place in florence and this be rather odd consider that it be all marble and mosaic pattern but its shape be very soothing and age have give it a quality of its own and there be just that touch of barbarism about it such as one get in byzantine building to lend it a peculiar character here the most notable sculpture in the baptistery be the tomb of the ex-pope john xxiii whose licentiousness be such that there be nothing for it but to depose and imprison he he have however much money and on he liberation he settle in florence present a true finger of john the baptist to the baptistery and arrange in return for he bone to repose in that sanctuary one of he executor be that niccolò da uzzano the head of the noble faction in the city whose color bust by donatello be in the bargello the tomb be exceedingly fine the work of donatello and he partner michelozzo who be engage to make it by giovannus de ' medici the ex-pontiff 's friend and the father of the great cosimo the design be all donatello 's and he the recumbent cleric lie very naturally hardly as if dead at all a little on one side so that he face be see nearly full the three figure beneath be michelozzo 's but donatello probably carve the seat angel who display the scroll which bear the dead pope 's name the madonna and child above be by donatello 's assistant pagno di lapo portigiani a pretty relief by whom we see in the museum of the cathedral be in red stone and very dusty like ghibertus 's door -lrb- which want the hose regularly -rrb- the line of the tomb be much impaired donatello be also represent here by a mary magdalene in wood on a altar at the left of the entrance door very powerful and poignant in the ordinary way when visitor to florence speak of the baptistery door they mean those opposite the duomo and when they go to the bargello and look at the design make by ghibertus and brunelleschus in competition they think that the competition be for those but that be wrong ghibertus win he spur with the door on the north side at which comparatively few person look the famous door opposite the duomo be commission many year later when he genius be acknowledge and when he have become so accomplish as to do what he like with he medium before however come to ghiberti we ought to look at the work of a early predecessor but for whom there might have be no ghibertus at all for while ghibertus be at work with he assistant on these north door between 1403 and 1424 the place which they occupy be fill by those execute seventy year earlier by andrea pisano -lrb- 1270-1348 -rrb- possibly from giotto 's design which be now at the south entrance opposite the charming little loggia at the corner of the via calzaiolus call the bigallo these represent twenty scene in the life of s john the baptist and below they be eight figure of cardinal and christian virtue and they employ they sculptor from 1330 to 1336 they have three claim to notice : as be admirably simple and vigorous in themselves as have influence all later worker in this medium and particularly ghibertus and donatello and as be the bronze work of the sculptor of certain of the stone scene round the base of giotto 's campanile the panel in which the baptist be see up to he waist in the water be surely the very last word in audacity in bronze ghibertus be charge with make bronze do thing that it be ill fit for but i do not know that even he mould water -- and transparent water -- from it the year 1399 be one of the most notable in the history of modern art since it be then that the competition for the baptistery gate be make public this announcement be the spring from which many river flow in that year lorenzo ghibertus a young goldsmith assist he father be twenty-one and filippo brunelleschus another goldsmith be twenty-two while giotto have be dead sixty-three year and the impulse he have give to painting have almost work itself out the new door be to be of the same shape and size as those by andrea pisano which be already get on for seventy year old and candidate be invite to make a specimen relief to scale represent the interrupted sacrifice of isaac although the subject-matter of the door be to be the life of s john the baptist among the judge be that florentine banker whose name be begin to be know in the city as a synonym for philanthropy enlightenment and sagacity giovannus de ' medicus in 1401 the specimen be ready and after much deliberation as to which be the better ghibertus 's or brunelleschus 's -- assist some say by brunelleschus 's own advice in favor of he rival -- the award be give to ghibertus and he be instruct to proceed with he task while brunelleschus as we have see be a man of determine ambition leave for rome to study architecture have make up he mind to be second to no one in whichever of the art and craft he decide to pursue here then be the first result of the competition -- that it turn brunelleschus to architecture ghibertus begin seriously in 1408 and continue till 1424 when the door be finish but in order to carry out the work he require assistance in casting and so forth and for that purpose engage among other a sculptor name donatello -lrb- bear in 1386 -rrb- a younger sculptor name luca dellum robbium -lrb- bear in 1400 -rrb- and a gigantic young painter call masaccio -lrb- bear in 1401 -rrb- each of whom be destine take fire no doubt from ghibertus and he fine free way to be a powerful innovator -- donatello -lrb- apart from other and rarer achievement -rrb- be the first sculptor since antiquity to place a statue on a pedestal around which observer could walk masaccio be the first painter to make picture in the modern use of the term with man and woman of flesh and blood in they as distinguish from decorative saint and to be by example the instructor of all the greatest master from he pupil lippo lippus to leonardo and michelangelo and luca dellum robbium be the inspired discoverer of a inexpensive means of glaze terra-cotta so that he beautiful and radiant madonna could be bring within the purchase means of the poorest congregation in italy these alone be remarkable enough result but when we recollect also that brunelleschus 's defeat lead to the building of the cathedral dome the significance of the event become the more extraordinary the door as i say be finish in 1424 after twenty-one year ' labor and the signorium leave the palazzo vecchio in procession to see they installation in the number and shape of the panel pisano set the standard but ghibertus 's work resemble that of he predecessor very little in other way for he have a mind of domestic sweetness without austerity and he be interested in make everything as easy and fluid and beautiful as might be he thoroughness recall giotto in certain of he fresco the impression leave by pisano 's door be akin to that leave by read the new testament but ghibertus make everything happier than that two scene -- both on the level of the eye -- i particularly like : the annunciation with its little lithe reluctant virgin and the adoration the border of the pisano door be i think finer than that of ghibertus 's but it be a later work look at they even now with eye that remember so much of the best art that follow they and take inspiration from they we can understand the better how delighted florence must have be with this new picture gallery and how the door be besiege by sightseer but greater still be to come ghibertus at once receive the commission to make two more door on he own scale for the south side of the baptistery and in 1425 he have begin on they these be not finish until 1452 so that ghibertus then a man of seventy-four have give practically he whole life to the making of four bronze door it be true that he do a few other thing besides such as the casket of s zenobius in the duomo and the baptist and s matthew for or san michele but he may be say justly to live by he door and particularly by the second pair although it be the first pair that have the greater effect on he contemporary and follower among he assistant on these be antonio pollaiuolo -lrb- bear in 1429 -rrb- who design the quail in the left border and paolo uccello -lrb- bear in 1397 -rrb- both destine to be man of influence the bald head on the right door be a portrait of ghibertus that of the old man on the left be he father who help he to polish the original competition plaque although commission for the south side they be place where they now be on the east as be most worthy of the position of honor and pisano 's door which use to be here be move to the south where they now be on ghibertus 's workshop opposite s marium nuova in the via bufalinus the memorial tablet mention michelangelo 's praise -- that these door be beautiful enough to be the gate of paradise after that what be a ordinary person to say that they be lovely be a commonplace but they be more they be so sensitive bronze the medium which horace have call by implication the most durable of all have become in ghibertus 's hand almost as soft as wax and tender as flesh it do all he ask it almost move every trace of sternness have vanish from it nothing in plastic art that we have ever see or shall see be more easy and ingratiating than these almost live picture before they there be steadily a little knot of admirer and on sunday you may always see country people explain the panel to each other every one have he favorite among these fascinating biblical scene and mine be cain and abel with the ploughing and abraham and isaac with its row of fir tree it have be explain by the purist that the sculptor stretch the bound of plastic art too far and make bronze paint picture but most person will agree to ignore that of the charm of ghibertus 's mind the border give further evidence with its fruit and foliage bird and woodland creature so true to life and here fix for all time so naturally that if these animal should ever -lrb- as be not unlikely in italy where every one have a gun and shoot at he pleasure -rrb- become extinct they could be create again from these design ghibertus who enjoy great honor in he life and a considerable salary as joint architect of the dome with brunelleschus die three year after the completion of the second door and be bury in s croce he place in florentine art be unique and glorious the broken porphyry pillar by these second door be a gift from pisa to florence in recognition of florence 's watchfulness over pisa while the pisan be away subdue the balearic islander the bronze group over ghibertus 's first door represent john the baptist preach between a pharisee and a levite be the work -lrb- either alone or assist by he master leonardo da vincus -rrb- of a interesting florentine sculptor giovannus francesco rusticus -lrb- 1474-1554 -rrb- who be remarkable among the artist of he time in be what we should call a amateur have a competence of he own and the manners of a patron place himself under verrocchio he become closely attach to leonardo a fellow-pupil and make he he model rather than the older man he take he art lightly and live in vasarus 's phrase free from care have such beguilement as a tame menagerie -lrb- leonardo it will be remembered loved animal too and have a habit of buy small caged bird in order to set they free -rrb- and two or three dine club the member of which vie with each other in devise curious and exotic dish andrea del sarto for example once bring as he contribution to the feast a model of this very church we be study the baptistery of which the floor be construct of jelly the pillar of sausage and the choir desk of cold veal while the chorister be roast thrush rustici further pave the way to a life free from care by appoint a steward of he estate whose duty it be to see that he money-box to which he go whenever he want anything always have money in it this box he never lock have learn that he need fear no robbery by once leave he cloak for two day under a bush and then find it again this world he exclaim be too good : it will not last among he pet be a porcupine train to prick the leg of he guest under the table so that they draw they in quickly a raven that speak like a human be a eagle and many snake he also study necromancy the better to frighten he apprentice he leave florence in 1528 after the medicus expulsion and like leonardo take service with franci the first he die at the age of eighty i have a hour and more exactly opposite the rusticus group on the same level while wait for the scoppio del carro and i find it easy to believe that leonardo himself have a hand in the work the figure of the baptist be superb the attitude of he listener masterly chapter v the riccardus palace and the medicus a evasion of history -- il caparra -- the gozzolus fresco -- giovannus de ' medicus -lrb- di bicci -rrb- -- cosimo de '

lorenzo de ' medici -- clement vii -- third banishment of the medicus -- the siege of florence -- alessandro de ' medicus -- ippolito de ' medicus -- lorenzino de ' medici -- giovannus delle bande nere -- cosimo i -- the grand duke the natural step from the baptistery would be to the uffizus but for we not yet because in order to understand florence and particularly the florence that exist between the extreme date that i have choose as contain the fascinating period -- namely 1296 when the duomo be begin and 1564 when michelangelo die -- one must understand who and what the medicus be while i have be enjoy the pleasant task of write this book -- which have be more agreeable than any literary work i have ever do -- i have continually be conscious of a plaintive voice at my shoulder proceed from one of the vigilant and embarrassing imp who sit there and do duty as conscience inquire if the time be not about ripe for introduce that historical sketch of florence without which no account such as this can be rightly understand and ever i have reply with word of a soothing and procrastinating nature but now that we be face to face with the medicus family in they very house i be conscious that the occasion for that historical sketch be here indeed and equally i be conscious of be quite incapable of supply it for the history of florence between say the birth of giotto or dante and the return of cosimo de ' medicus from exile when the absolute medicus rule begin be so turbulent crowd and complex that it would require the whole of this volume to describe it the change in the government of the city would alone occupy a good third so constant and complicated be they i should have to explain the guelph and the ghibelline the nerus and the bianchus the guild and the prior the gonfalonierus and the podesta the secondo popolo and the buonuominus rather than do this imperfectly i have choose to do it not at all and the curious must resort to historian proper but there be at the end of the volume a table of the chief date in florentine and european history in the period choose together with birth and death of artist and poet and other important person so that a bird 's - eye view of the progress of affair can be quickly gain while in this chapter i offer a outline of the great family of ruler of florence who make the little city a aesthetic lawgiver to the world and with whom she later fame good or ill be indissolubly unite for the rest be there not the library the medicus once so powerful and stimulating be still ever in the background of florence as one wander hither and thither they be behind many of the best picture and most of the best statue they escutcheon be everywhere i ought i believe to have make they the subject of my first chapter but since i do not let we without further delay turn to the via cavor which run away to the north from the baptistery be a continuation of the via de ' martellus and pause at the massive and dignified palace at the first corner on the leave for that be the medicus 's home and afterwards we will step into s lorenzo and see the church which brunelleschus and donatello make beautiful and michelangelo wonderful that the medicus might lie there visitor go to the riccardus palace rather to see gozzolus 's fresco than anything else and indeed apart from the noble solid renaissance architecture of michelozzo there be not much else to see in the courtyard be certain fragment of antique sculpture arrange against the wall and a sarcophagus be show in which a early member of the family guccio de ' medicus who be gonfalonier in 1299 once repose there too be donatello 's eight medallion but they be not very interesting be only enlarged copy of old medal and cameo and not notable for he own characteristic hence it be that after gozzolus by far the most interesting part of this building be its association for here live cosimo de ' medici whose building of the palace be interrupt by he banishment as a citizen of dangerous ambition here live piero de ' medicus for whom gozzolus work here be bear and here live lorenzo the magnificent to this palace come the pazzus conspirator to lure giuliano to the duomo and he doom here do charles viii -- savonarolum 's flagellum dei -- lodge and loot and it be here that capponus frighten he with the threat of the florentine bell hither come in 1494 the fickle and terrible florentine mob always passionate in its pursuit of change and excitement and now inflamed by the sermon of savonarolum to destroy the priceless manuscript and work of art here be bring up for a year or so the little catherine de ' medicus and next door be the house in which alessandro de ' medicus be murder it be in the seventeenth century that the palace pass to the riccardus family who make many addition a century later florence acquire it and to-day it be the seat of the prefect of the city cosimo 's original building be smaller but much of it remain untouched the exquisite cornice be michelozzo 's original and the courtyard have merely lose its statue among which be donatello 's judith now in the loggia de ' lanzus and he bronze david now in the bargello while verrocchio 's david be probably on the stair the escutcheon on the corner of the house give we the period of its erection the seven plain ball proclaim it cosimo 's each of the medicus sport these palle although each have also he private crest under giovannus cosimo 's father the ball be eight in number under cosimo seven under piero seven with the fleur-de-lis of france on the uppermost give he by loui xi under lorenzo six and as one walk about florence one can approximately fix the date of a building by remember these change how many time they occur on the façades of florence and its vicinity probably no one could say but they be everywhere the french wit who be amuse to derive catherine de ' medicus from a family of apothecary call they pill the beautiful lantern at the corner be add by lorenzo and be the work of a odd ironsmith in florence for whom he have a great liking -- niccolò grosso for lorenzo have all that delight in character which belong so often to the bear patron and usually to the bear connoisseur this grosso be a man of humorous independence and bluntness he have the admirable custom of carry out he commission in the order in which they arrive so that if he be at work upon a set of fire-iron for a poor client not even lorenzo himself -lrb- who as a matter of fact often try -rrb- could induce he to turn to something more lucrative the rich who can not wait he force to wait grosso also always insist upon something in advance and payment on delivery and pleasantly describe he workshop as be the sign of the burning book -- since if he book be burnt how could he enter a debt this rule earn for he from lorenzo the nickname of il caparra -lrb- earnest money -rrb- another of grosso 's eccentricity be to refuse to work for jew within the palace up stair be the little chapel which gozzolus make so gay and fascinating that it be probably the very gem among the private chapel of the world here not only do the medicus perform they devotions -- lorenzo 's corner seat be still show and anyone may sit in it -- but they splendor and taste be reflect on the wall cosimo as we shall see when we reach s marco invite fra angelico to paint upon the wall of that convent sweet and simple fresco to the glory of god piero employ fra angelico 's pupil benozzo gozzolus to decorate this chapel in the year 1439 as chapter ii relate through the instrumentality of cosimo a great episcopal council be hold at florence at which john palaeologus emperor of the east meet pope eugenius iv in that year cosimo 's son piero be twenty-three and gozzolus nineteen and probably upon both but certainly on the young artist such pomp and splendor and gorgeousness of costume as then be visible in florence make a deep impression when therefore piero after become head of the family decide to decorate the chapel with a procession of magi it be not surprising that the painter should recall this historic occasion we thus get the pageantry of the east with more than common realism while the portrait or at any rate representation of the patriarch of constantinople -lrb- the first king -rrb- and the emperor -lrb- the second king -rrb- be here together with those of certain medicus for the youthful third king be none other than piero 's eldest son lorenzo among they follower be -lrb- the third on the left -rrb- cosimo de ' medicus who be include as among the living although like the patriarch of constantinople he be dead and he brother lorenzo -lrb- the middle one of the three -rrb- whose existence be forget so completely until the accession of cosimo i in 1537 bring he branch of the family into power while on the right be piero de ' medici himself piero 's second son giuliano be on the white horse precede by a negro carry he bow the head immediately above giuliano i do not know but that one a little to the leave above it be gozzolus 's own among the throng be man of learn who either come to florence from the east or florentine who assimilate they philosophy -- such as georgius gemistho marsilio ficino and perhaps certain painter among they all protégés of cosimo and piero and all maker of the renaissance the assemblage alone apart altogether from any beauty and charm that the painting possess make these fresco valuable but the painting be a delight we have a pretty gozzolus in we national gallery -- no 283 -- but it give no indication of the ripeness and richness and incident of this work while the famous biblical series in the campo santo of pisa have so largely perish as to be scarcely evidence to he color the first impression make by the medici fresco be they sumptuousness when gozzolus paint -- if the story be true -- he have only candle light : the window over the altar be new but think of candle light be all the illumination of these wall as the painter work a new door and window have also be cut in the wall opposite the altar close to the three daughter of piero by vandal hand and bruta bruta say the guardian very rightly the landscape behind the procession be hardly less interesting than the procession itself but it be when we come to the meadow of paradise with the angel and rose the cypress and bird in the two chancel scene that this side of gozzolus 's art be most fascinating he have travel a long way from he master fra angelico here : the heaven be of the visible rather than the invisible eye sense be present as well as the rapturous spirit the little medicus who endure the tedium of the service here be to be felicitate with upon such a adorable presentment of glory with plenty of altar candle the sight of these garden of the blest must have beguile many a mass thinking here in england upon the medicus chapel i find that the impression it have leave upon I be chiefly cypress -- cypress black and comely disposed by a master hand with a glint of gold among they the picture that be over the altar have go it be a lippo lippus and be now in berlin the first of the medicus family to rise to the highest power be giovanni d'averardo de ' medicus -lrb- know as giovannus di bicci -rrb- 1360-1429 who a wealthy banker living in what be now the piazza del duomo be well know for he philanthropy and interest in the welfare of the florentine but do not come much into public notice until 1401 when he be appoint one of the judge in the baptistery door competition he be a retire watchful man whether he be personally ambitious be not too evident but he be oppose to tyranny and be the steady foe of the albizzi faction who at that time be endeavor to obtain supreme power in florentine affair in 1419 giovannus increase he popularity by found the spedale deglus innocentus and in 1421 he be elect gonfalonier or as we might now say president of the republic in this capacity he make he position secure and reduce the noble -lrb- chief of whom be niccolò da uzzano -rrb- to political weakness giovannus die in 1429 leave one son cosimo aged forty a second lorenzo aged thirtyfor a fragrant memory and a immense fortune to lorenzo who remain a private citizen we shall return in time it be cosimo -lrb- 1389-1464 -rrb- with whom we be now concerned cosimo de ' medicus be a man of great mental and practical ability : he have be educate as well as possible he have a passion both for art and letter he inherit he father 's financial ability and generosity while he add to these gift a certain genius for the management of man one of the first thing that cosimo do after he father 's death be to begin the palace where we now be reject a plan by brunelleschus as too splendid and choose instead one by michelozzo the partner of donatello two artist who remain he personal friend through life cosimo select this site in what be then the via larga but be now the via cavor partly because he father have once live there and partly because it be close to s lorenzo which he father with six other family have begin to rebuild a work he intend himself to carry on the palace be begin in 1430 abd be still in progress in 1433 when the albizzus who have always view the rise of the medicus family with apprehension and misgiving and be now strengthen by the death of niccolò da uzzano who though powerful have be a very cautious and temperate adviser succeed in get a majority in the signorium and pass a sentence of banishment on the whole medicus tribe as be too rich and ambitious to be good citizen of a simple and frugal republic cosimo therefore after some day of imprisonment in the tower of the palazzo vecchio during which he expect execution at any moment leave florence for venice take he architect with he in 1434 however the florentine realize that under the albizzus they be lose they independence and what be to be a democracy be become a oligarchy revolt and cosimo be recall and like he father be elect gonfalonier with this recall begin he long supremacy for he return like a king and like a king remain quickly establish himself as the lead man in the city the power behind the signorium not only do he never lose that position but he make it so naturally he own that when he die he be able to transmit it to he son cosimo de ' medicus be i think the wisest and best ruler that florence ever have and rank high among the ruler that any state ever have but he change the florentine from a independent people to a dependent one in he capacity of father of he country he see to it that he child lose they proud spirit he have to be absolute and this end he achieve in many way but chiefly by he wealth which make it possible to break the rich rebel and to enslave the poor he greatest asset -- next he wealth -- be he knowledge of the florentine character to know anything of this capricious fickle turbulent folk even after the event be in itself a task of such magnitude that almost no one else have compass it but cosimo do more he know what they be likely to do by this knowledge together with he riches he craft he tact he business ramification as a international banker he open-handedness and air of personal simplicity cosimo make himself a power for florence could he not do enough by invite the pope and the greek emperor to meet there he give it great political importance and incidentally bring about the new learning he establish the platonic academy and form the first public library in the west he rebuild and endow the monastery of s marco he build and rebuild other church he give donatello a free hand in sculpture and fra lippo lippus and fra angelico in painting he distribute altogether in charity and church four hundred thousand of those golden coin which be invent by florence and name florin after she -- a sum equal to a million pound of to-day in every direction one come upon trace of he generosity and thoroughness after he death it be decide that as pater patria or father of he country he should be for ever know cosimo die in 1464 leave a invalid son piero aged forty-eight know for he almost continuous gout as il gottoso giovannus and cosimo have have to work for they power piero step naturally into it although almost immediately he have to deal with a plot -- the first for thirty year -- to ruin the medicus prestige the leader of which be that luca pittus who begin the pittus palace in order to have a better house than the medicus the plot fail not a little owing to young lorenzo de ' medicus 's address and the remain few year of piero 's life be tranquil he be a quiet kindly man with the traditional family love of the art and it be for he that gozzolus work he die in 1469 leave two son lorenzo -lrb- 1449-1492 -rrb- and giuliano -lrb- 1453-1478 -rrb- lorenzo have be bring up as the future lead citizen of florence : he have every advantage of education and environment and be rich in the aristocratic spirit which often blossom most richly in the second or third generation of wealthy business family giovannus have be a banker before everything cosimo a administrator piero a faithful inheritor of he father 's wish it be leave for lorenzo to be the first poet and natural prince of the medici blood lorenzo continue to bank but mismanage the work and lose heavily while he poetical tendency no doubt distract he attention generally from affair yet such be he sympathetic understanding and he native splendor and gift of leadership that he could not but be at the head of everything the first to be consult and ingratiate not only be he the first medicus poet but the first of the family to marry not for love but for policy and that too be a sign of decadence lorenzo come into power when only twenty and at the age of forty-two he be dead but in the interval by he interest in every kind of intellectual and artistic activity by he passion for the greatness and glory of florence he make for himself a name that must always connote liberality splendor and enlightenment but it be beyond question that under lorenzo the florentine change deeply and for the worse the old thrift and simplicity give way to extravagance and ostentation the old faith give way too but that be not wholly the effect of lorenzo 's natural inclination towards platonic philosophy foster by he tutor marsilio ficino and he friend poliziano and pico dellum mirandolum but be due in no small measure also to the hostility of pope sixtus which culminate in the pazzus conspiracy of 1478 and the murder of giuliano look at the history of florence from we present vantage-point we can see that although under lorenzo the magnificent she be the center of the world 's culture and distinction there be behind this dazzling front no seriousness of purpose she be in short enjoy the fruit of she labor as though the time of rest have come and this when strenuousness be more than ever important lorenzo carry on every good work of he father and grandfather -lrb- he spend # 65000 a year in book alone -rrb- and be as jealous of florentine interest but he be also the magnificent and in that lay the peril florence could do with wealth and power but magnificence go to she head lorenzo die in 1492 leave three son of whom the eldest piero -lrb- 1471-1503 -rrb- succeed he never be such a decadence in a moment the medicus prestige which have be steadily grow under cosimo piero and lorenzo until it be world famous crumble to dust piero be a coarse-minded pleasure-loving youth -- the headstrong he father have call he -- whose one idea of power be to be sensual and tyrannical and the enemy of florence and of italy take advantage of this fact savonarolum 's sermon have pave the way from within too in 1494 charle viii of france march into italy piero pull himself together and visit the king to make term for florence but make such term that on return to the city he find a order of banishment and obey it on November 9th 1494 he and he family be expel and the mob forget so quickly all that they owe to the medicus who have go before rush to this beautiful palace and loot it the loss that art and learn sustained in a few hour can never be estimate a certain number of treasure be subsequently collect again such as donatello 's david and verrocchio 's david while donatello 's judith be remove to the palazzo vecchio where a inscription be place upon it say that she short way with holoferne be a warn to all traitor but priceless picture sculpture and mss be ruthlessly demolish in the chapter on s marco we shall read of what experiment in government the florentine substitute for that of the medici savonarolum for a while be at the head of the government although only for a brief period which end amid a orgy of lawlessness and then after a restless period of eighteen year in which florence have every claw cut and be weaken also by dissension the medicus return -- the change be the work of lorenzo 's second son giovannus de ' medicus who on the eve of become pope leo x procure they reinstatement thus justify the wisdom of he father in place he in the church piero have be drown long since he admirable but ill-starred brother giuliano duke of nemor now thirty-three assume the control always under leo x while they cousin giulio also a churchman and the natural son of the murder giuliano be busy behind the scene with the family fortune giuliano live only till 1516 and be succeed by he nephew lorenzo duke of urbino a son of peiro a young man of no more political use than he father and one who quickly become almost equally unpopular thing indeed be go so badly that leo x send giulio de ' medicus -lrb- now a cardinal -rrb- from rome to straighten they out and by some sensible repeal he succeed in allay a little of the bitterness in the city lorenzo have one daughter bear in this palace who be destine to make history -- catherine de ' medici -- and no son when therefore he die in 1519 at the age of twenty-seven after a life of vicious selfishness -lrb- which however be no bar to he have the noblest tomb in the world at s lorenzo -rrb- the succession should have pass to the other branch of the medicus family the descendant of old giovannus 's second son lorenzo brother of cosimo but giulio at rome always at the ear of the indolent pleasure-loving leo x have other project bear in 1478 the illegitimate son of a charming father giulio have none of the great medici tradition and the medici name never stand so low as during he period of power himself illegitimate he be the father of a illegitimate son alessandro for whose advancement he toil much as alexander vi have toil for that of caesar borgium he have not the black bold wickedness of alexander vi but as pope clement vii which he become in 1523 he be little less admirable he be cunning ambitious and tyrannical and during he pontificate he contrived not only to make many powerful enemy and to see both rome and florence under siege but to lose england for the church we move however too fast the year be 1519 and lorenzo be dead and the rightful heir to the medicus wealth and power be to be keep out to do this giulio himself move to florence and settle in the medicus palace and on he return to rome cardinal passerinus be install in the medicus palace in he stead nominally as the custodian of little catherine de ' medicus and ippolito a boy of ten the illegitimate son of giuliano duke of nemor that florence should have put up with this roman control show we how enfeebled be she once proud spirit in 1521 leo x die to be succeed in spite of all giulio 's effort by adrian of utrecht as adrian vi a good sincere man who have he live might have enormously change the course not only of italian but of english history he survive however for less than two year and then come giulio 's chance and he be elect pope clement vii clement 's first duty be to make florence secure and he therefore send he son alessandro then about thirteen to join the other at the medicus palace which thus now contain a resident cardinal watchful of medicus interest a legitimate daughter of lorenzo duke of urbino -lrb- but owe to quarrel she be remove to a convent -rrb- a illegitimate son of giuliano duke of nemor the nominal heir and already a member of the government and the pope 's illegitimate son of whose origin however nothing be say although it be imply that lorenzo duke of nemor be he father this be the state of affair during clement 's war with the emperor charle v -lrb- 2 -rrb- which end with the siege of rome and the imprisonment of the pope in the castle of s angelo for some month until he contrived to escape to orvieto and meanwhile florence realize he powerlessness utter a decree again banish the medicus family and in 1527 they be send forth from the city for the third time but even now when the move be so safe florence lack courage to carry it out until a member of the medicus family furious at the presence of the base-born medicus in the palace and a profess hater of she base-born uncle clement vii and all he way -- clarice strozzus née clarice de ' medici granddaughter of lorenzo the magnificent -- come herself to this house and drive the usurper from it with she extremely capable tongue to explain clearly the position of the florentine republic at this time would be too deeply to delve into history but it may briefly be say that by means of humiliating surrender and much crafty diplomacy clement vii be able to bring about in 1529 peace between the emperor charle v and franci i of france by which charle be leave master of italy while he partner and ally in these transaction clement expect for he own share certain benefit in which the humiliation of florence and the exaltation of alessandro come first florence have take side with franci find herself in any case very badly leave with the result that at the end of 1529 charle v 's army with the papal force to assist lay siege to she the siege last for ten month in which the city be most ably defend by ferruccus that gallant soldier whose portrait by piero di cosimo be in we national gallery -- no 895 -- and then come a decisive battle in which the emperor and pope be conqueror a thousand brave florentine be put to death and other be imprison alessandro de ' medici arrive at the medicus palace in 1531 and in 1532 the glorious florentine republic of so many year ' growth for the establishment of which so much good blood have be spill be declare to be at a end alessandro be proclaimed duke he first act be to order the demolition of the great bell of the signorium which have so often call the citizen to arm or meeting of independence meanwhile ippolito the natural son of giuliano duke of nemor and therefore the rightful heir after have be send on various mission by clement vii to keep he out of the way settle at bologna and take to poetry he be a kindly melancholy man with a deep sense of human injustice and in 1535 when after clement vii 's very welcome demise the florentine exile who either have be banish from florence by alessandro or have leave of they own volition rather than live in the city under such a contemptible ruler send a embassy to the emperor charle v to help they against this new tyrant ippolito head it but alessandro prudently arrange for he assassination en route it be unlikely however that the emperor would have do anything for in the following year he allow he daughter margaret to become alessandro 's wife that be in 1536 in January 1537 lorenzino de ' medici a cousin one of the younger branch of the family assume the mantle of brutus or liberator stab alessandro to death while he be keep a assignation in the house that then adjoin this palace thus die at the age of twenty-six one of the most worthless of man and although illegitimate the last of the direct line of cosimo de ' medici the father of he country to govern florence the next ruler come from the younger branch to which we now turn old giovannus di bicci have two son cosimo and lorenzo lorenzo 's son pier francesco de ' medicus have a son giovannus de ' medici this giovannus who marry caterina sforza of milan have also a son name giovannus bear in 1498 and it be he who be the rightful heir when lorenzo duke of urbino die in 1519 he be connect with both side of the family for he father as i have say be the great grandson of the first medicus on we list and he wife be marium salviatus daughter of lucrezia de ' medici -- herself a daughter of lorenzo the magnificent -- and jacopo salviati a wealthy florentine when however lorenzo duke of urbino die in 1519 giovannus be a young man of twenty-one with a absorb passion for fight which clement vii -lrb- then giulio -rrb- be only too keen to foster since he wish he out of the way in order that he own project for the ultimate advancement of the base-born alessandro and meanwhile of the catspaw the base-born ippolito might be further giovannus have already do some good service in the field be become famous as the head of he company of black band and be know as giovannus delle bande nere and he marriage to he cousin marium salviatus and the birth of he only son cosimo in 1519 make no difference to he delight in warfare he be happy only when in the field of battle and the struggle between franci and charle give he ample opportunity fight on the side of charle and the pope and do many brave and dash thing he die at a early age only twenty-eight in 1526 the idol of he man leave a widow and child in poverty almost immediately afterwards come the third banishment of the medicus family from florence giovannus 's widow and they son cosimo get along as best they could until the murder of alessandro in 1537 when cosimo be nearly eighteen he be a quiet reserved youth who have apparently take but little interest in public affair and have spend he time in the country with he mother chiefly in field sport but no sooner be alessandro dead and he slayer lorenzino have escape than cosimo approach the florentine council and claim to be appoint to he rightful place as head of the state and this claim he put or suggest with so much humility that he wish be grant instantly one of the most remarkable transition in history occur : the youth grow up almost in a day and at once begin to exert unsuspected reserve of power and authority in despair a number of the chief florentine make a effort to depose he and a battle be fight at montemurlo a few mile from florence between cosimo 's troops fortify by some french ally and the insurgent that be in 1537 the victory fall to cosimo and he long and remarkable reign begin with the imprisonment and execution of the chief rebel although cosimo make so bloody a beginning he be the first imaginative and thoughtful administrator that florence have have since lorenzo the magnificent he set himself grimly to build upon the ruin which the past forty and more year have produce and by the end of he reign he have work wonder as first he live in the medicus palace but after marry a wealthy wife eleanora of toledo he transfer he home to the signorium now call the palazzo vecchio as a safer spot and establish a bodyguard of swiss lancer in orcagna 's loggia close by -lrb- 3 -rrb- later he buy the unfinished pittus palace with he wife 's money finish it and move there meanwhile he be strengthen he position in every way by alliance and treaty and also by the convenient murder of lorenzino the brutus who have rid florence of alessandro ten year earlier and whose presence in the flesh could not but be a cause of anxiety since lorenzino derive from a elder son of the medicus and cosimo from a younger in 1555 the ancient republic of siena fall to cosimo 's troops after a cruel and barbarous siege and be thereafter merge in tuscany and in 1570 cosimo assume the title of cosimo i grand duke of tuscany and be crown at rome whether or not the common accusation against the medicus as a family that they have but one motive -- mercenary ambition and self-aggrandisement -- be true the fact remain that the crown do not reach they brow until one hundred and seventy year from the first appearance of old giovannus di bicci in florentine affair the statue of cosimo i in the piazza della signoria have a bas-relief of he coronation he be then fifty-one he live but four more year and when he die he leave a dukedom flourish in every way : rich powerful busy and enlighten he have develop and encourage the art capriciously as cellinus 's autobiography tell we but genuinely too as we can see at the uffizus and the pittus the art however be not what they have be for the great period have pass and florence be in the trough of the wave yet cosimo find the best man he could -- cellinus bronzino and vasarus -- and keep they busy but he greatest achievement as a connoisseur be he interest in etruscan remain and the excavation at arezzo and elsewhere which yield the priceless relic now at the archaeological museum with cosimo i this swift review of the medicus family end the rest have little interest for the visitor to florence to-day for whom cellinus 's perseus make to cosimo i 's order be the last great artistic achievement in the city in point of time but i may say that cosimo i 's direct descendant occupy the throne -lrb- as it have now become -rrb- until the death of gian gastone son of cosimo iii who die in 1737 tuscany pass to austria until 1801 in 1807 it become french and in 1814 austrian again in 1860 it be merge in the kingdom of italy under the rule of the monarch who have give he name to the great new piazza -- vittorio emmanuele after gian gastone 's death one other medicus remain alive : anna marium ludovica daughter of cosimo iii bear in 1667 she marry the elector palatine of the rhine and survive until 1743 it be she who leave to the city the priceless medicus collection as i have state in chapter viii the earlier and greatest of the medicus be bury in the church of s lorenzo or in michelangelo 's sacristy the later medicus begin with giovannus delle bande nere and he wife and they son cosimo i be in the gorgeous mausoleum that adjoin s lorenzo and be still be enrich with precious marble such be a outline of the history of this wonderful family and we leave they ancient home build by the greatest and wisest of they with mixed feeling of admiration and pity they be seldom lovable they be often despicable but where they be great they be very great indeed a latin inscription in the courtyard remind the traveller of the distinction which the house possess call it the home not only of prince but of knowledge herself and a treasury of the art but florence although it buy the palace from the riccardus family a century and more ago have never care to give it back its rightful name chapter vi s lorenzo and michelangelo a forlorn façade -- the church of the medicus -- cosimo 's parent ' tomb -- donatello 's cantorium and pulpit -- brunelleschus 's sacristy -- donatello again -- the palace of the dead grand duke -- costly intarsium -- michelangelo 's sacristy -- a weary titan 's life -- the victim of capricious pontiff -- the medicus tomb -- mementus morus -- the casa buonarroti -- brunelleschus 's cloister -- a model library architecturally s lorenzo do not attract as s croce and s marium novellum do but certain treasure of sculpture make it unique yet it be a cool scene of noble gray arch and the ceiling be very happily pick out with gold and color savonarolum preach some of he most important sermon here here lorenzo the magnificent be marry the façade have never yet be finish : it be just ragged brickwork wait for its marble and likely to wait although such expenditure on marble be go on within a few yard of it as make one gasp not very far away in the via ghibellina be a house which contain some rough plan by a master hand for this façade draw some four hundred year ago -- the hand of none other than michelangelo whose scheme be to make it not only a wonder of architecture but a wonder also of statuary the façade have many niche each to be fill with a sacred figure but michelangelo always dream on a scale utterly disproportionate to the foolish little span of life allot to we and the s lorenzo façade be never even begin the piazza which these untidy brick overlook be now give up to stall and be the center of the cheap clothing district look diagonally across it from the church one see the great wall of the courtyard of what be now the riccardus palace but be in the great day the medicus palace and at the corner face the borgo s lorenzo be giovanni delle bande nere in stone by the impossible bandinellus look at least twenty year older than he ever live to be s lorenzo be a very old church in the time of giovannus de ' medici the first great man of the family and have already be restore once in the eleventh century but it be he favorite church choose by he for he own resting-place and he spend great sum in improve it all this with the assistance of brunelleschus who be responsible for the interior as we now see it and would have he live have complete the façade after giovannus come cosimo who also devoted great sum to the glory of this church not only assist brunelleschus with he work but induce donatello to lavish he genius upon it and the church be thus establish as the family vault of the medicus race giovannus lie here cosimo lie here and piero while lorenzo the magnificent and giuliano and certain descendant be bury in the michelangelo sacristy and all the grand duke in the ostentatious chapel behind the altar cosimo be bury beneath the floor in front of the high altar in obedience to he wish and by the special permission of the roman church and in the same vault lie donatello cosimo who be bury with all simplicity on August 22nd 1464 in he last illness recommend donatello who be then seventy-eight to he son piero the old sculptor survive he illustrious patron and friend only two and a half year decline gently into the grave and he body be bring here in December 1466 a monument to he memory be erect in the church in 1896 piero -lrb- the gouty -rrb- who survive until 1469 lie close by he bronze monument with that of he brother be that between the sacristy and the adjoining chapel in a impose porphyry and bronze casket the work of verrocchio one of the richest and most impressive of all the memorial sculpture of the renaissance the marble pediment be support by four tortoise such as support the monolith in the piazza s marium novellum the iron rope work that divide the sacristy from the chapel be a marvel of workmanship but we go too fast : the church before the sacristy and the glory of the church be donatello 's we have see he cantorium in the museum of the cathedral here be another not so riotous and jocund in spirit but in its own way hardly less satisfy the museum cantorium have the wonderful frieze of dancing figure this be a exercise in marble intarsium it have the same row of pillar with little speck of mosaic gold but its beauty be that of delicate proportion and soft tone the cantorium be in the left aisle in its original place the two bronze pulpit be in the nave these have a double interest as be not only donatello 's work but he latest work they be incomplete at he death and be finish by he pupil bertoldo -lrb- 1410-1491 -rrb- and since as we shall see bertoldo become the master of michelangelo when he be a lad of fifteen and bertoldo a old man of eighty these pulpit may be say to form a link between the two great s lorenzo sculptor how fine and free and spirited bertoldo could be alone we shall see at the bargello the s lorenzo pulpit be very difficult to study : nothing want a stronger light than a bronze relief and in florence student of bronze relief be accustom to it since the most famous of all -- the ghibertus door -- be in the open air only in course of time can one discern the scene here the left pulpit be the finer for it contain the crucifixion and the deposition which to I form the most striking of the panel the other piece of sculpture in the church itself be a ciborium by desiderio da settignano in the chapel at the end of the right transept -- a exquisite work by this rare and playful and distinguished hand it be fitting that desiderio should be here for he be donatello 's favorite pupil the s lorenzo ciborium be wholly charming although there be a deposition upon it the little boy be adorable but one see it with the greatest difficulty owe to the crowded state of the altar and the dim light the altar picture in the martellus chapel where the sympathetic donatello monument -lrb- in the same medium as he annunciation at s croce -rrb- be find -- on the way to the library -- be by lippo lippus and be notable for the pretty virgin receive the angel 's news there be nice color in the predellum as i have say in the first chapter we be too prone to ignore the architect we look at the jewel and forget the casket brunelleschus be a far greater maker of florence than either donatello or michelangelo but one think of he rather as a abstraction than a man or forget he altogether yet the s lorenzo sacristy be one of the few perfect thing in the world what most people however remember be its tomb its door and its relief the proportion escape they i think its shallow easy dome beyond description beautiful brunelleschus who have a investigate genius himself paint the quaint constellation in the ceiling over the altar at the pazzus chapel we shall find similar architecture but there extraneous color be allow to come in here such relief as be admit be white too the tomb under the great marble and porphyry table in the center be that of giovannus di bicci the father and piccarda the mother of cosimo pater and be usually attribute to buggiano the adopted son of brunelleschus but other authority give it either to donatello alone or to donatello with michelozzo : both from the evidence of the design and because it be unlikely that cosimo would ask any one else than one of these two friend of he to carry out a commission so near he heart the table be part of the scheme and not a chance cover i think the porphyry center ought to be movable so that the beautiful fly figure on the sarcophagus could be see but donatello 's most striking achievement here be the bronze door which be at once so simple and so strong and so surprising by the activity of the virile and spirited holy man all convert each other thereon depict these door could not well be more different from ghibertus 's in the casting of which donatello assist those in such high relief these so low those so fluid and placid and these so vigorous donatello preside over this room -lrb- under brunelleschus -rrb- the vivacious speaking terra-cotta bust of the young s lorenzo on the altar be he the altar railing be probably he the frieze of terra-cotta cherub may be he the four low relief in the spandrel which it be so difficult to discern but which photograph prove to be wonderful scene in the life of s john the evangelist -- so like as one peer up at they plastic piranesis with they fine masonry -- be he the other relief be donatello 's too but the lavabo in the inner sacristy be verrocchio 's and verrocchio 's tomb of piero can never be overlook even amid such a wealth of the greater master 's work from this fascinating room -- fascinating both in itself and in its possession -- we pass after distribute the necessary largesse to the sacristan to a turnstile which admit on payment of a lira to the chapel of the prince and to michelangelo 's sacristy here be contrast indeed : the sacristy austere and classic and the chapel a very exhibition building of floridity and color ornateness date from the seventeenth century and not finish yet in pay the necessary fee to see these building one think again what the feeling of giovannus and cosimo and lorenzo the magnificent and even of cosimo i all such generous patron of florence would be if they could see the present feverish collection of lira in they beautiful city of the chapel of the prince i have little to say to pass from michelangelo 's sacristy to this be a error see it if see it you must first while the façade of s lorenzo be still neglect and the cornice of brunelleschus 's dome be still unfinished this lapidary 's show-room be be complete at a cost of million of lira ever since 1888 have the floor be in progress and there be many year ' work yet a enthusiastic custodian give I a list of the stone which be use in the design of the coat of arm of tuscan city of which that of fiesole be the most attractive : -- sicily jasper french jasper tuscany jasper petrified wood white and yellow corsican granite corsican jasper oriental alabaster french marble lapi lazulus verde antico african marble siena marble carrara marble rise agate mother of pearl and coral the name of the medicus be in porphyry and ivory it be all very marvellous and occasionally beautiful but this pretentious building be design by a natural son of cosimo i in 1604 and be begin as the state mausoleum of the grand duke and all lie here all the grand duchess too save bianca capellum wife of franci i who be bury none know where it be strange to realize as one stand here that this pavement cover all those lady bury in they wonderful clothes we shall see eleanor of toledo wife of cosimo i in bronzino 's famous picture at the uffizus in a amazing brocaded dress : it be that dress in which she repose beneath we they have they jewel too and each grand duke he crown and sceptre but these with one or two exception be steal during the french occupation of tuscany 1801-1814 only two of the grand duke have they statue -- ferdinand i and cosimo ii -- and the medicus no longer exist in the florentine memory and yet the quiet brick floor be have all this money squander on it to superimpose costly marble which can not matter to anybody michelangelo 's chapel call the new sacristy be begin for leo x and finish for giulio de ' medici illegitimate son of the murder giuliano and afterwards pope clement vii brunelleschus 's design for the old sacristy be follow but make more severe this one would feel to be the very home of dead prince even if there be no statue the only color be the white of the wall and the brown of the pillar and window the dome be to have be paint but it fortunately escape the contrast between michelangelo 's dome and brunelleschus 's be complete -- brunelleschus 's so suave and gentle in its rise with its gray line to help the eye and this soar so boldly to its lantern with its rigid device of dwindle square the odd thing be that with these two dome to teach he better the designer of the chapel of the prince should have indulge in such floridity such be the force of the architecture in the sacristy that one be profoundly conscious of be in melancholy 's most perfect home and the building be so much a part of michelangelo 's life and it contain such marvel from he hand that i choose it as a place to tell he story michelangelo buonarrotus be bear on march 6th 1475 at caprese of which town he father be podestà at that time brunelleschus have be dead twenty-nine year fra angelico twenty year donatello nine year leonardo da vincus be twenty-three year old and raphael be not yet bear lorenzo the magnificent have be on what be virtually the throne of florence since 1469 and be a young man of twenty-six for foster-mother the child have the wife of a stone-mason at settignano whither the family soon move and michelangelo use to say that it be with she milk that he imbibe the stone-cutting art it be from the air too for settignano 's principal industry be sculpture the village be only three mile from florence from it the boy could see the city very much as we see it now -- its duomo its campanile with the same attendant spire he be send to florence to school and intend for either the wool or silk trade as so many florentine be but display artistic ability he induce he father to apprentice he at the age of thirteen to a famous goldsmith and painter of florence who have a busy atelier -- no other than domenico ghirlandaio who be then a man of thirty-nine michelangelo remain with he for three year and although he power and imagination be already greater than he master 's he learn much and would never have make he sixtine chapel fresco with the ease he do but for this early grounding for ghirlandaio although not of the first rank of painter in genius be pre-eminently there in thoroughness while he be good for the boy too in spirit have a large way with he the first work of ghirlandaio which the boy see in the making be the beautiful adoration of the magus in the church of the spedale deglus innocentus complete in 1488 and the s marium novellum fresco and it be reasonable to suppose that he help with the fresco in color grind even if he do not as some have say paint with he own hand the beggar sit on the step in the scene represent the presentation of the virgin that he be already clever with he pencil we know for he have make some caricature and correct a drawing or two the three year with ghirlandaio be reduce eventually to one the boy have the good fortune to be choose as one of enough promise to be worth instruction both by precept and example in the famous medici garden here he be more at home than in a painting room for plastic art be he passion and not only have lorenzo the magnificent gather together there many of those masterpiece of ancient sculpture which we shall see at the uffizus but bertoldo the aged head of this informal school be the possessor of a private collection of donatello and other renaissance work of extraordinary beauty and worth donatello 's influence on the boy hold long enough for he to make the low relief of the madonna much in he style which be now preserve in the casa buonarroti while the plaque of the battle of the centaur and lapitha which be also there show bertoldo 's influence the boy 's first encounter with lorenzo occur while he be model the head of a aged faun he magnificent patron stop to watch he point out that so old a creature would probably not have such a fine set of tooth and michelangelo take the hint in a moment have not only knock out a tooth or two but -- and here he observation tell -- hollow the gum and cheek a little in sympathy lorenzo be so pleased with he quickness and skill that he receive he into he house as the companion of he three son : of piero who be so soon and so disastrously to succeed he father but be now a high-spirited youth of giovannus who as pope leo x many year after be to give michelangelo the commission for this very sacristy and of giuliano who lie beneath one of the tomb as they companion he enjoy the advantage of share they lesson under poliziano the poet and of hear the conversation of pico dellum mirandolum who be usually with lorenzo and to these early fastidious and intellectual surroundings the artist owe much that he read much we know the bible and dante be constant companion and we know also that in addition to modelling and copying under bertoldo he be assiduous in study masaccio 's fresco at the church of the carmine across the river which have become a school of painting it be there that he fellow-pupil pietro torrigiano who be always he enemy and a bully break he nose with one blow and fly to rome from the rage of lorenzo it be when michelangelo be seventeen that lorenzo die at the early age of forty-two and although the garden still exist and the medicus palace be still open to the youth the spirit have pass piero who succeed he father have none of he ability or sagacity and in two year be a refugee from the city while the treasure of the garden be dispose by auction and michelangelo too conspicuous as a medicus protégé to be safe hurry away to bologna he be now nineteen of he travels i say nothing here for we must keep to florence whither he think it safe to return in 1495 the city be now govern by the great council and the medicus banish michelangelo remain only a brief time and then go to rome where he make he first pietà at which he be work during the trial and execution of savonarolum whom he admire and reverence and where he remain until 1501 when aged twenty-six he return to florence to do some of he most famous work the medicus be still in exile it be in August 1501 that the authority of the cathedral ask michelangelo to do what he could with a great block of marble on they hand from which he carve that statue of david of which i tell the story in chapter xvi this establish he pre-eminence as a sculptor other commission for statue pour in and in 1504 he be invite to design a cartoon for the palazzo vecchio to accompany one by leonardo and a studio be give he in the via guelfa for the purpose this cartoon when finish so far establish he also as the greatest of painter that the masaccio in the carmine be desert by young artist in order that this might be study instead the cartoon as i relate in the chapter on the palazzo vecchio no longer exist the next year 1505 michelangelo near he thirtieth birthday return to rome and enter upon the second and tragic period of he life for he arrive there only to receive the order for the julius tomb which poison he remain year and of which more be say in the chapter on the accademia where we see so many vestige of it both in marble and plaster but i might remark here that this vain and capricious pontiff whose pride and indecision rob the world of no one can ever say what glorious work from michelangelo 's hand be the benevolent-looking old man whose portrait by raphael be in the pittus and uffizus in color in the corsinus palace in charcoal and again in we own national gallery in color of michelangelo at rome and carrara whither he go to superintend in person the quarrying of the marble that be to be transfer to life and where he have endless vexation and mortification i say nothing enough that the election of he boy friend giovannus de ' medici as pope leo x in 1513 bring he again to florence the pope have a strong wish that michelangelo should complete the façade of the medicus family church s lorenzo where we now be as we know the scheme be not carry out but in 1520 the pope substitute another and more attractive one : namely a chapel to contain the tomb not only of he father the magnificent and he uncle who have be murder in the duomo many year before but also he nephew piero de ' medici duke of urbino who have just die in 1519 and he younger brother -lrb- and michelangelo 's early playmate -rrb- giuliano de ' medici duke of nemor who have die in 1516 these be not medicus of the highest class but family pride be strong it be however odd that no memorial of piero di lorenzo de ' medicus who have be drown at the age of twenty-two in 1503 be require perhaps it may have be that since it be piero 's folly that have bring the medicus into such disgrace in 1494 the less thought of he the better michelangelo take fire at once and again hasten to carrara to arrange for marble to be send to he studio in the via mozzi now the via s zenobus while the building stone be bring from fiesole leo x live only to know that the great man have begin the new patron be giulio de ' medici natural son of the murder giuliano now a cardinal and soon in 1523 to become pope clement vii this pope show deep interest in the project but wish not only to add tomb of himself and pope leo x but also to build a library for the laurentian collection which michelangelo must design a little later he have decide that he would prefer to lie in the choir of the church and leo x with he and instead therefore of tomb michelangelo might merely make a colossal statue of he to stand in the piazza before the church the sculptor 's temper have not be improve by he many year ' experience of papal caprice and he reply to this suggestion with a letter unique even in the annals of infuriate artist let the statue be make of course he say but let it be useful as well as ornamental : the lower portion to be also a barber 's shop and the head since it would be empty a greengrocer 's the pope allow himself to be rebuke and abandon the statue write a mild and even pathetic reply until 1527 michelangelo work away at the building and the tomb always secretly behind impenetrable barrier and then come the trouble which lead to the siege of florence follow upon the banishment of alessandro duke of urbino natural son of the very lorenzo whom the sculptor be to dignify for all time by the emperor charle v and pope clement vii the city be attack and michelangelo be call away from clement 's sacristy to fortify florence against clement 's soldier part of he rampart at s miniato still remain and he strengthen all the gate but feel himself slight and hate the whole affair he suddenly disappear one story be that he hide in the church tower of s niccolò below what be now the piazzale dedicate to he memory wherever he be he be proclaim a outlaw and then on florence finding that she could not do without he be pardon and so return the city meanwhile have surrender and the medicus again be restore to power the pope show either fine magnanimity or compound with fact in the interest of the sacristy for he encourage michelangelo to proceed and the pacific work be take up once more after the martial interregnum and in a desultory way he be busy at it always secretly and moodily until 1533 when he tire completely and never touch it again a year later clement vii die have see only drawing of the tomb if those but though left unfinished the sacristy be wholly satisfying -- more indeed than satisfy conquer whatever help michelangelo may have have from he assistant it be know that the symbolical figure on the tomb and the two seat medicus be from he hand of the two finish or practically finish tomb -- to my mind as finish as they should be -- that of lorenzo be the finer the presentment of lorenzo in armor brooding and planning be more splendid than that of giuliano while the old man whose head anticipate everything that be consider most original in rodin 's work be among the best of michelangelo 's statuary much speculation have be indulge in as to the meaning of the symbolism of these tomb and have no theory of my own to offer i be glad to borrow mr gerald s davy ' summary from he monograph on michelangelo the figure of giuliano typify energy and leadership in repose while the man on he tomb typify day and the woman night or the man action and the woman the sleep and rest that produce action the figure of lorenzo typify contemplation the woman dawn and the man twilight the state which lie between light and darkness action and rest what michelangelo -- who owe nothing to any medicus save only lorenzo the magnificent and have see the best year of he life fritter away in the service of they and other proud prince -- may also have intend we shall never know but he be a saturnine man with a long memory and he might easily have make the tomb a vehicle for criticism one would not have another touch of the chisel on either of the symbolical male figure although a tomb to lorenzo the magnificent by michelangelo would surely have be a wonderful thing there be something startling and arrest in the circumstance that he have none at all from any hand but lie here unrecorded he grandfather in the church itself rest beneath a plain slab which aim so consciously at modesty as thereby to achieve special distinction : lorenzo leave no such direction have nothing while in the same room be monument to two common-place descendant to thrill the soul the disparity be in itself monumental that michelangelo 's madonna and child be on the slab which cover the dust of lorenzo and he brother be a chance the saint on either side be s cosimo and s damian the patron saint of old cosimo de ' medicus and be by michelangelo 's assistant the madonna be intend for the altar of the sacristy into this work the sculptor put much of he melancholy and one feel disappointment the face of the madonna be already sad and hopeless but the child be perhaps the most splendid and determine of any in all renaissance sculpture he may if we like symbolize the new generation that be always derive sustenance from the old without care or thought of what the old have to suffer he crush he head against he mother 's breast in a very passion of vigorous dependence -lrb- 4 -rrb- whatever be originally intend it be certain that in michelangelo 's sacristy disillusionment reign as well as death but how beautiful it be in a little room lead from the sacristy i be show by a smile custodian lorenzo the magnificent 's coffin crumble away and photograph of the skull of the two brother : giuliano 's with one of francesco de ' pazzus 's dagger wound in it and lorenzo 's ghastly in its decay i give the man half a lira while he be work on the tomb michelangelo have undertake now and then a small commission and to this period belong the david which we shall see in the little room on the ground floor of the bargello in 1534 when he finally abandon the sacristy and leave florence for ever settle in rome the laurentian library be only begin and he have little interest in it he never see it again at rome he time be fully occupy in paint the last judgment in the sixtine chapel and in various architectural work but florence at any rate have two marble masterpiece that belong to the later period -- the brutus in the bargello and the pietà in the duomo which we have see -- that poignantly impressive rendering of the entombment upon which the old man be at work when he die and which he mean for he own grave he death come in 1564 on February 23rd when he be nearly eighty-nine and he body be bring to florence and bury amid universal grief in s croce where it have a florid monument since we be consider the life of michelangelo i might perhaps say here a few word about he house which be only a few minute ' distant -- at no 64 via ghibellina -- where certain early work and personal relic be preserved michelangelo give the house to he nephew leonardo it be decorate early in the seventeenth century with scene in the life of the master and finally bequeath to the city as a heritage in 1858 it be perhaps the best example of the rapacity of the florentine for notwithstanding that it be leave freely in this way a lira be charge for admission the house contain more collateral curiosity as they might be call than those in the direct line but there be architectural drawing from the wonderful hand color drawing of a madonna a few study and two early piece of sculpture -- the battle of the lapitha and centaur a relief mark by tremendous vigor and full of movement and a madonna and child also in relief with many mark of greatness upon it in a recess in room iv be some personal relic of the artist which he great nephew the poet who be name after he begin to collect early in the seventeenth century as a whole the house be disappointing upstairs have be arrange a quantity of print and drawing illustrate the history of florence the s lorenzo cloister may be enter either from a side door in the church close to the old sacristy or from the piazza although a official in uniform keep the piazza door they be free brunelleschus be again the architect and from the loggia at the entrance to the library you see most acceptably the whole of he cathedral dome and half of giotto 's tower it be impossible for florentine cloister -- or indeed any cloister -- not to have a certain beauty and these be unusually charming and light see both from the loggia and the ground michelangelo 's biblioteca laurenziana which lead from they be one of the most perfect of sombre building the very home of well-ordered scholarship the staircase be impressive although perhaps a little too severe the long room could not be more satisfy to the eye michelangelo die before it be finish but it be he in design even to the ceiling and case for mss in which the library be so rich and the rich red wood ceiling vasarus michelangelo 's pupil and friend and the biographer to whom we be so much indebted carry on the work he scheme of window have be upset on the side opposite the cloister by the recent addition of a rotunda lead from the main room if ever rectangular window be more exquisitely and nobly proportion i should like to see they the library be free for student and the attendant be very good in call stray visitor ' attention to illuminate missal old mss early book and so forth one of galileo 's finger steal from he body use to be keep here in a glass case and may be here still but i do not see it i see however the portrait in a old volume of petrarch and he laura this wonderful collection be begin by cosimo de ' medici other add to it until it become one of the most valuable in the world not however without various vicissitude incident to any florentine institution : while one of its most cherish treasure the virgil of the fourth or fifth century be even carry to pari by napoleon and not return until the great year of restoration 1816 among the holograph mss be cellinus 's autobiography the library in time after be confiscate by the republic and sell to the monk of s marco again pass into the possession of a medicus leo x son of lorenzo the magnificent and then of clement vii and he it be who commission michelangelo to house it with dignity a old daily custom in the cloister of s lorenzo be the feeding of cat but it have long since be drop if you look at mr hewlett 's earthwork out of tuscany you will find a entertaining description of what it use to be like chapter vii or san michele and the palazzo vecchio the little bigallo -- the misericordium -- or san michele -- andrea orcagna -- the tabernacle -- old glass -- a company of stone saint -- donatello 's s george -- dante conference -- the guild of florence -- the palazzo vecchio -- two tower -- bandinellus 's group -- the marzocco -- the piazza della signoria -- orcagna 's loggia -- cellinus and cosimo -- the perseus -- verrocchio 's dolphin -- the great council hall -- leonardo da vincus and michelangelo 's cartoon -- bandinellus 's malice -- the palazzo vecchio as a home -- two cell and the bell of independence let we now proceed along the via calzaiolus -lrb- which mean street of the stocking-maker -rrb- run away from the piazza del duomo to the piazza della signoria the fascinatingly pretty build at the corner opposite pisano 's baptistery door be the bigallo in the loggia of which foundling child use to be display in the hope that passer-by might pity they sufficiently to make they present or even adopt they but this custom continue no longer the bigallo be design it be think by orcagna and it be worth the minutest study the company of the bigallo which be no longer a active force be one of the benevolent society of old florence but the greatest of these society still busy and merciful be the misericordium whose head-quarter be just across the via calzaiolus in the piazza face the campanile a company of florentine pledge at a moment 's notice no matter on what they may be engage to assist in any charitable work of necessity for the most part they carry ambulance to the scene of accident and perform the last office for the dead in the poorer district when on duty they wear black robe and hood they headquarters comprise a chapel with a altar by andrea della robbia and a statue of the patron saint of the misericordium s sebastian but they real patron saint be they founder a common porter name pietro borsus in the thirteenth century it be the custom for the porter and loafer connect with the old market to meet in a shelter here and pass the time away as best they could borsi join they be distressed to find how unprofitable be the hour and he suggest the formation of a society to be of some real use the money to support it to be obtain by fine in payment for oath and blasphemy a litter or two be soon buy and the machinery start the name be the company of the brother of mercy that be in 1240 to 1250 to-day no florentine be too grand to take he part and at the head of the porter 's band of brethren be the king pass along the via calzaiolus we come on the right to a noble square building with statue in its niche -- or san michele which stand on the site of the chapel of san michele in orto san michele in orto or more probably in horreo -lrb- meaning either in the garden or in the granary -rrb- be once part of a loggia use as a corn market in which be preserve a picture by ugolino da siena represent the virgin and this picture have the power of work miracle early in the fourteenth century the loggia be burn down but the picture be save -lrb- or quickly replace -rrb- and a new building on a much larger and more splendid scale be make for it none other than or san michele the chief architect be taddeo gaddus giotto 's pupil and later the constructor of the ponte vecchio where the picture then be i can not say -- whether inside the building or out -- but the principal use of the building be to serve as a granary after 1348 when florence be visit by that ravage plague which boccaccio describe in such gruesome detail at the beginning of the decameron and which send he gay company of lady and gentleman to the villa palmierus to take refuge in story tell and when this sacred picture be more than commonly busy and efficacious it be decide to apply the enormous sum of money give to the shrine from gratitude in beautify the church still more and chiefly in provide a casket worthy of hold such a pictorial treasure hence come about the noble edifice of to-day a man of universal genius be call in to execute the tabernacle : andrea orcagna a pupil probably of andrea pisano and also much influence by giotto whom though he have not know he idolize and one who like michelangelo later be not only a painter and sculptor but a architect and a poet orcagna or to give he he right name andrea di cione for orcagna be a abbreviation of arcagnolo flourish in the middle of the fourteenth century among he best-known work in painting be the dantesque fresco in the strozzus chapel at s marium novellum and that terrible allegory of death and judgment in the campo santo at pisa in which the gay ride party come upon the three open grave orcagna put all he strength into the tabernacle of or san michele which be a most sumptuous beautiful and thoughtful shrine yet owe to the darkness of the church be almost invisible guide it be true will emerge from the gloom and hold light taper to it but a right conception of it be impossible the famous miraculous picture over the altar be notable rather for its property than for its intrinsic beauty it be the panel of the altar which contain orcagna 's most exquisite work represent scene in the life of the virgin with emblematical figure intersperse that one wish to see only the back however can be see really well and this only when a door opposite to it -- in the via calzaiolus -- be open it should always be open with a grille across it that passer-by might have constant sight of this almost unknown florentine treasure it be in the relief of the death of the virgin on the back that -- on the extreme right -- orcagna introduce he own portrait the marble employ be of a delicate softness and orcagna have enough of giotto 's tradition to make the virgin a reality and to interest she for example as a mother in the wash of she baby as few painter have do and in particular as accord to ruskin poor ghirlandaio could not do in he fresco of the birth of the virgin herself it be orcagna 's habit to sign he sculpture andrea di cione painter and he painting andrea di cione sculptor and thus point he versatility by this tabernacle by he pisan fresco and by the design of the loggia de ' lanzus and the bigallo -lrb- which be usually give to he -rrb- he take he place among the most interesting and various of the forerunner of the renaissance within or san michele you learn the secret of the stoned-up window which one see with regret from without each or nearly each have a altar against it what the old glass be like one can divine from the lovely and sombre top light in exquisite pattern that be leave that on the center of the right wall of the church as one enter have jewel of green glass as lovely as any i ever see but blues purple and red predominate the tabernacle apart the main appeal of or san michele be the statuary and stone-work of the exterior for here we find the early master at they best the building be the head-quarter of the twelve florentine guild the statue and decoration be commission by they it be as though we city company should unite in beautify the guildhall donatello be the greatest artist here and it be for the armourer that he make he s george which stand now as he carve it in marble in the bargello but have a bronze substitute in its original niche below which be a relief of the slaying of the dragon from donatello 's chisel of this glorious s george more will be say later but i may remark now that in its place here it instantly prove the modernity and realistic vigor of its sculptor fine though they be all the other statue of this building be conventional they carry on a tradition of religious sculpture such as niccolò pisano respect many year earlier when he work at the pisan pulpit but donatello 's s george be new and be as beautiful as a greek god with something of real human life add donatello -lrb- with michelozzo -rrb- also make the exquisite border of the niche in the via calzaioli façade in which christ and s thoma now stand he be also to have make the figure -lrb- for the merchant ' guild -rrb- but be busy elsewhere and they fall to verrocchio of whom also we shall have much to see and say at the bargello and to my mind they be the most beautiful of all the john the baptist -lrb- make for the cloth-dealer -rrb- also on this façade be by ghibertus of the baptistery gate on the façade of the via de ' lambertus be donatello 's superb s mark -lrb- for the joiner -rrb- which lead to michelangelo 's criticism that he have never see a man who look more virtuous and if s mark be really like that he would believe all he word why do not you speak to I he also say to this statue as donatello have say to the zuccone higher on this façade be luca dellum robbium 's famous arm of the silk-weaver one of the perfect thing luca also make the arm of the guild of merchant with its florentine fleur-de-lis in the midst for the rest ghibertus 's s stephen and ghibertus and michelozzo 's s matthew on the entrance wall be the most remarkable the blacksmith relief be very lively and the blacksmith 's saint a noble figure the little square relief let into the wall at interval be often charming and the stone-work of the window be very lovely in fact the four wall of this fortress church be almost inexhaustible within its vaulted roof be so noble its proportion so satisfy one should often sit quietly here in the gloom and do nothing the little building just across the way be the guild house of the arte della lana or wool-comber and be now the head-quarter of the italian dante society who hold a conference every Thursday in the large room over or san michele gain by the fly buttress-bridge the dark picture on the outer wall be the very madonna to which when its position be at the mercato vecchio condemn criminal use to pray on they way to execution before we leave or san michele and the arte della lana a word on the guild of florence be necessary for at a period in florentine history between say the middle of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth they be the very powerful controller of the domestic affair of the city and it be possible that it would have be better for the florentine have they continue to be so for florence be essentially mercantile and the guild be compose of business man and it be natural that business man should know better than nobleman what a business city need they be divide into major guild chief of which be the woollen merchant -- the arte della lana -- and the silk merchant -- the calimalum -- and it be they pride to put they riches at the city 's service thus the arte dellum lana have charge of the building of the cathedral each of the major guild provide a prior and the prior elect the signorium who govern the city it be one of the principal charge that be bring against cosimo de ' medicus that he break the power of the guild return to the via calzaiolus and turn to the right we come very quickly to the piazza della signoria and see before we diagonally across it the loggia de ' lanzus and the palazzo vecchio with the gleaming gigantic figure of michelangelo 's david against the dark gateway this more than the piazza del duomo be the center of florence the palazzo vecchio be for century call the signorium be the home of the gonfalonier of florence and the signorium who assist he council it be begin by arnolfo the architect of the duomo and s croce at the end of the thirteenth century that be as we have see a period of great prosperity and ambition in florence but many alteration and addition be make -- by michelozzo cronaca vasarus and other -- to bring it to what it now be after be the scene of many riot execution and much political strife and dubiety it become a ducal palace in 1532 and be now a civic building and show-place in the old day the palazzo have a ringhiera or platform in front of it from which proclamation be make to know what this be like one have but to go to s trinità on a very fine morning and look at ghirlandaio 's fresco of the grant of the charter to s franci the scene paint in 1485 include not only the signorium but the loggia de ' lanzus -lrb- then the loggia dell ' orcagna -rrb- -- both before any statue be set up every façade of the palazzo vecchio be splendid i can not say which i admire more -- that which one see from the loggia de ' lanzus with its beautiful coping of corbel at once so heavy and so light with color escutcheon between they or that in the via de ' gondus with its fine jumble of old brickwork among the stone the palazzo vecchio be one of the most resolute and independent building in the world and it have need to be strong for the wave of florentine revolt be always break against it the tower rise from this square fortress have at once grace and strength and present a complete contrast to giotto 's campanile for giotto 's campanile be so light and delicate and reasonable and this tower of the signorium so stern and noble there be a difference as between a beautiful woman and a powerful man in the function of the two tower -- the dominate tower of florence -- be a wide difference also for the campanile call to prayer while for year the sombre note of the great signoria bell -- the vacca -- ring out only to bid the citizen to conclave or battle or to sound a alarm it be this vacca wich -lrb- with other -rrb- the brave piero capponus threaten to ring when charle viii wish in 1494 to force a disgraceful treaty on the city the scene be the medici palace in the via larga the paper be ready for signature and capponus would not sign then i must bid my trumpet blow say charle if you sound you trumpet capponus reply we will ring we bell and the king give way for he know that he man have no chance in this city if it rise suddenly against they but the glory of the palazzo vecchio tower -- afer its proportion -- be that brilliant inspiration of the architect which lead he so to speak to begin again by set the four column on the top of the solid portion these pillar be indescribably right : so solid and yet so light so powerful and yet so comely they duty be to support the bell and particularly the vacca when he rock he gigantic weight of green bronze to and fro to warn the city see from a distance the column be always beautiful see close by they be each a tower of comfortable strength and how the wind blow through they from the apennine the david on the left of the palazzo vecchio main door be only a copy the original stand there until 1873 when after three hundred and sixty-nine year it be move to a covered spot in the accademia as we shall there see and learn its history if we want to know what the palazzo vecchio look like at the time david be place there a picture by piero di cosimo in we national gallery tell we for he make it the background of he portrait of ferruccus no 895 the group on the right represent hercule and cacus -lrb- 5 -rrb- and be by baccio bandinellus -lrb- 1485-1560 -rrb- a coarse and offensive man jealous of most people and particularly of michelangelo to whom but for he displease pope clement vii the block of marble from which the hercule be carve would have be give bandinellus in he delight at obtain it vow to surpass that master 's david and those who want to know what florence thought of he effort should consult the amusing and malicious page of cellinus 's autobiography on its way to bandinellus 's studio the block fall into the arrio and it be a joke of the time that it have drown itself to avoid its fate at the sculptor 's hand even after he have half do it there be a moment when michelangelo have a opportunity of take over the stone and turn it into a samson but the siege of florence intervene and eventually bandinellus have he way and the hideous thing now on view be evolve the lion at the left end of the façade be also a copy the original by donatello be in the bargello close by but the pedestal be donatello 's original this lion be the marzocco the legendary guardian of the florentine republic and it stand here for four century and more supersede one which be kiss as a sign of submission by thousand of pisan prisoner in 1364 the florentine fleur-de-lis on the pediment be very beautiful the same lion may be see in iron on he staff at the top of the palazzo vecchio tower and again on the bargello bravely flourish he lily against the sky the great fountain with its bronze figure at this corner be by bartolommeo ammanatus a pupil of bandinellus and the statue of cosimo i be by gian bologna who be the best of the post-michelangelo sculptor and do much good work in florence as we shall see at the bargello and in the boboli garden he study under michelangelo in rome though bear a fleming and call a florentine he great fountain at bologna which be really a fine thing have identify he fame with that city have not ammanatus 's design better pleased cosimo i the bologna fountain would be here for it be design for this piazza gian 's best-known work be the fly mercury in the bargello which we have see on mantelpiece and in shop window everywhere but what be consider he masterpiece be over there in the loggia de ' lanzi the very beautiful building on the right of the palazzo the rape of the sabine a group which to I give no pleasure the bronze relief under the cosimo statue -- this cosimo being of course far other than cosimo de ' medici father of he country : cosimo i of tuscany who insist upon a crown and reign from 1537 to 1575 -- represent he assumption of rule on the death of alessandro in 1537 he triumphant entry into siena when he conquer it and absorb it and he reception of the rank of grand duke of cosimo -lrb- whom we meet in chapter v -rrb- more will be say when we enter the palazzo vecchio between this statue and the loggia de ' lanzus be a bronze tablet let into the paving which tell we that it be on this very spot in 1498 that savonarolum and two of he companion be put to death the ancient palace on the duomo side of the piazza be attribute in design to raphael who like most of the great artist of he time be also a architect and be the designer of the palazzo pandolfinus in the via san gallo no 74 the palazzo we be now admire for its blend of massiveness and beauty be the uguccione and anybody who wish may probably have a whole floor of it to-day for a few shilling a week the building which complete the piazza on the right of we with coat of arm on its façade be now give to the board of agriculture and have be recently restore it be once a court of justice the great building at the opposite side of the piazza where the tram start be a good example of modern florentine architecture base on the old : the palazzo landus build in 1871 and now chiefly a insurance office in london we have a more attractive though smaller derivative of the great day of florentine building in standen 's wool shop in jermyn street the piazza della signoria have such riches that one be in danger of neglect some the palazzo vecchio for example so overpower the loggia de ' lanzus in size as to draw the eye from that perfect structure one should not allow this to happen one should let the palazzo vecchio 's solid nobility wait awhile and concentrate on the beauty of orcagna 's three arch come so freshly from he tabernacle in or san michele we be again remind of the versatility of the early artist this structure originally call the loggia de ' priori or loggia d'orcagna be build in the fourteenth century as a open place for the delivery of proclamation and for other ceremony and also as a shelter from the rain the last be a purpose it still serve it be here that savonarolum 's ordeal by fire would have have place have it not be frustrated vasarus also give orcagna the four symbolical figure in the recess in the spandrel of the arch the loggia which take its new name from the swiss lancer or lanzus that cosimo i keep there -- he be a fearful ruler and never comfortable without a bodyguard -- be now a recognize place of siesta and hither many people carry they poste-restante correspondence from the neighbouring post office in the uffizus to read in comfort a barometer and thermometer be almost the only novelty that a visitor from the sixteenth century would notice the statuary be both old and new for here be genuine antique once in ferdinand i 's villa medicus at rome and such modern masterpiece as donatello 's judith and holoferne cellinus 's perseus and gian bologna 's two muscular and restless group the best of the antique be the woman mourn the fourth from the end on the left which be a superb creation donatello 's judith which give I less pleasure than any of he work both in the statue and in the relief be commission for cosimo de ' medicus who place it in the courtyard or garden of the medicus palace -- judith like david by she brave action against a tyrant be a champion of the florentine republic in 1495 after cosimo 's worthless grandson piero de ' medicus have be expel from florence and the medicus palace sack the statue be move to the front of the palazzo vecchio where the david now be and a inscription place on it describe it as a warn to all enemy of liberty this position be need for michelangelo 's david in 1506 judith be move to the loggia to the place where the sabine group now be in 1560 it take up its present position cellinus 's perseus will not quite do i think after donatello and verrocchio but few bronze be more famous and certainly of none have so vivacious and exciting a story be write as cellinus 's own setting forth he disappointment mortification and pride in connexion with this statue cellinus whatever one may think of he veracity be a divert and valuable writer and the picture of cosimo i which he draw for we be probably very near the truth we see he haughty familiar capricious vain impulsive clear-sighted and easily flattered intensely pleased to be in a position to command the service of artist and very unwilling to pay cellinus be a blend of lackey child and genius he leave francis i in order to serve cosimo and never cease to regret the change the perseus be he greatest accomplishment for cosimo and the narrative of its casting be terrific and not a little like duma when it be uncover in its present position all florence flock to the loggia to praise it the poet place commendatory sonnet on the pillar and the sculptor peacock up and down in a ecstasy of triumph then however he trouble once more begin for cosimo have the craft to force cellinus to name the price and we see cellinus in a agony between desire for enough and fear lest if he name enough he would offend he patron the whole book be a comedy of vanity and jealousy and florentine vigor with court as a background it be good to read it it be good have read it to study once again the unfevered resolute feature of donatello 's s george cellinus himself we may see among the statue under the uffizus and again in the place of honor -lrb- as a goldsmith -rrb- in the center of the ponte vecchio look at the perseus and remember donatello one realize that what cellinus want be character he have temperament enough but no character perseus be superb commanding distinguished and one do not care a fig for it on enter the palazzo vecchio we come instantly to one of the most charming thing in florence -- verrocchio 's fountain -- which stand in the midst of the courtyard this adorable work -- a little bronze cupid struggle with a spout dolphin -- be make for lorenzo de ' medicus 's country villa at careggus and be bring here when the palazzo be refurnish for franci i cosimo i 's son and successor and he bride joanna of austrium in 1565 nothing could better illustrate the accomplishment and imaginative adaptability of the great craftsman of the day than the two work of verrocchio that we have now see : the christ and s thoma at or san michele in donatello and michelozzo 's niche and this exquisite fountain splash water so musically notice the rich decoration of the pillar of this courtyard and the rich color and power of the pillar themselves the half-obliterated fresco of austrian town on the wall be make to prevent joanna from be homesick but be more likely one would guess to stimulate that malady in the left corner be the entrance to the old armoury now empty with opening in the wall through which piece might be discharge at various angle on any advance host the groin ceiling could support a pyramid the palazzo vecchio 's ground floor be a series of thoroughfare in which people be pass continually amid huge pillar and along dark passage but we way be up the stone step immediately to the leave on leave the courtyard where verrocchio 's child eternally smile for the step take we to that vast hall design by cronaca for savonarolum 's great council which be call into be for the government of florence after the luckless piero de ' medicus have be banish in 1494 here much history be make as to its structure and its architect vasarus who later be call in to restore it have a deal to say but it be too technical for we it be build by simone di pollaiuolo who be know as cronaca -lrb- the chronicler -rrb- from he vivid way of tell he adventure cronaca -lrb- 1454-1508 -rrb- who be a personal friend and devotee of savonarolum draw up he plan in consultation with leonardo da vincus michelangelo -lrb- although then so young : only nineteen or twenty -rrb- and other its peculiarity be that it be one of the largest room in existence without pillar from the foot of the step to the further wall i make it fifty-eight pace and thirty wide and the proportion strike the eye as perfect the wall behind the step be not at right angle with the other -- and this must be as peculiar as the absence of pillar once there be to be painting here by the greatest of all for master no less than leonardo and michelangelo be commission to decorate it each with a great historical painting : a high honor for the youthful michelangelo the loss of these work be one of the tragedy of art leonardo choose for he subject the battle of anghiarus a incident of 1440 when the florentine defeat piccinino and save they republic from the milanese and viscontus but both the cartoon and the fresco have go for ever and we sense of loss be not diminish by read in leonardo 's thought on paint the direction which he write for the use of artist who propose to paint battle : one of the most interesting and exciting piece of write in the literature of art michelangelo 's work which never reach the wall of the room as leonardo 's have do be complete as a cartoon in 1504 to 1506 in he studio in the hospital of the dyer in sant ' onofrio which be now the via guelfa the subject be also military : a incident in the long and bitter struggle between florence and pisa when sir john hawkwood -lrb- then in the pay of the pisan before he come over finally to the florentine -rrb- attack a body of florentine who be bathing in the river the scene give the young artist scope both for he power of delineate a spirited incident and for he drawing of the nude and those who see it say of this work that it be finer than anything the painter ever do while it be in progress all the young artist come to sant ' onofrio to study it as they and its creator have before flock to the carmine where masaccio 's fresco have for three-quarter of a century be object-lesson to student what become of the cartoon be not definitely know but vasarus 's story be that bandinellus the sculptor of the hercule and cacus outside the palazzo who be one of the most diligent copyist of the cartoon after it be place in a room in this building have the key of the door counterfeit and obtain entrance during a moment of tumult destroy the picture the reason give be : -lrb- 1 and a very poor one -rrb- that he desire to own the piece -lrb- 2 -rrb- that he wish to deprive other and rival student of the advantage of copy it -lrb- 3 -rrb- that he want leonardo to be the only painter of the palazzo to be consider and -lrb- 4 and sufficient -rrb- that he hate michelangelo at this time bandinellus could not have be more than eighteen vasarus 's story be uncorroborated leonardo 's battle merely perish be do in some fugitive medium and the wall be now cover with the work of vasarus himself and he pupil and do not matter while the ceiling be a muddle of undistinguished paint there be many statue which also do not matter but at the raise end be leo x son of lorenzo the magnificent and the first medicus pope and at the other a colossal modern statue of savonarolum who be in person the dominate influence here for the year between 1494 and 1497 who be to many the central figure in the history of this building and whose last night on earth be spend with he companion in this very room but to he we come in the chapter on s marco many room in the palazzo be to be see only on special occasion but the great hall be always accessible certain room upstairs mostly with rich red and yellow floor be also visible daily all interesting but most notable be the salle de lys with its lovely blue wall of lily its glorious ceiling of gold and rose ghirlandaio 's fresco of s zenobius and the perfect marble doorway contain the wooden door of giuliano and benedetto da maiano with the head of dante and petrarch in intarsium note the figure of charity and temperance in the doorway and the charming youthful baptist in eleanor of toledo 's dining-room there be some rich and elaborate green jug which i remember very clearly and also the ceiling of she workroom with its choice of penelope as the preside genius both eleanor 's chapel and that in which savonarolum pray before he execution be show but the most popular room of all with visitor -- and quite naturally -- be the little boudoiresque study of franci i with its voluptuous lady on the ceiling and the secret treasure-room lead from it while on the way just outside the door be a convenient oubliette into which to push any inconvenient visitor the loggia which mr morley have paint from the via castellanus be also always accessible and from it one have one of those pleasant view of warm roof in which florence abound one of the most attractive of the smaller room usually on view be that one which lead from the lily-room and contain nothing but map of the world : the most decorative thing conceivable next to chinese painting look naturally for sussex on the english map i find winchelsey battel rye lewe sorham arônde and cicestra from the map-room a little room be gain where the debate in the great council hall might be secretly overhear by interested eavesdropper but in particular by cosimo i a part of the cornice have hole in it for this purppse but on regain the hall itself i find that the disparity in the pattern be perfectly evident even to my eye so that every one in those suspicious day must have be aware of the listener the tower should certainly be ascend -- not only for the view and to be so near the bell and the pillar but also for historic association after a little way we come to the cell where cosimo de ' medicus later to be the father of he country be imprison before that exile which end in recall and triumph in 1433 this cell although not exactly a home from home be possible what be to be say of that other some thousand of step -lrb- as it seem -rrb- higher where savonarolum be keep for forty day vary only by interval of torture for savonarolum 's cell which be very near the top be nothing but a recess in the wall with a door to it it can not be more than five foot wide and eight foot long with a open loophole to the wind if a man be here for forty day and then pardon he life would be worth very little a bitter eyrie from which to watch the city one have risk all to reform what thought must have be he in that trap what review of policy what illuminations as to florentine character chapter viii the uffizus i : the building and the collector the growth of a gallery -- vasarus 's passaggio -- cosimo i -- franci i -- ferdinand i -- ferdinand ii -- cosimo iii -- anna marium ludovica de ' medicus -- pietro-leopoldo -- the statue of the façade -- art literature arm science and learning -- the omission -- florentine rapacity -- a antique custom -- window view -- the uffizus drawing -- the best picture the foreigner should understand at once that any inquiry into the history of the uffizus family -- such as for example yield interesting result in the case of the pazzus and the albizzus -- be doom to failure because uffizus merely mean office the palazzo deglus uffizus or palace of office be build by vasarus the biographer of the artist for cosimo i who have take the signorium or palazzo vecchio for he own home wish to provide another building for the municipal government it be begin in 1560 and still so far fulfil its original purpose as to contain the general post office while it also house certain tuscan archive and the national library a glance at piero di cosimo 's portrait of ferruccus in we national gallery will show that a ordinary florentine street precede the erection of the uffizus at that time the top storey of the building as it now exist be a open terrace afford a pleasant promenade from the palazzo vecchio down to the river and back to the loggia de ' lanzus beneath this be studio and workroom where cosimo 's army of artist and craftsman -lrb- with bronzino and cellinus as the most famous -rrb- be keep busy while the public office be on the ground floor then as he family increase cosimo decide to move and the incomplete and abandon pittus palace be buy and finish in 1565 as we have see franci cosimo 's son marry and be install in the palazzo vecchio and it be then that vasarus be call upon to construct the passaggio which unite the palazzo vecchio and the pittus cross the river by the ponte vecchio -- cosimo 's idea -lrb- borrow it be say from homer 's description of the passage unite the palace of priam and hector -rrb- be not only that he and he son might have access to each other but that in the event of danger on the other side of the river a body of soldier could be swiftly and secretly mobilize there cosimo i die in 1574 and franci i -lrb- 1574-1587 -rrb- succeed he not only in rule but in that patronage of the art which be one of the finest medicean tradition and it be he who first think of make the uffizus a picture gallery to do this be simple : it merely mean the loss of part of the terrace by walling and roofing it in ferdinand i -lrb- 1587-1609 -rrb- add the pretty tribuna and other room and bring hither a number of the treasure from the villa medicus at rome cosimo ii -lrb- 1609-1621 -rrb- do little but ferdinand ii -lrb- 1621-1670 -rrb- complete the roofing in of the terrace place there he own collection of drawing and a valuable collection of venetian picture which he have buy together with those that he wife vittorium dellum rovere have bring he from urbino while he brother cardinal giovannus carlo de ' medicus and cardinal leopoldo de ' medicus -lrb- the extremely ugly man with the curl chin at the head of the uffizus stair -rrb- add theirs giovannus carlo 's picture which mostly go to the pittus be varied but leopold 's be chiefly portrait of artist wherever possible paint by themselves a collection which be steadily be add to at the present time and be to be see in several room of the uffizus and those miniature portrait of man of eminence which we shall see in the corridor between the poccettus gallery and salon of justice at the pittus cosimo iii -lrb- 1670-1723 -rrb- add the dutch picture and the famous venus de ' medicus and other tribuna statuary the gallery remain the private property of the medicus family until the electress palatine anna marium ludovica de ' medici daughter of cosimo iii and great niece of the cardinal leopold bequeath all these treasure to which she have greatly add together with bronze now in the bargello etruscan antiquity now in the archaeological museum tapestry also there and book in the laurentian library to florence for ever on condition that they should never be remove from florence and should exist for the benefit of the public she death be in 1743 and with she pass away the last descendant of that giovannus de ' medicus -lrb- 1360-1429 -rrb- whom we see give commission to donatello build the child 's hospital and help florence to the best of he power : so that the first medicus and the last be akin in love of art and in generosity to they beautiful city the new austrian grand duke continue to add to the uffizus particularly pietro-leopoldo -lrb- 1765-1790 -rrb- who also found the accademia to he be due the assemble under the uffizus roof of all the outlying picture then belong to the state include

threaten to ring the city bell and farina deglus uberti a earlier soldier who die in 1264 and be in the divina commedium as a hero it be he who repulse the ghibelline suggestion that florence should be destroy and the inhabitant emigrate to empoli work back towards the loggia de ' lanzus we find less-known name : pietro antonio michele -lrb- 1679-1737 -rrb- the botanist francesco redus -lrb-

goldsmith and sculptor the most notable omission be arnolfo and brunelleschus -lrb- but these be as we have see on the façade of the palazzo de ' canonici opposite the south side of the cathedral -rrb- ghibertus fra angelico and savonarolum personally i should like to have still other here among they giorgio vasarus in recognition of he enthusiastic and entertaining biography of the florentine artist to say nothing of the circumstance that he design this building before we enter any florentine gallery let I say that there be only one free day and that the crowded sabbath admittance to nearly all be a lira moreover there be no re-admission the charge strike english visitor accustom to the open portal of they own museum and gallery as a outrage and it explain also the little interest in they treasure which most florentine display for be essentially a frugal people they have seldom see they visitor who can satisfy the authority that they be desirous of study the work of art with a serious purpose can obtain free pass but only after certain preliminary which include a seance with a photographer to satisfy the doorkeeper by compare the real and counterfeit physiognomy that no illicit transference of the precious privilege have be make italy be one know not a rich country but the revenue which the gallery entrance-fee represent can not reach any great volume and such as it be it have much better i should say be raise by other means meanwhile the foreigner chiefly pay it what giovannus de ' medicus and lorenzo de ' medicus and -- even more -- what anna marium ludovica de ' medicus who bequeath to the state these possession would think could they see this feverish and implacable pursuit of penny i have not imagination or scorn enough to set down infirm and languid visitor should get it clearly into they head -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the tour of the uffizus mean a long walk and -lrb- 2 -rrb- that there be a lift you find it in the umbrella room -- at every florentine gallery and museum be a official whose one object in life be to take away you umbrella -- and it cost twopence-halfpenny and be worth far more but walk downstairs be imperative because otherwise one would miss silenus and bacchus and a beautiful urgent mar in bronze together with other fine sculptured thing one of the quaintest symbol of conservatism in florence be the scissors of the official who supply ticket of entrance apparently the perforated line be unknown in italy hence the ticket be divide from its counterfoil -lrb- which i assume go to the authority in order that they may check they horrid takings -rrb- by a huge pair of shears these thing be snip-snap all over italy all day long have obtain you ticket you hand it to another official at a turn-stile and at last you be free of cupidity and red tape and may breathe easily again and examine the product of the light-hearted generous renaissance in the right spirit one should never forget in any gallery of florence to look out of the window there be always a courtyard a street or a spire against the sky and at the uffizus there be the river and bridge and mountain from the loggia of the palazzo vecchio i once see a woman with some twenty or thirty city pigeon on the table of she little room feed they with maize except for glimpse of the river and the via guicciardinus which it give i advise no one to walk through the passage unite the pittus and the uffizus -- unless of course bent on catch some of the ancient thrill when arm man run swiftly from one palace to the other to quell a disturbance or repulse a assault particularly do this counsel apply to wet day when all the window be close and there be no air a certain interest attach to the myriad portrait which line the wall chiefly of the medicus and comparatively recent worthy but one must have a glutton 's passion either for paint or history to wish to examine these as a matter of fact only a lightning-speed tourist could possibly think of see both the uffizus and the pittus on the same day and therefore the need of the passage disappear it be hard work only on sunday the drawing in the case in the first long corridor be worth close study -- cover as they do the whole range of great italian art : from say uccello to carlo dolci but as they be from time to time change it be useless to say more of they there be also on the first landing of the staircase a room in which exhibition of drawing of the old master be hold and this be worth know about not only because of the riches of the portfolio in the collection but also because once you have pass the door you be inside the only picture gallery in florence for which no entrance fee be ask how the authority have come to overlook this additional source of revenue i have no notion but they have and visitor should hasten to make the most of it for fear that a translation of these word of mine may wander into bad hand to name the most wonderful picture in the uffizus would be a very difficult task at the accademia if a plebiscite be take there be little doubt but that botticellus 's primavera would win at the pittus i personally would name giorgione 's concert without any hesitation at all but probably the public vote would go to raphael 's madonna dellum sedium but the uffizus here we be amid such wealth of masterpiece and yet when one come to pass they in review in memory none stand out as those other two i have name perhaps botticellus would win again with he birth of venus be the leonardo finish but it be only a sketch luca signorellus 's wild flower in no 74 seem to abide with I as vividly and graciously as anything but they be but a detail and it be a very personal predilection perhaps the great exotic work paint far away in belgium -- the van der go triptych -- be the most memorable but to choose a alien canvas be to break the rule of the game be it perhaps the unfinished leonardo after all if not and not the botticellus it be beyond question that lovely adoring madonna so gentle and sweet against the purest and bluest of tuscan sky which be attribute to filippino lippus : no 1354 chapter ix the uffizus ii : the first six room lorenzo monaco -- fra angelico -- mariotto albertinellus turn innkeeper -- the venetian room -- giorgione 's death -- titian -- mantegna unite north and south -- giovannus bellinus -- domenico ghirlandaio -- michelangelo -- luca signorellus -- wild flower -- leonardo da vincus -- paolo uccello the first and second room be venetian but i be incline to think that it be better to take the second door on the leave -- the first tuscan salon -- and walk straight across it come at once to the salon of lorenzo monaco and the primitive for the earliest good picture be here here especially one should remember that the picture be paint never for a gallery but for church lorenzo monaco -lrb- lawrence the monk 1370-c 1425 -rrb- who give he name to this room be a monk of the camaldolese order in the monastery of the angelus and be a little earlier than fra angelico -lrb- the angelic brother -rrb- the more famous painting monk whose date be 1387-1455 lorenzo be influence by taddeo gaddus giotto 's godson friend pupil and assistant he greatest work be this large uffizus altar-piece -- he paint nothing but altar-piece -- depict the coronation of the virgin : a great gay scene of splendor contain pretty angel who must have be the delight of child in church the predellum -- and here let I advise the visitor never to overlook the predella where the artist often throw off formality and allow he more natural feeling to have play almost as though he paint the picture for other and the predellum for himself -- be peculiarly interesting look at the leave at the death of a old saint attend by monk and nun whose grief be profound one other good lorenzo be here a adoration of the magus no 39 a little out of draw but full of life but for most people the glory of the room be not lorenzo the monk but brother giovannus of fiesole know ever more as beato or fra angelico of that most adoring and most adorable of painter i say much in the chapter on the accademia where he be very fully represent and it might perhaps be well to turn to those page -lrb- 227-230 -rrb- and read here on we first sight of he genius what be say two angelico be in this room -- the great triptych opposite the chief lorenzo and the crowning of the virgin on a easel the triptych be as much copy as any picture in the gallery not however for its principal figure but for the border of twelve angel round the center panel angelico 's benignancy and sweetness be here but it be not the equal of the coronation which be a blaze of pious fervor and glory the group of saint on the right be very charming but we be to be more pleased by this radiant hand when we reach the accademia already however we have learn he love of blue another altar-piece with a subtle quality of its own be the early annunciation by simone martini of siena -lrb- 1285-1344 -rrb- and lippo memmus he brother -lrb- d 1357 -rrb- in which the angel speak he golden word across the picture through a vase of lily and the virgin receive they shrinkingly it be all very primitive but it have great attraction and it be interesting to think that the picture must be get on for six hundred year of age this simone be a pupil of giotto and the painter of a portrait of petrarch 's laura now preserve in the laurentian library which earn he two sonnet of eulogy it be also two sienese painter who have make the gayest thing in this room the predellum no 1304 by neroccio di siena -lrb- 1447-1500 -rrb- and francesco di giorgio di siena -lrb- 1439-1502 -rrb- contain scene in the life of s benedetto neroccio do the landscape and figure the other the architecture and very fine it be another delightful predellum be that by benozzo gozzolus -lrb- 1420-1498 -rrb- fra angelico 's pupil whom we have see at the riccardus palace gozzolus 's predellum be no 1302 finally look at no 64 which show how prettily certain imitator of fra angelico could paint after the salum di lorenzo monaco let we enter the first tuscan room the draughtsmanship of the great last judgment fresco by fra bartolommeo -lrb- 1475-1517 -rrb- and mariotto albertinellus -lrb- 1474-1515 -rrb- be very fine it be now a ruin but enough remain to show that it must have be impressive these collaborator although intimate friend ultimately go different way for fra bartolommeo come under the influence of savonarolum burn he nude drawing and enter the convent of s marco whereas albertinellus who be a convivial follower of venus tiring of art and even more of art jargon take a inn outside the s gallo gate and a tavern on the ponte vecchio remark that he have find a way of life that need no knowledge of muscle foreshorten or perspective and better still be without critic among he pupil be franciabigio whose lovely madonna of the well we be come to in the tribuna chief among the other picture be two by the delightful alessio baldovinettus the master of domenico ghirlandaio no 60 and 56 and a large early altar-piece by the brother orcagna paint in 1367 for s marium nuova now the principal hospital of florence and once the home of many beautiful picture this work be rather dingy now but it be interesting as come in part from the hand that design the tabernacle in or san michele and the loggia de ' lanzi another less-known painter represent here be francesco granaccus -lrb- 1469-1543 -rrb- the author of no 1541 and 1280 both rich and warm and please granaccus be a fellow-pupil of michelangelo both in lorenzo de ' medicus 's garden and in ghirlandaio 's workshop and the bosom friend of that great man all he life like piero di cosimo granaccus be a great hand at pageantry and lorenzo de ' medici keep he busy he be not dependent upon art for he living but paint for love of it and vasarus make he a very agreeable man here too be gio antonio soglianus -lrb- 1492-1544 -rrb- also a rare painter with a finely color and finely draw disputa no 63 this painter seem to have have the same devotion to he master lorenzo di credi that di credi have for he master verrocchio vasarus call soglianus a worthy religious man who mind he own affair -- a good epitaph he work be rarely meet with in florence but he have a large fresco at s marco lorenzo di credi -lrb- 1459-1537 -rrb- himself have two pretty circular painting here of which no 1528 be particularly sweet : the virgin and child with st john and angel all comfortable and happy in a tuscan meadow while on a easel be another circular picture by pacchiarotto -lrb- 1477-1535 -rrb- this have good color and twilight beauty but it do not touch one and be not too felicitously compose over the door to the venetian room be a cosimo rossellus with a prettily affectionate madonna and child from this miscellaneous tuscan room we pass to the two room which contain the venetian picture of which i shall say less than might perhaps be expect not because i do not intensely admire they but because i feel that the chief space in a florentine book should be give to florentine or tuscan thing as a matter of fact i find myself when in the uffizus continually draw to revisit these wall the chief treasure be the titian the giorgione the mantegna the carpaccio and the bellinus allegory these alone would make the uffizus a mecca of connoisseur giorgione be to be find in he richest perfection at the pittus in he one unforgettable work that be preserve there but here he be wonderful too with he cavalier of malta black and golden and the two rich scene no 621 and 630 nominally from scripture but really from romantic italy to I these three picture be the jewel of the venetian collection to describe they be impossible : enough to say that some glowing genius produce they and whatever the expert admit personally i prefer to consider that genius giorgione giorgione who be bear in 1477 and die young -- at thirty-three -- be like titian the pupil of bellinus but be greatly influence by leonardo da vincus later he become titian 's master he be passionately devote to music and to lady and it be indeed from a lady that he have he early death for he continue to kiss she after she have take the plague -lrb- no bad way to die either for to be in the power of a emotion that sway one to such foolishness be surely better than to live the lukewarm calculate life of most of we -rrb- giorgione 's claim to distinction be that not only be he a glorious colourist and master of light and shade but may be say to have invent small genre picture that could be earn about and hang in this or that room at pleasure -- such picture as many of the best dutch painter be to bend they genius to almost exclusively -- he favorite subject be music party and picnic these mose and solomon picture in the uffizus be of course only a pretext for gloriously color arrangement of people with rich scenic background no621 be the finer the way in which the baby be be hold in the other indicate how little giorgione thought of verisimilitude the color be the thing after the giorgione the titian chief of which be no633 the madonna and child with s john and s anthony sometimes call the madonna of the rose a work which throw a pallor over all tuscan picture no626 the golden flora who glow more gloriously every moment -lrb- whom we shall see again at the pittus as the magdalen -rrb- the duke and duchess of urbino nos605 and 599 the duchess set at a window with what look so curiously like a deep blue surrey landscape through it and a village spire in the midst and 618 a unfinished madonna and child in which the master 's method can be follow the child complete save for the final bath of light be a miracle of draughtsmanship the triptych by andrea mantegna -lrb- 1431-1506 -rrb- be of inexhaustible interest for here as ever mantegna be full of thought and purpose the left panel represent the ascension christ be bear upward by eleven cherubim in a solid cloud the right panel -- by far the best i think -- show the circumcision where the painter have set himself various difficulty of architecture and goldsmith 's work for the pleasure of overcome they every detail be paint with dutch minuteness and yet leave the picture big while the middle panel which be concave depict a adoration of the magus that will bear much study the whole effect be very northern : not much less so than we own new national gallery mabuse mantegna also have a charming madonna and child no 1025 with please pastoral and stone-quarrying activity in the distance on the right of the triptych be the so-called carpaccio -lrb- 1450-1519 -rrb- a confused but glorious melee of youth and halberd red and yellow and brown very modern and splendid and totally unlike anything else in the whole gallery uccello may possibly be recall but only for subject finally there be giovannus bellinus -lrb- 1426-1516 -rrb- master of titian and giorgione with he sacra conversazione no 631 which mean i know not what but have a haunt quality later we shall see a picture by michelangelo which have be accuse of blend christianity and paganism but bellini 's sole purpose be to do this we have child from a bacchic vase and the crown virgin two naked saint and a venetian lady and a centaur watch a hermit the foreground be a mosaic terrace the background be rock and water it be all bizarre and very curious and memorable and quite unique for the rest i should mention two charming guardi a rich little canaletto a nice scene of sheep by jacopo bassano the portrait of a unknown young man by a unknown painter no 1157 and tintoretto 's daring abraham and isaac the other venetian room be almost wholly devote to portrait chief among they be a red-headed tintoretto burning furiously no 613 and titian 's sly and sinister caterina cornaro in she gorgeous dress no 648 piombo 's l'uomo ammalato tintoretto 's jacopo sansovino the sculptor the grave old man hold he caliper who make that wonderful greek bacchus at the bargello schiavone 's ripe bearded ignoto no 649 and perhaps above all the moronus no 386 black against gray there be also paolo veronese 's holy family with s catherine superbly masterly and golden but suggest the rialto rather than nazareth one picture give the next room the salum di michelangelo its name but enter from the venetian room we come first on the right to a very well-known lippo lippus copy in every picture shop in florence : no 1307 a madonna and two child few picture be so beset by delighted observer but apart from the perfection of it as a early painting leave nothing to later dexterity its appeal to I be weak the madonna -lrb- whose head-dress as so often in lippo lippus foreshadow botticellus -rrb- and the landscape equally delight the child almost repel and the decorative furniture in the corner quite repel the picture be interesting also for its color which be unlike anything else in the gallery the green of the madonna 's dress be especially lovely and distinguished and vulgarize the ghirlandaio -- no 1297 -- which hang next this picture be far too hot throughout and would indeed be almost displease but for the irradiation of the virgin 's face the other ghirlandaio -- no 1295 -- in this room be far finer and sweeter but at the accademia and the badium we be to see he at he best in this class of work none the less no 1295 be a charming thing and the little mother and she happy child whose big toe be be so reverently adore by the ancient mage be very near real simple life this artist we shall see always paint healthy honest baby the seaport in the distance be charming too ghirlandaio 's place in this room be interesting on account of he relation to michelangelo as first instructor but by the time that the great master 's holy family hang here be paint all trace of ghirlandaio 's influence have disappear and if any forerunner be noticeable it be luca signorellus but we must first glance at the pretty little lorenzo di credi no 1160 the annunciation a artificial work full of nice thought and touch with the prettiest little blue virgin imaginable a heavenly landscape and a predellum in monochrome in one scene of which eve rise from the side of the sleep adam with extraordinary realism the announce gabriel be deferential but positive mary be question but not wholly surprise in any collection of annunciation this picture would find a prominent place the holy family of michelangelo -- no 1139 -- be remarkable for more than one reason it be to begin with the only finished easel picture that exist from he brush it be also he one work in oils for he afterwards despise that medium as be fit only for child the frame be contemporary and be make for it the whole be commission by angelo donus a wealthy connoisseur whose portrait by raphael we shall see in the pittus and who accord to vasarus do he best to get it cheaper than he bargain and have in the end to pay dearer the period of the picture be about 1503 while the great david be in progress when the painter be twenty-eight that it be masterly and superb there can be no doubt but like so much of michelangelo 's work it suffer from its author 's greatness there be a austerity of power here that ill consort with the tender domesticity of the scene and the child be a young hercule the nude figure in the background introduce a alien element and suggest the conflict between christianity and paganism the new religion and the old : in short the twilight of the god whether michelangelo intend this we shall not know but there it be the prevail impression leave by the picture be immense power and virtuosity and no religion in the beautiful luca signorellus -- no74 -- next it we find at once a curious similarity and difference the madonna and child only be in the foreground a not too radiant but very tender couple in the background be male figure nearly nude : not quite as michelangelo make they and suggest no discord as in he picture luca be bear in 1441 and be thus thirty-four year older than michelangelo this picture be perhaps that one present by luca to lorenzo de ' medicus of which vasarus tell and if so it be probably on a wall in the medicus palace when michelangelo as a boy be teach with lorenzo 's son luca 's sweetness be alien to michelangelo but not he melancholy or he sense of composition while luca 's devotion to the human form as the unit of expression be in michelangelo carry out to its highest power vasarus who be a relative of luca 's and a pupil of michelangelo 's say that he master have the greatest admiration for luca 's genius luca signorellus be bear at cortona and be instruct by piero della francesca whose one uffizus painting be in a later room he chief work be at cortona at rome -lrb- in the sixtine chapel -rrb- and at orvieto he fame be sufficient in florence in 1491 for he to be make one of the judge of the design for the façade of the duomo luca live to a great age not die till 1524 and be much beloved he be magnificent in he habit and love fine clothes be very kindly and helpful in disposition and the influence of he naturalness and sincerity upon art be great one very pretty sad story be tell of he to the effect that when he son whom he have dearly loved be kill at cortona he cause the body to be strip and paint it with the utmost exactitude that through he own handiwork he might be able to contemplate that treasure of which fate have rob he perhaps the most beautiful or at any rate the most idiosyncratic thing in the picture before we be its lovely profusion of wayside flower these come out but poorly in the photograph but in the painting they be exquisite both in form and in detail luca paint they as if he love they -lrb- there be a hint of the same thoughtful care in the flower in no 1133 by luca in we national gallery but these at florence be the best -rrb- no 74 be in tempera : the next also by luca no1291 be in oil a holy family a work at once powerful rich and sweet here again we may trace a influence on michelangelo for the child be show deprecate a book which he mother be display while in the beautiful marble tondo of the madonna and child by michelangelo which we be soon to see in the bargello a reading lesson be in progress and the child weary of it we find luca again in the next large picture -- no1547 -- a crucifixion with various saint do in collaboration with perugino the design suggest luca rather than he companion and the woman at the foot of the cross be surely the type of which he be so fond the drawing of christ be masterly and all too sombre for perugino finally there be a luca predellum no 1298 represent the annunciation the birth of christ -lrb- in which joseph be older almost than in any version -rrb- and the adoration of the magus all notable for freedom and richness note the realism and charm and the costume of the two page of the magus and now we come to what be perhaps the most lovely picture in the whole gallery judge purely as color and sweetness and design -- no1549 -- a madonna adore with filippino lippus 's name and a interrogation mark beneath it who paint it if not filippino that be the question but into such problem which confront one at every turn in florence i be neither qualify nor anxious to enter when doctor disagree any one may decide before I the thought moreover that always occur in the presence of these good debatable picture be that any doubt as to they origin merely enrich this already over-rich period since some one have to paint they simon not pure become hardly less remarkable than simon pure if only the baby be more please this would be perhaps the most delightful picture in the world : as it be its blues alone lift it to the heaven of delectableness by a unusual stroke of fortune a crack in the paint where the panel join have make a star in the tender blue sky the tuscan landscape be very still and beautiful the flower although conventional and not accurate like luca 's be as pretty as can be the one unsatisfying element be the baby who be a little clumsy and a little in pain but diffuse radiance none the less and the mother -- the mother be all perfection and winsomeness she face and hand be exquisite and the tuscan twilight behind she be so lovely i have give a reproduction but color be essential the remain three picture in the room be a bastiano and a pollaiolo which be rather for the student than for the wanderer and a charming ignoto no 75 which i like immensely but ignoto nearly always paint well in the salum di leonardo be two picture which bear the name of this most fascinating of all the painter of the world one be the annunciation no 1288 upon the authenticity of which much have be say and write and the other a unfinished adoration of the magus which can not be question by anyone the probability be that the annunciation be a early work and that the ascription be accurate : at oxford be a draw know to be leonardo 's that be almost certainly a study for a detail of this work while among the leonardo drawing in the he de la salle collection at the louvre be something very like a first sketch of the whole certainly one can think of no one else who could have give the picture its quality which increase in richness with every visit to the gallery but the workshop of verrocchio where leonardo work together with lorenzo di credi and perugino with andrea of the true eye over all no doubt put forth wonderful thing the annunciation be unique in the collection both in color and character : nothing in the uffizus so deepen there be no cypress like these in any other picture no finer drawing than that of mary 's hand luca 's flower be better in the adjoining room one be not too happy about the pedestal of the reading-desk and there be virgin whom we can like more but as a whole it be perhaps the most fascinating picture of all for it have the leonardo darkness as well as light of leonardo i could write for ever but this book be not the place for though he be a florentine florence have very little of he work : these picture only and one of these only for certain together with a angel in a work by verrocchio at the accademia which we shall see and possibly a sculptured figure over the north door of the baptistery ludovico sforza duke of milan and franci i of france lure he away to the eternal loss of he own city it be milan and pari that be richest in he work and after that london which have at south kensington a sculptured relief by he as well as a painting at the national gallery a cartoon at burlington house and the british museum drawing he other work here -- no 1252 -- in the grave brown frame be to have be leonardo 's greatest picture in oil so vasarus say : larger in fact than any known picture at that time be very indistinct it be curiously enough best as the light begin to fail and the beautiful wistful face emerge from the gloom in they presence one recall leonardo 's remark in one of he notebook that face be most interesting beneath a troubled sky you should make you portrait he add at the hour of the fall of the evening when it be cloudy or misty for the light then be perfect in the background one can discern the prance horse of the magus 's suite a staircase with figure ascend and descend the rock and tree of tuscany and look at it one can not but ponder upon the fatality which seem to have pursue this divine and magical genius ordain that almost everything that he put forth should be either destroy or unfinished : he work in the castello at milan which might otherwise be a eighth wonder of the world perish he last supper at milan perish he colossal equestrian statue of francesco sforza break to piece he sculpture lose he palazzo vecchio battle cartoon perish this picture only a sketch even after long year the evil fate still persist for in 1911 he gioconda be steal from the louvre by madman or knave among the other picture in this room be the rather hot adoration of the magus by cosimo rossellus -lrb- 1439-1507 -rrb- over the leonardo annunciation a glowing scene of color and animation : this cosimo be the cosimo from whom piero di cosimo take he name and a associate of botticellus ghirlandaio perugino and luca signorellus on the sixtine chapel fresco on the left wall be uccello 's battle piece no 52 very like that in we national gallery : rich and glorious as decoration but quite bear out vasarus 's statement that uccello could not draw horse uccello be a most laborious student of animal life and so absorb in the mystery of perspective that he prefer they to bed but he do not seem to have be able to unite they he be a perpetual butt of donatello it be tell of he that have a commission to paint a fresco for the mercato vecchio he keep the progress of the work a secret and allow no one to see it at last when it be finish he draw aside the sheet for donatello who be buy fruit to admire ah paolo say the sculptor reproachfully now that you ought to be cover it up you uncover it there remain a superb nude study of venus by lorenzo di credi no 3452 -- one of the picture which escape savonarolum 's bonfire of vanity and no 1305 a virgin and child with various saint by domenico veneziano -lrb- 1400-1461 -rrb- who teach gentile da fabriano the teacher of jacopo bellinus this picture be a complete contrast to the uccello : for that be all tapestry richness and belligerence and this be so pale and gentle with its lovely light green a rare color in this gallery chapter x the uffizus iii : botticellus a painter apart -- sandro filipepus -- artist ' name -- piero de ' medici -- the adoration of the magus -- the judith picture -- lucrezium tornabuonus lorenzo and giuliano 's mother -- the tournament -- the birth of venus and the primavera -- simonetta -- a new star -- sacred picture -- savonarolum and the calumny -- the national gallery -- botticellus 's old age and death we come next to the salum di botticelli and such be the position hold by this painter in the affection of visitor to florence and such the wealth of work from he hand that the uffizus possess that i feel that a single chapter may well be devote to he genius more particularly as many of he picture be so closely associate with piero de ' medicus and lorenzo de ' medici we see botticellus here at he most vary the accademia also be very rich in he work have above all the primavera and in this chapter i shall glance at the accademia picture too return to they when we reach that gallery in due course among the great florentine master botticellus stand apart by reason not only of the sensitive wistful delicacy of he work but for the profound interest of he personality he be not essentially more beautiful than he friend filippino lippus or -- occasionally -- than fra lippo lippi he master but he be always deeper one feel that he too feel the emotion that he character display he do not merely paint he think and suffer hence he work be dramatic again botticellus have far wider sympathy than most of he contemporary he be a friend of the medicus a neo-platonist a student of theology with the poet palmierus a illustrator of dante and a devoted follower of savonarolum of the part that woman play in he life we know nothing : in fact we know less of he intimately than of almost any of the great painter but this we may guess that he be never a happy man he work fall naturally into division correspond to he early devotion to piero de ' medicus and he wife lucrezium tornabuonus in whose house for a while he live to he interest in they son lorenzo and giuliano and finally to he belief in savonarolum sublime he never be comforting he never be but he be everything else one can never forget in he presence the tragedy that attend the too earnest seeker after beauty : not all be vanity do botticellus say but all be transitory botticellus as we now call he be the son of mariano filipepus and be bear in florence in 1447 accord to one account he be call sandro di botticelli because he be apprentice to a goldsmith of that name accord to another he brother antonio a goldsmith be know as botticello -lrb- which mean a little barrel -rrb- and sandro be with he be call sandro di botticello whatever the cause the fact remain that the name of filipepus be rarely use and here a word as to the capriciousness of the nomenclature of artist we know some by they christian name some by they surname some by they nickname some by the name of they town and some by the name of they master tommaso bigordus a goldsmith be so clever in design a pretty garland for woman 's hair that he be call ghirlandaio the garland-maker and he painter son domenico be therefore know for ever as uomenico ghirlandaio paolo donus a painter of battle scene be so fond of bird that he be know as uccello -lrb- a bird -rrb- and now have no other name pietro vannuccus come from perugium be call perugino agnolo di francesco di migliore happen to be a tailor with a genius of a son andrea that genius be therefore andrea of the tailor -- del sarto -- for all time and so forth to return to botticellus in 1447 when he be bear fra angelico be sixty and masaccio have be dead for some year at the age of twelve the boy be place with fra lippo lippus then a man of a little more than fifty to learn painting that lippo be he master one may see continually but particularly by comparison of he headdress with almost any of botticellus 's both be minutely careful in this detail but where lippo be beautifully obvious sandro be beautifully analytical : he be also as i have say much more interesting and dramatic botticellus 's best patron be piero de ' medicus who take he into he house much as he son lorenzo be to take michelangelo into he and make he one of the family for piero botticellus always have affection and respect and when he paint he fortitude as one of the pollaiuolus 's series of the virtue for the mercatanzium -lrb- of which several be in this gallery -rrb- he make the figure symbolize piero 's life and character -- or so it be possible if one wish to believe but it should be understand that almost nothing be know about botticellus and the origin of he picture at piero 's request botticellus paint the adoration of the magus -lrb- no 1286 -rrb- which be to hang in s marium novellum as a offering of gratitude for piero 's escape from the conspiracy of luca pittus in 1466 piero have but just succeed to cosimo when pittus consider he merely a invalid strike he blow by virtue largely of the young lorenzo 's address the attack miscarry : hence the presence of lorenzo in the picture on the extreme leave with a sword piero himself in scarlet kneel in the middle giuliano he second son doom to a early death by assassination be kneel on he right the picture be not only a sacred painting but -lrb- like the gozzolus fresco at the riccardus palace -rrb- a exaltation of the medicus family the dead cosimo be at the child 's foot the dead giovannus piero 's brother stand close to the kneel giuliano among the other person represent be collateral medicus and certain of they friend it be by some accept that the figure in yellow on the extreme right look out of this picture be botticelli himself but for a portrait of the painter of more authenticity we must go to the carmine where in the brancaccus chapel we shall see a fresco by botticellus 's friend filippino lippus represent the crucifixion of s peter in which we painter be depict on the right look on at the scene -- a rather coarse heavy face with a large mouth and long hair he wear a purple cap and red cloak vasarus tell we that botticellus although so profoundly thoughtful and melancholy in he work be extravagant pleasure loving and give to practical joke part at least of this might be gather from observation of filippino lippus 's portrait of he accord to vasari it be no 1286 which bring botticellus he invitation to rome from sixtus iv to decorate the sixtine chapel but that be several year later and much be to happen in the interval the two little judith picture -lrb- no 1156 and 1158 -rrb- be paint for piero de ' medicus and have they place in the medicus palace in 1494 when piero di lorenzo de ' medicus be banish from florence and the palace loot they be steal and lose sight of but during the reign of franci i they reappear and be present to he wife bianca capellum and once more place with the medici treasure no 1156 the judith walk springily along sword in hand have slay the tyrant be one of the masterpiece of paint everything about it be radiant superb and unforgettable one other picture which the young painter make for he patron -- or in this case he patroness lucrezium tornabuonus piero 's wife -- be the madonna of the magnificat no 1267 with its beautiful child and sweet madonna its lovely landscape but not too attractive child the two boy be lorenzo on the left and giuliano in yellow one of they sister lean over they here the boy be perhaps in botticellus 's way typify rather than portray although this picture come so early in he career botticellus never excel its richness beauty and depth of feeling nor its liquid delicacy of treatment lucrezium tornabuonus for whom he paint it be a very remarkable woman not only a good mother to she child and a good wife to piero but a poet and exemplar she survive piero by thirteen year and she son giuliano by five botticellus paint she portrait which be now in berlin these picture be the principal work of botticellus 's first period which coincide with the five year of piero 's rule and the period of mourning for he he next appear in what many of he admirer find he most fascinating mood as a joyous allegorist the picture of venus rise from the sea in this room the primavera which we shall see at the accademia and the mar and venus in we national gallery belong to this epoch but in order to understand they we must again go to history piero be succeed in 1469 by he son lorenzo the magnificent who continue he father 's friendship for the young painter now twenty-two year of age in 1474 lorenzo devise for he brother giuliano a tournament in the piazza of s croce very like that which piero have give for lorenzo on the occasion of he betrothal in 1469 and botticellus be commission by lorenzo to make picture commemorate the event verrocchio again help with the costume lucrezia donatus again be queen of the tournament but the queen of beauty be the sixteen-year-old bride of marco vespuccus -- the lovely simonetta cattaneo a lady greatly beloved by all and a close friend both of giuliano and lorenzo the praise of lorenzo 's tournament have be sing by luca pulcus : giuliano 's be sing by poliziano under the title la giostra di giuliano de ' medicus and it be this poem which botticellus may be say to have illustrate for both poet and artist employ the same imagery thus poliziano or politian -lrb- of whom we shall hear more in the chapter on s marco -rrb- compare simonetta to venus and in stanza 100 and 101 speak of she birth describe she blow to earth over the sea by the breath of the zephyr and welcome there by the hour one of whom offer she a robe this botticellus translate into exquisite tempera with a wealth of pretty thought the cornflower and daisy on the hour 's dress be alone a perennial joy simonetta as venus have some of the wistfulness of the madonna and not without reason do botticellus give she this expression for she day be very short in the primavera which we be to see at the accademia but which must be describe here we find simonetta again but we do not see she first we see first that slender upright command figure all flower and youth and conquest in she lovely floral dress advance over the grass like thistle-down never before in painting have anything be do at once so distinguished and joyous and pagan as this for a kindred emotion one have to go to greek sculpture but botticellus while he grace and joy be hellenic be intensely modern too : the problem of the renaissance the tragedy of christianity equally cloud he brow the symbolism of the primavera be interesting glorious spring be return to earth -- in the presence of venus -- once more to make all glad and with she she attendant to dance and sing and the zephyr to bring the soft breeze and by spring botticellus mean the reign of lorenzo whose tournament motto be le temp revient simonetta be again the central figure and never do botticelli paint more exquisitely than here she bosom be the prettiest in florence the lining of she robe over she right arm have such green and blue and gold as never be see elsewhere she golden sandal be delicate as gossamer over she head a little cupid hover direct he arrow at mercury on the extreme left beside the three grace in mercury who be touch the tree with he caduceus and bid they burgeon some see giuliano de ' medicus who be not yet betroth but when the picture be paint both giuliano and simonetta be dead : simonetta first of consumption in 1476 and giuliano by stab in 1478 lorenzo who be at pisa during simonetta 's illness detail he own physician for she care on hearing of she death he walk out into the night and notice for the first time a brilliant star see he say either the soul of that most gentle lady have be transfer into that new star or else have it be join together thereunto of giuliano 's end we have read in chapter ii and it be botticelli whose destiny be so closely bind up with the medicus who be commission to paint portrait of the murderous pazzus to be display outside the palazzo vecchio a third picture in what may be call the tournament period be find by some in the venus and mar no 915 in we national gallery here giuliano would be mar and venus either one woman in particular whom florence wish he to marry or all woman typify by one try to lure he from other pre-occupation such as hunting to make she simonetta be to go too far for she be not like the simonetta of the other picture and simonetta be but recently marry and a very model of fair repute in no 916 in the national gallery be a venus with cupid -lrb- which might be by botticellus and might be by that interesting painter of whom mr berenson have write so attractively as amico di sandro -rrb- in which politian 's description of venus in he poem be again closely follow after the tournament picture we come in botticellus 's career to the sixtine chapel fresco and on he return to florence to other fresco include that lovely one at the villa lemmus -lrb- then the villa tornabuonus -rrb- which be now on the staircase of the louvre these be follow by at least two more medicus picture -- the portrait of piero di lorenzo de ' medicus in this room no 1154 the sad-faced youth with the medal and the palla and the centaur at the pittus a historical record of lorenzo 's success as a diplomatist when he go to naple in 1480 the latter part of botticellus 's life be spend under the influence of savonarolum and in despair at the wickedness of the world and its treatment of that prophet he picture become wholly religious but it be religion without joy never capable of disguise the sorrow that underlie all human happiness -- or as i think of it in look at he work the sense of transience -- botticellus as age come upon he be more than ever depress one have the feeling that he be persuade that only through devotion and self-negation could peace of mind be gain and yet for himself could find none the sceptic be too strong in he savonarolum 's eloquence could not make he serene however much he may have come beneath its spell it but serve to increase he melancholy hence these wistful despondent madonna all so conscious of the tragedy before they child hence these troubled angel and shadowed saint savonarolum be hang and burn in 1498 and botticellus pay a last tribute to he friend in the picture in this room call the calumny under the pretence of merely illustrate a passage in lucian who be one of he favorite author botticellus have represent the campaign against the great reformer the hall represent florence the judge -lrb- with the ear of a ass -rrb- the signorium and the pope into these ear ignorance and suspicion be whisper calumny with envy at she side and tend by fraud and deception hold a torch in one hand and with the other drag she victim who personify -lrb- but with no attempt at a likeness -rrb- savonarolum behind be the figure of remorse cloak and miserable and truth naked and unafraid the statue in the niche ironically represent abstract virtue everything in the decoration of the palace point to enlightenment and content and beyond be the calmest and greenest of sea one more picture be botticellus to paint and this also be to the glory of savonarolum by good fortune it belong to the english people and be no 1034 in the national gallery it have upon it a greek inscription in the painter 's own hand which run in english as follow : this picture i alessandro paint at the end of the year 1500 in the trouble of italy in the half-time after the time during the fulfilment of the eleventh of st john in the second woe of the apocalypse in the loosing of the devil for three year and a half afterwards he shall be confine and we shall see he trodden down as in this picture the loosing of the devil be the three year and a half after savonarolum 's execution on may 23rd 1498 when florence be mad with reaction from the severity of he discipline s john say i will give power unto my two witness and they shall prophesy the painter make three savonarola have have two comrade with he the picture be intend to give heart to the follower of savonarolum and bring promise of ultimate triumph after the death of savonarolum botticellus become both poor and infirm he have save no money and all he friend be dead -- piero de ' medici lorenzo giuliano lucrezium simonetta filippino lippus and savonarolum he hobble about on crutch for a while a pensioner of the medicus family and die at the age of seventy-eight be bury in ognissantus but without a tombstone for fear of desecration by the enemy of savonarolum 's adherent such be the outline of botticellus 's life we will now look at such of the picture in this room as have not be mention enter from the sala di leonardo the first picture on the right be the birth of venus then the very typical circular picture -- a shape which have come to be intimately associate with this painter -- no 1289 the madonna of the pomegranate one of he most beautiful work and possibly yet another design for lucrezium tornabuonus for the curl on the forehead of the boy to the left of the madonna -- who be more than usually trouble -- be very like that for which giuliano de ' medicus be famous this be a very lovely work although its color be a little depressed next be the most remarkable of the piero de ' medici picture which i have already touch upon -- no 1286 the adoration of the magus as different from the venus as could be : the venus so cool and transparent and this so hot and rich with its haughty florentine and sumptuous cloak above it be no 23 a less subtle group -- the madonna the child and angel -- difficult to see and then come the beautiful magnificat which we know to have be paint for lucrezium tornabuonus and which shall here introduce a passage from pater : for with botticellus she too although she hold in she hand the ` desire of all nation ' be one of those who be neither for jehovah nor for he enemy and she choice be on she face the white light on it be cast up hard and cheerless from below as when snow lie upon the ground and the child look up with surprise at the strange whiteness of the ceiling she trouble be in the very caress of the mysterious child whose gaze be always far from she and who have already that sweet look of devotion which man have never be able altogether to love and which still make the bear saint a object almost of suspicion to he earthly brethren once indeed he guide she hand to transcribe in a book the word of she exaltation the ` ave ' and the ` magnificat ' and the ` gaude marium ' and the young angel glad to rouse she for a moment from she devotion be eager to hold the ink-horn and to support the book but the pen almost drop from she hand and the high cold word have no meaning for she and she true child be those other among whom in she rude home the intolerable honor come to she with that look of wistful inquiry on they irregular face which you see in startled animal -- gipsy child such as those who in apennine village still hold out they long brown arm to beg of you with they thick black hair nicely comb and fair white linen on they sunburnt throat the picture 's frame be that which be make for it four hundred and fifty year ago : by whom i can not say but it be the custom at that time for the painter himself to be responsible also for the frame the glory of the end wall be the annunciation reproduce in this book the picture be a work that may perhaps not wholly please at first the cause largely of the vermilion on the floor but in the end conquer the hand be among the most beautiful in existence and the landscape with its one tree and its fairy architecture be a continual delight among annunciation as among picture it stand very high it have more of sophistication than most : the virgin not only recognize the honor but the doom which the painter himself foreshadow in the predellum where christ be see rise from the grave none of fra angelico 's simple radiance here and none of fra lippo lippus 's glorified matter-of-fact here be tragedy the painting of the virgin 's head-dress be again marvellous next the annunciation on the left be to my eye one of botticellus 's most attractive work : no 1303 just the madonna and child again in a niche with rose climb behind they : the madonna one of he youngest and more placid and simple than most with more than a hint of the verrocchio type in she face to the school of botticellus this be sometimes attribute : it may be rightly its pendant be another madonna and child no 76 more like lippo lippus and very beautiful in its darker graver way the other wall have the fortitude the calumny and the two little judith and holoferne picture upon the fortitude to which i have already allude it be well to look at ruskin who however be not aware that the artist intend any symbolic reference to the character and career of piero de ' medici the criticism be in morning in florence and it be follow by some fine page on the judith the justice prudence and charity of the pollaiuolo brother belong to the same series as the fortitude be also here but after the fortitude one do not look at they chapter xi the uffizus iv : remain room s zenobius -- piero della francesca -- federigo da montefeltro -- melozzo da forlus -- the tribuna -- raphael -- re-arrangement -- the gem -- the self-painted portrait -- a northern room -- hugo van der go -- tommaso portinarus -- the sympathetic memling -- ruben riotous -- vittorium della rovere -- baroccio -- honthorst -- giovannus the indiscreet -- the medusa -- medici miniature -- hercule segher -- the salum di niobe -- beautiful antique pass from the salum di botticelli through the sala di lorenzo monaco and the first tuscan room to the corridor we come to the second tuscan room which be dominate by andrea del sarto -lrb- 1486-1531 -rrb- whose madonna and child with s franci and s john the evangelist -- no 112 -- be certainly the favorite picture here as it be in reproduction in so many home but apart from the child i like far better the s giacomo -- no 1254 -- so sympathetic and rich in color which be reproduce in this volume another good andrea be no 93 -- a soft and misty apparition of christ to the magdalen the sodoma -lrb- 1477-1549 -rrb- on the easel -- s sebastian no 1279 -- be very beautiful in its leonardesque hue and romantic landscape and the two ridolfo ghirlandaio -lrb- 1483-1561 -rrb- near it be interesting as represent with much hard force scene in the story of s zenobius of florence of whom we read in chapter ii in one he restore life to the dead child in the midst of a florentine crowd in the other he bier pass the baptistery reanimate the dead tree giotto 's tower and the tower of the palazzo vecchio be to be see on the leave a very different picture be the cosimo rossellus no 1280 he a comely madonna and saint with a motherly thought in the treatment of the bodice among the other picture be a naked sprawling scene of body and limb by cosimo i 's favorite painter bronzino -lrb- 1502-1572 -rrb- call the savior in hell and two nice medici child from the same brush which be keep busy both on the living and ancestral lineament of that family two filippino lippi both fine if with a little too much color for this painter : one -- no 1257 -- approach the hotness of a ghirlandaio carpet piece but a great feat of crowded activity the other no 1268 have a beautiful blue madonna and a pretty little cherub with a red book piero di cosimo be here religious and not mythological and here be a very straightforward and satisfying mariotto albertinellus -- the virgin and s elizabeth very like a fra bartolommeo a very rich and beautiful deposition by botticinus one of verrocchio 's pupil with a gay little predellum underneath it and a pretty holy family by franciabigio but andrea remain the king of the wall from this sala a little room be gain which i advise all tired visitor to the uffizus to make they harbor of refuge and recuperation for it have only three or four picture in it and three or four piece of sculpture and some pleasant map and tapestry on the wall and from its window you look across the brown-red tile to s miniato the picture although so few be peculiarly attractive be the work of two very rare hand piero della francesca -lrb- 1398-1492 -rrb- and melozzo da forlus -lrb- 1438-1494 -rrb- melozzo have here a very charming annunciation in two panel the fascination of which i can not describe that they be fascinating there be however no doubt we have symbolical figure by he in we national gallery -- again hang next to piero della francesca -- but they be not the equal of these in charm although very charming these grow more attractive with every visit : the eager advance angel with he lily and the timid little virgin in she green dress with fold hand the two piero be of course superb piero never paint anything that be not distinguish and liquid and here he give we of he best : portrait of federigo da montefeltro duke of urbino and battista he second duchess with classical scene behind they piero della francesca have ever be one of my favorite painter and here he be wholly a joy of he work florence have but few since he be not a florentine nor do he work here be engage chiefly at urbino ferrara arezzo and rome he life end sadly for he become totally blind in addition to he painting he be a mathematician of much repute the duke of urbino here depict be federigo da montefeltro who rule from 1444 to 1482 and in 1459 marry as he second wife a daughter of alessandro sforza of pesaro the wedding be the occasion of piero 's picture the duke stand out among the many italian lord of that time as a humane and beneficent ruler and collector and eager to administer well he be a bear fighter and it be owe to the loss of he right eye and the fracture of he noble old nose that he be see here in such a determine profile against the lovely light over the umbrian hill the symbolical chariot in the landscape at the back represent respectively the triumph of fame -lrb- the duke 's -rrb- and the triumph of chastity -lrb- that of the duchess -rrb- the duke 's companion be victory prudence fortitude justice and temperance the little duchess 's be love hope faith charity and innocence and if these be not exquisite picture i never see any the statue in the room should not be miss particularly the little genius of love the bacchus and ampelo and the spoilt little comely boy suppose to represent -- and quite conceivably -- the infant nero cross the large tuscan room again we come to a little narrow room fill with what be now call cabinet picture : far too many to study properly but comprise a benignant old man 's head no 1167 which be sometimes call a filippino lippus and sometimes a masaccio a fragment of a fresco a boy from the serene perfect hand of perugino no 1217 two little panel by fra bartolommeo -- no 1161 -- paint for a tabernacle to hold a donatello relief and represent the circumcision and nativity in color and at the back a pretty annunciation in monochrome no 1235 on the opposite wall a very sweet mother and child by the same artist a perseus liberating andromeda by piero di cosimo no 1312 two or three lorenzo di credis two or three allori a portrait of galeazzo marium sforza by antonio pollaiuolo and three charming little scene from the life of s john the baptist and the virgin by fra angelico which belong properly to the predellum of a altar-piece that we see in the first room we enter -- no 1290 the coronation of the virgin no 1162 have the gayest green dress in it imaginable and here we enter the tribuna which be to the uffizus what the salon carré be to the louvre : the special treasure-room of the gallery hold its most valuable picture but to-day there be as good work outside it as in for the michelangelo have be move to another room and botticellus -lrb- to name no other -rrb- be not represent here at all probably the statue famous as the venus de ' medicus would be consider the tribuna 's chief possession but not by I nor should i vote either for titian 's venus in sculpture i should choose rather the knife-sharpener and among the picture raphael 's madonna del cardellino no 1129 but this be not to suggest that everything be not a masterpiece for it be begin at the door lead from the room of the little picture we find on we left raphael 's ignota no 1120 so rich and unfeeling and then francium 's portrait of evangelista scappus so rich and real and a picture that one never forget raphael 's julius ii come next not so powerful as the version in the pittus and above that titian 's famous venus in perugino 's portrait of francesco delle opere no 287 we find a evening sky and landscape still more lovely than francium 's this francesco be brother of giovannus delle corniole a protégé of lorenzo de ' medici famous as a carver of intaglio whose portrait of savonarolum in this medium now preserve in the uffizus in the gem room be say by michelangelo to carry art to its farthest possible point a placid and typical perugino -- the virgin and two saint -- come next and then a northern air sweep in with van dyck 's giovannus di montfort now darken into gloom but very fine and commanding titian 's second venus be above for which he daughter lavinium act as model -lrb- the venus of the other version be possibly the marchesa della rovere -rrb- and under it be the only luinus in the uffizus unmistakably from the sweet hand and full of leonardesque influence beneath this be a rich and decorative work of the veronese school a portrait of elisabetta gonzaga with another evening sky then we go north again to dürer 's adoration of the magi a picture full of pleasant detail -- a little mountain town here a knight in difficulty with he horse there two butterfly close to the madonna -- and interesting also for the treatment of the main theme in dürer 's masterly careful way and then to spain to spagnoletto 's s jerome in sombre chiaroscuro then north again to a painfully real christ crown with thorn by luca van leyden and the mousy reynoldsy first wife of peter paul ruben while a van dyck portrait under a superb domenichino and a adam and eve by luca cranach complete the northern group and so we come to the two correggio -- so accomplished and rich and untouching -- all delightful virtuosity without feel the favorite be of course no 1134 for its adorable baby whose natural charm atone for its theatrical mother on the other side of the door be no 1129 the perfect madonna del cardellino of raphael so call from the goldfinch that the little boy be caress this one be force to consider one of the perfect picture of the world even though other may communicate more pleasure the landscape be so exquisite and the mild sweetness of the whole work so complete and yet although the technical mastery be almost thrill the madonna del pozzo by andrea del sarto 's friend franciabigio close by -- no 1125 -- arouse infinitely livelier feeling in the observer so much movement and happiness have it raphael be perfect but cold franciabigio be less perfect -lrb- although exceedingly accomplish -rrb- but warm with life the charm of this picture be as notable as the skill of raphael 's : it be wholly joyous and the little madonna really once live both be reproduce in this volume raphael 's neighbouring youthful john the baptist be almost a giorgione for richness but be as truly raphael as the sebastian del piombo once -lrb- like the franciabigio also -rrb- call a raphael be not how it come to be consider raphael except that there may be a faint likeness to the fornarina be a mystery the room next the tribuna have for some time be under reconstruction and of these i say little nor of what picture be to be place there but with the tribuna in any case the collection suddenly decline begin to crumble the first of these room in the spring of this year 1912 be open with a number of small italian painting but they be probably only temporarily there chief among they be a parmigianino a boltraffio a pretty little guido renus a cosimo tura a lorenzo costa but nothing really important in the tiny gem room at the end of the corridor be wonder of the lapidary 's art -- and here be the famous intaglio portrait of savonarolum -- but they want better treatment the vase and other ornament should have the light all round they as in the galerie d'apollon at the louvre these be pack together in wall case and be hard to see pass through the end corridor where the beautiful matrona recline so placidly on she couch against the light and where we have such pleasant view of the ponte vecchio the trinita bridge the arno and the apennine so fresh and real and soothing after so much paint we come to the room contain the famous collection of self-painted portrait which move hither from rome have be accumulate in the uffizus for many year and be still grow to be invite to contribute to it be one of the highest honor a painter can receive the portrait occupy eight room and a passage though the collection be historically and biographically valuable it contain for every interesting portrait three or four dull one and thus become something of a weariness among the best be luca cranach anton more van dyck rembrandt -lrb- three -rrb- ruben seybold jordaen reynold and romney all of which remind we of michelangelo 's dry comment every painter draw himself well among the most interesting to we wander in florence be the two andrea one youthful and the other grown fatter than one likes and very different from the melancholy romantic figure in the pittus verrocchio by lorenzo di credi carlo dolci surprising by its good sense and humor raphael angelic wistful and weak tintoretto old and powerful and jacopo bassano old and simple among the modern corot 's portrait of himself be one of the most memorable but fantin lator flandrin leon bonnat and lenbach be all strong and modest which one can not say of we own leighton among the later english head orchardson 's be notable but mr sargent 's be disappointing we now come to one of the most remarkable room in the gallery where every picture be a gem but since all be northern picture import i give no reproduction this be the sala di van der go so call from the great work here the triptych paint in 1474 to 1477 by hugo van der go who die in 1482 and be bear at ghent or leyden about 1405 this painter of whose genius there can be no question be suppose to have be a pupil of the van eyck not much be know of he save that he paint at bruge and ghent and in 1476 enter a convent at brussels where he be allow to dine with distinguished stranger who come to see he and where he drink so much wine that he natural excitability turn to insanity he seem however to have recover and if ever a picture show few sign of a deranged or inflamed mind it be this which be paint for the agent of the medicus bank at bruge tommaso portinarus who present it to the hospital of s marium nuova in he native city of florence which have be found by he ancestor folco the father of dante 's beatrice the left panel show tommaso pray with he two son antonio and pigallo the right he wife marium portinarus and they adorably quaint little daughter with she charming head-dress and costume the flower in the center panel be among the most beautiful thing in any florentine picture : not wild and wayward like luca signorellus 's but most exquisitely do : iris red lily columbine and dark red clove pink -- all unexpected and all very unlikely to be in such a wintry landscape at all on the ground be violet the whole work be grave austere cool and as different as can be from the tuscan spirit yet it be say to have have a deep influence on the painter of the time and must have draw throng to the hospital to see it the other flemish and german picture in the room be all remarkable and all warmer in tone no 906 a unknown work be perhaps the finest : a crucifixion which might have borrow its richness from the carpaccio we see in the venetian room there be a fine adoration of the magus by gerard david -lrb- 1460-1523 -rrb- a unknown portrait of pierantonio baroncellus and he wife with a lovely landscape a jewel of paint by han memle -lrb- 1425-1492 -rrb- -- no 703 -- the madonna enthrone a masterpiece of draw by dürer calvary a austere and poignant transportation of christ to the sepulchre by roger van der weyden -lrb- 1400-1464 -rrb- and several very beautiful portrait by memle notably no 769 and 780 with they lovely evening light memle indeed i never like better than here other fine picture be a spanish prince by luca van leyden a old dutch scholar by a artist unknown no 784 and a young husband and wife by joost van cleef the elder and a breughel the elder like a old crome -- a beauty -- no 928 the room be interesting both for itself and also as show how the flemish brush be work at the time that so many of the great italian be engage on similar theme after the cool self-contained scientific work of these northerner it be a change to enter the salum di rubens and find that luxuriant giant -- they compatriot but how different -- once more in the uffizus ruben seem more foreign far than any one so fleshly pagan be he in antwerp cathedral he descent from the cross although its bravura be as always with he more noticeable than its piety might be call a religious picture but i doubt if even that would seem so here at any rate he uffizus work be all secular while he holy family in the pittus be merely domestic and robust he florentine masterpiece be the two henrus iv picture in this room henrus iv at ivry magnificent if not war and henrus 's entry into pari after ivry with its confusing muddle of naked warrior and spear only ruben could have paint these spirited impossible glorious thing which for all they greatness send one 's thought back longingly to the portrait of he wife in the tribuna while no 216 -- the bacchanale -- be so coarse as almost to send one 's foot there too look round the room after ruben have be dismiss it be too evident that the best of the uffizus collection be behind we there be interesting portrait here but biographically rather than artistically here be one or two fine susterman ' -lrb- 1597-1681 -rrb- that import painter whom we shall find in such rare form at the pittus here for example be ferdinand ii who do so much for the uffizus and so little for galileo and he cousin and wife vittorium della rovere daughter of claudia de ' medicus -lrb- whose portrait no 763 be on the easel -rrb- and federigo dellum rovere duke of urbino this silly plump lady have be marry at the age of fourteen and she bring she husband a little money and many picture from urbino notably those delightful portrait of a earlier duke and duchess of urbino by piero della francesca and also the two titian venus in the tribuna ferdinand ii and he grand duchess be on bad term for most of they life and she behave foolishly and bring up she son cosimo iii foolishly and altogether be a misfortune to florence susterman the painter she hold in the highest esteem and in return he paint she not only as herself but in various unlikely character among they a vestal virgin and even the madonna here also be no 196 van dyck 's portrait of margherita of lorraine whose daughter become cosimo iii 's wife -- a mischievous weak face but magnificently paint and no 1536 a vividly-painted elderly widow by jordaen -lrb- 1593-1678 -rrb- and on each side of the outrageous ruben a distinguished dutch gentleman and lady by the placid refined mierevelt the two priceless room devote to iscrizionus come next but we will finish the picture first and therefore pass on to the salum di baroccio federigo baroccio -lrb- 1528-1612 -rrb- be one of the later painter for whom i at any rate can not feel any enthusiasm he position in the uffizus be due rather to the circumstance that he be a protégé of the cardinal dellum rovere at rome whose collection come here than to he genius this room again be of interest rather historically than artistically here for example be some good medicus portrait by bronzino among they the famous eleanora of toledo wife of cosimo i in a rich brocade -lrb- in which she be bury -rrb- with the little stare ferdinand i beside she eleanora as we see in chapter v be the first mistress of the pittus palace and the lady who so dislike cellinus and get he into such trouble through he lie tongue bronzino 's little maria de ' medici -- no 1164 -- be more please for the other picture have a sinister air this child the first-born of cosimo i and eleanora die when only sixteen baroccio have a fine portrait -- francesco maria ii last duke of urbino and the grandfather of the vittorium della rovere whom we see in the sala di ruben here also be a portrait of lorenzo the magnificent by vasarus but it be of small value since vasarus be not bear till after lorenzo 's death the galileo by susterman -- no 163 -- on the contrary would be from life and after the tribuna portrait of ruben ' first wife it be interesting to find here he pleasant portrait of helen fourment he second to my eye two of the most attractive picture in the room be the young sculptor -- no 1266 -- by bronzino and the version of leonardo 's s anne at the louvre by andrea salaino of milan -lrb- 1483-1520 -rrb- i like also the hint of tenderness of bernardino luinus which break through the hardness of the aurelio luinus picture -- no 204 for the rest there be some sickly guido reni and carlo dolci and a sentimental guercino but the most popular work -- on sunday -- be the two gerard honthorst and not without reason for they be dramatic and bold and vivid and there be a baby in each that go straight to the maternal heart no 157 be perhaps the more satisfying but i have more reason to remember the larger one -- the adoration of the shepherd -- for i watch a copyist produce a most remarkable replica of it in something under a week on the same scale he be a short swarthy man with a neck like a bull 's and he carry the task off with astonishing brio never draw a line finish each part as he come to it and talk to a friend or a official the whole time somehow one feel he to be precisely the type of copyist that gherardo della notte ought to have this painter be bear at utrecht in 1590 but go early to italy and settle in rome devoted himself to master the method of amerighus better know as caravaggio -lrb- 1569-1609 -rrb- who specialize in strong contrast of light and shade after learn all he could in rome honthorst return to holland and make much money and fame for he hand be swift and sure charle i engage he to decorate whitehall he die in 1656 these two honthorst be as i say the most popular of the picture on Sunday when the uffizus be free but they supremacy be challenge by the five inlaid table one of which chiefly in lapi lazulus must be the bluest thing on earth pass for the present the salum di niobe we come to the salum di giovanni di san giovannus which be give to a second-rate painter who be bear in 1599 and die in 1636 he best work be a fresco at the badium of fiesole here he have some theatrical thing include one picture which send english lady out blush here also be some lely include nelly gwynn next be two room one lead from the other give to german and flemish picture and to miniature both of which be interesting in the first be more dürers and that alone would make it a desirable resort here be a virgin and child -- no 851 -- very naive and homely and the beautiful portrait of he father -- no 766 -- a symphony of brown and green less attractive work from the same hand be the apostle philip -- no 777 -- and s giacomo maggiore a old man very coarsely paint by comparison with the artist 's father here also be a very beautiful portrait of richard southwell by holbein with the peacock-green background that we know so well and always rejoice to see a typical candle-light schalcken no 800 several golden poelenburgh a anonymous portrait of virgilius von hytta of zuicham no 784 a clever smile lady by susterman no 709 the signora pulicianus and she husband no 699 a rather crudely color ruben -- venus and adoni -- no 812 the same artist 's three grace in monochrome very naked and some quaint portrait by luca cranach but no doubt to many person the most enchaining picture here be the medusa 's head which use to be call a leonardo and quite satisfied ruskin of its genuineness but be now attribute to the flemish school the head at any rate would seem to be very similar to that of which vasarus speak paint by leonardo for a peasant but retain by he father time have deal hardly with the paint and one have to study minutely before medusa 's horror be visible whether leonardo 's or not it be not uninteresting to read how the picture affect shelley when he see it here in 1819 : -- its horror and its beauty be divine upon its lip and eyelid seem to lie loveliness like a shadow from which shine fiery and lurid struggle underneath the agony of anguish and of death the little room lead from this one should be neglect by no one interested in medicean history for most of the family be here in miniature by bronzino 's hand here also be miniature by other great painter such as pourbus guido renus bassano clouet holbein look particularly at no 3382 a woman with brown hair in purple -- a most fascinating little picture the ignota in no 3348 might easily be henrietta marium wife of charle i of england the other exhibit be copy in miniature of famous picture notable among they a raphael -- no 3386 -- and a breughel -- no 3445 -- while no 3341 the robing of a monk be worth attention we come now to the last picture of the collection -- in three little room at the end near the bronze sleep cupid those in the first room be be rearrange when i be last here the other contain dutch work notable for a few masterpiece there be too many poelenburgh but the taste show as a whole be good perhaps to the english enthusiast for paint the fine landscape by hercule segher will in view of the recent agitation over lord lansdowne 's rembrandt the mill -- ascribe in some quarter to segher -- be the most interesting picture of all it be a sombre powerful scene of rugged coast which any artist would have be proud to sign but it in no way recall the mill 's serene strength among the best of its companion be a very good terburg a very good metsu and a extremely beautiful ruysdael and so we be at the end of the picture -- but only to return again and again -- and be not unwilling to fall into the trap of the official who sit here and allow he to unlock the door behind the laocöon group and enjoy what he recommend as a bellum vista from the open space which turn out to be the roof of the loggia de ' lanzus from this high point one may see much of florence and its mountain while on look down over the cope one find the busy piazza dellum signorium below with all its cab and wayfarer return to the gallery we come quickly on the right to the first of the neglect statuary room the beautiful salum di niobe which contain some interesting medicean and other tapestry and the sixteen statue of niobe and she child from the temple of apollo which the cardinal ferdinand de ' medici acquire and which be for many year at the villa medicus at rome a suggest reconstruction of the group will be find by the door i can not pretend to a deep interest in the figure but i like to be in the room the famous medicean vase be in the middle of it sculpture more ingratiating be close by in the two room give to iscrizionus : a collection of priceless antique which be not only beautiful but peculiarly interesting in that they can be compare with the work of donatello verrocchio and other of the renaissance sculptor for in such a case comparison be anything but odious and become fascinating in the first room there be for example a mercury isolate on the leave in marble who be a blood relation of donatello 's bronze david in the bargello and certain relief of merry child on the right low down as one approach the second room be cousin of the same sculptor 's cantorium romp not that donatello ever reproduce the antique spirit as michelangelo nearly do in he bacchus and sansovino absolutely do in he bacchus both at the bargello : donatello be of he time and the spirit of he time animate he creation but he have study the greek art in rome and profit by he lesson and he evenly-balanced humane mind have a warm corner for pagan joyfulness among other statue in this first room be a sacerdotessa wear a marble robe with long fold whose hand can be see through the drapery opposite the door be bacchus and ampelo superbly pagan while a sleep cupid be most lovely among the various fine head be one of cicero of a unknown -- no 377 -- and of homer in bronze -lrb- call by the photographer aristophane -rrb- but each thing in turn be almost the best the trouble be that the uffizus be so vast and the renaissance seem to be so eminently the only proper study of mankind when one be here that to attune oneself to the enjoyment of antique sculpture need a special effort which not all be ready to make in the center of the next room be the punctual hermaphrodite without which no large continental gallery be complete but more worthy of attention be the torso of a faun on the leave on a revolving pedestal which -lrb- unlike those in the bargello as we shall discover -rrb- really do revolve and enable you to admire the perfect back there be also a torso in basalt or porphyry which one should study from all point and on the wall some wonderful portion of a frieze from the ara paci erect in rome bc 139 with wonderful figure of man woman and child on it among the head be a colossal alexander very fine indeed a beautiful antoninus a benign and silly roman lady in whose existence one can quite believe and a melancholy seneca look also at no 330 and 332 on the wall : 330 a charming genius carry one of jove 's thunderbolt and 332 a boy who be sheer luca dellum robbium century before he birth i ought to add that in addition to the various salon in the uffizus the long corridor be hang with picture too in chronological order the earliest of all be to the right of the entrance door and in the corridor there be also some admirable statuary but the picture here although not the equal of those in the room receive far too little attention while the sculpture receive even less whether the beutiful full-length athlete or the relief on the cistern several of which have riotous dionysian procession on the stair too be some very beautiful work while at the top in the turnstile room be the original of the boar which tacca copy in bronze for the mercato nuovo and just outside it be the medicus who be chiefly concern with the formation of the collection on the first landing nearest the ground be a very beautiful and youthful bacchus the ceiling of the uffizus room and corridor also be paint thoughtfully and dexterously in the pompeian manner but there be limit to the receptive capacity of traveller ' eye and i must plead guilty to consistently neglect they chapter xii aërial fiesole andrea del sarto -- fiesole sight -- the villa palmierus and the decameron -- botticinus 's picture in the national gallery -- s francesco -- the roman amphitheatre -- the etruscan museum -- a sculptor 's walk -- the badium di fiesole -- brunelleschus again -- giovannus di san giovannus after all these picture how about a little climbing from so many window in florence along so many street from so many loggia and tower and perhaps above all from the piazzale di michelangelo fiesole be to be see on she hill with the beautiful campanile of she church in the dip between the two eminence that very soon one come to feel that this surely be the promised land florence lie so low and the delectable mountain be so near and so alluring but i be not sure that to dream of fiesole as desirable and to murmur its beautiful syllable be not best let I sit here by the window with you hand in mine and look a half-hour forth on fiesole -- that be andrea 's way and not a unwise one for fiesole at nearer view can easily disappoint it be beautifully set on its hill and it have a fascinating past but the journey thither on foot be very wearisome by the electric tram vexatious and noisy and in a horse-drawn carriage expensive and cruel and when you be there you become once more a tourist without alleviation and be pester by beggar and by nice little girl who ought to know better whose peculiar importunacy it be to thrust flower into the hand or buttonhole without any denial what should have be a mountain retreat from the city have become a kind of devil 's dyke but if one be resolute and defy all walk up to the little monastery of s francesco at the very top of the hill one may rest almost undisturbed with florence in the valley below and garden and vineyard undulate beneath and a monk or two ascend or descend the step and three or four picture-postcard hawker gamble in a corner and lizard on the wall here it be good to be in the late afternoon when the light be mellow and if you want tea there be a little loggia a few yard down this narrow steep path where it may be find how many beautiful villa in which one could be happy sunning oneself among the lizard lie between this point and florence who sit here can fail to think that in walk to fiesole one follow the high wall of the villa palmierus which be now very private american property but be famous for ever as the first refuge of boccaccio 's seven young woman and three young man when they flee from plague-stricken florence in 1348 and tell tale for ten halcyon day it be now generally agree that if boccaccio have any particular house in he mind it be this it use to be think that the villa poggio gherardo mrs ross 's beautiful home on the way to settignano be the first refuge and the villa palmierus the second but the latest research have it that the palmierus be the first and the podere dellum fonte or villa di boccaccio as it be call near camera a little village below s domenico the other the villa palmierus have another and somewhat different historical association for it be there that queen victorium reside for a while in 1888 but the most interesting thing of all about it be the circumstance that it be the home of matteo palmieri the poet and botticellus 's friend and fellow-speculator on the riddle of life palmierus be the author of a remarkable poem call la citta della vita -lrb- the city of life -rrb- which develop a scheme of theology that have many attraction to botticellus 's curious mind the poem be ban by rome although not until after its author 's death in we national gallery be a picture which use to be consider botticellus 's -- no 1126 the assumption of the virgin -- especially as it be mention with some particularity by vasarus together with the circumstance that the poet and painter devise it in collaboration in which the poem be translate into pigment as to the theology i say nothing nor as to its new ascription to botticinus but the picture have a greater interest for we in that it contain a view of florence with its wall of tower around it in about 1475 the exact spot where the painter sit have be identify by miss stoke in six month in the apennine on the left immediately below the painter 's vantage-ground be the mugnone with a bridge over it on the bank in front be the villa palmierus and on the picture 's extreme left be the badium of fiesole on leave s domenico if still bent on walk one should keep straight on and not follow the tram line to the right this be the old and terribly steep road which lorenzo the magnificent and he friend politian and pico dellum mirandolum have to travel whenever they visit the medicus villa just under fiesole with its drive line with cypress here must have be great talk and much conviviality it be now call the villa mccalmont once at fiesole by whatever mean you reach it do not neglect to climb the monastery step to the very top it be a day of climb and a hundred or more step either way mean nothing now for here be a gentle little church with swift silent monk in it and a few flower in bowl and a religious picture by that strange piero di cosimo whose heart be with the god in exile and the view of monte ceceri on the other side of fiesole see through the cypress here which could not be better in disposition have benozzo gozzolus himself arrange they be very striking and memorable fiesole 's darling son be mino the sculptor -- the raphael of the chisel -- whose radiant madonna and child and delicate tomb may be see here and there all over florence the piazza be name after he he be celebrate on a marble slab outside the museum where all the famous name of the vicinity may be read too and in the church be one of he most charming group and finest head they be in a little chapel on the right of the choir the head be that of bishop salutatus humorous wise and benign and the group represent the adoration of a merry little christ by a merry little s john and other as for the church itself it be severe and cool with such stone column in it as must last for ever but the main interest of fiesole to most people be not the cypress-covered hill of s francesco not the view from the summit not the straw memento not the mino relief in the church but the roman arena the excavator have make of this a very complete place one can stand at the top of the step and reconstruct it all -- the audience the performance the performer a very little time spend on building would be need to restore the amphitheatre to its original form beyond it be bath and in a hollow the remains of a temple with the altar where it ever be and then one walk a little farther and be on the ancient etruscan wall build when fiesole be a etruscan fortified hill city so do the century fall away here but everywhere among the ancient roman stone so massive and exact and the etruscan stone be the wild flower which luca signorellus paint in that picture in the uffizus which i love so much after the amphitheatre one visit the museum -- with the same ticket -- a little building fill with trophy of the spade there be nothing very wonderful -- nothing to compare with the treasure of the archaeological museum in florence -- but it be well worth a visit on leave the museum on the last occasion that i be there -- in April -- i walk to settignano the road for a while be between house for fiesole stretch a long way farther than one suspect very high look over the valley of the mugnone and then after a period between pine tree and grape-hyacinth one turn to the right and begin to descend until poggio del castello a noble villa on a isolate eminence the descent be very gradual with view of florence round the shoulder of monte ceceri but afterwards the road wind to ease the fall and the wayfarer turn off into the wood and tumble down the hill by a dry water-course amid crag and stone to the beginning of civilization again at the via di desiderio da settignano a sculptor who stand to he native town in precisely the same relation as mino to he settignano be a mere village with villa all about it and the thing to remember there be not only that desiderio be bear there but that michelangelo 's foster-mother be the wife of a local stone-cutter -- stone-cutting at that time be the staple industry on the way back to florence in the tram one pass on the right a gateway surmount by statue of the poet the villa poggio gherardo of which i have speak earlier in the chapter there be no villa with a nobler mien than this that be one walk from fiesole another be even more a sculptor ' way : for it would include maiano too where benedetto be bear the road be by way of the tram line to that acute angle just below fiesole when they turn back to s domenico and so straight on down the hill but if one be return to florence direct after leave fiesole it be well to walk down the precipitous path to s domenico and before again take the tram visit the badium overlook the valley of the mugnone this be do by turn to the right just opposite the church of s domenico which have little interest structurally but be famous as be the chapel of the monastery where fra angelico be once a monk the badium -lrb- abbey -rrb- di fiesole as it now be be build on the site of a older monastery by cosimo pater here marsilio ficino 's platonic academy use to meet in the loggia and in the little temple which one gain from the cloister and here pico della mirandola compose he curious gloss on genesis the dilapidated marble façade of the church and its rugged stone-work be exceedingly ancient -- date in fact from the eleventh century the new building be by brunelleschus and to my mind be one of he most beautiful work its lovely proportion and cool unfretted white space communicate even more pleasure than the pazzus chapel itself the decoration have be keep simple and severe and the color be just the gray pietra serena of fiesole of which the lovely arch be make all most exquisitely chisel and the pure white of the wall and ceiling this church be a favorite with the medicus and the youthful giovannus the son of lorenzo the magnificent receive he cardinal 's hat here in 1492 at the age of sixteen he afterwards become pope leo x how many of the boy now in the school -- for the monastery have become a jesuit school -- will one wonder rise to similar eminence in the beautiful cloister we have the same color scheme as in the church and here again brunelleschus 's miraculous genius for proportion be to be find here and there be foliation and other exquisite tracery by pupil of desiderio da settignano the refectory have a high-spirited fresco by that artist whose room in the uffizus be so carefully avoid by discreet chaperon -- giovannus di san giovannus -- represent christ eating at a table he ministrant be a crowd of little roguish angel and cherubim one of whom -lrb- on the right -rrb- be in despair at have break a plate in the entrance lobby be a lavabo by mino da fiesole with two little boy of the whitest and softest marble on it which be worth study and now we will return to the heart of florence once more chapter xiii the badium and dante filippino lippus -- buffalmacco -- mino da fiesole -- the dante quarter -- dante and beatrice -- monna tessa -- gemma donatus -- dante in exile -- dante memorial in florence -- the torre della castagna -- the borgo deglus albizzus and the old palace -- s ambrogio -- mino 's tabernacle -- wayside masterpiece -- s egidio opposite the bargello be a church with a very beautiful doorway design by benedetto da rovezzano this church be know as the badium and its delicate spire be a joy in the landscape from every point of vantage the badium be very ancient but the restorer have be busy and little of arnolfo 's thirteenth-century work be leave it be chiefly famous now for its filippino lippus and two tomb by mino da fiesole but historically it be interesting as be the burial-place of the chief florentine family in the middle age and as be the scene of boccaccio 's lecture on dante in 1373 the filippino altar-piece which represent s bernard 's vision of the virgin -lrb- a subject we shall see treated very beautifully by fra bartolommeo at the accademia -rrb- be one of the most perfect and charming picture by this artist : very grave and real and sweet and the saint 's hand exquisitely paint the figure pray in the right-hand corner be the patron piero di francesco del pugliese who commission this picture for the church of la campora outside the porta romana where it be honor until 1529 when clement vii 's troops advance it be bring here for safety and have here remain close by -- in the same chapel -- be a little door which the sacristan will open disclose a portion of arnolfo 's building with perish fresco which be attribute to buffalmacco a artist as to whose reality much scepticism prevail they be not in themselves of much interest although the sacristan 's eagerness should not be discourage but buffalmacco be boccaccio 's sacchettus 's vasarus 's -lrb- and later anatole france 's -rrb- amusing hero it be pleasant to look at he work and think of he freakishness buffalmacco -lrb- if he ever exist -rrb- be one of the earlier painter flourish between 1311 and 1350 and be a pupil of andrea tafus this simple man he plague very divertingly once frightening he clean out of he house by fix little light candle to the back of beetle and steer they into tafus 's bedroom at night tafus be terrify but on be tell by buffalmacco -lrb- who be a lazy rascal -rrb- that these devil be merely show they objection to early rising he become calm again and agree to lie in bed to a reasonable hour cupidity however conquer he again order he pupil to be up betime when the beetle again re-appear and continue to do so until the order be revoke the sculptor mino da fiesole whom we shall shortly see again at the bargello in portrait bust and madonna relief be at he best here in the superb monument to count ugo who found with he mother the benedictine abbey of which the badium be the relic here all mino 's sweet thought gaiety and charm be apparent together with the perfection of radiant workmanship the quiet dignity of the recumbent figure be no less masterly than the group above it note the impulsive urgency of the splendid charity with she two baby and the quiet beauty of the madonna and child above all while the proportion and delicate pattern of the tomb as a whole still remain to excite one 's pleasure and admiration we shall see many tomb in florence -- few not beautiful -- but none more joyously accomplish than this the tomb of carlo marsuppini in s croce by desiderio da settignano which await we be undoubtedly the parent of the ugo mino follow he master very closely but he charm be he own accord to vasari the ugo tomb be consider to be mino 's finest achievement and he deliberately make the madonna and child as like the type of he beloved desiderio as he could it be finish in 1481 and mino die in 1484 from a chill follow over-exertion in move heavy stone mino also have here a monument to bernardo giugnus a famous gonfalonier in the time of cosimo de ' medici mark by the same distinction but not quite so memorable the ugo be he masterpiece the carve wooden ceiling which be a very wonderful piece of work and of the deepest and most glorious hue should not be forget but nothing be easier than to overlook ceiling the cloister be small but they atone for that -- if it be a fault -- by have a loggia from the loggia the top of the noble tower of the palazzo vecchio be see to perfection upon the upper wall be a series of fresco illustrate the life of s benedict which must have be very gay and spirited once but be now fade the badium may be say to be the heart of the dante quarter dante must often have be in the church before it be restore as we now see it and a quotation from the divine comedy be on its façade the via dante and the piazza donatus be close by and in the via dante be many reminder of the poet besides he alleged birthplace elsewhere in the city we find incised quotation from he poem but the baptistery -- he beautiful san giovannus -- be the only building in the city proper now remain which dante would feel at home in could he return to it and where we can feel assure of share he presence the same pavement be there on which he foot once stand and on the same mosaic of christ above the altar would he eye have fall when dante be exile in 1302 the cathedral have be in progress only for six or eight year but it be know that he take the deepest interest in its construction and we have see the stone mark the place where he sit watch the builder the façade of the badium of fiesole and the church of s miniato can also remember dante no other here however we be on that ground which be richest in personal association with he and he for in spite of re-building and certain modern change the air be heavy with antiquity in these narrow street and passage where the poet have he childhood and youth the son of a lawyer name alighierus dante be bear in 1265 but whether or not in this casa dante be a open question and it be in the baptistery that he receive the name of durante afterwards abbreviate to dante -- durante meaning endure and dante give those who have read the vita nuova either in the original or in rossettus 's translation may be surprise to learn that the boy be only nine when he first meet he beatrice who be seven and for ever pass into bondage to she who beatrice be be again a mystery but it have be agree to consider she in real life a daughter of folco portinarus a wealthy florentine and the founder of the hospital of s marium nuova one of whose descendant commission hugo van der go to paint the great triptych in the uffizus folco 's tomb be in s egidio the hospital church while in the passage to the cloister be a stone figure of monna tessa -lrb- of whom we be about to see a color bust in the bargello -rrb- who be not only beatrice 's nurse -lrb- if beatrice be truly of the portinarus -rrb- but the instigator it be say of folco 's deed of charity of dante 's rapt adoration of he lady the vita nuova tell accord to that strangest monument of devotion it be not until another nine year have pass that he have speech of she and then beatrice meeting he in the street salute he as she pass he with such ineffable courtesy and grace that he be lift into a seventh heaven of devotion and set upon the writing of he book the two seem to have have no closer intercourse : beatrice shone distantly like a star and she lover worship she with increase loyalty and fervor overlay the idea of she as one might say with gold and radiance very much as we shall see fra angelico add glory to the madonna and saint in he picture and with a similar intensity of ecstasy then one day beatrice marry and not long afterwards be always very fragile she die at the age of twenty-three the fact that she be no longer on earth hardly affect she poet whose worship of she have always so little of a physical character and she continue to dominate he thought in 1293 however dante married one gemma donatus of the powerful guelph family of that name of which corso donatus be the turbulent head and by she he have many child for gemma however he seem to have have no affection and when in 1301 he leave florence never to return he leave he wife for ever too in 1289 dante have be present at the battle of campaldino fighting with the guelph against the ghibelline and on settle down in florence and take to politics it be as a guelph or rather as one of that branch of the guelph party which have become white -- the bianchus -- as oppose to the other party which be black -- the nerus the feud between these division take the place of those between the guelph and ghibelline since florence be never happy without internal strife and it can not have add to dante 's home comfort that he wife be relate to corso donatus who lead the nerus and swagger in he bully way about the city with proprietary intolerant air that must have be infuriate to a man with dante 's stern sense of right and justice it be corso who bring about dante 's exile but he himself survive only six year and be then kill by he own wish on he way to execution rather than be humiliate in the city in which he have sway dante whose genius devise a more lasting form of reprisal than any personal encounter could be have depict he in the purgatorio as on the road to hell but this be go too fast in 1300 when dante be thirty-five he be sufficiently important to be make one of the six prior of the city and in that capacity be call upon to quell a nerus and bianchus disturbance it be characteristic of he that he be a party to the banishment of the leader of both faction among whom be he closest friend guido cavalcantus the poet who be one of the bianchus whether it be because of guide 's illness in he exile or from what motive we shall not know but the sentence be lighten in the case of this bianco a circumstance which do not add to dante 's chance when the nerus have plot successfully with charle of valoi capture supreme power in florence this be in the year 1301 dante be absent from that city on a embassy to rome to obtain help for the bianchus he never come back for the nerus plan succeed the nerus assume control and in January 1302 he be formally fine and banish the nominal charge against he be of misappropriate fund while a prior but that be merely a matter of form he real offence be in be one of the bianchus a enemy of the nerus and a man of part in the rest of dante 's life florence have no part except in he thought how he view she the divine comedy tell we and that he long to return we also know the chance be indeed once offer but under the impossible condition that he should do public penance in the baptistery for he offence this he refuse he wander here and there and settle finally in ravenna where he die in 1321 the divine comedy anticipate printing by so many year -- the invention do not reach florence until 1471 -- dante could not make much popular way as a poet before that time but to he genius certain florentine be earlier no stranger not only by peruse m copy of he great work which by its richness in florentine allusion excite a interest apart altogether from that create by its beauty but by public lecture on the poem deliver in the church by order of the signorium the first dante professor to be appoint be giovanni boccaccio the author of the decameron who be bear in 1313 eight year before dante 's death and become a enthusiast upon the poet the picture in the duomo be place there in 1465 then come printing to florence and dante pass quickly into he countryman 's thought and language michelangelo who be bear in time -- 1475 -- to enjoy in lorenzo the magnificent 's house the new and precious advantage of print book become as a boy a profound student of the poet and when later a appeal be make from florence to the pope to sanction the removal of dante 's bone to florence michelangelo be among the signatory but it be not do he death-mask from ravenna be in the bargello : a few of he bone and they coffin be still in ravenna in the monastery of classe piously preserve in a room fill with dante relic and literature he tomb be elsewhere at ravenna a shrine visit by thousand every year ever since have dante 's fame be grow so that only the bible have lead to more literature and to-day florence be more proud of he than any of she son except perhaps michelangelo we have see one or two reminder of he already more be here where we stand we have see the picture in honor of he which the republic set up in the cathedral he head on a beautiful inlaid door in the palazzo vecchio the building where he sentence of banishment be devise and carry to be follow by death sentence thrice repeat -lrb- burn alive to be exact -rrb- and we have see the head-quarter of the florentine dante society in the guild house at or san michele we have still to see he statue opposite s croce another fresco head in s marium novellum certain holograph relic at the library at s lorenzo and he head again by he friend giotto in the bargello where he would have be confine while wait for death have he be capture dante 's house have be rebuild very recently and next to it be a newer building still with a long inscription in italian upon it to the effect that the residence of bellum and bellincione alighierus stand hereabouts and in that abode be dante bear the commune of florence it go on to say have secure possession of the site build this edifice on the remains of the ancestral house as fresh evidence of the public veneration of the divine poet the torre della castagna across the way have a inscription in italian which may be translate thus : this tower the so-called tower of the chestnut be the solitary remnant of the head-quarter from which the prior of the art govern florence before the power and glory of the florentine commune procure the erection of the palace of the signorium few person in the real city of florence it may be say confidently live in a house build for they but hereabouts none at all in fact it be the exception anywhere near the center of the city to live in a house build less than three century ago palace abound cut up into office flat room and even cinema theater the telegraph office in the via del proconsolo be a palace commission by the strozzus but never complete : hence its name nonfinito next it be the superb palazzo quaratesus which brunelleschi design now the head-quarter of a score of firm and a ecclesiastical school whence sound of sacred song continually emerge since we have mino da fiesole in we mind and be on the subject of old palace let we walk from the dante quarter in a straight line from the corso that very busy street of small shop across the via del proconsolo and down the borgo degli albizzi to s ambrogio where mino be bury this borgo be a street of palace and a excellent one in which to reflect upon the strange habit which wealthy florentine then indulge of set they mansion within a few foot of those opposite house -- or rather fortress -- that must have cost fortune and have be occupy by family of wealth and splendor be erect so close to they vis-à-vi that two cart could not pass abreast between they side by side contiguity one can understand but not this other adjacence every ground floor window be bar like a gaol those bar tell we something of the peril of life in florence in the great day of faction ambition while the thickness of the wall and solidity of construction tell we something too of the integrity of the florentine builder these ancient palace one feel whatever may happen to they can never fall to ruin such stone as be place one upon the other in the pittus and the strozzus and the riccardus nothing can displace it be a odd thought that several florentine palace and villa build before columbus sail for america be now occupy by rich american some of they draw possibly much of they income from the manufacture of steel girder for sky-scraper these ancient street with they stern and sombre palace specially touch the imagination of dickens when he be in florence in 1844 but in he picture from italy he give the city only fugitive mention the old prison which then adjoin the palazzo vecchio and in which the prisoner could be see also move he the borgo degli albizzi as i have say be crowd with palazzo no 24 -- and there be something very incongruous in palace have number at all -- be memorable in history as be one of the home of the pazzus family who organize the conspiracy against the medicus in 1478 as i have relate in the second chapter and fail so completely donatello design the coat of arm here the palace at no 18 belong to the altovitus no 12 be the palazzo albizzi the residence of one of the most powerful of the florentine family whose ally be all about they in this quarter as it be wise to be as a change from picture gallery i can think of nothing more delightful than to wander about these ancient street and wherever a courtyard or garden shine penetrate to it stop now and again to enjoy the vista the red duomo or giotto 's tower so often mount into the sky at one end or a indigo apennine at the other standing in the middle of the via ricasolus for example one have sight of both at the piazza s pietro we see one of the old tower of florence of which there be once so many into which the woman and child might retreat in time of great danger and here too be a series of arch which fruit and vegetable shop make gay the next piazza be that of s ambrogio this church be interesting not only for do its work in a poor quarter -- one have the feeling at once that it be a right church in the right place -- but as contain as i have say the grave of mino da fiesole : mino de ' poppi detto da fiesole as the floor tablet have it over the altar of mino 's little chapel be a large tabernacle from he hand in which the gayest little boy give the benediction own brother to that one by desiderio at s lorenzo the tabernacle must be one of the master 's finest work and beneath it be a relief in which a priest pour something -- perhaps the very blood of christ which be keep here -- from one chalice to another hold by a kneel woman surround by other kneel woman which be a marvel of flow beauty and life the line of it be peculiarly lovely on the wall of the same little chapel be a fresco by cosimo rossellus which must once have be a delight represent a procession of corpus christus -- this chapel be dedicate to the miracle of the sacrament -- and it contain accord to vasari a speaking likeness of pico della mirandola other grave in the church be those of cronaca the architect of the palazzo vecchio 's great council room a friend of savonarolum and rossellus 's nephew by marriage and verrocchio the sculptor whose beautiful work we be now to see in the bargello it be say that lorenzo di credi also lie here and albertinellus who give up the brush for innkeep opposite the church on a house at the corner of the borgo s croce and the via de ' maccus be a della robbia saint -- one of many such mural work of art in florence thus at the corner of the via cavor and the via de ' pucci opposite the riccardus palace be a beautiful madonna and child by donatello in the via zannettus which lead out of the via cerretanus be a very pretty example by mino a few house on the right these be sculpture and everywhere in the older street you may see shrine build into the wall : there be even one in the prison in the via dell ' agnolo once the convent of the murate where catherine de ' medicus be imprison as a girl but many of they be cover with glass which have be allow to become black a word or two on s egidio the church of the great hospital of s marium nuova might round off this chapter since it be folco portinarus beatrice 's father who found it the hospital stand in a rather forlorn square a few step from the duomo down the via dell ' orivolo and then the first to the left and it extend right through to the via deglus alfanus in cloister and ramification the façade be in a state of decay old fresco peel off it but one picture have be enclose for protection -- a gay and busy scene of the consecration of the church by pope martin v within it be a church of the poor notable for its general florid comfort -lrb- comparatively -rrb- and folco 's gothic tomb in the chancel be a pretty little tabernacle by mino which use to have a bronze door by ghibertus but have it no longer and a very fine dellum robbium madonna and child probably by andrea behind a grille upstairs sit the hospital nurse in the adjoining cloister -- one of the high road to the hospital proper -- be the ancient statue of old monna tessa beatrice 's nurse and in a niche a pretty symbolical painting of charity by that curious painter giovannus di san giovanni it be in the hospital that the famous van der go triptych use to hang a tablet on a house opposite s egidio a little to the right state that it be there that ghibertus make the baptistery gate which michelangelo consider fit to be the portal of paradise chapter xiv the bargello plastic art -- blood-soaked stone -- the faithful artist -- michelangelo -- italian custodian -- the famous david -- michelangelo 's tondo -- brutus -- benedetto da rovezzano -- donatello 's life-work -- the s george -- verrocchio -- ghibertus and brunelleschus and the baptistery door -- benvenuto cellinus -- john of bologna -- antonio pollaiuolo -- verrocchio again -- mino da fiesole -- the florentine wealth of sculpture -- beautiful lady -- the della robbias -- south kensington and the louvre before my last visit but one to florence plastic art be less attractive to I than pictorial art but now i be not sure at any rate when here in england i think of florence as so often i do i find myself visit in imagination the bargello before the uffizus picture in any number can bewilder and dazzle as much as they delight the eye tire and so it be true can a multiplicity of antique statuary such as one find at the vatican or at the louvre but a small collection of renaissance work so soft and human as at the bargello be not only joy-giving but refreshing too the soft contour soothe as well as enrapture the eye : the tenderness of the madonna the gentleness of the florentine lady and youth as verrocchio and mino da fiesole donatello and pollaiuolo mould they calm one where the perfection of phidia and praxitele excite hence the very special charm of the bargello whose plastic treasure be comparatively few and pick as against the heap profusion of paint in the uffizus and the pittus it pair off rather with the accademia and have this further point in common with that choicest of gallery that michelangelo 's chisel be represent in both the bargello be at the corner of the via ghibellina in the narrow via del proconsolo -- so narrow that if you take one step off the pavement a tram may easily sweep you into eternity so narrow also that the real dignity of the bargello be never to be properly see and one think of it rather for its inner court and staircase and its strong tower than for its massive façades its history be soak in blood it be build in the middle of the thirteenth century as the residence of the chief magistrate of the city the capitano del popolo or podestà first appoint soon after the return of the guelph in 1251 and it so remain with such natural florentine vicissitude as destruction by mob and fire for four hundred year when in 1574 it be convert into a prison and place of execution and the head-quarter of the police and change its name from the palazzo del podestà to that by which it be now know so call after the bargello or chief of the police it be indeed fortunate that no rioter succeed in obliterate giotto 's fresco in the bargello chapel which he paint probably in 1300 when he friend dante be a prior of the city giotto introduce the portrait of dante which have draw so many people to this little room together with portrait of corso donatus and brunetto latinus dante 's tutor whitewash cover it for two century dante 's head have be restore it be in 1857 that the bargello be again convert this time to its present gracious office of preserve the very flower of renaissance plastic art pass through the entrance hall which have a remarkable collection of medicean armor and weapon and in which -lrb- i have read but not see -rrb- be a oubliette under one of the great pillar the famous court be gain and the famous staircase of this court what can i say its quality be not to be communicate in word and even the photograph of it that be sell have to be make from picture which the assiduous signor giulianus among other be always so faithfully paint stone for stone one forget all the horror that once be enact here -- the execution of honorable florentine patriot whose only offence be that in they service of this proud and beautiful city they differ from those in power one think only of the soft light on the immemorial wall the sturdy graceful column the carve escutcheon the resolute step the spaciousness and stern calm of it all in the colonnade be a number of statue the most famous of which be perhaps the die adoni which baedeker give to michelangelo but the curator to vincenzo di rossi a ascription that would annoy michelangelo exceedingly if it be a mistake since rossus be a pupil of he enemy the absurd bandinellus mr wg water in he italian sculptor consider not only that michelangelo be the sculptor but that the work be intend to form part of the tomb of pope julius in the second room opposite the main entrance across the courtyard we come however to michelangelo authentic and supreme for here be he small david he brutus he bacchus and a tondo of the madonna and child accord to baedeker the bacchus and the david revolve certainly they be on revolving stand but to say that they revolve be to disregard utterly the character of the italian official a catch hold each in its place and any effort to release this or to induce the custodian to release it be equally futile chiuso -lrb- close -rrb- he reply and that be final useless to explain that the back of statue can be beautiful as the front that one of the triumph of great statuary be its equal perfection from every point that the revolving stand be not make for a joke but for a serious purpose chiuso he reply the museum custodian of italy be either like this -- jaded figure of apathy -- or they be enthusiast to each enthusiast there be ninety-nine of the other who either sit in a kind of stupor and watch you with sullen suspicion or clear they throat as no gentleman should the result be that when one meet the enthusiast one remember they there be a little dark fellow in the brera at milan whose zeal in display the merit of mantegna 's foreshortened christ be as unforgettable as a striking piece of character-acting in a theater there be a more reserved but hardly less appreciative official in the accademia at bologna with a genuine if incommunicable passion for guido renus and lastly there be alfr branconus at s croce with he continual and rapturous it be faine it be faine but he be a private guide the bargello custodian belong to the other camp the fondness of sculptor for david as a subject be due to the fact that the florentine who have spend so much of they time under tyrant and so much of they blood in resist they be captivate by the idea of this striple free he compatriot from goliath and the philistine david as i have say in my remark on the piazza della signoria stand to they with judith as a champion of liberty he be alluring also on account of he youth so attractive to renaissance sculptor and poet and the florentine ' admiration be not diminish by the circumstance that he task be a singularly light one since he never come to close quarter with he antagonist at all and have the lord of host on he side a david of mythology perseus another florentine hero a striple with what look like a formidable enemy also enjoy supernatural assistance david appeal to the greatest sculptor of all -- to michelangelo to donatello and to verrocchio and michelangelo make two figure one of which be here and the other at the accademia and donatello two figure both of which be here so that verrocchio 's example be also here very interesting comparison be possible personally i put michelangelo 's small david first it be the one in which apart from its beauty you can best believe he colossal david seem to I one of the most glorious thing in the world but it be not david not the simple ruddy shepherd lad of the bible this david could obviously defeat anybody donatello 's more famous david in the hat upstairs be the most charming creature you ever see but it have be far better to call he something else both he and verrocchio 's david also upstairs be young tournament noble rather than shepherd lad who have sling a stone at a philistine bully i see they both -- but particularly perhaps verrocchio 's -- in the interval of strife most acceptably hold up a lady 's train or lie at she foot read one of boccaccio 's story neither could ever have watch a flock donatello 's second david behind the more famous one have more reality but i would put michelangelo 's smaller one first and what beautiful marble it be -- so rich and warm one point which both donatello 's and verrocchio 's david emphasize be the gulf that be fix between the biblical and religious conception of the youthful psalmist and that of these sculptor of the renaissance one can indeed never think of donatello as a religious artist serious yes but not religious or at any rate not religious in the too common sense of the word in the sense of appertain to a special reverential mood distinguish from ordinary mood of dailiness he david as i have say be a comely culture boy who belong to the very flower of chivalry and romance verrocchio 's be akin to he but he have less radiant mastery donatello 's david might be the young lord verrocchio 's he page here we see the new spirit the renaissance at work for though religion call it into be and the church continue to be its patron it rapidly divide into two half and while the painter be bring all they genius to glorify sacred history the scholar be endeavor to humanize it in this task they have no such ally as the sculptor and particularly donatello who always think independently and vigorously be they best friend donatello 's david fight also more powerfully for the modern spirit -lrb- have he know it -rrb- than ever he could have do in real life with such a large sword in such delicate hand for by be the first nude statue of a biblical character he make simpler the way to all humanist in whatever medium they work michelangelo be not often tender profoundly sad he could be : indeed he own head in bronze at the accademia might stand for melancholy and bitter world-knowledge but seldom tender yet the madonna and child in the circular bas-relief in this ground-floor room have something very nigh tenderness and a greatness that none of the other italian sculptor however often they attempt this subject ever reach the head of mary in this relief be i think one of the most beautiful thing in florence none the less so for the charming head-dress which the great austere artist have give she the child be older than be usual in such group and differ in another way for tire of a reading lesson he have lay he arm upon the book : a pretty touch michelangelo 's bacchus a early work be opposite it be a remarkable proof of he extraordinary range that the same little room should contain the david the madonna the brutus and the bacchus in david one can believe as i have say as the young serious stalwart of the book of king the madonna although perhaps a shade too intellectual -- or at any rate more intellectual and commanding than the other great artist have accustom we to think of she -- have a sweet gravity and power and almost domestic tenderness the brutus be powerful and modern and realistic while bacchus be steep in the greek spirit and the little faun hide behind he be the very essence of mischief add to these the fluid vigor of the unfinished relief of the martyrdom of s andrew no 126 and you have five example of human accomplishment that would be enough without the other florentine evidence at all -- the medicus chapel tomb and the duomo pieta the inscription under the brutus say : while the sculptor be carve the statue of brutus in marble he think of the crime and hold he hand and the theory be that michelangelo be at work upon this head at rome when in 1537 lorenzino de ' medicus who claim to be a modern brutus murder alessandro de ' medicus but it might easily have be that the sculptor be concern only with brutus the friend of cæsar and revolt at he crime the circumstance that the head be unfinished matter nothing once see it can never be forget although michelangelo be as always the dominator this room have other possession to make it a resort of visitor at the end be a fireplace from the casa borgherini by benedetto da rovezzano which probably have not a equal although the pietra serena of which it be make be a horrid hue and on the wall be fragment of the tomb of s giovannus gualberto at vallombrosa design by the same artist but never finish benedetto -lrb- 1474-1556 -rrb- have a peculiar interest to the english in have come to england in 1524 at the bidding of cardinal wolsey to design a tomb for that proud prelate on wolsey 's disgrace henry viii decide that the tomb should be continue for he own bone but the sculptor die first and it be unfinished later charle i cast envious eye upon it and wish to lie within it but circumstance deprive he too of the honor finally after have be despoil of certain bronze addition the sarcophagus be use for the remains of nelson which it now hold in st paul 's crypt the borgherinus fireplace be a miracle of exquisite work everything have receive think the delicate tracery on the pillar not less than the frieze the fireplace be in perfect condition not one head have be knock off but the gualberto relief be badly damage yet full of life the angel under the saint 's bier in no 104 almost move in this room look also at the beautiful blade of barley on the pillar in the corner close to brutus and the lovely frieze by a unknown hand above michelangelo 's martyrdom of s andrew and the carve upon the two niche for statue on either side of the door the little room through which one pass to the michelangelo may well be linger in there be a gravely fine floor-tomb of a nun to the left of the door -- no 20 -- which one would like to see in its proper position instead of upright against the wall and a stone font in the middle which be very fine there be also a beautiful tomb by giustus da settignano and the iron gate be worth attention from michelangelo let we ascend the stair past the splendid gate to donatello and here a word about that sculptor for though we meet he again and again in florence -lrb- yet never often enough -rrb- it be in the upper room in the bargello that he be enthrone of donatello there be nothing known but good and good of the most captivating variety not only be he a great creative genius equally the first modern sculptor and the sanest but he be himself tall and comely open-handed a warm friend humorous and of vigorous intellect a hint of the affection in which he be hold be obtain from he name donatello which be a pet diminutive of donato -- he full style be donato di niccolò di betto bardi bear in 1386 four year before fra angelico and nearly a century after giotto he be the son of a well-to-do wool-comber who be no stranger to the peril of political energy in these time of donatello 's youth little be know but it be almost certain that he help ghibertus with he first baptistery door be thirteen when that sculptor begin upon they at sixteen he be himself enrol as a sculptor it be soon after this that as i have say in the first chapter he accompany he friend brunelleschus who be thirteen year he senior to rome and return alone he begin work in florence in earnest both for the cathedral and campanile and for or san michele in 1425 he take into partnership michelozzo and become with he a protégé of cosimo de ' medicus with whom both continue on friendly term for the rest of they life in 1433 he be in rome again probably not sorry to be there since cosimo have be banish and have take michelozzo with he on the triumphant return of cosimo in 1434 donatello be most prosperous period begin for he be intimate with the most powerful man in florence be honor by he and be himself at the useful age of forty-four of donatello as a innovator i have say something above in consider the florentine david but he be also the inventor of that low relief in which he school work call rilievo stiacciato of which there be some excellent example at south kensington in ghiberti 's high relief break out often into completely detach figure he be also a master as we shall see at s lorenzo but he greatest claim to distinction be he psychological insight ally to perfect mastery of form he statue be not only the first really great statue since the greek but be still -lrb- always leave michelangelo on one side as abnormal -rrb- the greatest modern example judge upon a realistic basis here in the bargello in original and in cast he may be adequately appreciate but to padua he admirer must certainly go for the bronze equestrian statue of gattamela be there donatello be paint by he friend masaccio at the carmine but the fresco have perish he be to be see in the uffizus portico although that be probably a fancy representation and again on a tablet in the wall opposite the apse of the duomo the only contemporary portrait -lrb- and this be very doubtful -rrb- be in a picture in the louvre give to uccello -- a serious thoughtful bearded face with steady observant eye : one of five head the other be giotto manettus brunelleschus and uccello himself donatello who never marry but live for much of he life with he mother and sister die at a great age care for both by cosimo de ' medicus and he son and successor piero he be bury with cosimo in s lorenzo vasarus tell we that he be free affectionate and courteous but of a high spirit and capable of sudden anger as when he destroy with a blow a head he have make for a mean patron who object to its very reasonable price he think say vasarus nothing of money keep it in a basket suspend from the ceiling so that all he workman and friend take what they want without say anything he be as careless of dress as great artist have ever be and of a handsome robe which cosimo give he he complain that it spoil he work when he be die he relation affect great concern in the hope of inherit a farm at prato but he tell they that he have leave it to the peasant who have always toil there and he would not alter he will the donatello collection in the bargello have be make representative by the addition of cast the original number ten : there be also a cast of the equestrian statue of gattemala at padua which be i suppose next to verrocchio 's bartolommeo colleonus at venice the finest equestrian statue that exist head from various collection include m dreyfus ' in paris although dr bode now give that charming example to donatello 's pupil desiderio and various other masterpiece elsewhere but it be the original that chiefly interest we and first of these in bronze be the david of which i have already speak and first of these in marble the s george this george be just such a resolute clean warlike idealist as one dream he he would kill a dragon it be true but he would eat and sleep after it and tell the story modestly and not without humor by a happy chance the marble upon which donatello work have light vein run through it just where the head be with the result that the face seem to possess a radiance of its own this statue be make for or san michele where it use to stand until 1891 when the present bronze replica that take its place be make the spirited marble frieze underneath it at or san michele be the original and have be there for century it be this s george whom ruskin take as the head and inspiration of he saint george 's guild the david be interesting not only in itself but as be the first isolate statue of modern time it be make for cosimo de ' medicus to stand in the courtyard of the medicus palace -lrb- now the riccardus -rrb- and until that time since antiquity no one have make a statue to stand on a pedestal and be observable from all point hitherto modern sculptor have either make relief or statue for niche it be also the first nude statue of modern time and once again one have the satisfaction of recognize that the first be the best at any rate no later sculptor have make anything more charming than this figure or more masterly within its limit after the s george and the bronze david the two most memorable thing be the adorable bronze amorino in its quaint little trousers -- or perhaps not amorino at all since it be trample on a snake which such little sprite do not do -- and the color terra-cotta bust call niccolò da uzzano so like life as to be after a while disconcert the sensitiveness of the mouth can never have be excel the other original include the gaunt john the baptist with its curious little moustache so far remove from the amorino and so admirable a proof of the sculptor 's vigilant thoughtfulness in all he do the relief of the infant john one of the most animated of the head -lrb- the baptist at all period of he life be a favorite with this sculptor -rrb- three bronze head of which those of the young gentleman and the roman emperor remain most clearly in my mind but the authorship of the roman emperor be very doubtful and lastly the glorious marzocco -- the lion from the front of the palazzo vecchio firmly hold the florentine escutcheon against the world florence have other donatello -- the judith in the loggia de ' lanzi the figure on giotto 's campanile the annunciation in s croce and above all the cantorium in the museum of the cathedral but this room hold most of he strong sweet genius here -lrb- for there be seldom more than two or three person in it -rrb- you can be on term with he after the donatello we should see the other renaissance sculpture but first the carrand collection of ivory picture jewel carving vestment plaquette and objet d'art bequeath to florence in 1888 everything here be good and worth examination among the outstanding thing be a plaquette no 393 a satyr and a bacchante attribute to donatello under the title allegory of spring which be the work of a master and a very riot of mythological imagery the neighbouring plaquette many of they of the school of donatello be all beautiful we now find the sixth salon to see verrocchio 's david of which i have already speak this wholly charming boy a little nearer life perhaps than donatello 's although not quite so radiantly distinguish illustrate the association of verrocchio and leonardo as clearly as any of the painting do for the head be sheer leonardo at the palazzo vecchio we see verrocchio 's boy with the dolphin -- that happy bronze lyric -- and outside or san michele he christ and s thoma in donatello and michelozzo 's niche with the fly cherubim beneath but as with donatello so with verrocchio one must visit the bargello to see he in florence most intimately for here be not only he david which once know can never be forget and be as full of the renaissance spirit as anything ever fashion whether in bronze marble or paint but -- upstairs -- certain other wonderfully beautiful thing to which we shall come and that be so i would like here to say a little about they author verrocchio be a nickname signify the true eye andrea 's real name be de ' cionus he be know to fame as andrea of the true eye and since he have acquire this style at a time when every eye be true enough he must have be true indeed it be probable that he be a pupil of donatello who in 1435 when andrea be bear be forty-nine and in time he be to become the master of leonardo : thus be the great artist relate the history of florentine art be practically the history of a family one artist lead to the other -- the genealogy of genius the story go that it be the excellence of the angel contribute by leonardo to he master 's picture of the baptism of christ -lrb- at the accademia -rrb- which decide verrocchio to paint no more just as ghibertus 's superiority in the relief of abraham and isaac drive brunelleschus from sculpture if this be so it account for the extraordinarily small number of picture by he like many artist of he day verrocchio be also a goldsmith but he be versatile above most even when versatility be a habit and excel also as a musician both piero de ' medicus and lorenzo employ he to design they tournament costume and it be for lorenzo that he make this charming david and the boy and the dolphin he greatest work of all be the bronze equestrian statue of bartolommeo colleonus in venice the finest thing of its kind in the world and so glorious and exciting indeed that every city should have a cast of it in a conspicuous position just for the good of the people it be while at work upon this that verrocchio die at the age of fifty-three he body be bring from venice by he pupil lorenzo di credi who adore he and be bury in s ambrogio in florence lorenzo di credi paint he portrait which be now in the uffizus -- a plump undistinguished-looking little man in the david room be also the extremely interesting rival bronze relief of abraham sacrifice isaac which be make by ghibertus and brunelleschus as trial of skill to see which would win the commission to design the new gate of the baptistery as i have tell earlier in this book six competitor enter for the contest but ghibertus 's and brunelleschus 's effort be alone consider seriously a comparison of these two relief prove that ghibertus at any rate have a finer sense of group he fill the space at he disposal more easily and he hand be more fluent but there be a very engaging vivacity in the other work the realistic detail of which be so arrest as to make one regret that brunelleschus have for sculpture so little time in s marium novellum be that crucifix in wood which he carve for he friend donatello but he only other sculptured work in florence be the door of he beautiful pazzus chapel in the cloister of s croce of ghibertus 's baptistery gate i have say more elsewhere enough here to add that the episode of abraham and isaac do not occur in they this little room also have a cassa reliquiarium by ghibertus below a fine relief by bertoldo michelangelo 's master in sculpture represent a battle between the roman and the barbarian case of exquisite bronze the head in bronze -lrb- no 25 -rrb- of a old placid shrewd woman execute from a death-mask which the photographer call contessina de ' bardi wife of cosimo de ' medici by donatello but which can not be so since the sculptor die first head of apollo and two baby over the ghibertus and brunelleschus competition relief a crucifixion by bertoldo a row of baby represent the triumph of bacchus and below these a case of medal and plaquette every one a masterpiece the next room sala vii be apportion chiefly between cellinus and gian or giovannus da bologna the two sculptor who dominate the loggia de ' lanzus here we may see model for cellinus 's perseus in bronze and wax and also for the relief of the rescue of andromeda under the statue he cosimo i with the wart -lrb- omit by bandinellus in the head downstairs which pair with michelangelo 's brutus -rrb- and various smaller work but personally i find that cellinus will not do in such near proximity to donatello verrocchio and they gentle follower he be of course far later he be not bear -lrb- in 1500 -rrb- until donatello have be dead thirty-four year mino da fiesole sixteen year desiderio da settignano thirty-six year and verrocchio twelve year he thus do not begin to work until the finer impulse of the renaissance be exhaust giovannus da bologna although he it be true be even later -lrb- 1524-1608 -rrb- i find more sympathetic while landor boldly proclaim he superior to michelangelo he mercury in the middle of the room which one see counterfeit in all the statuary shop of florence be truly very nearly light as air if ever bronze float this figure do he cherub and dolphin be very skilful and merry he turkey and eagle and other animal indicate that he have humility john of bologna be best know at florence by he rape of the sabine and hercule and nessus in the loggia de ' lanzus but the boboli garden have a fine group of oceanus and river god by he in the midst of a lake before leave this room look at the relief of christ in glory -lrb- no 35 -rrb- to the left of the door by jacopo sansovino a rival of michelangelo which be most admirable and at the case of bronze animal by pietro tacca john of bologna 's pupil who make the famous boar -lrb- a copy of a ancient marble -rrb- at the mercato nuovo and the relief for the pediment of the statue of cosimo i -lrb- by he master -rrb- in the piazza della signoria but i believe that the most beautiful thing in this room be the bronze figure for the tomb of mariano sozzino by lorenzo di pietro before we look at the della robbias which be in the two large room upstairs let we finish with the marble and terra-cotta statuary in the two smaller room to the leave as one pass through the first dellum robbium room in the first of they correspond to the room with verrocchio 's david downstairs we find verrocchio again with a bust of piero di lorenzo de ' medicus -lrb- whom botticellus paint in the uffizus hold a medal in he hand -rrb- and a most exquisite madonna and child in terra-cotta from s marium nuova -lrb- this be on a hinge for better light but the official sky will fall if you touch it -rrb- here also be the bust of a young warrior by antonio pollaiuolo -lrb- 1429-1498 -rrb- who be verrocchio 's closest rival and one of ghibertus 's assistant for the second baptistery door he greatest work be at rome but this bust be indescribably charming and the softness of the boy 's contour be almost of life it be sometimes call giuliano de ' medicus other beautiful object in the room be the terra-cotta madonna and child by andrea sansovino -lrb- 1460-1529 -rrb- pollaiuolo 's pupil which be as radiant although not so domestically lovely as verrocchio 's the bust by benedetto da maiano -lrb- 1442-1497 -rrb- of pietro mellini that shrewd and wrinkled patron of the church who present to s croce the famous pulpit by this sculptor a ancient lady by the door in color terra-cotta who be think to represent monna tessa the nurse of dante 's beatrice and certain other work by that delightful and prolific person ignoto fiorentino who here and in the next room which we now enter be at he best this next priceless room be chiefly memorable for verrocchio and mino da fiesole we come to verrocchio at once on the leave where he relief of the death of francesca pittus tornabuonus -lrb- on a tiny bed only half as long as herself -rrb- may be see this poor lady who die in childbirth be the wife of giovannus tornabuonus and he it be who employ ghirlandaio to make the fresco in the choir of s marium novellum -lrb- i ought however to state that miss cruttwell in she monograph on verrocchio question both the subject and the artist -rrb- close by we have two more work by verrocchio -- no 180 a marble relief of the madonna and child the madonna 's dress fasten by the prettiest of brooch and she herself possess a dainty sad head and the long finger that verrocchio so favored which we find again in the famous gentildonna -lrb- no 181 -rrb- next it -- that florentine lady with flower in she bosom whose contour be so exquisite and who have such pretty shoulder near by be the little eager s john the baptist as a boy by antonio rossellino -lrb- 1427-1478 -rrb- and on the next wall the same sculptor 's circular relief of the madonna adoring in a border of cherub in the middle be the masterpiece of jacopo sansovino -lrb- 1486-1570 -rrb- : a bacchus so strangely like a genuine antique full of greek lightness and grace and then we come back to the wall in which the door be and find more work from the delicate hand of mino da fiesole whom we in london be fortunate in be able to study as near home as at the victorium and albert museum of mino i have say more both at the badium and at fiesole but here i might remark again that he be bear in 1431 and die in 1484 and be the favorite pupil of desiderio da settignano who be in he turn the favorite pupil of donatello in the little church of s ambrogio we have see a tablet to the memory of mino who lie there not far from the grave of verrocchio whom he most nearly approach in feeling although they ideal type of woman differ in everything save the slenderness of the finger the bargello have both bust and relief by he all distinguish and sensitive and marked by mino 's profound refinement the madonna and child in no 232 be peculiarly beautiful and notable both for high relief and shallow relief and the child in no 193 be even more charming for delicacy and vivacity in marble portraiture it would be impossible to surpass the head of rinaldo dellum luna and the two medici be wonderfully real everything in mino 's work be thoughtful and exquisite while the unusual type of face which so attract he give he freshness too this room and that next it illustrate the wealth of fine sculptor which florence have in the fifteenth century for the work by the unknown hand be in some case hardly less beautiful and masterly than those by the known look for example at the fleur-de-lis over the door at the madonna and child next it on the right at the girl 's head next to that at the baby girl at the other end of the room and at the older boy and he pendant but one do not need to come here to form a idea of the wealth of good sculpture the street alone be full of it every palace have beautiful stone-work and a escutcheon which often only a master could execute -- as donatello devise that for the palazzo pazzus in the borgo degli albizzi on the great staircase of the bargello for example be number of coat of arm that could not be more beautifully design and incise in the room lead from that which be memorable for pollaiuolo 's youth in armor be a collection of medal by all the best medallist begin in the first case with pisanello here be he sigismondo malatesta the tyrant of riminus and isotta he wife here also be a portrait of leon battista albertus who design and work on the cathedral of riminus as well as upon s marium novellum in florence on the other side of this case be the medal commemorate the pazzus conspiracy in other case be pretty italian lady such as julium astallum lucrezium tornabuonus with she hair in curl just as in ghirlandaio 's fresco costanza rucellaus leonora altovitus marium poliziano and marium de ' mucinus and so we come to the della robbias without whose joyous radiant art florence would be only half as beautiful as she be of these exquisite artist luca the uncle bear in 1400 be by far the greatest andrea he nephew bear in 1435 come next and then giovannus luca seem to have be a serious quiet man who would probably have make sculpture not much below he friend donatello 's have not he chance on the discovery of a means of color and glaze terra-cotta example of this craft be see all over florence both within door and out as the page of this book indicate but at the bargello be the greatest number of small piece gather together i do not say there be anything here more notable than the annunciation attribute to andrea at the spedale deglus innocentus while of course for most people he putto on the façade of that building be the dellum robbium symbol nor be there anything finer than luca 's work at impruneta but as a collection of sweetness and gentle domestic beauty these bargello relief be unequalled both in character and in volume here you see what one might call roman catholic art -- that be the art which at once give pleasure to simple soul and symbolize benevolence and safety -- carry out to its highest power tenderness happiness and purity be equally suggest by every relief here have luca and andrea be entrust with the creation of the world it would be a paradise and as it be it seem to I impossible but that they leave the world sweeter than they find it such example of affection and solicitude as they be continually bring to the popular vision must have engender kindness i have note as especially beautiful in the first room no 4 6 12 23 by andrea and 10 and 21 by luca these by the way be the bargello ascription but the expert do not always agree herr bode for example who have study the della robbias with passionate thoroughness give the famous head of the boy which be in reproduction one of the best-known work of plastic art to luca but the bargello director say andrea in herr bode 's fascinating monograph florentine sculptor of the renaissance he go very carefully into the difference between the uncle and the nephew master and pupil in all the group for example he say that luca place the child on the madonna 's left arm andrea on the right in the second room i have mark particularly no 21 28 and 31 by luca 28 be a deeper relief than usual and the madonna not adoring but hold and delight in one of the most adorable of baby observe in the reproduction of this relief in this volume -- how the mother 's finger sink into the child 's flesh luca be the first sculptor to notice that no 31 be the lovely madonna of the rose bower but nothing give I more pleasure than the boy 's head of which i have just speak attribute to andrea and also reproduce here the giovane donna which pair with it have extraordinary charm and delicacy too i have mark also by andrea no 71 and 76 giovannus della robbia 's best be perhaps no 15 in the other room one curious thing that one note about della robbia pottery be its inability to travel it be make for the church and it should remain there even in the bargello where there be a ancient environment it lose half its charm while in a english museum it become hard and cold but in a church to which the poor carry they trouble with a dim light and a little incense it be perfect far beyond painting in its tenderness and symbolic value i speak of course of the madonna and altar-piece when the della robbias work for the open air -- as in the façade of the child 's hospital or at the certosa or in the loggia di san paolo opposite s marium novellum where one may see the beautiful meeting of s franci and s dominic by andrea -- they seem in italy to have fitness enough but it would not do to transplant any of these relief to a english façade there be once i might add in florence a via della robbia but it be now the via nazionale i suppose this injustice to the great potter come about in the eighteen-sixty when popular political enthusiasm lead to every kind of similar re-naming in the room lead out of the second dellum robbium room be a collection of vestment and brocade bequeath by baron giulio franchettus where you may see date from as far back as the sixth century design that for beauty and splendor and durability put to shame most of the stuff now weave but the top floor of the museo archeologico in the via della colonna be the chief home in florence of such treasure there be other beautiful thing in the bargello of which i have say nothing -- a gallery of mediaeval bell most exquisitely design from famous steeple case of carve ivory and many of such treasure as one see at the cluny in pari but it be for its courtyard and for the renaissance sculpture that one go to the bargello and return again and again to the bargello and it be for these that one remember it on return to london the first duty of every one who have drunk deep of delight in the bargello be to visit that too much neglect treasure-house of we own the victorium and albert museum at south kensington there may be nothing at south kensington as fine as the bargello 's finest but it be a priceless collection and be superior to the bargello in one respect at any rate for it have a relief attribute to leonardo here also be a adorable madonna and laugh child beyond anything in florence for sheer gaiety if not mischief which the south kensington authority call a rossellino but herr bode a desiderio da settignano the room be rich too in donatello and in verrocchio and altogether it make a perfect footnote to the bargello it also have within call learn gentleman who can give intimate information about the exhibit which the bargello badly lack the louvre and the kaiser friedrich museum in berlin -- but particularly the kaiser friedrich since herr bode who have such a passion for this period become its director -- have priceless treasure and in paris i have have the privilege of see the little but exquisite collection form by m gustave dreyfus dominate by that mirthful italian child which the bargello authority consider to be by donatello but herr bode give to desiderio at the louvre in gallery on the ground floor gain through the egyptian sculpture section and open very capriciously may be see the finest of the prisoner from michelangelo 's tomb for pope julius donatello 's youthful baptist a madonna and child by agostino di duccio whom we see at the museum of the cathedral a early color terra-cotta by luca dellum robbium and no 316 a terra-cotta madonna and child without ascription which look very like rossellino in addition to original there be at south kensington cast of many of the bargello 's most valuable possession such as donatello 's and verrocchio 's david donatello 's baptist and many head mino da fiesole 's best madonna pollaiuolo 's young warrior and so forth so that to loiter there be most attractively to recapture something of the florentine feeling chapter xv s croce a historic piazza -- marble façades -- florence 's westminster abbey -- galileo 's ancestor and ruskin -- benedetto 's pulpit -- michelangelo 's tomb -- a fond lady -- donatello 's annunciation -- giotto 's fresco -- s franci -- donatello magnanimous -- the gifted albertus -- desiderio 's great tomb -- the sacristy -- the medicus chapel -- the pazzus chapel -- old jacopo desecrate -- a restoration the piazza s croce now belong to child the church be at one end bizarre building be on either side the dante statue be in the middle and harsh gravel cover the ground everywhere be child all dirty and all rather squalid and mostly bow-legged show that they be of the wrong age to take they first step on holy Saturday at noon the long brown building on the right as we face s croce be a seventeenth-century palazzo for the rest the architecture be chiefly notable for green shutter the frigid and florid dante memorial which be unveil in 1865 on the six hundredth anniversary of the poet 's birthday look gloomily upon what once be a scene of splendor and animation for in 1469 piero de ' medici devise here a tournament in honor of the betrothal of lorenzo to clarice orsini the queen of the tournament be lucrezia donatus and she award the first prize to lorenzo the tournament cost 10000 gold florin and be very splendid verrocchio and other artist be call in to design costume and it be think that pollaiuolo 's terra-cotta of the young warrior in the bargello represent the comely giuliano de ' medici as he appear in he armor in the list the piazza be the scene also of that famous tournament give by lorenzo de ' medicus for giuliano in 1474 of which the beautiful simonetta be the queen of beauty and to which as i have say elsewhere we owe botticellus 's two most famous picture difficult to reconstruct in the piazza any of those glory to-day the new façade of s croce endowed not long since by a englishman have be much abused but it be not so bad as the front of so beautiful and wonderful a church it may be inadequate but as a structure of black and white marble it will do to my mind nothing satisfactory can now be do in this medium which unless it be century old be always harsh and cut the sky like a knife instead of rest against it as architecture should but when it be old as at s miniato it be right s croce be the westminster abbey of florence michelangelo lie here machiavelli lie here galileo lie here and here giotto paint donatello carve and brunelleschus plan although outside the church be disappointing within it be the most beautiful in florence it have the boldest arch the best light at all season the most attractive floor -- of gentle red -- and a apse almost wholly make of color glass not a little of its charm come from the delicate passage-way that run the whole course of the church high up on the yellow wall it also have the finest circular window in florence over the main entrance a deposition by ghibertus the lightness be indeed once so intense that no fewer than twenty-two window have to be close the circular window over the altar upon which a new roof seem to be intrude be in reality the interloper : the roof be the original one and the window be cut later in defiance of good architecture by vasarus who since he be a pupil of michelangelo should have know better to he be entrust the restoration of the church in the middle of the sixteenth century the original architect of the modern s croce be the same arnolfo di cambio or lapo who begin the duomo he have some right to be choose since he father jacopo or lapo a german be the builder of the most famous of all the franciscan church -- that at assisus which be begin while s franci be still live and giotto who paint in that church he most famous fresco depict scene in the life of s franci succeed arnolfo here as at the duomo with equal fitness arnolfo begin s croce in 1294 the year that the building of the duomo be decide upon as a reply to the new dominican church of s marium novellum and to he german origin be probably due the northern impression which the interior both of s croce and the duomo convey the first thing to examine in s croce be the floor-tomb close to the center door upon which ruskin write one of he most characteristic passage the tomb be of a ancestor of galileo -lrb- who lie close by but beneath a florid monument -rrb- and it represent a mediaeval scholarly figure with fold hand ruskin write : that worn face be still a perfect portrait of the old man though like one strike out at a venture with a few rough touch of a master 's chisel and that fall drapery of he cap be in its few line faultless and subtle beyond description and now here be a simple but most useful test of you capacity for understand florentine sculpture or painting if you can see that the line of that cap be both right and lovely that the choice of the fold be exquisite in its ornamental relation of line and that the softness and ease of they be complete -- though only sketch with a few dark touch -- then you can understand giotto 's drawing and botticellus 's donatello 's carve and luca 's but if you see nothing in this sculpture you will see nothing in theirs of theirs where they choose to imitate flesh or silk or to play any vulgar modern trick with marble -- -lrb- and they often do -rrb- -- whatever in a word be french or american or cockney in they work you can see but what be florentine and for ever great -- unless you can see also the beauty of this old man in he citizen 's cap -- you will see never the passage be in morning in florence which begin with s croce and should be read by every one visit the city and here let I advise another companion for this church : a little dark enthusiast in a black skull cap name alfred branconus who be usually to be find just inside the door but may be secure as a guide by a postcard to the church signor branconus know s croce and he love it and he have the further qualification of know all florence too and speak excellent english which he teach himself the s croce pulpit which be by benedetto da maiano be a satisfying thing accomplish both in proportion and workmanship with panel illustrate scene in the life of s franci these be all most gently and persuasively do influence of course by the baptistery door but individual too and full of a kindred sweetness and liveliness the scene be the confirmation of the franciscan order -lrb- the best i think -rrb- the burning of the book the stigma which we shall see again in the church in fresco for here we be all dedicate to the saint of assisus not yet have come upon the stern s dominic the ruler at s marco and s marium novellum the death of s franci very real and touching which we shall also see again and the execution of certain franciscan benedetto who be also a architect and make the plan of the strozzus palace be so unwilling that anything should mar the scheme of he pulpit that after strengthen this pillar with the greatest care and thoroughness he hollow it and place the stair inside the first tomb on the right close to this pulpit be michelangelo 's a mass of allegory design by he friend vasarus the author of the life of the artist the reading of which be perhaps the best preparation for the understanding of florence if life please we michelangelo once say we ought not to be grieve by death which come from the same giver michelangelo have intend the pietà now in the duomo to stand above he grave but vasarus who have a little of the pepy in he nature think to do he greater honor by this ornateness the artist be lay to he rest in 1564 but not before he body be exhume by he nephew at rome where the great man have die and a series of elaborate ceremony have be perform which vasarus who be here trustworthy enough describe minutely all the artist in florence vie in celebrate the dead master in memorial painting for he catafalque and its surroundings which have now perish but probably the loss be not great except as a example of homage for that be a bad period how bad it be may be a little gauge by vasarus 's tributory tomb and he window over the high altar opposite michelangelo 's tomb on the pillar be the pretty but rather victorian madonna del latte surround by angel by bernardo rossellino -lrb- 1409-1464 -rrb- brother of the author of the great tomb at s miniato this pretty relief be commission as a family memorial by that francesco norus the close friend of lorenzo de ' medicus who be kill in the duomo during the pazzus conspiracy in he effort to save lorenzo from the assassin the tomb of alfierus the dramatist to which we now come be erect at the cost of he mistress the countess of albany who herself sit to canova for the figure of bereaved italy this curious and unfortunate woman become at the age of nineteen the wife of the young pretender twenty-seven year after the '45 and lead a miserable existence with he -lrb- due chiefly to he depravity but a little she always hold to the circumstance that they choose good Friday for they wedding day -rrb- until alfierus fall in love with she and offer he protection together she and the poet remain apparently contented with each other and receive by society even by the english royal family until alfierus die in 1803 when after exclaim that she have lose all -- consolation support society all all -- and establish this handsome memorial she select the french artist fabre to fill the ache void in she fifty-years-old heart and fabre not only fill it until she death in 1824 but become the heir of all that have be bequeath to she by both the stuart and alfierus such be the countess of albany to whom human affection be so necessary she herself be bury close by in the chapel of the castellanus mr piozzus in she glimpse of italian society mention see in florence in 1785 the unhappy pretender though old and sickly he go much into society sport the english arm and livery and wear the garter other tomb in the right aisle be those of machiavellus the statesman and author of the prince and rossinus the composer of william tell who die in paris in 1868 but be bring here for burial these tomb be modern and of no artistic value but there be near they a fine fifteenth-century example in the monument by bernardo rossellino to another statesman and author leonardo brunus know as aretino who write the life of dante and petrarch and a latin history of florence a copy of which be place on he heart at he funeral this tomb be consider to be rossellino 's masterpiece but there be one opposite by another hand which dwarf it there be also a work of sculpture near it in the same wall which draw away the eye -- donatello 's annunciation the expert now think this to belong to the sculptor 's middle period but vasarus think it earlier and make it the work which have most influence in establish he reputation while accord to the archive it be place in the church before donatello be live vasarus ought to be better inform upon this point than usual since it be he who be employ in the sixteenth century to renovate s croce at which time the chapel for whose altar the relief be make -- that of the cavalcantus family -- be remove the relief now stand unrelated to anything every detail of it should be examine but alfr branconus will see to that the stone be the gray pietra serena of fiesole and donatello have plentifully but not too plentifully lighten it with gold which be exactly what all artist who use this medium for sculpture should have do by a pleasant tactful touch the designer of the modern donatello monument in s lorenzo have follow the master 's lead almost everything of donatello 's that one see be in turn the best but stand before this lovely work one be more than commonly conscious of be in the presence of a wonderful creator the virgin be wholly unlike any other woman and she be surprising and modern even for donatello with he vast range the charming terra-cotta boy above be almost without doubt from the same hand but they can not have be make for this monument to the della robbias we come in the castellanus chapel in the right transept which have two full-length statue by either luca or andrea in the gentle glazed medium of s franci and s bernard quite different from anything we have see or shall see because isolate the other full-size figure by these master -- such as those at impruneta -- be place against the wall the s bernard on the leave as one enter the chapel be far the finer it surely must be one of the most beautiful male draped figure in the world the next chapel at the end of the transept be once enrich by giotto fresco but they no longer exist there be however a interesting but restore series of scene in the life of the virgin by taddeo gaddus giotto 's godson a madonna ascend to heaven by mainardus who be ghirlandaio 's pupil and so satisfactory a one that he be reward by the hand of he master 's sister and a pretty piece of gothic sculpture with the christ child upon it hereabouts i may remark we have continually to be walk over floor-tomb now ruin beyond hope they ruin be perhaps the cause of a protect rail be place round the other although a floor-tomb should have i think a little wear from the foot of worshipper just to soften the line those at the certosa be for example far too sharp and clean let we complete the round of the church before we examine the sacristy and go now to the two chapel where giotto may be find at he best although restore too on this side of the high altar the peruzzus chapel have scene from the life of the two s john the baptist and the evangelist : all rather too thoroughly re-painted although follow giotto 's groundwork closely enough to retain much of they interest and value and here once again one should consult the morning in florence where the wilful discerning enthusiast be like he revered subject also at he best giotto 's thoughtfulness could not be better illustrated than in s croce one see he as ever think of everything : not a very remarkable attribute of the fresco painter since then but very remarkable then when any kind of facile saintliness suffice signor bianchus who find these painting under the whitewash in 1853 and restore they overdo he part there be no doubt but as i have say they interest be unharmed and it be that which one so delight in look for instance at the attitude of drusiana suddenly twitch by s john back again into this vale of tear while she bier be on its way to the cemetery outside the pretty city be i really to live again she so plainly say to the inexorable miracle-worker the dancing of herodia ' daughter which offer giotto less scope be original too -- original not because it come so early but because giotto 's mind be original and innovate and creative the musician be charming the last scene of all be a delightful blend of religious fervor and reality : the miraculous ascent from the tomb through a elegant florentine loggia to everlasting glory in a blaze of gold and christ and a apostle lean out of heaven with outstretched hand to pull the saint in as into a boat such a christ as that could not but be believe in in the next chapel the bardus we find giotto at work on a life of s franci and here again ruskin be essential it be a task which since this church be the great effort of the florentine franciscan would put a artist upon he mettle and giotto set the choose incident before the observer with the discretion and skill of the great biographer that he be and not only that but the great assisi decorator that he be no choice could have be better at any time in the history of art giotto choose the follow scene one or two of which coincide with those on benedetto da maiano 's pulpit which come of course many year later : the confirmation of the rule of the franciscan s franci before the sultan and the magus s franci sick and appear to the bishop of assisus s franci flee from he father 's house and he reception by the bishop of assisus and the death of s franci giotto 's assisus fresco which precede these anticipate they but in some case these be consider to be better although in other not so good it be generally agree that the death scene be the best note the characteristic touch by which giotto make one of the monk at the head of the bed look up at the precise moment when the saint die see he be receive into heaven accord to vasari one of the two monk -lrb- on the extreme left as i suppose -rrb- be giotto 's portrait of the architect of the church amolfo the altar picture consist of many more scene in the life of s franci be often attribute to cimabue giotto 's master but probably be by another hand in one of these scene the saint be find preach to what must be the most attentive bird on record the figure on the ceiling represent poverty chastity and obedience which all franciscan be pledge to observe the glass be coeval with the building which have be describe as the most perfect gothic chapel in existence the founder of this chapel be ridolfo de ' bardus whose family early in the fourteenth century bid fair to become as powerful as the medicus and by the same means they business be banking and money-lending in association with the founder of the adjoining chapel the peruzzus ridolfo 's father die in 1310 and he son who have become a franciscan in 1327 and the chapel be build and giotto probably paint the fresco soon after the father 's death both the bardus and peruzzus be bring low by we king edward iii who borrow from they money with which to fight the french at crecy and poitier and omit to repay it the chapel in the left transept be less interesting except perhaps to student of painting in its early day in the chapel at the end we find donatello 's wooden crucifix which lead to that friendly rivalry on the part of brunelleschus the story of which be one of the best in all vasarus donatello have finish this wooden crucifix and be unusually satisfy with it ask brunelleschi 's opinion confidently expect praise but brunelleschus who be sufficiently close a friend to say what he think reply that the type be too rough and common : it be not christ but a peasant christ of course be a peasant but by peasant brunelleschus mean a stupid dull man donatello chagrin have recourse to what have always be a popular retort to critic and challenge he to make a better brunelleschus take it very quietly : he say nothing in reply but secretly for many month in the interval of he architecture work at he own version and then one day when it be finish invite donatello to dinner stop at the mercato vecchio to get some egg and other thing these he give donatello to carry and send he on before he to the studio where the crucifix be stand unveil when brunelleschus arrive he find the egg scatter and break on the floor and donatello before he carve in a ecstasy of admiration but what be we go to have for dinner the host inquire dinner say donatello i have have all the dinner i require to thee it be give to carve christ : to I only peasant no one should forget this pretty story either here or at s marium novellum where brunelleschus 's crucifix now be the flexible siena iron grille of this end chapel date from 1335 note its ivy border on enter the left aisle we find the tomb of cherubinus the composer raphael morghen the engraver and that curious example of the florentine universalist whose figure we see under the uffizus leon battista albertus -lrb- 1405-1472 -rrb- architect painter author mathematician scholar conversationalist aristocrat and friend of prince he chief work in florence be the rucellaus palace and the façade of s marium novellum but he be greater as a influence than creator and he manual on architecture painting and the study of perspective help to bring the art to perfection it be at riminus that he be perhaps most wonderful lorenzo de ' medici greatly value he society and he be a leader in the platonic academy but the most human achievement to he credit be he powerful plea for use the vernacular in literature rather than conceal one 's best thought as be fashionable before he protest in latin so much for albertus 's intellectual side physically he be remarkable too and one of he accomplishment be to jump over a man standing upright while he be also able to throw a coin on to the highest tower even i suppose the campanile and ride any horse however wild at the bargello may be see albertus 's portrait on a medal design by pisanello the old medal be indeed the best authority for the lineament of the great man of the renaissance better far than paint at south kensington thousand may be see either in the original or in reproduction in the right aisle we see bernardo rossellino 's tomb of leonardo brunus in the left be that of brunus 's successor as secretary of state carlo marsuppinus by desiderio da settignano which be high among the most beautiful monument that exist faine faine say alfred branconus with he black eye dim and this though he have see it every day for year and explain its beauty in the same word everything about it be beautiful as the photograph which i give in this volume will help the reader to believe : proportion figure and tracery but i still consider mino 's monument to ugo in the badium the finest florentine example of the gentler memorial style as contrast with the severe michelangelesque manner mino it must be remember be desiderio 's pupil as desiderio be donatello 's note how desiderio by a inspiration open the leaf-work at each side of the sarcophagus and instantly the great solid mass of marble become light almost buoyant never can a few stroke of the chisel have have so transform a effect there be some doubt as to whether the boy be just where the sculptor set they and the upper one with they garland be think to be a later addition but we be never likely to know the return visitor from florence will like to be remind that as of so many other of the best florentine sculpture there be a cast of this at south kensington the last tomb of the highest importance in the church be that of galileo the astronomer who die in 1642 but it be not interesting as a work of art in the center of the church be a floor-tomb by ghibertus with a bronze figure of a famous franciscan francesco sansonus da brescium next the sacristy italian priest apparently have no resentment against inquisitive foreigner who be lead into they dressing-room while sumptuous and significant vestment be be don but i must confess to feel it for they and if my impression of the s croce sacristy be meager and confuse it be because of a certain delicacy that i experience in intrude upon they rite for on both occasion when i visit the sacristy there be several priest either robing or disrobe apart from a natural disinclination to invade privacy i be so poor a roman catholic as to be in some doubt as to whether one have a right to be so near such a mystery at all but i recollect that in this sacristy be treasure of wood and iron -- the most beautiful intarsium wainscotting i ever see by giovannus di michele with a frieze of wolf and foliage and fourteenth-century iron gate to the little chapel pure gothic in design with a little rise window at the top delicate beyond word : all which thing once again turn the thought to this wonderful italy of the fourteenth and fifteenth century when not even the best be good enough for those who build church but something miraculous be demand from every craftsman at the end of the passage in which the sacristy be situate be the exquisite little cappellum medicus which michelozzo the architect of s marco and the palazzo medicus and for a while donatello 's partner build for he friend cosimo de ' medicus who though a dominican in he cell at s marco be a franciscan here but by be equally a patron dissociate himself from partisanship three treasure in particular do this little temple hold : giotto 's coronation of the virgin the della robbia altar relief and mino da fiesole 's tabernacle giotto 's picture which be sign once stand as altar-piece in the baroncellus chapel of the church proper in addition to the beautiful dellum robbium altar-piece so happy and holy -- which alfr branconus boldly call luca -- there be over the door christ between two angel a lovely example of the same art for a subtler more modern and less religious mind we have but to turn to the tabernacle by mino every inch of which be exquisite on the same wall be a curious thing in the eighteen-sixty die a signor lombardus who own certain relief which he believe to be donatello 's when he monument be make these ancient work be build into they and here and there gilded -lrb- for it be a wicked world and there be no taste at that time -rrb- one 's impulse be not to look at this encroach piece of novelty at all but one should resist that feeling because on examination the madonna and child above signor lombardus 's head become exceedingly interesting she hand be the work of a great artist and they be really hold the child why this should not be a early donatello i do not see the cloister of s croce be enter from the piazza just to the right of the church : the first a little ornate by arnolfo and the second until recently use as a barracks but now be restore to a more pacific end by brunelleschus and among the most perfect of he work brunelleschus be also the designer of the pazzus chapel in the first cloister the severity of the façade be delightfully softened and enliven by a frieze of mischievous cherub ' head the joint work of donatello and desiderio donatello 's be on the right and one see at once that he be the bolder stronger hand look particularly at the laughing head fourth from the right but that one of desiderio 's over the middle column have much charm and power the door from brunelleschus 's own hand in a doorway perfect in scale be noble and worthy the chapel itself i find too severe and a little fret by its dellum robbia and the multiplicity of circle it be call brunelleschus 's masterpiece but i prefer both the badium of fiesole and the old sacristy at s lorenzo and i remember with more pleasure the beautiful doorway lead from the arnolfo cloister to the brunelleschus cloister which probably be he too the dellum robbium relief once one can forgive they for be here be worth study nothing could be more charming -lrb- or less conducive to a methodical literary morning -rrb- than the angel who hold s matthew 's ink-pot but i think my favorite of all be the pensive apostle who lean he cheek on he hand and he elbow on he book this figure alone prove what a sculptor luca be apart altogether from the charm of he mind and the fascination of he chosen medium this chapel be once the scene of a gruesome ceremony old jacopo pazzi the head of the family at the time of the pazzus conspiracy against the medicus after be hang from a window of the palazzo vecchio be bury here some short while afterwards florence be inundate by rain to such a extent that the vengeance of god be infer and cast about for a reason the florentine decide that it be because jacopo have be allow to rest in sacred soil a mob therefore rush to s croce break open he tomb and drag he body through the street stop on they way at the pazzus palace to knock on the door with he skull he be then throw into the swollen arno and bear away by the tide in the old refectory of the convent be now a number of picture and fragment of sculpture the last supper by taddeo gaddus on the wall be notable for depict juda who have no shrift at the hand of the painter without a halo castagno and ghirlandaio as we shall see under similar circumstance place he on the wrong side of the table in either case but particularly perhaps in taddeo 's picture the answer to christ 's question which leonardo at milan make so dramatic be a foregone conclusion the crucifixion on the end wall at the left be interesting as have be paint for the porta s gallo -lrb- in the piazza cavor -rrb- and remove here all the gate of florence have religious fresco in they some of which still remain the great bronze bishop be say to be by donatello and to have be mean for or san michele but one do not much mind one find occasion to say so many hard thing of the florentine disregard of ancient art that it be peculiarly a pleasure to see the progress that be be make in restore brunelleschus 's perfect cloister at s croce to they original form when they be turn into barracks the loggia be wall in all round and make into a series of room these wall be now gradually come away the lovely pillar be again isolate the chimney remove and everything lightly wash grass have also be sow in the great central square the crumble of the decorative medal in the spandrel of the cloister can not of course be restore but one do not complain of such natural decay as that chapter xvi the accademia michelangelo -- the david -- the tomb of julius -- a contrast -- fra angelico -- the beatific painter -- cimabue and giotto -- masaccio -- gentile da fabriano -- domenico ghirlandaio -- fra angelico again -- fra bartolommeo -- perugino -- botticellus -- the primavera -- leonardo da vincus and verrocchio -- botticellus 's sacred picture -- botticinus -- tapestry of eden the accademia delle belle arti be in the via ricasolus that street which see from the top of the campanile be the straightest thing in florence run like a rule line from the duomo to the valley of the mugnone upstairs be modern painter : but upstairs i have never be it be the ground-floor room that be so memorable contain as they do a small but very choice collection of picture illustrate the growth of italian art with particular emphasis on florentine art the best assemblage of the work of fra angelico that exist and a large gallery give up to michelangelo 's sculpture : original and cast the principal magnet that draw people here no doubt be the fra angelico and botticellus 's primavera but in five at least of the room there be not a uninteresting picture while the collection be so small that one can study it without fatigue -- no little matter after the crowded uffizus and pittus it be a simple matter to choose in such a book as this the best place in which to tell something of the life-story of say giotto and brunelleschus and the della robbias for at a certain point they genius be find concentrated -- donatello 's and the della robbias ' in the bargello and those other at the duomo and campanile but with michelangelo it be different he be so distribute over the city -- he gigantic david here the medicus tomb at s lorenzo he fortification at s miniato he tomb at s croce while there remain he house as a natural focus of all he activity i have however choose the medicus chapel as the spot best suit for he biography and therefore will here dwell only on the original that be preserve about the david the david himself superb and confident be the first thing you see in enter the door of the gallery he stand at the end white and glorious with he eye steadfastly measure he antagonist and calculate upon what will be he next move if the sling misdirect the stone of the objection to the statue as be not representative of the biblical figure i have say something in the chapter on the bargello where several david come under review yet after all that can be say against its dramatic fitness the statue remain a impressive and majestic yet strangely human thing there it be -- a sign of what a little italian sculptor with a broken nose could fashion with he mallet and chisel from a mass of marble four hundred and more year ago its history be curious in 1501 when michelangelo be twenty-six and have just return to florence from rome with a great reputation as a sculptor the joint authority of the cathedral and the arte della lana offer he a huge block of marble that have be in they possession for thirty-five year have be work upon clumsily by a sculptor name baccellino and then set aside michelangelo be tell that if he accept it he must carve from it a david and have it do in two year he begin in September 1501 and finish in January 1504 and a committee be appoint to decide upon its position among they be leonardo da vincus perugino lorenzo di credi filippino lippus botticellus and andrea della robbia there be three suggest site : the loggia de ' lanzi the courtyard of the palazzo vecchio where verrocchio 's little boudoir david then stand -lrb- now in the bargello -rrb- and where he cupid and dolphin now be and the place where it now stand then occupy by donatello 's judith and holoferne this last be finally select not by the committee but by the determination of michelangelo himself and judith and holoferne be move to the loggia de ' lanzus to they present position the david be set up in may 1504 and remain there for three hundred and sixty-nine year suffer no harm from the weather but have a arm break in the medicus riot in 1527 in 1878 however it be decide that further exposure might be injurious and so the statue be move here to its frigid niche and a replica in marble afterwards set up in its place since this glorious figure be to be see thrice in florence he may be say to have become the second symbol of the city next the fleur-de-lis the tribuna del david as the michelangelo salon be call have among other original several figure intend for that tomb of pope julius ii -lrb- whose portrait by raphael we have see at the uffizus -rrb- which be to be the eighth wonder of the world and by which the last year of the sculptor 's life be render so unhappy the story be a miserable one of the various component part of the tomb finish or unfinished the best know be the mose at s pietro in vincolus at rome reproduce in plaster here in the accademia beneath the bronze head of its author various other part be in rome too other here one or two may be at the bargello -lrb- although some authority give these suppose michelangelo to vincenzo dantus -rrb- other be in the grotto of the boboli garden and the louvre have what be in some respects the finest of the prisoner the first statue on the right of the entrance of the tribuna del david be a group call genio vittorioso here in the old man we see rock actually turn to life in the various prisoner near we see life emerge from rock in the david we forget the rock altogether one wonder how michelangelo go to work do the shape of the block of marble influence he or do he with he mind 's eye the röntgen ray of genius see the figure within it embed in the midst and hew and chip until it disclose on the back of the fourth statue on the leave a monkish face have be incise : probably some visitor to the studio after look at these original and cast and remember those other michelangelo sculpture elsewhere in florence -- the tomb of the medicus the brutus and the smaller david -- turn to the bronze head over the cast of mose and reflect upon the author of it all : the profoundly sorrowful eye behind which so much power and ambition and disappointment dwell it be peculiarly interesting to walk out of the michelangelo gallery into the little room contain the fra angelico : to pass from a great melancholy saturnine sculptor the victim of the caprice of prince temporal and spiritual he eye trouble with world knowledge and world weariness to the child-like celebrant of the joy of simple faith who paint these gay and happy picture fra angelico -- the sweetest of all the florentine painter -- be a monk of fiesole whose real name be guido petrus da mugello but become a dominican he call himself giovannus and now through the sanctity and happiness of he brush be for all time beato angelico he be bear in 1390 nearly sixty year after giotto 's death when chaucer be fifty and richard ii on the english throne he early year be spend in exile from fiesole the brother have come into difficulty with the archbishop but by 1418 he be again at fiesole and when in 1436 cosimo de ' medici return from exile at venice set he friend michelozzo upon build the convent of s marco fra angelico be fetch from fiesole to decorate the wall there and here in the accademia be he chief work assemble but he work also at fiesole at cortona and at rome where he paint fresco in the chapel of nichola v in the vatican and where he die aged sixty-eight and be bury it be while at rome that the pope offer he the priorship of s marco which he decline as be unworthy but recommend antonio the good archbishop -- that practically be he whole life as to he character let vasarus tell we he would often say that whosoever practice art need a quiet life and freedom from care and he who occupy himself with the thing of christ ought always to be with christ some say that fra giovannus never take up he brush without first make a prayer he never make a crucifix when the tear do not course down he cheek the one curious thing -- to I -- about fra angelico be that he have not be canonize if ever a son of the church toil for she honor and for the happiness of mankind it be he there be example of fra angelico 's work elsewhere in florence the large picture in room i of this gallery the large altar-piece at the uffizus with certain other the series of mural painting in the cell of s marco and he picture will be find not only elsewhere in florence and italy but in the chief gallery of the world for he be very assiduous we have a excellent example at the national gallery no 663 but this little room give we the artist and rhapsodist most completely in look at he picture three thing in particular strike the mind : the skill with which he compose they he mastery of light and -- and here he be unique -- the pleasure he must have have in paint they all seem to have be play he enjoy the toil exactly as a child enjoy the labor of build a house with toy brick nor one feel could he be depress even in he crucifixion there be a certain underlie happiness due to he knowledge that the crucify be to rise again and ascend to heaven and enjoy eternal felicity know this -lrb- as he do know it -rrb- how could he be wholly cast down you see it again in the flagellation of christ in the series of six scene -lrb- no 237 -rrb- the scourging be almost a festival but best of all i like the flight into egypt in no 235 everything here be joyous and -lrb- in spite of the terrible cause of the journey -rrb- bath in the sunny light of the age of innocence : the landscape joseph younger than usual brave and resolute and undismayed by the curious turn in he fortune and mary with the child in she arm happy and pretty seat securely on a amiable donkey that have neither bit nor bridle it be when one look at fra angelico that one understand how wise be the old master to seek they inspiration in the life of christ one can not imagine fra angelico 's existence in a pagan country look in no 236 at the six radiant and rapturous angel clustering above the manger be there ever anything prettier but i be not sure that i do not most covet no 250 christ crucify and two saint and no 251 the coronation of the virgin for they beauty of light in the photograph no 246 -- a deposition -- be unusually striking but in the original although beautiful it be far less radiant than usual with this painter it have however such feeling as to make it especially memorable among the many treatment of this subject what be generally consider the most important work in this room be the last judgment which be certainly extraordinarily interesting and in the hierarchy of heaven and the company of the blest fra angelico be in a very acceptable mood the benignant christ who divide the sheep and the goat the healthy ripe-lipped saint and father who assist at the tribunal and have never a line of age or experience on they bloom cheek the monk and nun just rise from they grave who embrace each other in the mead of paradise with such fervor -- these have much of the charm of little flower but in delineate the damned the painter be in strange country it be a subject of which he know nothing and the introduction among they of monk of the rival order of s franci be mere party politics and a blot there be two other room here but fra angelico spoil we for they four panel by another frate but less radiant lippo lippus be remarkable particularly the figure of the virgin in the annunciation and there be a curious series of scene entitle l'albero dellum croce by a ignoto of the fourteenth century with a christ crucify in the midst and all scripture in medallion around he the tragedy of adam and eve at the foot -lrb- mutilate by some chaste pedant -rrb- be very quaint and in angelico 's room there be a little modest annunciation by one of he school -- no 256 -- which show what a good influence he be and to which the eye return and return here also on easel be two portrait of vallombrosan monk by fra bartolommeo serene and very sympathetically paint which cause one to regret the deterioration in italian ecclesiastic physiognomy and andrea del sarto 's two pretty angel which one so often find in reproduction be here too let we now enter the first room of the collection proper and begin at the very beginning of tuscan art for this collection be historical and not fortuitous like that of the pittus the student may here trace the progress of tuscan painting from the level to the highest peak and downward again the accademia be establish with this purpose by that enlighten prince peter leopold grand duke of tuscany in 1784 other picture not wholly within he scheme have be add since together with the michelangelo statue and cast but they do not impair the original idea for the serious student the first room be of far the most importance for there he may begin with cimabue -lrb- 1240 - 1302 -rrb- and giotto -lrb- 1267 - 1337 -rrb- and pass steadily to luca signorellus -lrb- 1450-1523 -rrb- for the most part the picture in this room appeal to the inquirer rather than the sightseer but there be not one that be without interest while three work of extraordinary charm have thoughtfully be enisle on screen for special attention -- a fra angelico a fabriano and a ghirlandaio before reach these let we look at the wall the first large picture on the leave the cimabue mark the transition from byzantine art to italian art giovannus cimabue who be to be the forerunner of the new art be bear about 1240 at that time there be plenty of painting in italy but it be greek the work of artist at constantinople -lrb- byzantium -rrb- the center of christianity in the eastern half of the roman empire and the fount of ecclesiastical energy and it be crude workmanship exist purely as a accessory of worship cimabue of whom i may say almost nothing definite be know and upon whom the delightful but casual old vasarus be the earliest authority as dante be he first eulogist carry on the byzantine tradition but breathe a little life into it in he picture here we see he feel he way from the unemotional paint symbol of the faith to humanity itself one can understand this large panel be carry -lrb- as we know the similar one at s marium novellum be -rrb- in procession and worship but it be nearer to the icon of the russian peasant of today than to a raphael the madonna be above life the child be a little man this be paint say in 1280 as a altar-piece for the badium of s trinità at florence next come giotto cimabue 's pupil bear about 1267 whom we have meet already as a architect philosopher and innovator and in the second picture in this room from giotto 's brush we see life really awaken the madonna be vivify the child be nearer childhood we can believe that here be vein with blood in they moreover whereas cimabue 's angel bring masonry these bring flower it be crude no doubt but it be enough the new art which be to counterfeit and even extend nature have really begin the mystery and glory of painting be assure and the door open for botticellus but much have to happen first particularly the mastery of the law of perspective and it be not -lrb- as we have see -rrb- until ghibertus have get to work on he first door and brunelleschus be study architecture and uccello sit up all night at he desk that painting as we know it -- painting of man and woman in the round -- could be do and it be leave for a youth who be not bear until giotto have be dead sixty-four year to do this first as a master -- one tommaso di ser giovanni guido da castel san giovannus know as masaccio or big tom the three great name then in the evolution of italian painting a subject to which i return in chapter xxv on the carmine be cimabue giotto masaccio we pass on at the accademia from cimabue 's pupil giotto to giotto 's follower taddeo gaddus and bernardo daddus and daddus 's follower spinello aretino and the long dependent and interdependent line of painter for the most part they paint altar-piece these early craftsman the church be the principal patron of art these work be many of they fade and so elementary as to have but a antiquarian interest but think of the excitement in those day when the picture be at last ready and gay in its gold be erect in the chapel among the purely ecclesiastical work no 137 a annunciation by giovannus del biondo -lrb- second half of the fourteenth century -rrb- be light and cheerful and no 142 the crowning of the virgin by rosello di jacopo franchus -lrb- 1376-1456 -rrb- have some delightful detail and be everywhere joyous with a charming green pattern in it the wedding scene in no 147 give we florentine life on the mundane side with some valuable thoroughness and the pietro lorenzettus above -- scene in the life of s umilita -- be very quaint and cheery and be paint as early as 1316 the little virgin adoring no 160 in the corner by the fertile ignoto be charmingly pretty and now for the three screen notable among the screen of the gallery of europe as hold three of the happiest picture ever paint the first be the adoration of the magus by gentile da fabriano a artist of whom one see too little he full name be gentile di niccolò di giovannus massus and he be bear at fabriano between 1360 and 1370 some twenty year before fra angelico accord to vasari he be fra angelico 's master but that be now consider doubtful and yet the three little scene from the life of christ in the predellum of this picture be nearer fra angelico in spirit and charm than any not by a follower that i have see gentile do much work at venice before he come to florence in 1422 and this picture which be consider he masterpiece be paint in 1423 for s trinita he die four year later gentile be charming rather than great and to this work might be apply ruskin 's sarcastic description of poor ghirlandaio 's fresco that they be mere goldsmith 's work and yet it be much more for it have gaiety and sweetness and the nice thoughtfulness that make the child a real child interested like a child in the bald head of the kneel mage while the predellum be not to be excel in its modest tender beauty by any in florence and predella i may remark again should never be overlook strong as the tendency be to miss they many a painter have fail in the large space or make only a perfunctory success but in the small have achieve real feeling gentile 's holy family on its way to egypt be never to be forget not so radiant as fra angelico 's in the room we have visit out of due course but as charming in its own manner -- both in personage and landscape while the city to which joseph lead the donkey -lrb- again without rein -rrb- be the most perfect thing out of fairyland ghirlandaio 's picture which be the neighbor of gentile 's be as a whole nearer life and one of he most attractive work it be i think excel only by he very similar adoration of the magus at the spedale deglus innocentus which however it be difficult to see and it be far beyond the example at the uffizus which be too hot of the life of this artist who be michelangelo 's master i shall speak in the chapter on s marium novellum this picture which represent the adoration of the shepherd be paint in 1485 when the artist be thirty-six it be essentially pleasant : a religious picture on the sunny side the child be the soul of babyish content equally amuse with its thumb and the homage it be receive close by be a goldfinch unafraid in the distance be a city valley with a river wind in it and down a neighbouring hill on the top of which the shepherd feed they flock come the impose procession of the magus joseph be more than commonly perplexed and the disparity between he own and he wife 's age which the old master agree to make considerable be more considerable than usual both gentile and ghirlandaio choose a happy subject and make it happier fra angelico -lrb- for the third screen picture -rrb- choose a melancholy subject and make it happy not because that be he intention but because he could not help it he have only one set of color and one set of countenance and since the color be of the gayest and the countenance of the serenest the result be bind to be peaceful and glad this picture be a large deposizione dellum croce a altar-piece for s trinità there be such joy in the painting and light in the sky that a child would clap he hand at it all and not least at the vermilion of the redeemer 's blood fra angelico give think to every touch : and he beatific holiness flood the work each of these three great picture i may add have its original frame the room which lead from this one be much less valuable but fra bartolommeo 's vision of s bernard have lately be bring to a easel here to give it character i find this the frate 's most beautiful work it may have detail that be a little crude and the pointed nose of the virgin be not perhaps in accordance with the best tradition while she be too real for a apparition but the figure of the kneel saint be masterly and the landscape lovely in subject and feeling here too be fra bartolommeo 's portrait of savonarolum in which the reformer be show as personating s peter martyr the picture be not paint from life but from a earlier portrait fra bartolommeo have some reason to know what savonarolum be like for he be he personal friend and a brother in the same convent of s marco a few yard from the accademia across the square he be bear in 1475 and be apprentice to the painter cosimo rossellus but he learn more from study masaccio 's fresco at the carmine and the work of leonardo da vincus it be in 1495 that he come under the influence of savonarolum and he be the first artist to run home and burn he study from the nude in response to the preacher 's denunciation three year later when savonarolum be a object of hatred and the convent of s marco be besiege the artist be with he and he then make a vow that if he live he would join the order and this promise he keep although not until savonarolum have be execute for a while as a monk he lay aside the brush but in 1506 he resume it and paint until he death in 1517 he be bury at s marco in he less regenerate day fra bartolommeo 's greatest friend be the jovial mariotto albertinellus whose rather theatrical annunciation hang between a number of the monk 's other portrait all very interesting of albertinellus i have speak earlier before leave look at the tiny ignoto next the door -- a madonna and child the child eat a pomegranate it be a little picture to steal in the next room be a number of the later and showy painter such as carlo dolcus lorenzo lippus and francesco furinus all bold dash self-satisfied hand in whom -lrb- so near the real thing -rrb- one can take no interest nothing to steal here return through salum prima we come to the sala del perugino and be among the master once more -- riper and richer than most of those we have already see for tuscan art here reach its finest flower perugino be here and botticellus fra bartolommeo and leonardo luca signorellus fra lippo lippus and filippino lippus and here be a masaccio the great perugino assumption have all he mellow sunset calm and never be a landscape more tenderly sympathetic the same painter 's deposition hang next and the custodian bring a magnifying glass that the tear on the magdalen 's cheek may be more closely observe but the third no 53 christ in the garden of gethsemane be finer and here again the landscape and light be perfect for the rest there be a royal academy andrea and a formal ghirlandaio and now we come to botticellus who although less richly represent in number than at the uffizus be for the majority of he admirer more to be seek here by reason of the primavera allegory which be the accademia 's most powerful magnet the botticelli be divide between two room the primavera be in the first the first feeling one have be how much cooler it be here than among the perugino and how much gayer for not only be there the primavera but fra lippo lippus be here too with a company of angel help to crown the virgin and a very sweet almost transparent little madonna adoring -- no 79 -- which one can not forget the primavera be not wear too well : one see that at once be in tempera it can not be clean and a dulness be overlay it but nothing can deprive the figure of spring of she joy and movement a float type of conquer beauty and youth the most wonderful thing about this wonderful picture be that it should have be paint when it be : that suddenly out of a solid phalanx of madonna should have step these radiant creature of the joyous earth earthy and joyful and not only that they should have so surprisingly and suddenly emerge but that after all these year this figure of spring should still be the finest of she kind that be the miracle luca signorellus 's flower at the uffizus remain the best but botticellus 's be very thoughtful and before the grass turn black they must have be very lovely the exquisite drawing of the iris in the right-hand corner can still be trace although the color have go the effect now be rather like a chinese painting for the history of the primavera and its signification one must turn back to chapter x i speak just now of luca 's flower there be other in he picture in this room -- botanist 's flower as distinguish from painter 's flower : the wild strawberry beautifully straggle this picture be one of the most remarkable in all florence to I : a crucifixion to which the perishing of the color have give a effect of extreme delicacy while the group round the cross on the distant mound have a quality for which one usually go to spanish art the magdalen be curiously sulky and human into the skull at the foot of the cross creep a lizard this room have three lippo lippi which be a interesting circumstance when we remember that that dissolute brother be the greatest influence on botticellus the largest be the coronation of the virgin with its many lily -- a picture which one must delight in so happy and crowded be it but which never seem to I quite what it should be the most fascinating part of it be the figure in the two little medallion : two perfect piece of color and design the kneel monk on the right be lippo lippus himself near it be the madonna adoring no 79 of which i have speak with herself so luminous and the background so dark the other -- no 82 -- be less remarkable no 81 above it be by browning 's pacchiorotto -lrb- who work in distemper -rrb- close by be the masaccio which have a deep quiet beauty and beneath it be a richly color predellum by andrea del sarto the work of a few hour i should guess and full of spirit and vigor it consist of four scriptural scene which might be call the direct forerunner of sir john gilbert and the modern illustrator lastly we have what be in many way the most interesting picture in florence -- no 71 the baptism of christ -- for it be hold by some authority to be the only known painting by verrocchio whose sculpture we see in the bargello and at or san michele while in one of the angel -- that surely on the leave -- we be to see the hand of he pupil leonardo da vincus they face be singularly sweet other authority consider not only that verrocchio paint the whole picture himself but that he paint also the annunciation at the uffizus to which leonardo 's name be give be that as it may -- and we shall never know -- this be a beautiful thing accord to vasari it be the excellence of leonardo 's contribution which decide verrocchio to give up the brush among the thought of leonardo be one which come to mind with peculiar force before this work when we know its story : poor be the pupil who do not surpass he master the second salum di botticelli have not the value of the first it have magnificent example of botticellus 's sacred work but the other picture be not the equal of those in the other room chief of the botticelli be no 85 the virgin and child with diver saint in which there be certain annoying and restless element one feel that in the accessory -- the flooring the curtain and gilt -- the painter be waste he time while the child be too big botticellus be seldom too happy with he baby but the face of the saint in green and blue on the left be most exquisitely paint and the virgin have rather less troubled beauty than usual the whole effect be not quite spiritual and the symbolism of the nail and the crown of thorn hold up for the child to see be rather too cruel and obvious i like better the smaller picture with the same title -- no 88 -- in which the saint at each side be wholly beautiful in botticellus 's wistful way and the painting of they head and head-dress be so perfect as to fill one with a kind of despair but take altogether one must consider botticellus 's triumph in the accademia to be pagan rather than sacred no 8 call officially school of verrocchio and by one firm of photographer botticinus and by another botticellus be a fine free thing low in color with a quiet landscape and be altogether a delight it represent tobia and the three angel and raphael move nobly although not with quite such a step as the radiant figure in a somewhat similar picture in we own national gallery -- no 781 -- which once confidently give to verrocchio be now attribute to botticinus while we no 296 which the visitor from florence on return to london should hasten to examine be no longer verrocchio but school of verrocchio when we think of these attribution and then look at no 154 in the accademia -- another tobia and the angel here give to botticinus -- we have a concrete object lesson in the perilous career that await the art expert the other picture here be two sunny panel by ridolfo ghirlandaio high up with nice easy color no 92 a adoration of the shepherd by lorenzo di credi with a good landscape and all very sweet and quiet no 98 a deposition by filippino lippus and perugino in collaboration with very few sign of filippino and no 90 a resurrection by raffaellino del garbo a uncommon painter in florence the whole thing a tour de force but not important and now let we look at the angelico again before leave the accademia for the last time one should glance at the tapestry near the main entrance just for fun that one in which adam name the animal be so delightfully naive that it ought to be reproduce as a nursery wall-paper the creature pass in review in four procession and adam must have have to be uncommonly quick to make up he mind first and then rattle out they resultant name in the time the main procession be that of the larger quadruped head by the unicorn in single glory and the moment choose by the artist be that in which the elephant have just hear he name -lrb- for the first time -rrb- and not altogether like it be turn towards adam in surprised remonstrance the second procession be of reptile lead by the snail the third the smaller quadruped lead by four rat follow desperately close -lrb- but of course under the white flag -rrb- by two cat while the fourth -- all sort and condition of bird -- stream through the air the other in this series be all delightful not the least be that in which god have finish he work take adam 's arm and fly with he over the earth to point out its merit chapter xvii two monastery and a procession the certosa -- a company of uncle -- the cell -- machiavellus -- impruneta -- the della robbias -- pontassieve -- pelago -- milton 's simile -- vallombrosa -- s gualberto -- prato and the lippi -- the grassina albergo -- a american invasion -- the procession of the dead christ -- my loss everyone who merely visit florence hold it a duty to bring home at least one flask of the val d'ema liqueur from the carthusian monastery four or five mile distant from the city not because that fiery distillation be peculiarly attractive but because the vessel which contain it be at once pretty decoration and evidence of travel and culture they can be buy in florence itself it be true -lrb- at a shop at the corner of the via de ' cerretanus close to the baptistery -rrb- but the certosa be far too interesting to miss if one have time to spare from the city 's own treasure the tram start from the mercato nuovo and come along the via dell ' arcivescovado to the baptistery and so to the porta romana and out into the hilly country the ride be dull and rather tiresome for there be much wait at siding but the expedition become attractive immediately the tram be leave there be then a short walk principally up the long narrow approach to the monastery gate outside which when i be there be sit a beggar at a stone table wait for the bowl of soup to which all who ask be entitle pass within the courtyard you ring the bell on the right and enter the wait hall from which in the course of time when a sufficient party have be gather a elderly monk in a white robe lead you away how many monk there may be i can not say but of the few of whom i catch a glimpse all be alike in the possession of white beard and all suggest uncle in fancy dress ours speak good french and be clearly a man of part lull by he soothing description i pass in a kind of dream through this ancient abode of peace the certosa date from 1341 and be build and endow by a wealthy merchant name niccolo acciaiolus after whom the lungarno acciaiolus be name the member of the family be still bury here certain of the tombstone bear date of the present century to-day it be little but a show place the cell of the monk be mostly empty and the sale of the liqueur its principal reason for existence but the monk who be leave take a pride in they church which be attribute to orcagna and its possession among which come first the relief monument of early acciaiolus in the floor of one of the chapel -- the founder 's be perhaps also the work of orcagna while that of he son lorenzo who die in 1353 be attribute by we cicerone to donatello but by other to a unknown hand it be certainly very beautiful these tomb be the very reverse of those which we see in s croce for those bear the obliterate trace of century of footstep so that some be nearly flat with the stone whereas these have be rail off for ever and have lose nothing the other famous certosa tomb be that of cardinal angelo acciaiolus which once give to donatello be now sometimes attribute to giuliano di sangallo and sometimes to he son francesco the certosa have a few good picture but it be as a monastery that it be most interesting : as one of the myriad lonely convent of italy which one see so constantly from the train perch among the apennine and do not expect ever to enter the cloister which surround the garden in the center of which be a well and beneath which be the distillery be very memorable not only for they beauty but for the sixty and more medallion of saint and evangelist all round it by giovannus della robbia here the monk have sun themselves and here be bury these five and a half century one suite of room be show with its own little private garden and no striking discomfort except the hole in the wall by the bed through which the sleeper be awaken from its balcony one see the etna far below and hear the roar of a weir and away in the distance be florence with the duomo and a third of giotto 's campanile visible above the intervene hill have show you all the sight the monk lead you again to the entrance hall and bid you good-bye with murmur of surprise and a hint of reproach on discover a coin in he hand for which however none the less he manage in the recess of he robe to find a place and you be then direct to the room where the liqueur together with sweet and picture post-card be sell by another monk assist by a lay attendant and the visit to the certosa be over the tram that pass the certosa continue to s casciano in the chiantus district -lrb- but much wine be call chiantus that never come from here -rrb- where there be a point of interest in the house to which machiavellus retire in 1512 to give himself to literature and to live that wonderful double life -- a peasant loafer by day in the field and the village inn and at night dress in he noblest clothes the cold sagacious mentor of the ruler of mankind but at s casciano i do not stop and farther still one come to the village of impruneta after climb higher and higher with lovely calm valley on either side color by silver olive grove and vivid wheat and maize and stud with white villa and village and church tower on the road every woman in every doorway plait straw with rapid finger just as if we be in bedfordshire impruneta be famous for its new terra-cotta vessel and its ancient dellum robbia for in the church be some of luca 's most exquisite work -- a altarpiece with a frieze of aerial angel under it and a stately white saint on either side and the loveliest decorate column imaginable while in a adjoining chapel be a christ crucify mourn by the most dignified and melancholy of magdalen andrea della robbia be here too and here also be a richly design cantorium by mino da fiesole the village be not in the regular program of visitor and baedeker ignore it hence perhaps the excitement which a arrival from florence cause for the child turn out in battalion the church be very dirty and so indeed be everything else but no amount of grime can disguise the charm of the cloister the certosa be a mere half-hour from florence impruneta a hour and a half but vallombrosa ask a long day one can go by rail change at sant ' ellero into the expensive rack-and-pinion car which climb through the vineyard to a point near the summit and have since it be open bring to the mountain so many new resident whose little villa cling to the western slope among the lizard and in summer be smitten unbearably by the sun but the best way to visit the monastery and the grove be by road a motor-car no doubt make little of the journey but a carriage and pair such as i charter at florence for forty-five lira have to be away before seven and allow three hour on the top be not back again until the same hour in the evening and this the ancient way with the beat of eight hoof in one 's ear be the right way for several mile the road and the river -- the arno -- run side by side -- and the railway close by too -- through venerable village whose inhabitant derive they living either from the soil or the water and amid vineyard all the time here and there a white villa be see but for the most part this be peasant ' district : one such villa on the leave before pontassieve have about it and on each side of its drive such cypress as one seldom see and only gozzolus or mr sargent could rightly paint each in he own style not far beyond in a scrap of meadow by the road sit a girl knit in the morning sun -- with a placid glance at we as we rattle by and ten hour later when we rattle past again there she still be still knit in the evening sun and again she quiet eye be just raise and drop at pontassieve we stop a while for coffee at a inn at the corner of the square of pollarded lime and while it be prepare watch the little crumble town at work particularly the cooper opposite who be finish a massive cask within whose recess good chiantus be doubtless now mature and then on the white road again to the turn a mile farther on to the leave where one bid the arno farewell till the late afternoon steady climb now and then a turn to the right and we see pelago before we perch on its crag and by and by come to it -- a tiny town with a clean and alluring inn very different from the squalor of pontassieve : famous in art and particularly florentine art as be the birthplace of lorenzo ghibertus who make the baptistery door from pelago the road descend with extreme steepness to a brook in a rocky valley at a bridge over which the real climb begin to go steadily on -lrb- save for another swift drop before tosus -rrb- until vallombrosa be reach wind through wood all the way chiefly chestnut -- those wood which give milton who be here in 1638 he famous simile -lrb- 6 -rrb- the heat be now become intense -lrb- it be mid-september -rrb- and the horse be suffer and most of this last stage be do at walk pace but such be the exhilaration of the air such the delight of the aroma which the breeze continually waft from the wood now sweet now pungent and always refresh that one feel no fatigue even though walk too and so at last the monastery and what be at that moment better than anything lunch the beauty and joy of vallombrosa i may say at once be nature 's not man 's the monastery which be now a government school of forestry be ugly and unkempt the hotel be unattractive the few people one meet want to sell something or take you for a drive but in a instant in any direction one can be in the wood -- and at this level they be pine wood soft underfoot and richly perfumed -- and a quarter of a hour 's walk bring the view it be then that you realize you be on a mountain indeed florence be to the north-west in the long arno valley which be here precipitous and narrow the river be far below -- if you slip you would slide into it -- feed by tumble apennine stream from both wall the top of the mountain be heathery like scotland and open but not long will it be so for everywhere be the fenced parallelogram which indicate that a villa be to be erect nothing however can change the mountain air or the glory of the surround height another view unbroken by villa but include the monastery and the forester ' hotel in the immediate foreground and extend as far as florence itself -lrb- on suitable day -rrb- be obtain from il paradisino a white building on a ledge which one see from the hotel above the monastery but that be not by any mean the top the view cover much of the way by which we come hither of the monastery of vallombrosa we have have foreshadowing in florence we see at the accademia two exquisite portrait by fra bartolommeo of vallombrosan monk we see at the bargello the remains of a wonderful frieze by benedetto da rovezzano for the tomb of the founder of the order s giovannus gualberto we shall see at s miniato scene in the saint 's life on the site of the ancient chapel where the crucifix bent and bless he as the head of the monastery gualberto be famous for the severity and thoroughness of he discipline but though a martinet as a abbot personally he be humble and mild he advice on all kind of matter be say to have be invite even by king and pope he invent the system of lay brother to help with the domestic work of the convent and after a life of holiness which comprise several miracle he die in 1073 and be subsequently canonize the monastery as i have say be now secularize save for the chapel where three resident monk perform service one may wander through its room and see in the refectory beneath portrait of famous brother the table now lay for young forester the museum of forestry be interesting to those interested in museum of forestry it be to the monastery at vallombrosa that the browning travel in 1848 when mr brown be ill but the abbot could not break the rule in regard to woman and after five day they have to return to florence browning use to play the organ in the chapel as it be say milton have do two century earlier at such a height and with only a short season the hotel proprietor must do what they can and price do not rule low a depart american be eye he bill with a rueful glance as we be leave milton have it wrong he say to I -lrb- with the freemasonry of the pluck for i know he not -rrb- what he mean be ` thick as thief ' we return by way of sant ' ellero the gallant horse trot steadily down the hill and then beside the arno once more all the way to florence it chance to be a great day in the city -- September 20th the anniversary of the final defeat of papal temporal power in 1870 -- which we be not sorry to have miss the first tiding come to we from the beautiful tower of the palazzo vecchio which in honor of the occasion have be pick out with fairy lamp among the excursion which i think ought to be make if one be in florence for a justify length of time be a visit to prato this ancient town one should see for several thing : for its age and for its wall for its great piazza -lrb- with a pile of vividly dye yarn in the midst -rrb- surround by arch under which coppersmith hammer all day at shine rotund vessel while they wife plait straw for filippino lippus 's exquisite madonna in a little mural shrine at the narrow end of the piazza which a woman -lrb- fetch by a crowd of ragged boy -rrb- will unlock for threepence and for the cathedral with filippino 's dissolute father 's fresco in it the salome be one of the most interesting pre-botticelli scene in italian art if only it have its color what a wonder of lightness and beauty this still would be but probably most people be attract to prato chiefly by donatello and michelozzo 's outdoor pulpit the frieze of which be a kind of prentice work for the famous cantorium in the museum of the cathedral at florence with just such wanton boy dance round it on good Friday evening in the lovely die April light i pay thirty centime to be take by tram to grassina to see the famous procession of the gesù morto the number of people on the same errand have throw out the tram service we have very long wait while the road be throng with other vehicle and the result be i be tire enough -- have be stand all the way -- when grassina be reach for festival six mile out of florence at seven in the evening disarrange good habit but a few penny spend in the albergo on bread and cheese and wine soon restore I a queer cavern of a place this inn with rough table row and row of wine flask and a open fire behind the bar tend by a old woman from which everything good to eat proceed rapidly without dismay -- roast chicken and fish in particular a strapping girl with high cheek bone and a broad dark comely face wash plate and glass assiduously and two waiter with eye as near together as monkey ' serve the customer with bewildering intelligence it be the sort of inn that in england would throw up its hand if you ask even for cold beef the piazza of grassina which although merely a village be enterprising enough to have a cinematoscope hall be full of stall give chiefly to the preparation and sale of cake like the dutch wafelen and among the stall be conjuror cheap-jack singer and dice thrower while every moment bring its fresh motor-car or carriage load nearly all speak english with a nasal twang meanwhile every one shout the naphtha flare the drum beat the horse champ the street be full too chiefly of peasant but among they myriad resolute american virgin in motor veil whom nothing can ever surprise a few american man sceptical as ever of anything ever happen here and there a diffident englishwoman and englishman more in the background but destine in the end to see all but what i chiefly notice be the native girl with they proud bosom carry high and nothing on they head they at any rate know they own future no rush over the globe for they but the simple natural home life and child in the gloom the younger girl in white muslin be like pretty ghost each follow by a solicitous mother give a touch here and a touch there -- mother who once wear muslin too will wear it no more and be now happy in pride in they daughter and very little girl too -- mere tot -- wear wing who very soon be to join the procession as angel and all the while the darkness be grow and on the hill where the church stand light be begin to move about in that mysterious way which torch have when a procession be be mobilize while all the villa on the hill around have they row of candle and then the shift flame come gradually into a mass and take a steady upward progress and the melancholy strain of a ancient ecclesiastical lamentation reach we listen ear as the light draw nearer i leave the bank where all the mamy and sady with they momma be station and walk down into the river valley to meet the vanguard on the bridge i find a little band of roman soldier on horseback without stirrup and have a few word with one of they as to he anachronistic cigarette and then the first torch arrive carry by proud little boy in red and after the torch the little girl in muslin veil which be however for the most part disarrange for the better recognition of relation and even more perhaps for recognition by relation : and very pretty this recognition be on both side and then the village priest in full canonical look a little self-conscious and after they the dead christ on a litter carry by a dozen contadinus who have a good deal to say to each other as they bear he this be the same dead christ which have be lie in state in the church for the past few day to be worship and kiss by the peasantry i have see a similar image at settignano the day before and have watch how the man take it they begin by stand in group in the piazza gossipping then two or three would break away and make for the church there all among the woman and child half-shyly half-defiantly they peck at the plaster flesh and return to resume the conversation in the piazza with a new serenity and confidence in they heart after the dead christ come a triumphal car of the very little girl with wing signify i know not what but intensely satisfy to the onlooker one little wet-nosed cherub i pat so chubby and innocent she be and heaven send that the impulse profit I this car be draw by a ancient white horse amiable and tractable as a saint but as bewildered as i as to the meaning of the whole strange business after the car of angel a stalwart body of white-vestmented singer sturdy fellow with black moustache who have be all day among the vine or steer placid white ox through the furrow and be now lift they voice in a miserere and after they the paint plaster virgin carry as upright as possible and then more torch and the wail band and after the band another guard of roman soldier such be the grassina procession it pass slowly and solemnly through the town from the hill and up the hill again and not soon shall i forget the mournfulness of the music which nothing of tawdriness in the constituent of the procession itself could rid of impressiveness and beauty one thing be certain -- all procession by day or night should first descend a hill and then ascend one all should walk to melancholy strain indeed a joyful procession become a impossible thought after this and then i sink luxuriously into a corner seat in the wait tram and seek for the return journey 's thirty centime find that during the proceedings my purse have be steal chapter xviii s marco andrea del castagno -- the last supper -- the steal madonna -- fra angelico 's fresco -- little antony -- the good archbishop -- the buonuominus -- savonarolum -- the death of lorenzo the magnificent -- pope alexander vi -- the ordeal by fire -- the execution -- the s marco cell -- the cloister fresco -- ghirlandaio 's last supper -- relic of old florence -- pico and politian -- piero di cosimo -- andrea del sarto from the accademia it be but a step to s marco across the piazza but it be well first to go a little beyond that in order to see a certain painting which both chronologically and as a influence come before a painting that we shall find in the museo s marco we therefore cross the piazza s marco to the via d'arrazzierus which lead into the via 27 aprile -lrb- 7 -rrb- where at a door on the leave mark a be a ancient refectory preserve as a picture gallery : the cenacolo di s apollonium all that be keep sacred of the monastery of s apollonia now a military establishment this room be important to student of art in contain so much work of andrea del castagno -lrb- 1390-1457 -rrb- to whom vasari give so black a character the portrait fresco be from the villa pandolfinus -lrb- previously carduccus -rrb- and among they be boccaccio petrarch and dante -- who be here rather less ascetic than usual -- none of whom the painter could have see there be also a very charming little cupid carry a huge peacock plume but the last supper be the glory of the room this work which belong to the middle of the fifteenth century be interesting as a real effort at psychology leonardo make juda leave he seat to ask if it be he that be mean -- that be the dramatic moment choose by this prince of painter : castagno call attention to juda as a undesirable member of the little band of disciple by place he apart the only one on he side of the table which be avoid the real task since naturally when one of the company be force into so sinister a position the question would be already answer castagno indeed render juda so obviously untrustworthy as to make it a surprise that he ever be admit among the disciple -lrb- or wish to be one -rrb- at all while vasarus blandly suggest that he be the very image of the painter himself other position which later artist convert into a convention may also be note : john for example be recline on the table in a ecstasy of affection and fidelity while the florentine loggia as the scene of the meal be often reproduce later andrea del castagno begin life as a farm lad but be educate as a artist at the cost of one of the less notable medicus he have a vigorous way with he brush as we see here and have see elsewhere in the duomo for example we see he equestrian portrait of niccolò da tolentino a companion to uccello 's hawkwood when the albizzus and peruzzus intrigue which have lead to the banishment of cosimo de ' medicus come to they final frustration with the triumphant return of cosimo it be andrea who be commission by the signorium to paint for the outside of the bargello a picture of the leader of the insurrection upside down vasarus be less to be trust in he date and fact in he memoir of andrea del castagno than anywhere else for he state that he commemorate the failure of the pazzus conspiracy -lrb- which occur twenty year after he death -rrb- and accuse he not only of murder he fellow-painter domenico veneziano but confess to the crime the best answer to which allegation be that domenico survive andrea by four year we may now return to s marco the convent as we now see it be build by michelozzo donatello 's friend and partner and the friend also of cosimo de ' medici at whose cost he work here antonino the saintly head of the monastery have suggest to cosimo that he should apply some of he wealth not always too nicely obtain to the lord cosimo begin literally to squander money on s marco divide he affection between s lorenzo which he complete upon the line lay down by he father and this dominican monastery where he even have a cell reserve for he own use with a bedroom in addition whither he might now and again retire for spiritual refreshment and quiet it be at s marco that cosimo keep the mss which he be constantly collect and which now after curious vicissitude be lodge in michelangelo 's library at s lorenzo and on he death he leave they to the monk cosimo 's librarian be tommaso parenticellus a little busy man who to the general astonishment on the death of eugenius iv become pope and take the name of nichola v he energy as pontiff go rather towards learn and art than anything else : he lay the foundation of the vatican library on the model of cosimo 's and persuade fra angelico to rome to paint vatican fresco the magnet which draw every one who visit florence to s marco be first fra angelico and secondly savonarolum or first savonarolum and secondly fra angelico accord as one be constitute fra angelico at cosimo 's desire and cost come from fiesole to paint here while girolamo savonarolum force to leave ferrara during the war enter these wall in 1482 fra angelico in he single crucifixion picture in the first cloister and in he great scene of the mount of olive in the chapter house show himself less incapable of depict unhappiness than we have yet see he but the most memorable of the ground-floor fresco be the symbol of hospitality over the door of the wayfarer ' room where christ be be welcome by two dominican in the way that dominican -lrb- as contrast with scoundrelly franciscan -rrb- would of course welcome he in this ospizio be three reliquary which fra angelico paint for s marium novellum now preserve here in a glass case they represent the madonna della stella the coronation of the virgin and the adoration of the magus all be in angelico 's happiest manner with plenty of gold and the predellum of the coronation be the prettiest thing possible with its blue saint gather about a blue mary and joseph who bend over the baby the madonna della stella be the picture which be steal in 1911 but quickly recover it be part of the strange complexity of this world that it should equally contain artist such as fra angelico and thief such as those who plan and carry out this robbery : nominally custodian of the museum to repeat one of vasarus 's sentence : some say that he never take up he brush without first make a prayer the peter with he finger to he lip over the sacristy be remind the monk that that room be vow to silence in the chapter house be the large crucifixion by the same gentle hand he greatest work in florence and very fine and true in character beneath it be portrait of seventeen famous dominican with s dominic in the midst note the girl with the scroll in the right -- how gay and light the color upstairs in the cell and pre-eminently in the passage where he best know annunciation be to be see angelico be at he best in each cell be a little fresco remind the brother of the life of christ -- and of those by angelico it may be say that each be as simple as it can be and as sweet : easy line easy color with the very spirit of holiness shine out i think perhaps that the coronation of the virgin in the ninth cell reproduce in this volume be my favorite as it be of many person but the annunciation in the third the two marie at the sepulchre in the eighth and the child in the stable in the fifth be ever memorable too in the cell set apart for cosimo de ' medici no 38 which the official point out be a adoration of the magus paint there at cosimo 's express wish that he might be remind of the humility proper to ruler and here we get one of the infrequent glimpse of this best and wisest of the medicus for a portrait of he adorn it with a wrong death-date on it here also be a sensitive terra-cotta bust of s antonio cosimo 's friend and another pride of the monastery : the monk who be also archbishop of florence until he death and whom we see in stone in a niche under the uffizus he cell be the thirty-first cell opposite the entrance this benign old man who have one of the kindest face of he time which be often introduce into picture be appoint to the see at the suggestion of fra angelico to whom pope eugenius -lrb- who consecrate the new s marco in 1442 and occupy cosimo de ' medicus 's cell on he visit -rrb- have offer it but the painter decline and put forward antonio in he stead antonio pierozzus whose destiny it be to occupy this high post to be a confidant of cosimo de ' medicus and ultimately in 1523 to be enrol among the saint be bear at florence in 1389 accord to butler from the cradle antonino or little antony as the florentine affectionately call he have no inclination but to piety and be a enemy even as a infant both to sloth and to the amusement of child as a schoolboy he only pleasure be to read the life of the saint converse with pious person or to pray when not at home or at school he be in church either kneel or lie prostrate before a crucifix with a perseverance that astonish everybody s dominic himself preach at fiesole make he a dominican he answer to a examination of the whole decree of gratian be the decide cause although little antony be then but sixteen as a priest he be never see at the altar but bath in tear after be prior of a number of convent and a counsellor of much weight in convocation he be make archbishop of florence : but be so anxious to avoid the honor and responsibility that he hide in the island of sardinium on be discover he write a letter pray to be excuse and water it with he tear but at last he consent and be consecrate in 1446 as archbishop he life be a model of simplicity and solicitude he think only of he duty and the well-being of the poor he purse be open to all in need and he often sell he single mule in order to relieve some necessitous person he give up he garden to the growth of vegetable for the poor and keep a ungrateful leper whose sore he dress with he own hand he die in 1459 and be canonize in 1523 he body be still free from corruption in 1559 when it be translate to the chapel in s marco prepare for it by the salviatus but perhaps the good antonino 's finest work be the foundation of a philanthropic society of florentine which still carry on its good work antonino 's sympathy lay in particular with the reduce family of florence and it be to bring help secretly to they -- too proud to beg -- that he call for volunteer the society be know in the city as the buonuominus -lrb- good man -rrb- of s martino the little church close to dante 's house behind the badium : s martin be famous among saint for he impulsive yet wise generosity with he cloak the other and most famous prior of s marco be savonarola girolamo savonarolum be bear of noble family at ferrara in 1452 and after a profound education in which he concentrate chiefly upon religion and philosophy he enter the dominican order at the age of twenty-two he first come to s marco at the age of thirty and preach there in lend in 1482 but without attract much notice when however he return to s marco seven year later it be to be instantly hail both as a powerful preacher and reformer he eloquent and burn declaration be hurl both at florence and rome : at the apathy and greed of the church as a whole and at the sinfulness and luxury of this city while lorenzo the magnificent who be then at the height of he influence surround by accomplished and witty hedonist and happiest when add to he collection of picture jewel and sculpture in particular do the priest rebuke savonarolum stand for the spiritual ideal and asceticism of the baptist christ and s paul lorenzo in he eye make only for sensuality and decadence the two man however recognize each other 's genius and lorenzo with the tolerance which be as much a mark of the first three medicus ruler as its absence be notable in most of the later one rather encourage savonarolum in he crusade than not he visit he in the monastery and do not resent be keep wait and he go to hear he preach in 1492 lorenzo die send for savonarolum on he death-bed which be watch by the two closest of he scholarly friend pico della mirandolum and politian the story of what happen have be variously tell accord to the account of politian lorenzo meet he end with fortitude and savonarolum pray with the die man and give he he blessing accord to another account lorenzo be call upon by savonarolum to make three undertaking before he die and lorenzo decline savonarolum leave he unabsolved these promise be -lrb- 1 -rrb- to repent of all he sin and in particular of the sack of volterra of the alleged theft of public dowry fund and of the implacable punishment of the pazzus conspirator -lrb- 2 -rrb- to restore all property of which he have become possess by unjust means and -lrb- 3 -rrb- to give back to florence she liberty but the probability be in favor of politian 's account be the true one and the later story a political invention lorenzo dead and piero he son so incapable savonarolum come to he own he have long foresee a revolution follow on the death of lorenzo and in one of he most powerful sermon he have suggest that the flagellum dei to punish the wicked florentine might be a foreign invader when therefore in 1493 the french king charle viii arrive in italy with he army savonarolum be recognize not only as a teacher but as a prophet and when the medicus have be again banish and charle have ask too much have retreat from florence the republic be remodel with savonarolum virtually control its great council for a year or two he power be supreme this be the period of the piagnonus or weeper the citizen adopt sober attire a spirit as of england under the puritan prevail and savonarolum 's eloquence so far carry away not only the populace but many person of genius that a bonfire be light in the middle of the piazza della signoria in which costly dress jewel false hair and study from the nude be destroy savonarola meanwhile be not only chastise and reform florence but with fatal audacity be attack with even less mincing of word the licentiousness of the pope as to the character of lorenzo de ' medici there can be two opinion and indeed the historian of florence be widely divide in they estimate but of roderigo borgium -lrb- pope alexander vi -rrb- there be but one and savonarolum hold it savonarolum be excommunicate but refuse to obey the edict pope however although florence have to a large extent put itself out of reach have long arm and gradually -- take advantage of the city 's grow discontent with piety and tear and recur unquiet there be still a strong pro-medici party and building not a little on he knowledge of the florentine love of change -- the pope gather together sufficient supporter of he determination to crush this too outspoken critic and humiliate he fellow-citizen event help the pontiff a pro-medici conspiracy excite the populace a second bonfire of vanity lead to rioting for the florentine be begin to tire of virtue and the preaching of a franciscan monk against savonarolum -lrb- and the gentle fra angelico have show we in the accademia how franciscan and dominican could hate each other -rrb- bring matter to a head for he challenge savaronolum to a ordeal by fire in the loggia de ' lanzus to test which of they speak with the real voice of god a dominican volunteer to make the essay with a franciscan this ceremony anticipate with the liveliest eagerness by the florentine be at the last moment forbid and savonarolum who have to bear the responsibility of such a bitter disappointment to a pleasure-loving people become a unpopular figure everything just then be against he for charle viii with whom he have a understanding and of whom the pope be afraid choose that moment to die the pope drive home he advantage and get more power among individual on the council force they to indict they firebrand no means be spare however base forgery and false witness be as nothing the summons arrive on April 8th 1497 when savonarolum be at s marco the monk who adore he refuse to let he go and for a whole day the convent be under siege but might of course prevail and savonarolum be drag from the church to the palazzo vecchio and prosecute for the offence of claim to have supernatural power and foment political disturbance he be imprison in a tiny cell in the tower for many day and under constant torture he no doubt utter word which would never have pass he lip have he be in control of himself but we may dismiss as false the evidence which make they into confession evidence there have to be and evidence naturally be forthcoming and sentence of death be pass in that cell when not under torture he manage to write meditation on the thirteenth psalm in thee o lord have i hope and a little work entitle a rule for live a christian life before the last day he administer the sacrament to he two companion who be to die with he with perfect composure and the night precede they spend together in prayer in the great hall which he have once dominate the execution be on may 23rd 1498 a gallows be erect in the piazza della signoria on the spot now mark by the bronze tablet beneath the gallows be a bonfire all those member of the government who could endure the scene be present either on the platform of the palazzo vecchio or in the loggia de ' lanzi the crowd fill the piazza the three monk go to they death unafraid when he friar 's gown be take from he savonarolum say : holy gown thou wert grant to I by god 's grace and i have ever keep thee unstained now i forsake thee not but be bereft of thee -lrb- this very garment be in the glass case in savonarolum 's cell at s marco -rrb- the bishop reply hastily : i separate thee from the church militant and triumphant militant reply savonarolum not triumphant for that rest not with you the monk be first hang and then burn the larger picture of the execution which hang in savonarolum 's cell although interesting and up to a point credible be of course not right the square must have be crowd : in fact we know it be the picture have still other claim on the attention for it show the judith and holoferne as the only statue before the palazzo vecchio standing where david now be it show the old ringhiera the marzocco -lrb- very inaccurately draw -rrb- and the loggia de ' lanzus empty of statuary we have in the national gallery a little portrait of savonarolum -- no 1301 -- with another representation of the execution on the back of it so far as i can understand savonarola he failure be due to two cause : firstly he fatal blending of religion and politics and secondly the conviction which he temporary success with the susceptible florentine breed in he heated mind that he be destine to carry all before he totally fail to appreciate the florentine character with all its swift and deadly change and love of change as i see it savonarolum 's special mission at that time be to be a wander preacher spread the light and exciting he listener to spiritual revival in this city and that but never to be in a position of political power and never to become root the peculiar tragedy of he career be that he leave florence no better than he find it : indeed very likely worse for in a reaction from a spiritual revival a lower depth can be reach than if there have be no revival at all while the visit of the french army to italy for which savonarolum take such credit to himself merely end in disaster for italy disease for europe and the spreading of the very renaissance spirit which he have toil to destroy but when all be say as to he tragedy personal and political there remain this magnificent isolate figure single-minded austere and self-sacrificing in a age of indulgence for most people romolum be the medium through which savonarolum be visualize but there he be probably make too theatrical yet he must have have something of the theater in he even to consent to the ordeal by fire that he be a intense visionary be beyond doubt but a very real man too we must believe when we read of the devotion of he monk to he person and of he success for a while with the shrewd worldly great council savonarolum have many staunch friend among the artist we have see lorenzo di credi and fra bartolommeo under he influence after he death fra bartolommeo enter s marco -lrb- he cell be no 34 -rrb- and di credi who be note for he clean living enter s marium nuova two of luca dellum robbium 's nephew be also monk under savonarolum we have see fra bartolommeo 's portrait of savonarolum in the accademia and there be another of he here cronaca who build the great council 's hall survive savonarolum only ten year and during that time all he story be of he michelangelo who be a young man when he hear he preach read he sermon to the end of he long life but upon botticellus he influence be most powerful for he turn that master 's hand from such pagan allegory as the primavera and the birth of venus wholly to religious subject savonarolum have three adjoining cell in the first be a monument to he he portrait by fra bartolommeo and three fresco by the same hand in the next room be the glass case contain he robe he hair shirt and rosary and here also be he desk and some book in the bedroom be a crucifixion by fra angelico on linen no one know savonarolum 's story can remain here unmoved we find fra bartolommeo again with a pencil drawing of s antonio in that saint 's cell here also be antonino 's death-mask the terra-cotta bust of he in cosimo 's cell be the most like life but there be a excellent and vivacious bronze in the right transept of s marium novellum before pass downstairs again the library should be visit that delightful assemblage of gray pillar and arch without its desk and case it would be one of the most beautiful room in florence all the book have go save the illuminated music in the first cloister which be more liveable-in than the ordinary florentine cloister have a great shady tree in the midst with a seat round it and flower be the fra angelico i have mention the other painting be rather theatrical and poor in the refectory be a large scene of the miracle of the providenza when s dominic and he companion during a famine be feed by two angel with bread while at the back s antonio watch the crucified christ the artist be sogliano in addition to fra angelico 's great crucifixion fresco in the chapter house be a single christ crucify with a monk mourning by antonio pollaiuolo very like the fra angelico in the cloister but the color have leave it and what must have be some noble cypress be now ghost dimly visible the frame be superb one other painting we must see -- the last supper of domenico ghirlandaio florence have two last supper by this artist -- one at the ognissantus and this the two work be very similar and have much entertaining interest but the debt which this owe to castagno be very obvious : it be indeed castagno sweeten although psychologically this picture be weak or at any rate not strong it be full of pleasant touch : the supper really be a supper as it too often be not with fruit and dish and a generous number of flask the tablecloth would delight a good housekeeper a cat sit close to juda he only companion a peacock perch in a niche there be flower on the wall and at the back of the charming loggia where the feast be hold be luxuriant tree and fruit and fly bird the monk at food in this small refectory have compensation for they silence in so engage a scene this room also contain a beautiful dellum robbium deposition the little refectory which be at the foot of the stair lead to the cell open on the second cloister and these few visitor ever enter but they be of deep interest to any one with a passion for the florence of the great day for it be here that the municipality preserve the most remarkable relic of building that have have to be destroy it be in fact the museum of the ancient city here for example be that famous figure of abundance in gray stone which donatello make for the old market where the piazza vittorio emmanuele now be in the midst of which she pour forth she fruit from a cornucopia high on a column for all to see opposite be a magnificent doorway design by donatello for the pazzus garden old window chimney-pieces fragment of cornice carve pillar paint beam coat of arm be everywhere in cell no 3 be a pretty little colored relief of the virgin adoring which i covet from a tabernacle in the old piazza di brunelleschi here too be relic of the guild house of some of the smaller artus while perhaps the most humanly interesting thing of all be the great mournful bell of s marco in savonarolum 's time know as la piagnone in the church of s marco lie two of the learn man friend of lorenzo de ' medici whose talk at the medicus table be one of the youthful michelangelo 's educative influence what time he be study in the medici garden close by : angelo poliziano -lrb- 1454-1494 -rrb- the poet and the tutor of the three medicus boy and the marvellous pico dellum mirandolum -lrb- 1463-1494 -rrb- the enchanted scholar pico be one of the most fascinating and comely figure of he time he be bear in 1463 the son of the count of mirandolum and take early to scholarship spending he time among philosophy as other boy among game or s antonio at he devotions but by no means neglect polished life too for we know he to have be handsome accomplished and a knight in the court of venus in 1486 he challenge the whole world to meet he in rome and dispute publicly upon nine hundred theses but so many of they seem likely to be paradox against the true faith too brilliantly defend that the pope forbid the contest pico dabble in the black art write learnedly -lrb- in he room at the badium of fiesole -rrb- on the mosaic law be a amorous poet in italian as well as a serious poet in latin and in everything he do be interesting and curious steep in renaissance culture and inspire by the wish to reconcile the past and the present and humanize christ and the father he find time also to travel much and he give most of he fortune to establish a fund to provide penniless girl with marriage portion he have enough imagination to be the close friend both of lorenzo de ' medicus and savonarolum savonarolum clothe he dead body in dominican robe and make he posthumously one of the order which for some time before he death he have desire to join he die in 1494 at the early age of thirty-one two year after lorenzo angelo poliziano know as politian be also a renaissance scholar and also a friend of lorenzo and he companion with pico at he death-bed but although in precocity brilliancy of gift and literary charm he may be class with pico the comparison there end for he be a gross sensualist of mean exterior and capable of much pettiness he be tutor to lorenzo 's son until they mother interfere hold that he view be far too loose but while in that capacity he teach also michelangelo and put he upon the design of he relief of the battle of the lapitha and centaur at the time of lorenzo and giuliano 's famous tournament in the piazza of s croce poliziano write as i have say the descriptive allegorical poem which give botticellus idea for he birth of venus and primavera he live chiefly by he latin poem but he do much to make the language of tuscany a literary tongue he elegy on the death of lorenzo have real feeling in it and prove he to have esteem that friend and patron like pico he survive lorenzo only two year and he also be bury in dominican robe perhaps the finest feat of poliziano 's life be he action in slam the sacristy door in the face of lorenzo 's pursuer on that fatal day in the duomo when giuliano de ' medicus be stab ghirlandaio 's fresco in s trinità of the grant of the charter to s franci give portrait both of poliziano and lorenzo in the year 1485 lorenzo stand in a little group of four in the right-hand corner hold out he hand towards poliziano who with lorenzo 's son giuliano on he right and follow by two other boy be advance up the step poliziano be see again in a ghirlandaio fresco at s marium novellum from s marco we be go to ss annunzia but first let we just take a few step down the via cavor in order to pass the casino medicus since it be build on the site of the old medicus garden where lorenzo de ' medicus establish bertoldo the sculptor as head of a school of instruction amid those beautiful antique which we have see in the uffizus and where the boy michelangelo be a student a few step farther on the left towards the fiesole height which we can see rise at the end of the street we come at no 69 to a little doorway which lead to a little courtyard -- the chiostro dello scalzo -- decorate with fresco by andrea del sarto and franciabigio and contain the earliest work of both artist the fresco be in monochrome which be very unusual but they interest be not impaired thereby : one do not miss other color no 7 the baptism of christ be the first fresco these two associate ever do and several year elapse between that and the best that be here such as the group represent charity and the figure of faith for the work be long interrupted the boy on the staircase in the fresco which show s john leave he father 's house be very much alive this be by franciabigio as be also s john meeting with christ a very charming scene andrea 's best and latest be the birth of the baptist which have the fine figure of zacharia write in it but what he should be write at that time and place one can not imagine : more reasonably might he be call a physician prepare a prescription on the wall be a terra-cotta bust of s antonio make he much younger than be usual andrea 's suave brush we find all over florence both in fresco and picture and this be a excellent place to say something of the man of whom english people have perhaps a more intimate impression than of any other of the old master by reason largely of browning 's poem and not a little by that beautiful portrait which for so long be erroneously consider to represent the painter himself in we national gallery andrea 's life be not very happy no painter have more honor in he own day and none have a greater number of pupil but these stop with he only a short time owe to the demeanor towards they of andrea 's wife who develop into a flirt and shrew dower with a thousand jealousy andrea the son of a tailor be bear in 1486 and apprentice to a goldsmith show however more draw than design ability he be transfer to a painter name barile and then pass to that curious man of genius who paint the fascinating picture the death of procri which hang near andrea 's portrait in we national gallery -- piero di cosimo piero carry oddity to strange length he live alone in indescribable dirt and live wholly on hard-boiled egg which he cook with he glue by the fifty and eat as he feel inclined he forbid all pruning of tree as a act of insubordination to nature and delighted in rain but cower in terror from thunder and lightning he peer curiously at cloud to find strange shape in they and in he pursuit of the grotesque examine the spittle of sick person on the wall or ground hope for suggestion of monster combat of horse or fantastic landscape but why this should have be think madness in cosimo when leonardo in he direction to artist explicitly advise they to look hard at spotty wall for inspiration i can not say he be also the first to my knowledge to don ear-cap in tedious society -- as herbert spencer later use to do he have many pupil but latterly could not bear they in he presence and be therefore but a indifferent instructor as a deviser of pageant he be more in demand than as a painter but he brush be not idle both london and pari have i think better example of he genius than the uffizus but he be well represent at s spirito piero send andrea to the palazzo vecchio to study the leonardo and michelangelo cartoon and there he meet franciabigio with whom he strike up one of he close friendship and together they take a studio and begin to paint for a live they first work together be the baptism of christ at which we be now look the next commission after the scalzo be to decorate the courtyard of the convent of the servus now know as the church of the annunciation and move into adjacent lodgings andrea meet jacopo sansovino the venetian sculptor whose portrait by bassano be in the uffizus a capable all-round man who have study in rome and be in the way of help the young andrea at all point it be then too that he meet the agreeable and convivial rusticus of whom i have say something in the chapter on the baptistery and quickly become something of a blood -- for by this time the second decade of the sixteenth century the simplicity of the early artist have give place to dash sophistication and the great period be nearly over for this change the brilliant complex inquire mind of leonardo da vincus be largely responsible together with the encouragement and example of lorenzo de ' medicus and such of he culture sceptical friend as albertus pico della mirandolum and poliziano but that be a subject too large for this book enough that a worldly splendor and vivacity have come into artistic life and andrea be a impressionable young man in the midst of it it do not seem to have affect the power and dexterity of he hand but it make he a religious court-painter instead of a religious painter he sweetness and a underlying note of pathos give he work a peculiar and genuine character but he be just not of the greatest not so great really as luca signorellus for example whom few visitor to the gallery rush at with gurgle cry of rapture as they rush at andrea when andrea be twenty-six he marry the lady be the widow of a hatter andrea have long love she but the hatter cling outrageously to life in 1513 however she be free and give she hand to the painter he freedom pass for ever vasarus be among andrea 's pupil may be trust here and vasarus give she a bad character which browning complete andrea paint she often notably in the fresco of the nativity of the virgin to which we shall soon come at the annunzia : a fine statuesque woman by no means unwilling to have the most popular artist in florence as she slave of the rest of andrea 's life i need say little he grow steadily in favor and be always busy he meet michelangelo and admire he and michelangelo warn raphael in rome of a little fellow in florence who would make he sweat browning in he monologue make this remark of michelangelo 's and the comparison between andrea and raphael that follow the kernel of the poem like leonardo and rusticus andrea accept in 1518 a invitation from francis i to visit pari and once there begin to paint for that royal patron but although he wife do not love he she want he back and in the midst of he success he return take with he a large sum of money from franci with which to buy for the king work of art in italy that money he misapply to he own extravagant end and although franci take no punitive step the event can not have improve either andrea 's position or he peace of mind while it cause franci to vow that he have do with florentine andrea die in 1531 of fever nurse by no one for he wife fear it might be the dreaded plague keep away chapter xix the ss annunzia and the spedale deglus innocentus andrea del sarto again -- franciabigio outrage -- alessio baldovinettus -- piero de ' medicus 's church -- a easter Sunday congregation -- andrea 's madonna del sacco -- the statue and the bust -- henrus iv -- the spedale deglus innocentus -- andrea della robbia -- domenico ghirlandaio -- cosimo i and the etruscan -- bronze and tapestry -- perugino 's triptych -- s mary magdalene de ' pazzus -- very sacred human dust from s marco it be a easy step along the via sapienza to the piazza dell ' annunzia where one find the church of that name the palazzo riccardi-mannellus and opposite it gay with the famous dellum robbium relief of swaddled child the spedale deglus innocentus first the church which be notable for possess in its courtyard andrea del sarto 's finest fresco this series of which he be the chief painter with he friend franciabigio again as he principal ally depict scene in the life of the virgin and s filippo the scene of the birth of the virgin have be call the triumph of fresco painting and certainly it be very gay and life-like in that medium the whole picture very charming and easy with the pleasantest coloring imaginable and pretty detail such as the wash of the baby and the boy warm he hand while of the two woman in the foreground that on the left face the spectator be a portrait of andrea 's wife lucrezium in the arrival of the magus we find andrea himself the figure second from the right-hand side point while next to he on the left be he friend jacopo sansovino the dead man restore to life by s filippo be andrea 's next best franciabigio do the scene of the marriage of the virgin which contain another of he well-drawn boy on the step the injury to this fresco -- the disfigurement of mary 's face -- be the work of the painter himself in a rage that the monk should have inspect it before it be ready vasarus be interesting on this work he draw attention to it as illustrate joseph 's great faith in take she he face express as much fear as joy he also say that the blow which the man be give joseph be part of the marriage ceremony at that time in florence franciabigio in spite of he action in the matter of this fresco seem to have be a very sweet-natured man who paint rather to be able to provide for he poor relation than from any stronger inner impulse and when he see some work by raphael give up altogether as verrocchio give up after leonardo mature franciabigio be a few year older than andrea but die at the same age possibly it be through watch he friend 's domestic trouble that he remain single remark that he who take a wife endure strife he most charming work be that madonna of the well in the uffizus which be reproduce in this volume franciabigio 's master be mariotto albertinellus who have learn from cosimo rossellus the teacher of piero di cosimo andrea 's master -- another illustration of the interdependence of florentine artist one of the most attractive work in the courtyard must once have be the adoration of the shepherd by alessio baldovinettus at the left of the entrance to the church it be badly damage and the color have go but one can see that the valley landscape when it be paint be a dream of gaiety and happiness the particular treasure of the church be the extremely ornate chapel of the virgin contain a picture of the virgin display once a year on the feast of the annunciation march 25th in the painting of which the virgin herself take part descend from heaven for that purpose the artist thus divinely assist be pietro cavallini a pupil of giotto the silver shrine for the picture be design by michelozzo and be a beautiful thing before the canopy and all the distressing accessory be add it be make at the order of piero de ' medicus who be as fond of this church as he father cosimo be of s lorenzo michelozzo only design it the sculpture be do by pagno di lapo portigiani whose madonna be over the tomb of pope john by donatello and michelozzo in the baptistery among the altar-piece be two by perugino but of florentine altar-piece one can say little or nothing in a book of reasonable dimension there be so many and they be for the most part so difficult to see now and then one arrest the eye and hold it but for the most part they go unstudied the rotunda of the choir be interesting for here we meet again alberti who complete it from design by michelozzo it do not seem to fit the church from within and even less so from without but it be a fine structure the seventeenth-century painting of the dome be almost impressive but one can forget and forgive all the church 's gaudiness and floridity when the choir be in good voice and the string play palestrina as they do last easter Sunday the annunzia be famous for its music and on the great occasion people crowd there as nowhere else at high mass the singing be fine but the instrumental music finer one be accustom to see vicarious worship in italy but never be there so vicarious a congregation as ours and indeed if it have not be for the sight of the busy celibate at the altar one would not have know that one be worship at all the culmination of detachment come when a family of siamese or burmese child in native dress enter a positive hum go round and not a eye but be fix on the little oriental when however the organ be for a while supersede and the viola and violin quiver under the plangent melody of palestrina we roving attention be fix and hold i be not sure that the andrea in the cloister be not the best of all he work it be very simple and wholly beautiful and in spite of year of ravage the coloring be still wonderful perhaps indeed better for the hand of time it be call the madonna del sacco -lrb- grain sack -rrb- and fill the lunette over the door lead from the church the madonna -- andrea 's favorite type with the eye set widely in the flat brow over the little trustful nose -- have she son older than usual sprawl on she knee she robe be ample and rich a cloak of green be over she pretty head by she sit s joseph on the sack reading with very long sight that be all but one do not forget it for the rest the cloister be a huddle of memorial slab and indifferent fresco in the middle be a well with nice iron work no grass at all the second cloister into which it be not easy to get have a gaunt john the baptist in terra-cotta by michelozzo on leave the church we natural destination be the spedale on the left but one should pause a moment in the doorway of the courtyard -lrb- if the beggar who be always there do not make it too difficult -rrb- to look down the via de ' servus run straight away to the cathedral which with its great red warm dome close the street the statue in the middle of the piazza be that of the grand duke ferdinand by giovannus da bologna cast from metal take from the italian ' ancient enemy the turk while the fountain be by tacca giovannus 's pupil who make the bronze boar at the mercato nuovo the synthetical guide book from which i have already quote warn its reader not to overlook the puzzling bee at the back of ferdinand 's statue try to count they it add -lrb- i accept the challenge and find one hundred and one -rrb- the bee have reference to ferdinand 's emblem -- a swarm of these insect with the word majestate tantum the statue by the way be interesting for two other reason than its subject first it be that to which browning 's poem the statue and the bust refer and which accord to the poet be set here at ferdinand 's command to gaze adoringly for ever at the della robbia bust of the lady whom he love in vain but the bust no longer be visible if ever it be john of douay -lrb- as gian bologna be also call -rrb- -- john of douay shall effect my plan set I on horseback here aloft alive as the crafty sculptor can in the very square i have cross so oft : that man may admire when future sun shall touch the eye to a purpose soft while the mouth and the brow stay brave in bronze -- admire and say when he be alive how he would take he pleasure once the other point of interest be that when maria de ' medici ferdinand 's niece wish to erect a statue of henrus iv -lrb- she late husband -rrb- at the pont neuf in paris she ask to borrow gian bologna but the sculptor be too old to go and therefore only a bronze cast of this same horse be offer in the end tacca complete both statue and henrus iv be set up in 1614 -lrb- after have fall overboard on the voyage from leghorn to havre -rrb- the present statue at the pont neuf be however a modern substitute the façade of the spedale deglus innocentus or child 's hospital when first see by the visitor evoke perhaps the quickest and happiest cry of recognition in all florence by reason of its row of della robbia baby each in its blue circle reproduction of which have go all over the world these be think to be by andrea luca 's nephew and be add long after the building be complete luca probably help he the hospital be begin by brunelleschus at the cost of old giovannus de ' medici cosimo 's father but the guild of the silk weaver for whom luca make the exquisite coat of arm on or san michele take it over and finish it andrea not only model the baby outside but the beautiful annunciation -lrb- of which i give a reproduction in this volume -rrb- in the court : one of he best work the photograph will show how full of pretty thought it be but in color it be more charming still and the green of the lily stalk be not the least delightful circumstance not only among work of sculpture but among annunciation this relief hold a very high place few of the artist devise a scene in which the great news be bring more engagingly in sweeter surroundings or receive more simply the door of the chapel close by lead to another work of art equally adapt to its situation -- ghirlandaio 's adoration of the magus : one of the perfect picture for child we have see ghirlandaio 's adoration of the shepherd at the accademia : this be its own brother it have the sweetest mildest little mother and in addition to the elderly magus two tiny little saintling adore too in the distance be a enchanted landscape about a fairy estuary this hospital be a very busy one and the authority be glad to show it to visitor who really take a interest in such work rich italian carry on a fine rivalry in generosity to such institution bologna for instance could probably give lesson in thoughtful charity to the whole world the building opposite the hospital have a loggia which be notable for a series of four arch like those of the mercato nuovo and in summer for the flower that hang down from the little balcony a pretty building before turn to the right under the last of the arch of the hospital loggia which open on the via della colonna and from the piazza always frame such a charming picture of house and mountain it be well with so much of andrea del sarto 's work warm in one 's memory to take a few step up the via gino capponus -lrb- which also always frame a apennine vista under its arch -rrb- to no 24 and see andrea 's house on the right marked with a tablet in the via della colonna we find at no 26 on the leave the palazzo crocetta which be now a museum of antiquity and for its etruscan exhibit be of the greatest historical value and interest to visitor to tuscany such as ourselves for here you may see what civilization be like century before christ and rome the beginning of the etruscan people be indistinct but about 1000 bc have be agree to as the dawn of they era etrurium comprise tuscany perugium and rome itself florence have no remains but fiesole be a fortified etruscan town and many trace of its original builder may be see there together with etruscan relic in the little museum for the best reconstruction of a etruscan city one must go to volterra where so many of the treasure in the present building be find the etruscan in they heyday be the most powerful people in the world but after the fifth century they supremacy gradually disappear the gaul on the one side and the roman on the other wear they down all we knowledge of they come through the spade excavation at volterra and elsewhere have reveal some thousand of inscription which have be in part decipher but nothing have throw so much light on this accomplished people as they habit of provide the ash of they dead with everything likely to be need for the next world whose requirement fortunately so exactly tally with those of this that a complete system of domestic civilization can be deduce in art and science they be most enviably advance as a visit to the british museum will show in a moment but it be to this florentine museum of antiquity that all student of etrurium must go the garden contain a number of the tomb themselves rebuild and refurnish exactly as they be find while on the ground floor be the amazing collection of article which the tomb yield the grave have preserve they for we not quite so perfectly as the volcanic dust of vesuvius preserve the domestic appliance of pompeius but very nearly so jewel vessel weapon ornament -- many of they of a beauty never since reproduce -- be to be see in profusion now gather together for study only a short distance from the district in which century ago they be make and use for actual life upstairs we find relic of a older civilization still the egyptian and a few room of work of art all find in etruscan soil the property of the pierpont morgan and george salting of that ancient day who have collect they exactly as we do now certain of the statue be world-famous here for example in sala ix be the bronze minerva which be find near arezzo in 1554 by cosimo 's workman here be the chimæra also from arezzo in 1554 which cellinus restore for cosimo and tell we about in he autobiography here be the superb orator from lake trasimene another of cosimo 's discovery in sala x look at the bronze situlum in a isolate glass case of such a peacock blue as only century could give it upstairs in sala xvi be many more greek and roman bronze among which i notice a faun with two pipe as be especially good while the little room lead from it have some fine life-size head include a noble one of a horse and the famous idolino on its elaborate pedestal -- a full-length greek bronze from the earth of pesaro where it be find in 1530 the top floor be give to tapestry and embroidery the collection be vast and comprise much foreign work but cosimo i introduce tapestry weave into florence many of the example come from the city 's loom the finest or at any rate most interesting series be that depict the court of france under catherine de ' medicus with portrait : very sumptuous and gay example of flemish work the trouble at florence be that one want the day to be ten time as long in order that one may see its wonderful possession properly here be this dry-looking archaeological museum with antipathetic custodian at the door who refuse to get change for twenty-lira piece : nothing could be more unpromising than they or they building and yet you find yourself instantly among countless vestige of a past people who have rise to power and crumble again before christ be bear -- but at a time when man be so vastly more sensitive to beauty than he now be that every appliance for daily life be the work of a artist well a collection like this demand day and day of patient examination and one have only a few hour be i joshua -- have i he curious gift -- it be to florence i would straightway fare the sun should stand still there : no rock more motionless continue along the via della colonna we come on the right at no 8 to the convent of s marium maddalena de ' pazzus which be now a barracks but keep sacred one room in which perugino paint a crucifixion he masterpiece in fresco the work be in three panel of which that on the left represent the virgin and s bernard be the most beautiful indeed there be no more beautiful light in any picture we shall see and the virgin 's melancholy face be inexpressibly sweet perugino be best represent at the accademia and there be work of he at the uffizus and pittus and in various florentine church but here he be at he best vasarus tell we that he make much money and be very fond of it also that he like he young wife to wear light head-dress both out of door and in the house and often dress she himself he master be verrocchio and he best pupil raphael s mary magdalene de ' pazzi a member of the same family that plot against the medicus and own the sacred flint be bear in 1566 and say miss dunbar -lrb- 8 -rrb- show extraordinary piety from a very tender age when only a child herself she use to teach small child and she daily carry lunch to the prisoner she real name be catherine but become a nun she call herself mary magdalene in a illness in which she be give up for dead she lay on she bed for forty day during which she see continual vision and then recover like s catherine of bologna she embroider well and paint miraculously and she once heal a leprosy by lick it she die in 1607 the old english cemetery as it be usually call -- the protestant cemetery as it should be call -- be a oval garden of death in the piazza donatello at the end of the via di pinti and the via alfierus rise up from the boulevard that surround the northern half of florence -lrb- the new protestant cemetery be outside the city on the road to the certosa -rrb- i notice as i walk beneath the cypress the grave of arthur hugh clough the poet of dipsychus who die here in florence on November 13th 1861 of walter savage landor that old lion -lrb- bear January 30th 1775 die September 17th 1864 -rrb- of whom i shall say much more in a later chapter of he son arnold who be bear in 1818 and die in 1871 and of mr holman hunt who die in 1866 but the most famous grave be that of elizabeth barrett browning who lie beneath a massive tomb that bear only the initial ebb and the date 1861 italy write jame thomson the poet of the city of dreadful night on hearing of mr brown 's death italy you hold in trust very sacred human dust chapter xx the cascine and the arno florence 's bois de boulogne -- shelley -- the race -- the game of pallone -- ss ognissantus -- botticellus and ghirlandaio -- amerigo vespuccus -- the platonic academy 's garden -- albertus 's palazzo rucellaus -- melancholy decay -- two smile boy -- the corsinus palace -- the trinità bridge -- the borgo san jacopo from the back -- home fishing -- ss apostolus -- a sensitive river -- the ponte vecchio -- the goldsmith -- s stefano the cascine be the boi of florence but it do not compare with the parisian expanse either in size or attraction here the wealthy florentine drive the middle class saunter and ride bicycle the poor enjoy picnic and the english take country walk the further one go the better it be and the better also the river which at the very end of the wood become such a stream as the pleinairiste love with pollarded tree on either side among the tree of one of these wood nearly a hundred year ago a walk englishman name percy bysshe shelley write he ode to the west wind the cascine be a boi also in have a race-course in it -- a small course with everything about it on a little scale grandstand bet box and all and why not -- for after all florence be quite small in size however remarkable in character here funny little race-meeting be hold begin on easter Monday and continue at interval until the weather get too hot the florentine pour out in they hundred and lie about in the long grass among the wild flower and in they fives and ten back they fancy the system be the pari-mutuel and here one seem to be more at its mercy even than in france the odds keep distressingly low but no one seem to be either elated or depressed whatever happen to be at the race be the thing -- to walk about and watch the people and enjoy the air it be the most orderly frugal scene and the baleful and mysterious power of the racehorse to poison life and landscape as in england do not exist here to the cascine also in the spring and autumn several hundred florentine man come every afternoon to see the game of pallone and risk a few lira on they favorite player mr ruskin whose morning in florence be still the textbook of the devout be severe enough upon those visitor who even find it in they heart to shop and gossip in the city of giotto what then would he have say of one who have spend not a few afternoon hour between five and six in watch the game of pallone i would not call pallone a good game compare with tennis it be nothing compare with lawn tennis it be poor compare with football it be anaemic yet in a italian city after the gallery have close on a warm afternoon it will do and it will more than do as afford a opportunity of see muscular italian athlete in the pink of condition the game be play by six three each side : a battitore who smite the ball which be serve to he very much as in rounders the spallum who play back and the terzino who play forward the court be sixty or more yard long on one side be a very high wall and on the other and at each end net the implement be the ball which be hollow and of leather about half the size of a football and a cylinder stud with spike rather like a huge fir-cone or pine-apple which be place over the wrist and forearm to hit the ball with and the game be much as in tennis only there be no central net : merely a line each man 's ambition however be less to defeat the return power of the foe than to paralyse it by hit the ball out of reach it be as though a batsman be out if he fail to hit three wide a good battitore for instance can smite the ball right down the sixty yard into the net above the head of the oppose spallum who stand await it at the far end such a stroke be to the english mind a blot and it be no uncommon thing after each side have have a good rally to see the battitore put every ball into the net in this way and so win the game without he opponent have one return which be the very negation of sport each inning last until one side have gain eight point the point go to whichever player make the successful stroke this mean that the bet -- and of course there be bet -- be upon individual and not upon side the pari-mutuel system be that which be adopt at both the pallone court in florence -lrb- there be another at the piazza beccarium -rrb- and the unit be two lira bet be invite on the winner and the second and place-money be pay on both no wonder then that as the game draw to a close the excitement become intense while during its progress feeling run high too for how can a young florentine who have he money on say gabrus the battitore withhold criticism when gabrus 's arm fail and the ball drop comfortably for the terzino ugo to smash it into gabrus 's net such a lapse should not pass unnoticed nor do it from the cascine we may either return to florence along the bank of the river or cross the river by the vile iron ponte sospeso and enter the city again on the pittus side by the impose porta s frediano suppose that we return by the lungarno amerigo vespuccus there be little to notice beyond costly modern house of a portland place type and the inevitable garibaldus statue until just past the oblique pescaja -lrb- or weir -rrb- we see across the piazza manin the church of all saint -- s salvadore d'ognissantus which must be visit since it be the burial-place of botticellus and amerigo vespucci the chapel of the vespuccus family be paint by ghirlandaio and since here too lie botticellus 's beautiful simonetta who so untimely die accord to vasari the fresco of s jerome by ghirlandaio and s augustine by botticellus be do in competition they be paint as it happen elsewhere but move here without injury i think the s jerome be the more satisfy a benevolent old scientific author -- a lord avebury of the canon -- with he implement about he on a tapestry tablecloth a brass candlestick he cardinal 's hat and a pair of tortoise-shell eyeglass handy s augustine be also scientific astronomical book and instrument surround he too he tablecloth be linen amerigo vespuccus whose statue we see in the uffizus portico colonnade be a florentine by birth who settle in spain and take to exploration he discovery be important but america be not really among they for columbus whom he know and support financially get there first by a mistake in the date in he account of he travels vespuccus 's name come to be give to the new continent and it be then too late to alter it he become a naturalized spaniard and die in 1512 columbus indeed suffer in florence for have it not be for vespuccus america would no doubt be call columbium while brunelleschus anticipate he in the egg trick the church be very proud of possess the robe of s franci which be display once a year on October 4th in the refectory be a last supper by ghirlandaio not quite so good as that which we see at s marco but very similar and like that derive from castagno 's at the cenacolo di sant ' apollonia the predestined juda be once more on the wrong side of the table return to the river bank again we be at once among the hotel and pension which continue cheek by jowl right away to the ponte vecchio and beyond in the piazza goldonus where the ponte carraia spring off several street meet best of they and busiest of they be that via della vigna nuova which one should miss few opportunity of walk along for here be the palazzo -- at no 20 -- which leon battista albertus design for the rucellaus the rucellaus family 's present palace i may say here be in the via della scala and by good fortune i find at the door sun himself a complacent major-domo who the house be empty of its August owner allow I to walk through into the famous garden -- the ortus oricellarus -- where the platonic academy meet for a while in bernardo rucellaus 's day a monument inscribe with they name have be erect among the evergreen afterwards the garden be give by franci i to he beloved bianca capellum its natural beauty be impair by a gigantic statue of polyphemus bigger than any other statue in florence the new rucellaus palace do not compare with the old which be i think the most beautiful of all the private house of the great day and be more easily see too for there be a little piazza in front of it the palace with its lovely design and its pilastered window be now a rookery while various industry thrive beneath it part of the right side have be knock away but even still the proportion be noble this be a bad quarter for vandalism for in the piazza opposite be a most exquisite little loggia build in 1468 the three lovely arch of which have be fill in and now form the window of a english establishment know as the artistic white house a absurd name for if it be really artistic it would open up the arch again the rucellaus chapel behind the palace be in the via della spada and the key must be ask for in the palace stable it be in a shocking state and quite in keep with the tradition of the neighborhood while the old church of s pancrazio its neighbor be now a government tobacco factory the rucellaus chapel contain a model of the holy sepulchre at jerusalem in marble and intarsium by the great albertus -- one of the most jewel-like little building imaginable within it be the faint vestige of a fresco which the stable-boy call a botticellus and indeed the hand and face of the angel such as one can see of they with a farthing dip do not render the suggestion impossible on the altar be a terra-cotta christ which he call a donatello and again he may be right but fury at a condition of thing that can permit such a beautiful place to be so desecrate render it impossible to be properly appreciative since we be here instead of return direct to the river let we go a few yard along this via della spada to the left cross the via de ' fossus and so come to the busy via di pallazzuolo on the left of which past the piazza of s paolino be the little church of s francesco de ' vanchetonus this church be usually lock but the key be next door on the right and it have to be obtain because over the right sacristy door be a boy 's head by rossellino and over the leave a boy 's head by desiderio da settignano and each be joyful and perfect the via de ' fossus will bring we again to the piazza goldonus and the arno and a few yard farther along there be a palace to be see the corsinus the only palazzo still inhabit by its family to which stranger be admit -- the long low white façade with statue on the top and a large courtyard on the lungarno corsinus just after the piazza goldonus it be not very interesting and belong to the wrong period the seventeenth century it be open on fixed day and free save that one manservant receive the visitor and another conduct he from room to room there be many picture but few of outstanding merit and the authorship of some of these have be challenge thus the cartoon of julius ii which be call a raphael and seem to be the sketch for one of the well-known portrait at the pittus uffizus or we national gallery be hold to be not by raphael at all among the pleasantest picture be a lippo lippus madonna and child a filippino lippus madonna and child with angel and a similar group by botticellus but one have a feeling that carlo dolci and guido reni be the true hero of the house guido renus 's lucrezium romana with a dagger which she have already thrust two inch into she bosom as though it be cheese be one of the most foolish picture i ever see the corsinus family have give the world a pope a case of papal vestment be here it be this pope when cardinal corsinus who say to dr johnson 's friend mr piozzus meet he in florence in 1785 well madam you never see one of we red-legged partridge before i believe there may be more beautiful bridge in the world than the trinità but i have see none its curve be so gentle and soft and its three arch so light and graceful that i wonder that whenever new bridge be necessary the authority do not insist upon the trinità be copy the ponte vecchio of course have a separate interest of its own and stand apart like the rialto it be a bridge by chance one might almost say but the trinità be a bridge in intent and supreme at that the most perfect union of two river bank imaginable it show to what depths modern florence can fall -- how little she esteem she past -- that the iron bridge by the cascine should ever have be build the various yellow of florence -- the prevail color -- be spread out nowhere so favourably as on the pittus side of the river between the trinità and the ponte vecchio on the back of the house of the borgo san jacopo and just so must this row have look for four hundred year certain of the occupant of these tenement even on the upper floor have fishing net on pulley which they let down at interval during the day for the minute fish which seem to be as precious to italian fisherman as sparrow and wren to italian gunner the great palace at the trinità end of this stretch of yellow building -- the frescobaldus -- must have be very striking when the loggia be open : the three row of double arch that be now wall in from this point as well as from similar point on the other side of the ponte vecchio one realize the mischief do by cosimo i 's secret passage across it for not only do the passage impose a straight line on a bridge that be never intend to have one but it cut florence in two if it be not for its large central arch one would from the other bridge or the embankment see nothing whatever of the further side of the city but as it be through these arch one have heavenly vignette we leave the river again for a few minute about fifty yard along the lungarno acciaiolus beyond the trinità and turn up a narrow passage to see the little church of ss apostolus where there be a delightful gay ciborium all bright color and happiness attribute to andrea della robbia with pretty cherub and pretty angel and a benignant christ and flower and fruit which can not but chase away gloom and dubiety here also be a fine tomb by the sculptor of the elaborate chimney-piece which we see in the bargello benedetto da rovezzano who also design the church 's very beautiful door whether or not it be true that ss apostolus be build by charlemagne it be certainly very old and architecturally of great interest vasarus say that brunelleschus acquire from it he inspiration for s lorenzo and s spirito to many florentine its principal importance be its custody of the pazzus flint for the igniting of the sacred fire which in turn ignite the famous carro return again to the embankment we be quickly at the ponte vecchio where it be pleasant at all time to loiter and observe both the river and the people while from its central arch one see the mountain from no point be the hill of s miniato and its stately cypress more beautiful but one can not see the church itself -- only the church of s niccolò below it and of course the bronze david in dry weather the arno be green in rainy weather yellow it be so sensitive that one can almost see it respond to the most distant shower but directly the rain fall and it be feed by a thousand apennine torrent it foam past this bridge in fury the ponte vecchio be the work upon a roman foundation of taddeo gaddus giotto 's godson in the middle of the fourteenth century but the shop be of course more recent the passage between the pittus and uffizus be add in 1564 gaddus who be a fresco painter first and architect afterwards be employ because giotto be absent in milan giotto be the first thought of every one in difficulty at that time the need however be press for a flood in 1333 have destroy a large part of the roman bridge gaddus build so well that when two hundred and more year later another flood severely damage three other bridge the ponte vecchio be unharmed none the less it be not gaddus 's bust but cellinus 's that have the post of honor in the center but this be of course because cellinus be a goldsmith and it be to goldsmith that the shop belong once it be the butcher ' quarter i never cross the ponte vecchio and see these artificer in they blouse through the window without wonder if in any of they boy assistant be the michelangelo or orcagna or ghirlandaio or even cellinus of the future since all of those and countless other of the renaissance master begin in precisely this way the odd thing be that one be on the ponte vecchio from either end before one know it to be a bridge at all a street of sudden steepness be what it seem to be not the least charming thing upon it be the mass of groundsel which have establish themselves on the pent roof over the goldsmith ' shop every visitor to florence must have long to occupy one of these little bridge house but i be not aware that any have do so one of the oldest street in florence must be the via girolamus from the ponte vecchio to the uffizus under a arch a turn to the left bring one to the piazza s stefano where the barn-like church of s stefano be enter and close by be the torre de ' girolamus where s zenobius live s stefano although it be now so easily overlook be of importance in its day and it be here that niccolò da uzzano the leader of the noble hold a meeting to devise means of check the grow power of the people early in the fifteenth century and be thwart by old giovannus de ' medicus from that thwart proceed the power of the medicus family and the gloriously endowed florence that we travel to see chapter xxi s marium novellum the great church of florence -- a dominican cathedral -- the decameron begin -- domenico ghirlandaio -- alessio baldovinettus -- the louvre -- the s marium novellum fresco -- giovannus and lorenzo tornabuonus -- ruskin implacable -- cimabue 's madonna -- filippino lippus -- orcagna 's last judgment -- the cloister of florence -- the spanish chapel -- s dominic triumphant -- giotto at he sweetest -- the wanderer 's doom -- the piazza as a arena s marium novellum be usually bracket with s croce as the most interesting florentine church after the duomo but s lorenzo have of course to be reckon with very seriously i think that for interest i should place s marium novellum fifth include also the baptistery before it but architecturally second its interior be second in beauty only to s croce s croce be its immediate religious rival for it be because the dominican have s marium novellum begin in 1278 that several year later the franciscan determine to have a equally important church and build s croce the s marium novellum architect be brother of the order but talentus whom we see at work both on giotto 's tower and on san michele build the campanile and leon battista alberti the marble façade many year later the richest patron of s marium novellum -- correspond to the medicus at s lorenzo and the bardus at s croce -- be the rucellaus whose palace design also by the wonderful versatile albertus we have see the interior of s marium novellum be very fine and spacious and it gather and preserve a exquisite light at all time of the day nowhere in florence be there a finer aisle with the roof spring so nobly and masterfully from the eight column on either side the whole effect like that of s croce be rather northern the result of the yellow and brown hue but whereas s croce have a crush flat roof this one be all soar gladness the finest view of the interior be from the altar step look back to the beautiful circular window over the entrance a mass of happy color in the afternoon the little plain circular window high up in the aisle shoot shaft of golden light upon the yellow wall the high altar of inlaid marble be i think too bright and too large the church be more impressive on good Friday when over this altar be build a calvary with the crucifix on the summit and life-size mourner at its foot while a choir and string orchestra make superbly mournful music i like to think that it be within the older s marium novellum that those seven mirthful young lady of florence remain one morning in 1348 after mass to discuss plan of escape from the city during the plague as here they chat and plot there enter the church three young man and what simpler than to engage they as companion in they retreat especially as all three like all seven of the young woman be accomplish teller of story with no fear whatever of mr grundy and thus the decameron of giovannus boccaccio come about s marium novellum also resemble s croce in its move group of sight-seer each in the hand of a guide these one see always and hear always : so much so that a reminder have be print and set up here and there in this church to the effect that it be primarily the house of god and for worshipper but s marium novellum have not a tithe of s croce 's treasure have almost no tomb of first importance it have to rely upon its interior beauty and upon its fresco and its chief glory whatever mr ruskin who hate they might say be for most people ghirlandaio 's series of scene in the life of the virgin and s john the baptist these cover the wall of the choir and for more than four century have give delight to florentine and foreigner such be the thoroughness of they painter in he color mix -lrb- in which the boy michelangelo assist he -rrb- that although they have sadly dim and require the best morning light they should endure for century longer a reminder not only of the thoughtful sincere interesting art of ghirlandaio and of the pious generosity of the tornabuonus family who give they but also of the costume and carriage of the florentine lady at the end of the fifteenth century when lorenzo the magnificent be in he zenith domenico ghirlandaio may not be quite of the highest rank among the maker of florence but he come very near it and indeed by reason of be michelangelo 's first instructor perhaps should stand amid they but one thing be certain -- that without he florence would be the poorer by many beautiful work he be bear in 1449 twenty-one year after the death of masaccio and three before leonardo twenty-six before michelangelo and thirty-four before raphael he full name be domenico or tommaso di currado di doffo bigordi but he father tommaso bigordus a goldsmith have hit upon a peculiarly attractive way of make garland for the hair be know as ghirlandaio the garland maker and time have efface the bigordus completely the portrait of both tommaso and domenico side by side occur in the fresco represent joachim drive from the temple : domenico who be to be see second from the extreme right a little resemble we charle ii like he father and as we have see like most of the artist of florence he too become a goldsmith and he love of the jewel that goldsmith make may be trace in he picture but at a early age he be send to alessio baldovinettus to learn to be a painter alessio 's work we find all over florence : a last judgment in the accademia for example but that be not a very please thing a madonna enthrone in the uffizus the s miniato fresco the s trinità fresco and that extremely charming although fade work in the outer court of ss annunzia for the most delightful picture from he hand however one have to go to the louvre where there be a madonna and child -lrb- 1300 a -rrb- in the early tuscan room which have a charm not excel by any such group that i know the photographer still call it a piero della francesca and the louvre authority omit to name it at all but it be alessio beyond question next it hang the best ghirlandaio that i know -- the very beautiful visitation and to add to the interest of this room to the return florentine wanderer on the same wall be two far more attractive work by bastiano mainardus -lrb- ghirlandaio 's brother-in-law and assistant at s marium novellum -rrb- than any in florence alessio who be bear in 1427 be a open-handed ingenious man who could not only paint and do mosaic but once make a wonderful clock for lorenzo he experiment with color be disastrous : hence most of he fresco have perish but possibly it be through alessio 's mistake that ghirlandaio acquire the use of such a lasting medium alessio be a independent man who paint from taste and not necessity ghirlandaio 's chief influence however be masaccio at the carmine fra lippo lippus and verrocchio who be think also to have be baldovinettus 's pupil and whose baptism of christ in the accademia paint when ghirlandaio be seventeen must have give ghirlandaio the line for he own treatment of the incident in this church one have also only to compare verrocchio 's sculptured madonna in the bargello with many of ghirlandaio 's to see the influence again both be attract by a similar type of sweet easy-natured girl when he be twenty-six ghirlandaio go to rome to paint the sixtine library and then to san gimignano where he be assist by mainardus who be to remain he most valuable ally in execute the large commission which be to come to he workshop he earliest florentine fresco be those which we shall see at ognissantus the madonna della misericordia and the deposition paint for the vespuccus family and only recently discover together with the s jerome in the church and the last supper in the refectory by this time ghirlandaio and botticellus be in some sort of rivalry although so far as i know friendly enough and both go to rome in 1481 together with perugino piero di cosimo cosimo rossellus luca signorellus and other at the command of pope sixtus iv to decorate the sixtine chapel the excommunication of all florentine which the pope have decree after the failure of the pazzus conspiracy to destroy the medicus -lrb- as we see in chapter ii -rrb- have be remove in order to get these excellent workman to the holy city painting very rapidly the little band have finish they work in six month and ghirlandaio be at home again with such a ambition and industry in he that he once express the wish that every inch of the wall of florence might be cover by he brush -- and in those day florence have wall all round it with twenty-odd tower in addition to the gate he next great fresco be those in the palazzo vecchio and s trinita it be in 1485 that he paint he delightful adoration at the accademia and in 1486 he begin he great series at s marium novellum finish they in 1490 he assistant be he brother david benedetto mainardus who marry ghirlandaio 's sister and certain apprentice among they the youthful michelangelo who come to the studio in 1488 the story of the fresco be this ghirlandaio when in rome have meet giovannus tornabuonus a wealthy merchant whose wife have die in childbirth she death we have already see treat in relief by verrocchio in the bargello ghirlandaio be first ask to beautify in she honor the minerva at rome where she be bury and this he do later when giovannus tornabuonus wish to present s marium novellum with a handsome benefaction he induce the riccus family who own this chapel to allow he to re-decorate it and engage ghirlandaio for the task this mean first cover the fast fading fresco by orcagna which be already there and then painting over they what the orcagna be like we can not know but the substitute although probably it have less of curious genius in it be undoubtedly more attractive to the ordinary observer the right wall as one face the window -lrb- whose richness of color glass although so fine in the church as a whole be here such a privation -rrb- be occupy by scene in the story of the baptist the leave by the life of the virgin the left of the lowest pair on the right wall represent s mary and s elizabeth and in it a party of ghirlandaio 's stately florentine lady watch the greet of the two saint outside florence itself symbolize rather than portray very near the church in which we stand the girl in yellow on the right of the picture with she handkerchief in she hand and wear a rich dress be giovanna deglus albizzus who marry lorenzo tornabuonus at the villa lemmus near florence that villa from which botticellus 's exquisite fresco now in the louvre at the top of the main staircase in which she again be to be see be take she life be a sad one for she husband be one of those who conspire with piero di lorenzo de ' medicus for he return some ten year later and be behead s elizabeth be of course the older woman the companion to this picture represent the angel appear to s zacharia and here again ghirlandaio give we contemporary florentine portrait of distinguished tornabuonus man and certain friend of eminence among they in the little group low down on the leave for example be poliziano and marsilio ficino the platonist above -- but see be begin to be difficult -- the pair of fresco represent on the right the birth of the baptist and on the leave he name the birth scene have much beauty and be as well compose as any and there be a girl in it of superb grace and nobility but the birth scene of the virgin on the opposite wall be perhaps the finer and certainly more easily see in the naming of the child we find medici portrait once more that family be relate to the tornabuonus and mr davy in he book on ghirlandaio offer the interesting suggestion which he support very reasonably that the painter have make the incident refer to the naming of lorenzo de ' medicus 's third son giovannus -lrb- or john -rrb- who afterwards become pope leo x in that case the man on the leave in green with he hand on he hip would be lorenzo himself whom he certainly resemble who the sponsor be be not know the landscape and architecture be alike charming above these we faintly see that strange baptism of christ so curiously like the verrocchio in the accademia and the baptist preach the left wall be perhaps the favorite we begin with joachim be drive from the temple one of the lowest pair and this have a peculiar interest in give we a portrait of the painter and he associate -- the figure on the extreme right be benedetto mainardus then domenico ghirlandaio then he father and lastly he brother david on the opposite side of the picture be the fate lorenzo tornabuonus of whom i have speak above the figure farthest from the edge with he hand on he hip the companion picture be the most popular of all -- the birth of the virgin -- certainly one of the most charming interior in florence here again we have portrait -- no doubt tornabuonus lady -- and much pleasant fancy on the part of the painter who make everything as beautiful as he could totally unmindful of the probability ruskin be angry with he for neglect to show the splashing of the water in the vessel but it would be quite possible for no splashing to be visible especially if the pour have only just begin but for ruskin 's stricture you must go to morning in florence where poor ghirlandaio get a lash for every virtue of giotto next -- above on the leave -- we have the presentation of the virgin and on the right she marriage the presentation be consider by mr davy to be almost wholly the work of ghirlandaio 's assistant while the youthful michelangelo himself have be credit with the half-naked figure on the step although mr davy give it to mainardi mainardus again be probably the author of the companion scene the remain fresco be of less interest and much damaged but in the window wall one should notice the portrait of giovannus tornabuonus and francesca di luca pitti he wife kneel because this giovannus be the donor of the fresco and he sister lucrezium be the wife of piero de ' medicus and therefore the mother of lorenzo the magnificent while francesca tornabuonus the poor lady who die in childbirth be the daughter of that proud florentine who begin the pittus palace but end he life in disgrace and so we leave this beautiful recess where pure religious feeling may perhaps be want but where the best spirit of the renaissance be to be find : everything make for harmony and pleasure and on return to london the visitor should make a point of see the florentine girl by the same hand in we national gallery no 1230 for she be very typical of he genius on the entrance wall of the church be what must once have be a fine masaccio -- the trinity -- but it be in very bad condition while in the cappellum rucellaus in the right transept be what purport to be a cimabue very like the one in the accademia but with a rather more matured child in it vasarus tell we that on its completion this picture be carry in stately procession from the painter 's studio to the church in great rejoicing and blowing of trumpet the populace be move not only by religious ecstasy but by pride in a artist who could make such a beautiful and spacious painting the largest then known vasarus add that when cimabue be at work upon it charle of anjou visit florence be take to he studio to see the wonderful painter and a number of florentine enter too they break out into such rejoicing that the locality be know ever after as borgo allegro or joyful quarter this would be about 1290 there be a certain fitness in cimabue painting this madonna for it be say that he have he education in the convent which stand here before the present church be begin but i should add that of cimabue we know practically nothing and that most of vasarus 's statement have be confute while the painter of the s marium novellum madonna be hold by some authority to be duccio of siena so where be we the little chapel next the choir on the right be that of filippo strozzus the elder who be one of the witness of the pazzus outrage in the duomo in 1478 this be the filippo strozzus who begin the strozzus palace in 1489 father of the filippo strozzus who marry lorenzo de ' medicus 's noble grand-daughter clarice and come to a tragic end under cosimo i old filippo 's tomb here be design by benedetto da maiano who make the famous franciscan pulpit in s croce and be ghirlandaio 's friend and the strozzus palace 's first architect the beautiful circular relief of the virgin and child with a border of rose and fly worship angel all about it behind the altar be benedetto 's too and very lovely and human be both mother and child the fresco in this chapel by filippino lippus be interesting particularly that one on the left depict the resuscitation of drusiana by s john the evangelist at rome in which the group of woman and child on the right with the little dog be full of life and most naturally do above -lrb- but almost impossible to see -rrb- be s john in he cauldron of boiling oil between roman soldier and the denounce emperor under the banner spqr -- a work in which roman local color completely exclude religious feeling opposite below we see s philip exorcise a dragon a very florid scene and above a painfully spirited and realistic representation of the crucifixion the sweetness of the figure of charity and faith in monochrome and gold help with benedetto 's tondo to engentle the air we then come again to the choir with ghirlandaio 's urbane florentine pageant in the guise of sacred history and pass on to the next chapel the cappellum gondus where that crucifix in wood be to be see which brunelleschus carve as a lesson to donatello who receive it like the gentleman he be i have tell the story in chapter xv the left transept end in the chapel of the strozzus family of which filippo be the head in he day and here we find andrea orcagna and he brother 's fresco of heaven the last judgment and hell it be the two orcagna who accord to vasarus have cover the choir with those scene in the life of the virgin which ghirlandaio be allow to paint over and vasarus add that the later artist avail himself of many of the idea of he predecessor this however be not very likely i think except perhaps in choice of subject orcagna like giotto and later michelangelo be a student of dante and the strozzus chapel fresco follow the poet 's description in the last judgment dante himself be to be see among the elect in the attitude of prayer petrarch be with he the sacristy be by talentus -lrb- of the campanile -rrb- and be add in 1350 among its treasure once be the three reliquary paint by fra angelico but they be now at s marco it have still rich vestment fine woodwork and a gay and elaborate lavabo by one of the della robbias with its wealth of ornament and color and its charming madonna and child with angel a little doorway close by use to lead to the cloister and a mercenary sacristan be never far distant only too ready to unlock for a fee what should never have be lock and black with fury if he get nothing but all this have now be do away with and the entrance to the cloister be from the piazza just to the left of the church and there be a turnstile and a fee of fifty centime at s lorenzo the cloister be free at the carmine and the annunzia the cloister be free at s croce the charge be a lira and at s marium novellum half a lira to make a charge for the cloister alone seem to I utterly wicked let the pazzus chapel at s croce and the spanish chapel here have fee if you like but the cloister should be open to all child should be encourage to play there since however s marium novellum impose a fee we must pay it and the new arrangement at any rate carry this advantage with it that one know what one be expect to pay and can count on entrance the cloister be everywhere interesting to loiter in but they chief fame be derive from the spanish chapel which gain that name when in 1566 it be put at the disposal of eleanor of toledo 's suite on the occasion of she marriage to cosimo i nothing spanish about it otherwise both structure and fresco belong to the fourteenth century of these fresco which be of historical and human interest rather than artistically beautiful that one on the right wall as we enter be the most famous it be a pictorial glorification of the dominican order triumphant with a vivid reminder of the origin of the word dominican in the episode of the wolf -lrb- or heretic -rrb- be attack by black and white dog the cane dominus or hound of the lord the morning in florence should here be consult again for ruskin make a very thorough and characteristically decisive analysis of these painting which whether one agree with it or not be profoundly interesting poor old vasarus who so patiently describe they too and name a number of the original of the portrait be now shelve and from both he artist simone martini and taddeo gaddus have the authorship be take by modern expert some one however must have do the work the duomo as represent here be not the duomo of fact which have not then its dome but of anticipation opposite we see a representation of the triumph of the greatest of the dominican after its founder s thoma aquinas the author of the summa theologia who die in 1274 the painter show the angelic doctor enthrone amid saint and patriarch and heavenly attendant while three powerful heretic grovel at he foot and beneath be the science and moral quality and certain distinguished man who serve they conspicuously such as aristotle the logician whom s thomas aquinas edit and cicero the rhetorician in real life aquina be so modest and retire that he would accept no exalted post from the church but remain closeted with he book and scholar and we can conceive what he horror would be could he view this apotheosis on the ceiling be a quaint rendering of the walk on the water s peter 's failure be watch from the ship with the utmost closeness by the other disciple but attract no notice whatever from a angler close by on the shore the chapel be desolate and unkempt and those of we who be not dominican be not sorry to leave it and look for the simple sweetness of the giotto these be to be find with some difficulty on the wall of the niche where the tomb of the marchese ridolfo stand they be certainly very simple and tell and i advise every one to open the morning in florence and learn how the wilful magical pen deal with they but it would be a pity to give up ghirlandaio because giotto be so different as ruskin wish room for both one scene represent the meeting of s joachim and s anna outside a mediaeval city 's wall and it have some pretty giottesque touch such as the man carry dove to the temple and the angel unite the two saint in friendliness and the other be the birth of the virgin which ruskin be so pleased to pit against ghirlandaio 's treatment of the same incident well it be give to some of we to see only what we want to see and be blind to the rest and ruskin be of these the very king i agree with he that ghirlandaio in both he nativity fresco think little of the exhaustion of the mother but it be arguable that two such accouchement might with propriety be treat as abnormal -- as indeed every painter have treat the birth of christ where the virgin fully dress be receive the magus a few moment after ruskin after make he deadly comparison conclude thus genially of the giotto version -- if you can be please with this you can see florence but if not by all means amuse yourself there if you can find it amusing as long as you like you can never see it the s marium novellum habit be one to be quickly contract by the visitor to florence : nearly as important as the s croce habit both church be hospitable and apart from the cloister free and eminently suit for dally in thus differ from the duomo which be dark and s lorenzo where there be payment to be make and attendant to discourage a effort should be make at s marium novellum to get into the old cloister which be very large and indicate what a vast convent it once be but there be no certainty the way be to go through to the palaestra and hope for the best here as i have say in the second chapter be lodge pope eugenius and he suite when they come to the council of florence in 1439 these large and beautiful green cloister be now desert through certain window on the left one may see chemist at work compound drug and perfume after old dominican recipe to be sell at the farmacium in the via della scala close by the great refectory have be turn into a gymnasium the two obelisk support by tortoise and surmount by beautiful lily in the piazza of s marium novellum be use as boundary in the chariot race hold here under cosimo i and in the collection of old florentine print on the top floor of michelangelo 's house you may see representation of these race the charming loggia opposite s marium novellum with dellum robbium decoration be the loggia di s paolo a school design it be think by brunelleschus and here at the right hand end we see s dominic himself in a friendly embrace with s franci a very beautiful group by either luca or andrea della robbia in the loggia cabman now wrangle all day and all night from it s marium novellum be see under the best condition always cheerful and serene while far behind the church be the huge apennine where most of the weather of florence seem to be manufacture in mid April this year -lrb- 1912 -rrb- it still have its cap of snow chapter xxii the piazza vittorio emmanuele to s trinità a city of tram -- the old market -- donatello 's figure of abundance -- a evening resort -- a hall of variety -- florentine of to-day -- the war with turkey -- homecome hero -- restaurant -- the new market -- the bronze boar -- a fifteenth century palace -- old florentine life reconstruct -- where change be few -- s trinità -- ghirlandaio again -- s franci -- the strozzus palace -- clarice de ' medici florence be not simple to the stranger like all very old city build fortuitously it be difficult to learn : the point of the compass be elusive the street be so narrow that the sky be no constant guide the name of the street be often not there the policeman have no high standard of helpfulness there be tram it be true -- too many and too noisy and too near the pavement -- but the name of they outward destination from the center too rarely correspond to any point of interest that one be desire hence one have many embarrassment and even annoyance yet i daresay this be best : a orderly florence be unthinkable since however the tram that be return to the center nearly all go to the duomo either pass it or stop there the tram become one 's best friend and the duomo one 's start point for most excursion suppose ourselves to be there once more let we quickly get through the horrid necessity which confront one in all ancient italian city of see the piazza vittorio emmanuele in a earlier chapter we leave the baptistery and walk along the via calzaiolus again start from the baptistery let we take the via dell ' arcivescovado which be parallel with the via calzaiolus on the right of it and again walk straight forward we shall come almost at once to the great modern square no italian city or town be complete without a piazza vittorio emmanuele and a statue of that monarch in florence the sturdy king bestride he horse here italy be so old and vittorio emmanuele so new it follow in most case that the square or street name after he supplant a older one and if the italian have any memory or imaginative interest in history they would see to it that the old name be not wholly obliterate in florence in order to honor the first king of unite italy much grave violence be do to antiquity for a very picturesque quarter have to be clear away for the huge brasserie store and hotel which make up the west side which in they turn mark the site of the old market where donatello and brunelleschus and all the later artist of the great day do they shopping and meet to exchange ideal and banter and that market in its turn mark the site of the roman forum one of the feature of the old market be the charming loggia di pesce another donatello 's figure of abundance surmount a column this figure be now in the museum of ancient city relic in the monastery of s marco where one confront she on a level instead of look up at she in mid sky but she be very good none the less in talk to elderly person who can remember florence forty and fifty year ago i find that nothing so distress they as the loss of the old quarter for the making of this new spacious piazza and probably nothing can so delight the younger florentine as its possession for have nothing to do in the evening they do it chiefly in the piazza vittorio emmanuele chair and table spring up like mushroom in the roadway among which too few waiter distribute those very inexpensive refreshment which seem to be purchase rather for the right to the seat that they confer than for any stimulation it be extraordinary to the eye of the thriftless english who be never so happy as when they be overpay italian and other caterer in they own country to notice how long these wiser folk will occupy a table on a expenditure of fourpence i do not mean that there be no theater in florence there be many but they be not very good and the young man can do without they curious old theater fade and artificial all apparently build for the comedy of goldonus there be cinema theater too at price which would delight the english public addict to those insidious entertainment but horrify english manager and the teatro salvini at the back of the palazzo vecchio be occasionally transform into a foly bergères -lrb- as it be call -rrb- where one after another comedienne sing each two or three song rapidly to a audience who regard they with apathy and converse without cease the only sign of interest which one observe be the murmur which follow anything a little off the beat track -- a sound that might equally be encouragement or disapproval but a really pretty woman enter a box move they then they employ every note in the gamut and curiously enough the pretty woman in the box be usually as cool under the fusillade as a professional and hardened sister would be a strange music hall this to the english eye where the orchestra smoke and no number be put up and every one talk and the interval seem to be hour long but the florentine do not mind for they have not the english thirst for entertainment and escape they carry they entertainment with they and do not wish to escape -- go to such place only because they be warmer than out of door sit here and watch they ironical negligence of the stage and they interest in each other 's company they animated talk and rapid decision as to the merit and charm of a performer the comfort of they attitude and carelessness -lrb- although never quite slovenliness -rrb- in dress one seem to realize the nation better than anywhere the old fighting passion may have go but much of the quickness the shrewdness and the humor remain together with the determination of each man to have if possible he own way and whether possible or not he own say see they in great number one quickly learn and steadily corroborate the fact that the florentine be not beautiful a pretty woman or a handsome man be a rarity but a dull-looking man or woman be equally rare they be shrewd philosophic cynical and very ready for laughter they look contented also : florence clearly be the best place to be bear in to live in and to die in let all the world come to florence by all means and spend its money there but do not ask florence to go to the world do not in fact ask florence to do anything very much civilization and modern condition have do the florentine no good they destiny be to live in a walled city in turbulent day when the foe come against it or tyranny threaten from within and have to be resist they be then florentine and everything matter to-day they be italian and nothing matter very much moreover it must be galling to have somewhere in the recess of they consciousness the knowledge that they famous city build and cement with they ancestor ' blood be now only a museum when it be fine and warm the music hall do not exist and it be in the piazza vittorio emmanuele that the florentine sit and talk or walk and talk or listen to the band which periodically inhabit a stand near the center and it be here that i watch the reception of the news that italy have declare war on turkey a decision which while it rejoice the national warlike spirit of the populace could not but carry with it a reminder that war have to be pay for six or seven month later i see the return to florence of the first troops from the war and they reception be terrific in the mass they be welcome enough but as soon as unit could be separate from the mass the fun begin for they be carry shoulder high to whatever destination they want they knapsack and rifle fall to proud bearer too while the woman clap from the upper window the shrewd shopkeeper cheer from they doorway and the crowd which follow and surround the hero every moment increase as for the hero they look for the most part a good deal less foolish than englishman would have do but here and there be one whose expression suggest that the turk be nothing to this one poor fellow have he coat drag from he back and tear into a thousand souvenir the restaurant of florence be those of a city where the native be thrifty and the visitor dine in hotel there be one expensive high-class house in the via tornabuonus -- doney e nipoti or doney et neveux -- where the cooking be franco-italian and the chiantus and wine be dear beyond belief and the venerable waiter move with a deliberation which can drive a hungry man -- and one be always hungry in this fine tuscan air -- to despair i like better the excellent old-fashioned purely italian food and chiantus and speed at bonciani 's in the via de panzani close to the station these twain be the best but it be more interesting to go to the huge gambrinus in the piazza vittorio emmanuele because so much be go on all the time one curious florentine habit be quickly discover and resent by the stranger who frequent a restaurant and that be the system of change waiter from one set of table to another so that whereas in london and pari the wise diner be true to a corner because it carry the same service with it in florence he must follow the service but if the restaurant have odd way and a limited range of dish and those not very interesting they make up for it by be astonishingly quick thing be cook almost miraculously the florentine eat little but greediness be not a italian fault no greedy people would have a five-syllabled word for waiter continue along the via dell ' arcivescovado which after the piazza become the via celimana we come to that very beautiful structure the mercato nuovo which however be not so wonderfully new have be build as long ago as 1547-1551 its column and arched roof be exquisitely proportion as a market it seem to be a poor affair the chief commodity be straw hat for the principal food market one have to go to the via d'ariento near s lorenzo and this be i think well worth do early in the morning lover of han andersen go to the mercato nuovo to see the famous bronze boar -lrb- or metal pig as it be call in the translation on which i be bring up -rrb- that stand here on whose back the little street boy have such adventure the boar himself be the work of pietro tacca -lrb- 1586-1650 -rrb- a copy from a ancient marble original now in the uffizus at the top of the entrance stair but the pedestal with its collection of creep thing be modern the florentine who stand in the market niche be bernardo cenninus a goldsmith and one of ghibertus 's assistant who introduce printing into florence in 1471 and begin with a edition of virgil giovannus villanus who be the city 's first serious historian beginning in 1300 and continue till he death in 1348 and michele lando the wool-carder who on July 22nd 1378 at the head of a mob overturn the power of the signory by continue straight on we should come to that crowded and fussy little street which cross the river by the ponte vecchio and eventually become the roman way but let we instead turn to the right this side of the market down the via porta rossa because here be the palazzo davanzatus which have a profound interest to lover of the florentine past in that it have be restore exactly to its ancient state when pope eugenius iv lodge here and have be fill with fourteenth and fifteenth century furniture in those day it be the home of the davizza family the davanzatus buy it late in the sixteenth century and retain it until 1838 in 1904 it be buy by professor elium volpus who restore its ancient condition and present it to the city as a permanent monument of the past here we see a mediaeval florentine palace precisely as it be when its florentine owner live he uncomfortable life there for say what one may there be no question that life must have be uncomfortable in early and late summer when the weather be fine and warm these stone floor and continuous draught may have be solace but in winter and early spring when florentine weather can be so bitterly hostile what then that there be a big fire we know by the smoky condition of michelozzo 's charming frieze on the chimney piece but the room -- i refer to that on the first floor -- be so vast that this fire can have do little for any one but a immediate vis-à-vi and the room moreover be between the open world on the one side and the open court -lrb- now roof in with glass -rrb- on the other with such additional opportunity for draught as the four trap-door in the floor offer it be through these trap that the stone cannon-ball still stack in the window seat be drop or a few gallon of boiling oil pour whenever the city or a faction of it turn against the householder not comfortable you see at least not in we northern sense of the word although to the hardy frugal florentine it may have seem a haven of luxury the furniture of the salon be simple and sparse and very hard a bust here a picture there a color plate a crucifix and a madonna and child in a niche : that be all the decoration save tapestry a hour glass a pepper mill a compass a inkstand stand for utility and quaint and twisted musical instrument and a backgammon board for beguilement in the salle-à-manger adjoining be less light and here also be a symbol of florentine unrest in the shape of a hole in the wall -lrb- beneath the niche which hold the madonna and child -rrb- through which the advance foe who have successfully avoid the cannon ball and the oil might be prod with lance or even fire at the next room be the kitchen curiously far from the well the open to which be in the salon and then a bedroom -lrb- with some gun in it -rrb- and smaller room gain from the central court the rest of the building be the same -- a series of self-contained flat but all dip for water from the same shaft and all depend anxiously upon the success of the first floor with invader at the top be a beautiful loggia with florence beneath it the odd thing to remember be that for the poor of florence who now inhabit house of the same age as the davanzatus palace the condition be almost as they be in the fifteenth century a few change have come in but hardly any myriad of the tenement have no water lay on : it must still be pull up in bucket exactly as here indeed you may often see the top floor at work in this way and there be a row of house on the left of the road to the certosa a little way out of florence with a most elaborate network of bucket rope over many garden to one well similarly one see the occupant of the higher floor draw vegetable and bread in basket from the street and lower the money for they the postman deliver letter in this way too again one of the survival of the davanzatus to which the custodian draw attention be the rain-water pipe like a long bamboo down the wall of the court but one have but to walk along the via lambertesca between the uffizus and the via por s marium and peer into the alley to see that these pipe be common enough yet in fact directly one leave the big street florence be still fifteenth century less color in the costume and a few anachronism such as gas or electric light poster newspaper cigarette and bicycle which dart like dragon fly -lrb- every florentine cyclist be a trick cyclist -rrb- but for the rest there be no change the business of life have not alter the same food be eat the same vessel contain it the same fire cook it the same red wine be make from the same grape in the same vineyard the same language -lrb- almost -rrb- be speak the baby be christen at the same font the parent visit the same church similarly the handicraft can have alter little the coppersmith the blacksmith the cobbler the woodcarver the goldsmith in they yellow smock must be just as they be and certainly the cellar and cavern under the big house in which they work have not change where the change be be among the better-to-do the rich and in the government for no longer be a man afraid to talk freely of politics no longer do he shudder as he pass the bargello no longer be the name of medicus on he lip everything else be practically as it be the via porta rossa run to the piazza s trinità the church of s trinità be we destination for here be some interesting fresco first however let we look at the sculpture : a very beautiful altar by benedetto da rovezzano in the fifth chapel of the right aisle a monument by luca dellum robbium to one of the archbishop of fiesole once in s pancrazio -lrb- which be now a tobacco factory -rrb- in the via della spada and bring here for safe keep -- a beautiful example of luca 's genius not only as a modeller but also as a very treasury of pretty thought for the border of flower and leave be beyond praise delightful the best green in florence -lrb- after nature 's which be see through so many doorway and which splash over so many white wall and mingle with gay fruit in so many shop -rrb- be here in the fifth chapel of the left aisle be a magdalen carve in wood by desiderio da settignano and finish by benedetto da maiano while s trinità now possess but show only on good Friday the very crucifix from s miniato which bow down and bless s gualberto the porphyry tomb of the sassettus in the chapel of that family by giuliano di sangallo be magnificent it be in the sassettus chapel that we find the ghirlandaio fresco of scene in the life of s franci which bring so many stranger to this church the painting which depict s franci receive the charter from the emperor honorius be interesting both for its history and its painting for it contain a valuable record of what the palazzo vecchio and loggia de ' lanzus be like in 1485 and also many portrait : among they lorenzo the magnificent on the extreme right hold out he hand : poliziano tutor of the medicus boy come first up the stair and on the extreme left very probably verrocchio one of ghirlandaio 's favorite painter we find old florence again in the very attractive picture of the resuscitation of the nice little girl in violet a daughter of the spinus family who fall from a window of the spinus palace -lrb- as we see in the distance on the leave this be one of the old synchronize scene -rrb- and be bring to life by s franci who chance to be fly by the scene be intensely local : just outside the church look along what be now the piazza s trinità and the old trinità bridge the spinus palace be still there but be now call the ferronus and it accommodate no longer florentine aristocrat but consul and bank clerk among the portrait in the fresco be noble friend of the spinus family -- albrizzus acciaiolus strozzus and so forth the little girl be very quaint and perfectly ready to take up once more the thread of she life how long she live this second time and what become of she i have not be able to discover she tiny sister behind the bier be even quainter on the left be a little group of the comely florentine lady in whom ghirlandaio so delighted tall and serene with a few youth among they it be interesting to note that ghirlandaio in he s trinità fresco and benedetto da maiano in he s croce pulpit relief choose exactly the same scene in the life of s franci : interesting because when ghirlandaio be paint fresco at san gimignano in 1475 benedetto be at work on the altar for the same church of s fina and they be friend where ghirlandaio and giotto also in s croce also coincide in choice of subject some interesting comparison may be make all to the advantage of giotto in spiritual feeling and unsophisticated charm but by no means to ghirlandaio 's detriment as a fascinating historian in color in the scene of the death of s franci we find ghirlandaio and giotto again on the same ground and here it be probable that the later painter go to the earlier for inspiration for he have follow giotto in the fine thought that make one of the attendant brother glance up as though at the saint 's ascend spirit it be remarkable how with every picture that one see giotto 's completeness of equipment as a religious painter become more marked he hand may have be ignorant of many masterly device for which the time be not ripe but he head and heart know all the patriarch in the spandrel of the choir be by ghirlandaio 's master alessio baldovinettus of whom i say something in the chapter on s marium novellum they once more testify to this painter 's charm and brilliance almost more than that of any other do one regret the scarcity of he work it be fitting that he should have paint the choir for he name-saint s alessio guard the façade of the church the column opposite the church come from the bath of caracallum and be set up by cosimo i upon the attainment of he life-long ambition of a grand-dukeship and a crown the figure at the top be justice s trinità be a good starting-point for the leisurely examination of the older and narrower street a occupation which so many visitor to florence prefer to the study of picture gallery and church and perhaps rightly in no city can they carry on they research with such ease for florence be incurious about they either the florentine be too much engross in they own affair or the peer foreigner have become too familiar a object to merit notice but one may drift about even in the narrowest alley beside the arno east and west and attract few eye and the city here be at its most romantic : between the piazza s trinità and the via por s maria all about the borgo ss apostolus we have just be discuss benedetto da maiano the sculptor if we turn to the leave on leave s trinità instead of lose ourselves in the little street we be in the via tornabuonus where the best shop be and american be the prevail language we shall soon come on the right to a example of benedetto 's work as a architect for the first draft of the famous palazzo strozzus the four-square fortress-home which filippo strozzus begin for himself in 1489 be he benedetto continue the work until he death in 1507 when cronaca who build the great hall in the palazzo vecchio take it over and add the famous cornice the iron lantern and other smithwork be by lorenzo the magnificent 's sardonic friend il caparro of the sign of the burning book of whom i write in the chapter on the medicus palace the first mistress of the strozzus palace be clarice strozzus née clarice de ' medici the daughter of piero son of lorenzo the magnificent she be bear in 1493 and marry filippo strozzus the younger in 1508 during the family 's second period of exile they then live at rome but be allow to return to florence in 1510 clarice 's chief title to fame be she proud outburst when she turn ippolito and alessandro out of the medicus palace she die in 1528 and be bury in s marium novellum the unfortunate filippo meet he end nine year later in the boboli fortezza which he money have help to build and in which he be imprison for he share in a conspiracy against cosimo i cosimo confiscate the palace and all strozzus 's other possession but later make some restitution to-day the family occupy the upper part of they famous imperishable home and beneath there be a exhibition of picture and antiquity for sale no private individual whatever he wealth or ambition will probably ever again succeed in build a house half so strong or noble as this chapter xxiii the pittus luca pittus 's pride -- preliminary caution -- a terrace view -- a collection but not a gallery -- the personally-conducted -- giorgione the superb -- susterman -- the madonna del granduca -- the madonna della sedia -- from cimabue to raphael -- andrea del sarto -- two pope and a bastard -- the ill-fated ippolito -- the national gallery -- royal apartment -- palla subdue the centaur -- the boboli garden the pittus approach from the via guicciardinus be far liker a prison than a palace it be commission by luca pittus one of the proudest and richest of the rival of the medicus in 1441 cosimo de ' medicus as we have see have reject brunelleschus 's plan for a palazzo as be too pretentious and go instead to he friend michelozzo for something that externally at any rate be more modest pittus whose one ambition be to exceed cosimo in power popularity and visible wealth deliberately choose brunelleschus and give he carte blanche to make the most magnificent mansion possible pittus however plot against cosimo 's son piero be frustrated and condemn to death and although piero obtain he pardon he lose all he friend and pass into utter disrespect in the city meanwhile he palace remain unfinished and neglect and continue so for a century when it be acquire by the grand duchess eleanor of toledo the wife of cosimo i who though she see only the beginning of its splendor live there awhile and there bring up she doomed brood eleanor 's architect -- or rather cosimo 's for though the grand duchess pay the grand duke control -- be ammanati the designer of the neptune fountain in the piazza della signoria other important addition be make later the last medicean grand duke to occupy the pittus be gian gastone a bizarre detrimental whose head in a monstrous wig may be see at the top of the stair lead to the uffizus gallery he die in 1737 as i have say in chapter viii it be by the will of gian gastone 's sister widow of the elector palatine who die in 1743 that the medicean collection become the property of the florentine this bequest do not however prevent the migration of many of the best picture to pari under napoleon but after waterloo they come back the pittus continue to be the home of prince after gian gastone quit a world which he find strange and make more so but they be not of the medici blood it be now a residence of the royal family the first thing to do if by evil chance one enter the pittus by the covered way from the uffizus be just before emerge into the palace to avoid the room where copy of picture be sell for not only be it a very catacomb of headache from the fresh paint but the copy be in themselves horrible and lead to disquieting reflection on the subject of sweat labor the next thing to do on at last emerge be to walk out on the roof from the little room at the top of the stair and get a supply of fresh air for the gallery and see florence which be very beautiful from here look over the city one notice that the tower of the palazzo vecchio be almost more dominate than the duomo the work of the same architect who begin this palace between the two be fiesole the signorium tower be as i say the highest then the duomo then giotto 's campanile the bargello be hide but the graceful badium tower be see also the little white baptistery roof with its lantern just show from the fortezza come the sound of drum and bugle return from this terrace we skirt a vast porphyry basin and reach the top landing of the stair -lrb- which be i presume once a loggia -rrb- where there be a very charming marble fountain and from this we enter the first room of the gallery the pittus wall be so congested and so many of the picture so difficult to see that i propose to refer only to those which after a series of visit seem to I the absolute best let I hasten to say that to visit the pittus gallery on any but a really bright day be folly the great window -lrb- which be to be larger than cosimo de ' medicus 's door -rrb- be excellent to look out of but the room be so crowd with painting on wall and ceiling and the curtain be so absorbent of light that unless there be sunshine one grope in gloom the only picture in short that be properly visible be those on screen or hinge and these be fortunately almost without exception the best the pittus room be never make for picture at all and it be really absurd that so many beautiful thing should be mass here without reasonable light the pittus also be always crowd the uffizus be never crowd the accademia be always comfortable the bargello be sparsely attend but the pittus be normally congest not only by individual but by flock whose guide speak broken english and sometimes broken american lead from room to room i need hardly say that they form the tightest knot before the work of raphael all this be proper enough of course but it serve to render the pittus a difficult gallery rightly to study picture in in the first chapter on the uffizus i have say how simple it be in the pittus to name the best picture of all and how difficult in most gallery but the pittus have one particular jewel which throw everything into the background : the work not of a florentine but of a venetian : the concert of giorgione which stand on a easel in the sala di marte -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be true that modern criticism have doubt the lightness of the ascription and many critic whose one idea seem to be to deprive giorgione of any picture at all leave he but a glorious name without anything to account for it call it a early titian but this need not trouble we there the picture be and never do i think to see anything more satisfying piece by piece it be not more than fine rich painting but as a whole it be impressive and mysterious and enchanting pater compare the effect of it to music and he be right the salum dell ' iliade -lrb- the name of each room refer always to the ceiling painting which however one quite easily forget to look at -rrb- be chiefly notable for the raphael just inside the door : la donna gravida no 229 one of he more realistic work with bolder color than usual and harder treatment rather like the picture that have be make its pendant no 224 a incognita by ridolfo ghirlandaio very firmly paint but harder still between they be the first of the many pittus andrea del sartos : no 225 a assumption of the madonna opposite a similar work from the same brush neither contain quite the finest trait of this artist but the youth with outstretched hand at the tomb be nobly do no 265 principe mathias de ' medicus be a good bold susterman but no 190 on the opposite wall be a far better -- a most charming work represent the crown prince of denmark son of frederick iii justus susterman who have so many portrait here and elsewhere in florence be a belgian bear in 1597 who settle in florence as a portrait painter to cosimo iii van dyck greatly admire he work and paint he he die at florence in 1681 no 208 a virgin enthrone by fra bartolommeo be from s marco and it have better have be paint on the wall there like the fra angelico and then the convent would have it still the child be very attractive as almost always in this artist 's work but the picture as a whole have grow rather dingy by the window be a velasquez the first we have see in florence a little philip iv on he prance steed rather too small for its subject but very interesting here among the italian in the next large room -- the salum di saturno -- we come again to raphael who be indeed the chief master of the pittus he exquisite madonna del granduca be just to the left of the door here we have the simplest coloring and perfect sweetness and such serenity of mastery as must be the despair of the copyist who however never cease attempt it the only defect be a little clumsiness in the madonna 's hand the picture be lose for two century and it then change owner for twelve crown the seller be a poor woman and the buyer a bookseller the bookseller find a ready purchaser in the director of the grand duke ferdinand iii 's gallery and the grand duke so esteemed it that he carry it with he on all he journey just as sir george beaumont the english connoisseur never travel without a favorite claude hence its name another andrea del sarto the disputa sulla trinita no 172 be close by nobly draw but again not of he absolute best and then five more raphael or putative raphael -- no 171 tommaso inghiramus no 61 angelo donus the collector and the friend of artist for whom michelangelo paint he holy family in the uffizus no 59 maddalena donus and above all no 174 the vision of ezekiel that little great picture so strong and spirited and -- to coin a word -- sixtinish all these i may say be question by expert but some very fine hand be to be see in they any way over the ezekiel be still another no 165 the madonna detta del baldacchino which be so much better in the photograph next this group -- no 164 -- we find raphael 's friend perugino with a entombment but it lack he divine glow and above it a soft and mellow and easy andrea del sarto no 163 which ought to be in a church rather than here a better perugino be no 42 which have all he sweetness but to call it the magdalen be surely wrong and close by it a rather formal fra bartolommeo no 159 gesu resuscitato from the church of ss annunzia in which once again the baby who hold the circular landscape be the best part after another doubtful raphael -- the sly cardinal divizio da bibbiena no 158 -- let we look at a unquestioned one no 151 the most popular picture in florence if not the whole world raphael 's madonna dellum sedium that beautiful rich scene of maternal tenderness and infantine peace personally i do not find myself often under raphael 's spell but here he conquer the madonna again be without enough expression but she arm be right and the child be right and the color be so rich almost venetian in that odd way in which raphael now and then could suggest venice it be interesting to compare raphael 's two famous madonna in this room : this one belong to he roman period and the other opposite it to florence with the difference so marked for by the time he paint this he know more of life and human affection this picture i suppose might be call the consummation of renaissance painting in fullest bloom : the latest triumph of that impulse i do not say it be the best but it may be call a crown on the whole movement both in subject and treatment think of the gulf between the cimabue madonna and the giotto madonna side by side which we see in the accademia and this with so many vivid sympathy giotto must have want with all he soul to make the mother motherly and the child childlike but the time be not yet he hand be neither free nor fit between giotto and raphael have to come many thing before such treatment as this be possible most of all i think luca della robbia have to come between for he be the most valuable reconciler of god and man of they all he be the first to bring a tender humanity into the church the first to know that a mother 's finger hold a baby sink into its soft little body without luca i doubt if the madonna della sedia could be the idyll of protective solicitude and loving pride that it be the salum di giove bring we to venetian painting indeed and glorious painting too for next the door be titian 's bellum no 18 the lady in the peacock-blue dress with purple sleeve all richly embroidered in gold whom to see once be to remember for ever on the other side of the door be andrea 's brilliant s john the baptist as a boy no 272 and then the noblest fra bartolommeo here a deposition no 64 not good in color but superbly draw and pitiful in this room also be the monk 's great spirited figure of s marco for the convent of that name between they be a tintoretto no 131 vincenzo zeino one of he ruddy old man with a glimpse of venice under a angry sky through the window over the door no 124 be a annunciation by andrea with a slight variation in it for two angel accompany that one who bring the news and the announcement be make from the right instead of the leave while the incident be be watch by some people on the terrace over a classical portico a greater andrea hang next : no 123 the madonna in glory fine but rather formal and like all andrea 's work hall-marked by its woman type the other notable picture be raphael 's fornarina no 245 which be far more venetian than the madonna della sedia and have be give to sebastian del piombo and the venetian group on the right of the door which be not only interesting for its own charm but as be a foretaste of the superb and glorious giorgione in the sala di marte which we now enter here we find a rembrandt no 16 a old man : age and dignity emerge golden from the gloom and as a pendant a portrait with somewhat similar characteristic but softer by tintoretto no 83 between they be a prosperous ruddy group of scholar by ruben who have place a vase of tulip before the bust of seneca and we find ruben again with a sprawling brilliant feat entitle the consequence of war but what those consequence be beyond nakedness one have difficulty in discerning raphael 's holy family no 94 -lrb- also know as the madonna dell ' impanna -rrb- next it might be call the perfection of draw without feel the authority consider it a school piece : that be to say chiefly the work of he imitator the vivacity of the child 's face be very remarkable the best andrea be in this room -- a holy family no 81 which get sweeter and simpler and richer with every glance other andrea be here too notably on the right of the further door a sweet mother and sprawl vigorous child but every andrea that i see make I think more highly of the madonna della sacco in the cloister of ss annunzia van dyck who paint much in italy before settle down at the english court we find in this room with a masterly full-length seat portrait of a astute cardinal but the room 's greatest glory as i have say be the giorgione on the easel in the sala di apollo at the right of the door as we enter be andrea 's portrait of himself a serious and mysterious face shine out of darkness and below it be titian 's golden magdalen no 67 the same ripe creature that we see at the uffizus pose as flora again diffuse venetian light on the other side of the door we find for the first time in florence murillo who have two group of the madonna and child on this wall the better be no 63 which be both sweet and masterly in no 56 the child become a pretty spanish boy play with a rosary and in both he have a faint nimbus instead of the halo to which we be accustom on the same wall be another fine andrea who be most lavishly represent in this gallery no 58 a deposition all gentle melancholy rather than grief the kneel girl be very beautiful finally there be van dyck 's very charming portrait of charle i of england and henrietta a most deft and distinguished work and raphael 's famous portrait of leo x with two companion : rather dingy and too like three person set for the camera but powerful and deeply interesting to we because here we see the first medicus pope leo x lorenzo de ' medicus 's son giovannus who give michelangelo the commission for the medicus tomb and the new sacristy of s lorenzo and in the young man on the pope 's right hand we see none other than giulio natural son of giuliano de ' medici lorenzo 's brother who afterwards become pope as clement vii it be he who lay siege to florence when michelangelo be call upon to fortify it and it be during he pontificate that henry viii throw off the shackle of rome and become the defender of the faith himself a bastard giulio become the father of the base-born alessandro of urbino first duke of florence who after procure the death of ippolito and live a life of horrible excess be himself murder by he cousin lorenzino in order to rid florence of she worst tyrant in he portrait leo x have a illuminate missal and a magnifying glass as indication of he scholarly taste that he be also a good liver he form and feature testify of this picture a interesting story be tell after the battle of pavium in 1525 clement vii wish to be friendly with the marquis of gonzaga a powerful ally of the emperor charle v ask he what he could do for he and gonzaga express a wish for the portrait of leo x then in the medicus palace clement comply but wish to retain at any rate a semblance of the original direct that the picture should be copy and andrea del sarto be choose for that task the copy turn out to be so close that gonzaga never obtain the original at all in the next room -- the salum di venere and the last room in the long suite -- we find another raphael portrait and another pope this time julius ii that pontiff whose caprice and pride together render null and void and unhappy so many year of michelangelo 's life since it be for he that the great julian tomb never complete be design a replica of this picture be in we national gallery here also be a wistful and poignant john the baptist by dossus no 380 two dürers -- a adam and a eve very naked and primitive face each other from opposite wall and two ruben landscape not equal to ours at trafalgar square but spacious and lively the gem of the room be a lovely titian no 92 on a easel a golden work of supreme quietude and disguised power the portrait be call sometimes the duke of norfolk sometimes the young englishman return to the first room -- the salum of the iliad -- we enter the salum dell ' educazione di giove and find on the leave a little gipsy portrait by boccaccio boccaccino -lrb- 1497-1518 -rrb- which have extraordinary charm : a grave wistful childish face in a blue handkerchief : quite a new kind of picture here i reproduce it in this volume but it want its color for the rest the room belong to less-known and later man in particular to cristofano allorus -lrb- 1577-1621 -rrb- with he famous judith reproduce in all the picture shop of florence this work be no favorite of mine but one can not deny it power and richness the guido renus opposite in which a affect fat actress pose as cleopatra with the asp be not however even tolerable we next pass after a glance perhaps at the adjoining tapestry room on the left -lrb- where the bronze cain and abel be -rrb- the most elegant bathroom imaginable fit for anything rather than soap and splash and come to the salum di ulisse and some good venetian portrait : a bearded senator in a sable robe by paolo veronese no 216 and no 201 titian 's fine portrait of the ill-fated ippolito de ' medici son of that giuliano de ' medici duc de nemors whose tomb by michelangelo be at s lorenzo this amiable young man be bring up by leo x until the age of twelve when the pope die and the boy be send to florence to live at the medicus palace with the base-born alessandro under the care of cardinal passerinus where he remain until clarice de ' strozzus order both the boy to quit in 1527 come the third expulsion of the medicus from florence and ippolito wander about until clement vii the second medicus pope be in rome after the sack and join he there he be against he will make a cardinal and send to hungary : clement 's idea be to establish alessandro -lrb- he natural son -rrb- as duke of florence and squeeze ippolito the rightful heir out this clement succeed in do and the repulsive and squalid-minded alessandro -- know as the mule -- be install ippolito in whom this proceeding cause deep grief settle in bologna and take to scholarship among other task translate part of the aeneid into italian blank verse but when clement die and thus liberate rome from a vile tyranny he be with he and protect he corpse from the angry mob that be in 1534 when ippolito be twenty-seven in the following year a number of exile from florence who could not endure alessandro 's offensive way or have be force by he to fly decide to appeal to the emperor charle v for assistance against such a contemptible ruler and ippolito head the mission but before he could reach the emperor a emissary of alessandro 's succeed in poisoning he such be ippolito de ' medici grandson of the great lorenzo whom titian paint probably when he be in bologna in 1533 or 1534 this room also contain a nice little open decorative scene -- like a sketch for a fresco -- of the death of lucrezium no 388 attribute to the school of botticellus and above it a good royal academy andrea del sarto the next be the best of these small room -- the salum of prometheus -- where on sunday most people spend they time in astonishment over the inlaid table but where tuscan art also be very beautiful the most famous picture be i suppose the circular filippino lippus no 343 but although the lively background be very entertaining and the virgin most wonderfully paint the child be a serious blemish the next favorite if not the first be the perugino on the easel -- no 219 -- one of he loveliest small picture with a evening glow among the apennine such as no other painter could capture other fine work here be the fra bartolommeo no 256 over the door a holy family very pretty and characteristic and he ecce homo next it the adorable circular botticinus -lrb- as the catalogue call it although the photographer waver between botticellus and filippino lippus -rrb- no 347 with its myriad rose and child with they little fold hand and the mother and child diffuse happy sweetness which if only it be a little less painty would be one of the chief magnet of the gallery hereabout be many botticellus school picture chief of these the curious girl call foolishly la bellum simonetta which mr berenson attribute to that unknown disciple of botticellus to whom he have give the charming name of amico di sandro this study in brown yellow and gray always have its public other popular botticellus derivative be no 348 and 357 look also at the sly and curious woman -lrb- no 102 -rrb- near the window by ubertinus a new artist here and the pretty jacopo del sellaio no 364 a finely draw s sebastian by pollaiuolo the holy family by jacopo di boateri no 362 with very pleasant color no 140 the incognita which people use to think be by leonardo -- for some reason difficult to understand except on the principle of make the wish father to the thought -- and be now give to bugiardinus and lastly a rich and comely example of lombardy art no 299 from this room we will enter first the corridio delle colonne where cardinal leopoldo de ' medicus 's miniature portrait be hang all remarkable and some superb but unfortunately not name together with a few larger work all very interesting that young goldsmith no 207 which use to be give to leonardo but be now ridolfo ghirlandaio 's be here a franciabigio no 43 a question raphael no 44 a fine and sensitive head of one of the gonzaga family by mantegna no 375 the coarse head of giovannus bentivoglio by da costa no 376 and a pollaiuolo no 370 s jerome whose fine rapt countenance be beautifully draw in the salum della giustizia we come again to the venetian : a noble piombo no 409 the fine aretino and tommaso mostus by titian tintoretto 's portrait of a man no 410 and two good moroni but i be not sure that dosso dossus 's nymph and satyr on the easel be not the most remarkable achievement here i do not however care greatly for it in the sala di flora we find some interesting andrea a beautiful portrait by puligo no 184 and giulio romano 's famous frieze of dancer also a fine portrait by allorus no 72 the end room of all be notable for a ruysdael finally there be the sala del poccetti out of the salum di prometeo which together with the precede two room that i have describe have lately be rearrange here now be the hard but masterly holy family of bronzino who have a enormous amount of work in florence chiefly medicean portrait but nowhere i think reach the level of he allegory in we national gallery or the portrait in the taylor collection sell at christie 's in 1912 here also be four rich poussin two typical salvator rosa landscape and a battle piece from the same hand and by some strange chance a portrait of oliver cromwell by sir peter lely but the stone table again win most attention and here as we leave the last of the great picture collection of florence i would say how interesting it be to the return visitor to london to go quickly to the national gallery and see how we compare with they florence be naturally far richer than we but although only now and then have we the advantage we can valuably supplement in a great many case and the national gallery keep up its quality throughout -- it do not suddenly fall to piece as the uffizus do thus i doubt if florence with all she andrea have so exquisite a thing from he hand as we portrait of a young sculptor so long call a portrait of the painter himself and we have two michelangelo painting to the uffizus 's one in leonardo the louvre be of course far richer even without the gioconda but we have at burlington house the cartoon for the louvre 's s anne which may pair off with the uffizus 's unfinished madonna and we have also at the national gallery he finished virgin of the rock while to burlington house one must go too for michelangelo 's beautiful tondo in piero di cosimo we be more fortunate than the uffizus and we have raphael as important as those of the pittus we be strong too in perugino filippino lippus and luca signorellus while when it come to piero della francesca we lead absolutely we verrocchio or school of verrocchio be a superb thing while we cimabue -lrb- from s croce -rrb- have a quality of richness not excel by any that i have see elsewhere but in botticellus florence win the pittus palace contain also the apartment in which the king and queen of italy reside when they visit florence which be not often florence become the capital of italy in 1865 on the day of the sixth anniversary of the birth of dante it remain the capital until 1870 when rome be choose the room be show thrice a week and be not i think worth the time that one must give to the perambulation beyond this there be nothing to say except that they would delight child visitor be hurry through in small band and dally be discourage hence one be merely tantalize by the presence of they greatest treasure botticellus 's palla subdue the centaur paint to commemorate lorenzo de ' medicus 's successful diplomatic mission to the king of naple in 1480 to bring about the end of the war with sixtus iv the prime instigator of the pazzus conspiracy and the bitter enemy of lorenzo in particular -- whose only fault as he drily express it have be to escape be murder in the cathedral -- and of all tuscany in general botticellus whom we have already see as a medicean allegorist always ready with he glance genius to extol and commend the virtue of that family here make the centaur typify war and oppression while the beautiful figure which be tame and subdue he by reason represent palla or the art of peace here identifiable with lorenzo by the laurel wreath and the pattern of she robe which be compose of he private crest of diamond ring intertwine this exquisite picture -- so rich in color and of such power and impressiveness -- ought to be remove to a easel in the pittus gallery proper the madonna della rosa by botticellus or he school be also here and i have a moment before a very alluring holbein but my memory of this part of the palace be make up of gilt and tinsel and plush and candelabrum with two piece of furniture outstanding -- a blue and silver bed and a dining table rather larger than a lawn-tennis court the boboli garden which climb the hill from the pittus be also open only on three afternoon a week the panorama of florence and the surround apennine which one have from the belvedere make a visit worth while but the garden themselves be from the english point of view poor save in extent and in the grove on the way to the stable -lrb- scuderie -rrb- like all garden where clip walk be the principal feature they want people they be make for people to enjoy they rather than for flower to grow in and at every turn there be a new and charming vista in a green frame it be from the boboli hill-side before it be a garden that much of the stone of florence be quarry with such stone so near it be less to be wonder at that the building be what they be and yet it be wonderful too -- that these little inland italian citizen should so have build they house for all time it prove they to have have great gift of character there be no such building any more the grotto close to the pittus entrance which contain some of michelangelo 's less remarkable prisoner intend for the great julian tomb be so grottesque that the statue be almost lose and altogether it be rather a old rye house affair and though giovannus da bologna 's fountain in the midst of a lake be very fine i doubt if the walk be quite worth it my advice rather be to climb at once to the top at the back of the pittus by way of the amphitheatre where the gentleman and lady use to watch court pageant and past that ingenious fountain above it in which neptune 's trident itself spout water and rest in the pretty flower garden on the very summit of the hill among the lizard there seat on the wall you may watch the peasant at work in the vineyard and the white ox plough in the olive grove in the valley between this hill and s miniato in spring the contrast between the green of the crop and the silver gray of the olive be vivid and gladsome in September one may see the grape be pick and pile into the barrel immediately below and hear the squdge as the wooden pestle be drive into the purple mass and the juice gush out chapter xxiv english poet in florence casa guidi -- the browning -- giotto 's miss spire -- jame russell lowell -- lander 's early life -- fra bartolommeo before raphael -- the tuscan gardener -- the villa landor to-day -- storm on the hillside -- pastoral poetry -- italian memory in england -- the final outburst -- last day in florence -- the old lion 's beguilement -- the famous epitaph on a house in the piazza s felice obliquely face the pittus with window both in the via maggio and via mazzetta be a tablet place there by grateful florence state that it be the home of robert and of elizabeth barrett browning and that she verse make a golden ring to link england to italy in other word this be casa guidi a third member of the family flush the spaniel be also with they and they move here in 1848 and it be here that mr brown die in 1861 but it be not they first florentine home for in 1847 they have go into room in the via delle belle donne -- the street of beautiful lady -- whose name so fascinate ruskin near s marium novellum at casa guidi brown write among other poem christina eve and easter day the statue and the bust of which i have say something in chapter xix and the old picture in florence that philosophic commentary on vasarus which end with the spirited appeal for the crowning of giotto 's campanile with the addition of the golden spire that its builder intend -- fine as the beak of a young beccaccium the campanile the duomo 's fit ally shall soar up in gold full fifty braccium complete florence as florence italy but i suppose that the monologue andrea del sarto and fra lippo lippi would be consider the finest fruit of browning 's florentine sojourn as casa guidi window be of mr brown 's she great poem be indeed as passionate a plea for italian liberty as anything by a italian poet here also she write much if not all of aurora leigh the poem before congress and those other italian political piece which when she husband collect they as last poem he dedicate to ` grateful florence ' in these casa guidi room the happiest day of both life be spend and many a time have the wall resound to the great voice laugh praise or condemn of walter savage landor while the shy hawthorne have talk here too casa guidi lodge not only the browning but at one time lowell who be not however a very good florentine as for picture i find he write in 1874 on a later visit i be tire to death of 'em and then most of they be so bad i like best the earlier one that say so much in they half-unconscious prattle and talk nature to I instead of high art but the older street he say have a noble mediaeval distance and reserve for I -- a frown i be go to call it not of hostility but of haughty doubt these grim palace front meet you with a aristocratic start that put you to the proof of you credentials there be to I something wholesome in that that make you feel you place the browning be the two english poet who first spring to mind in connexion with florence but they have have very illustrious predecessor in August and September 1638 during the reign of ferdinand ii john milton be here and again in the spring of 1639 he read latin poem to fellow-scholar in the city and receive complimentary sonnet in reply here he meet galileo and from here he make the excursion to vallombrosa which give he some of he most famous line he also learn enough of the language to write love poetry to a lady in bologna although he be say to have offend italian generally by he strict morality skip a hundred and eighty year we find shelley in florence in 1819 and it be here that he son be bear receive the name percy florence here he write as i have say he ode to the west wind and that grimly comic work peter bell the third but next the browning it be walter savage landor of whom i always think as the greatest english florentine florence become he second home when he be middle-aged and strong and then again when he be a very old man shipwreck by he impulsive and impossible temper it become he last haven it be brown who find he he final resting-place -- a floor of room not far from where we now stand in the via nunziatina florence be so intimately associate with landor and landor be so happy in florence that a brief outline of he life seem to be imperative bear in 1775 the heir to considerable estate the boy soon develop that whirlwind headstrong impatience which be to make he as notorious as he exquisite genius have make he famous he be send to rugby but disapprove of the headmaster 's judgment of he latin verse he produce such a lampoon upon he also in latin as make removal or expulsion a necessity at oxford he latin and greek verse be still he delight but he take also to politics be call a mad jacobin and in order to prove he sanity and show he disapproval of a person obnoxious to he fire a gun at he shutter and be send down for a year he never return after a period of strained relation with he father and hot repudiation of all the plan for he future which be make for he -- such as enter the militia reading law and so forth -- he retire to wale on a small allowance and write gebir which come out in 1798 when its author be twenty-three in 1808 landor throw in he lot with the spaniard against the french see some fighting and open he purse for the victim of the war but the usual personal quarrel intervene return to england he buy llanthony abbey stock it with spanish sheep plant extensively and be to be the squire of squire and at the same time see a pretty penniless girl at a ball in bath he make a bet he would marry she and win it as a squire he become quickly involve with neighbor -lrb- a inevitable proceeding with he -rrb- and also with a bishop concern the restoration of the church lawsuit follow and such expense and vexation occur that landor decide to leave england -- always a popular resource with he kind he mother take over the estate and allow he a income upon which he travel from place to place for a few year quarrel with he wife and make it up write latin verse everywhere and on everything and come into collision not only with individual but with municipality he settle in florence in 1821 finding room in the palazzo medicus or rather riccardus there he remain for five year which no doubt would have be a longer period have he not accuse he landlord the marquis who be then the head of the family of seduce away he coachman landor write state the charge the marquis call in reply enter the room with he hat on and landor first knock it off and then give notice it be at the palazzo medicus that landor be visit by hazlitt in 1825 and here also he begin the imaginary conversation he best-known work although it be of course such brief and faultless lyric as rise aylmer and to ianthe that have give he he widest public on leave the palazzo landor acquire the villa gherardesca on the hill-side below fiesole and a very beautiful little estate in which the stream affrico rise crabb robinson the friend of so many man of genius who be in florence in 1880 in room at 1341 via della nuova vigna meet landor frequently at he villa and have leave he impression landor have make up he mind to live and die in italy but hate the italian he would rather he say follow he daughter to the grave than to she wedding with a italian husband talk on art he say he prefer john of bologna to michelangelo a statement he repeat to emerson but afterwards i believe recant he say also to robinson that he would not give 1000 pound for raphael 's transfiguration but ten time that sum for fra bartolommeo 's picture of s mark in the pittus next to raphael and fra bartolommeo he love perugino landor soon become quite the husbandman write to he sister in 1831 he say : i have plant 200 cypress 600 vine 400 rose 200 arbutus and 70 bay besides laurustina etc etc and 60 fruit tree of the best quality from france i have not have a moment 's illness since i reside here nor have the child my wife run after cold it would be strange if she do not take they but she have take none here hers be all from florence i have the best water the best air and the best oil in the world they speak highly of the wine too but here i doubt in fact i hate wine unless hock or claret italy be a fine climate but swansea better that however be the only spot in great britain where we have warmth without wet still italy be the country i would live in in two -lrb- year -rrb- i hope to have a hundred good peach every day at table during two month : at present i have have as many bad one my land be say to produce the best fig in tuscany i have usually six or seven bushel of they i have walk through lander 's little paradise -- now call the villa landor and reach by the narrow rugged road to the right just below the village of s domenico its cypress plant as i imagine by lander 's own hand be stately as minaret and its lawn be as green and soft as that of a oxford college the orchard in April be a mass of blossom thrush sing in the evergreen and the first swallow of the year dart through the cypress just as we reach the gate it be truly a poet 's house and garden in 1833 a french neighbor accuse landor of rob he of water by stop a underground stream and landor naturally challenge he to a duel the meeting be avoid through the tact of lander 's second the english consul at florence and the two man become friend at he villa landor write much of he best prose -- the pentameron pericle and aspasium and the trial of shakespeare for deer-stealing -- and he be in the main happy have so much planting and harvesting to do he child to play with and now and then a visitor in the main too he manage very well with the country people but one day be amuse to overhear a conversation over the hedge between two pass contadinus all the english be mad say one but as for this one there be a story of landor current in florence in those day which depict he furious with a spoil dish throw he cook out of the window and then realize where he would fall exclaim in a agony good god i forget the violet such be landor 's impossible way on occasion that he succeed in get himself exile from tuscany but the grand duke be call in as pacificator and though the order of expulsion be not rescind it be not carry out in 1835 landor write some verse to he friend ablett who have lend he the money to buy the villa profess himself wholly happy -- thou knowest how and why be dear to I my citron grove of fiesole my chirping affrico my beechwood nook my naiad with foot only in the brook which run away and giggle in they face yet there they sit nor sigh for other place -- but later in the year come a serious break landor 's relation with mr landor never of such a nature as to give any sense of security have grow steadily worse as he become more explosive and they now reach such a point that he fling out of the house one day and do not return for many year complete the action by a poem in which he take a final -lrb- as he think -rrb- farewell of italy : -- i leave thee beauteous italy no more from the high terrace at even-tide to look supine into thy depths of sky the golden moon between the cliff and I or thy dark spire of fret cypress border the channel of the milky way fiesole and valdarno must be dream hereafter and my own lose affrico murmur to I but the poet 's song landor give he son arnold the villa settle a sum on he wife for the other child 's maintenance and himself return to bath where he add to he friend sir william napier -lrb- who first find a resemblance to a lion in landor 's feature -rrb- john forster who afterwards write he life and charle dickens who name a child after he and touch off he merrier turbulent side most charmingly as leonard boythom in bleak house but he most constant companion be a pomeranian dog in dog indeed he find comfort all he life right to the end landor 's love of he villa and estate find expression again and again in he verse write at this time the most charming of all these charming poem -- the perfection of the light verse of a serious poet -- be the letter from england to he youngest boy speculate on he italian pursuit i begin at the passage describe the villa 's cat : -- do cincirillo follow thee about invert one swart foot suspensively and wag he dread jaw at every chirp of bird above he on the olive-branch frighten he then away 'twa he who slew we pigeon we white pigeon peacock-tail that fear not you and I -- alas nor he i flatten he striped side along my knee and reason with he on he bloody mind till he look blandly and half-close he eye to ponder on my lecture in the shade i doubt he memory much he heart a little and in some minor matter -lrb- may i say it -rrb- could wish he rather sager but from thee god hold back wisdom yet for many year whether in early season or in late it always come high-priced for thy pure breast i have no lesson it for I have many come throw it open then what sport what care -lrb- since there be none too young for these -rrb- engage thy busy thought be you again at work walter and you with those sly labourer geppo giovannus cecco and poeta to build more solidly you broken dam among the poplar whence the nightingale inquisitively watch would you all day long i be not of you council in the scheme or might have save you silver without end and sigh too without number art thou go below the mulberry where that cold pool urge to devise a warmer and more fit for mighty swimmer swim three abreast or art though panting in this summer noon upon the lowest step before the hall draw a slice of watermelon long as cupid 's bow athwart thy wet lip -lrb- like one who play pan 's pipe -rrb- and let drop the sable seed from all they separate cell and leave bay profound and rock abrupt redder than coral round calypso 's cave in 1853 landor put forth what he think he last book under the title last fruit off a old tree unhappily it be not he last for in 1858 he issue yet one more dry stick faggott by w s landor in which be a malicious copy of verse reflect upon a lady he be sue for libel lose the case with heavy damages and once more and for the last time leave england for florence he be now eighty-three at first he go to the villa gherardesco then the home of he son arnold but he outburst be unbearable and three time he break away to be three time bring back in July 1859 he make a fourth escape and then escape altogether for brown take the matter in hand and establish he after a period in siena in lodgings in the via nunziatina from this time till he death in 1864 landor may be say at last to have be at rest he have find safe anchorage and never leave it many friend come to see he chief among they brown who be at once he adviser he admirer and he shrewd observer landor always devote to picture but without much judgment now add to he collection browning in one of he letter to forster tell how he have find he particularly delighted by the acquisition of three execrable daub by domenichino and gaspar poussin most benevolently batter by time another friend say that he have a habit of attribute all he doubtful picture to corregoio he can not brown continue in the least understand that he be at all wrong or injudicious or unfortunate in anything whatever he may profess the thing he really love be a pretty girl to talk nonsense with of the old man in the company of fair listener we have glimpse in the reminiscence of mr field in the atlantic monthly in 1866 she also describe he as in a cloud of picture there with he pomeranian giallo within fondle distance the poet seat in he arm-chair fire comment upon everything giallo 's opinion be ask on all subject and landor say of he that a approve wag of he tail be worth all the praise of all the quarterly it be giallo who lead to the profound couplet -- he be foolish who suppose dog be ill that have hot nose mr field tell how after some classical or fashionable music have be play landor would come closer to the piano and ask for a old english ballad and when auld robin gray he favorite of all be sing the tear would stream down he face ah you do not know what thought you be recall to the troublesome old man but we have browning 's word that he do not spend much time in remorse or regret while there be the composition of the pretty little tender epigram of this last period to amuse he and italian politics to enchain he sympathy he impulsive generosity lead he to give he old and trust watch to the fund for garibaldus 's sicilian expedition but brown persuade he to take it again for garibaldus 's wound prisoner he write a italian dialogue between savonarolum and the prior of s marco the death of mr brown in 1861 send brown back to england and landor after that be less cheerful and rarely leave the house he chief solace be the novel of anthony trollope and gpr jame in he last year he receive a visit from a young english poet and enthusiast for poetry one algernon charle swinburne who arrive in time to have a little glowing talk with the old lion and thus obtain inspiration for some fine memorial stanza on September 17th 1864 death find landor ready -- as nine year earlier he have promise it should -- to my ninth decade i have totter would on and no soft arm bend now my step to steady she who once lead I where she would be go so when he call I death shall find I ready landor be bury as we see in the english cemetery within the city whither he son arnold be bear less than seven year later here be he own epitaph one of the most perfect thing in form and substance in the english language : -- i strove with none for none be worth my strife nature i loved and next to nature art i warm both hand before the fire of life it sink and i be ready to depart it should be cut on he tombstone chapter xxv the carmine and san miniato the human form divine and waxen -- galileo -- bianca capellum -- a faithful grand duke -- s spirito -- the carmine -- masaccio 's place in art -- leonardo 's summary -- the s peter fresco -- the pittus side -- romolum -- a little country walk -- the ancient wall -- the piazzale michelangelo -- a evening prospect -- s miniato -- antonio rossellino 's masterpiece -- the story of s gualberto -- a city of the dead -- the reluctant departure the via maggio be now we way but first there be a museum which i think should be visit if only because it give dickens so much pleasure when he be here -- the museo di storia naturale which be open three day a week only and be always free many visitor to florence never even hear of it and one quickly find that its chief frequenter be the poor all the better for that here not only be the whole animal kingdom spread out before the eye in crowded case but the most wonderful collection of wax reproduction of the human form be to be see these anatomical model be so numerous and so exact that since the human body do not change with the time a medical student could learn everything from they in the most gentlemanly way possible but they need a strong stomach mine i confess quail before the end the hero of the museum be galileo whose tomb at s croce we have see : here be preserved certain of he instrument in a modern floridly decorate tribuna name after he galileo galileus -lrb- 1564-1642 -rrb- belong rather to pisa where he be bear and where he find the lean tower useful for experiment and to rome where in 1611 he demonstrate he discovery of the telescope but florence be proud of he and it be here that he die under circumstance tragic for a astronomer for he have become totally blind the fresco in the tribuna celebrate other italian scientific triumph and in the case be historic telescope astrolabe binoculars and other mystery the via maggio which run from casa guidi to the ponte trinita and at noon be always full of school-girl bring we by way of the via michelozzo to s spirito but by continue in it we pass a house of great interest now no 26 where once live the famous bianca capellum that beautiful and magnetic venetian whom some hold to have be so vile and other so much the victim of fate bianca capellum be bear in 1543 when franci i cosimo i 's eldest son afterwards to play such a part in she life be two year of age while he be be bring up in florence bianca be gain loveliness in she father 's palace when she be seventeen she fall in love with a young florentine engage in a bank in venice and they be secretly marry she family be outrage by the mésalliance and the young couple have to flee to florence where they live in poverty and hide a prize of 2000 ducat be offer by the capellum family to anyone who would kill the husband while by way of show how much in earnest they be they have he uncle throw into prison where he die one day the unhappy bianca be sit at she window when the young prince franci be pass : he look up see she and be enslave on the spot -lrb- the portrait of bianca do not i must admit lay emphasis on this story titian 's i have not see but there be one by bronzino in we national gallery -- no 650 -- and many in florence -rrb- there be however something in bianca 's face to which franci fall a victim and he bring about a speedy meeting at first bianca repulse he but when she find that she husband be unworthy of she she return the prince 's affection -lrb- i be tell she story from the pro-bianca point of view : there be plenty of narrator on the other side -rrb- meanwhile franci 's official life go on he marry that archduchess joanna of austrium for whom the austrian fresco in the palazzo vecchio be paint but he heart remain bianca 's and he be more at she house than in he own at last bianca 's husband be kill in some fray she be free from the persecution of she family and ready to occupy the palace which franci hasten to build for she here in the via maggio now cut up into tenement at a few lira a week the attachment continue unabated when franci come to the throne and upon the death of he archduchess in 1578 bianca and he be almost immediately but privately marry she be then thirty-five and in the next year they be publicly marry in the church of s lorenzo with every circumstance of pomp while later in the same year bianca be crown franci remain she lover till he death which be both dramatic and suspicious husband and wife die within a few hour of each other at the medicus villa of poggium a caiano in 1587 historian have not hesitate to suggest that franci be poison by he wife but there be no proof it be indeed quite possible that she life be more free of intrigue ambition and falsehood than that of any one about the court at that time but the florentine encourage by franci 's brother ferdinand i who succeed he make up they mind that she be a witch and few thing in the way of disaster happen that be not lay to she charge call a woman a witch and everything be possible ferdinand not only detest bianca in life and deplore she fascination for he brother but when she die he refuse to allow she to be bury with the other of the family hence the chapel of the prince at s lorenzo lack one archduchess she grave be unknown the whole truth we shall never know but it be as easy to think of bianca as a harmless woman who both lose and gain through love as to picture she as sinister and scheming at any rate we know that franci be devote to she with a fidelity and persistence for which grand duke have not always be conspicuous s spirito be one of brunelleschus 's solidest work within it resemble the city of bologna in its vista of brown and white arch the effect be severe and splendid but the church be to be take rather as architecture than a treasury of art for although each of its eight and thirty chapel have a altar picture and several have fine piece of sculpture -- one a copy of michelangelo 's famous pieta in rome -- there be nothing of the highest value it be in this church that i be ask alms by one of the best-dressed man in florence but the florentine beggar be not importunate : they ask receive or be deny and that be the end of it the other great church in the pittus quarter be the carmine and here we be on very sacred ground in art -- for it be here as i have have occasion to say more than once in this book that masaccio paint those early fresco which by they innovate boldness turn the brancaccus chapel into a academy for all the artist come to study and copy they : among other michelangelo whose nose be break by the turbulent torrigiano a fellow-student under this very roof tommaso di ser giovannus or masaccio the son of a notary be bear in 1402 he master be not know but tommaso finus or masolino bear in 1383 be often name vasarus state that as a youth masaccio help ghibertus with he first baptistery door and if so the fact be significant but all that be really know of he early life be that he go to rome to paint a chapel in s clemente he return apparently on hearing that he patron giovannus de ' medicus be in power again another friend brunelleschus have build the church of s spirito in 1422 masaccio begin to work there in 1423 when he be only twenty-one masaccio 's peculiar value in the history of painting be he early combined power of apply the law of perspective and represent human being in the round giotto be the first and greatest innovator in painting -- the father of real painting masaccio be the second if from giotto 's influence a stream of vigor have flow such as flow from masaccio 's there would have be nothing special to note about masaccio at all but the impulse which giotto give to art die down some one have to reinvigorate it and that some one be masaccio in he remark on painting leonardo da vincus sum up the achievement of the two they stand out he say from the other of they time by reason of they wish to go to life rather than to picture giotto go to life he follower go to picture and the result be a decline in art until masaccio who again go to life from the carmine fresco come the new painting it be not that wall henceforth be cover more beautifully or suitably than they have be by giotto 's follower probably less suitably very often but that religious symbolism without much relation to actual life give way to scene which might credibly have occur where man woman and saint walk and talk much as we do in similar surroundings with background of city that could be live in and window that could open it be this revolution that masaccio perform no doubt if he have not another would for it have to come : the new demand be that religion should be reconcile with life it be generally suppose that masaccio have masolino as he ally in this wonderful series and a vast amount of ink have be spill over masolino 's contribution indeed the literature of expert art criticism on florentine picture alone be of alarming bulk and astonishing in its affirmation and denial the untutored visitor in the presence of so much scientific variance will be wise to enact the part of the lawyer in the old caricature of the litigant and the cow who while they pull one at the head and the other at the tail fill he bucket with milk in other word the plain duty of the ordinary person be to enjoy the picture without any special knowledge of art one can by remember the early date of these fresco realize what excitement they must have cause in the studio and how tongue must have clack in the old market we have but to send we thought to the spanish chapel at s marium novellum to realize the technical advance masaccio we see be people a visible world the spanish chapel painter be merely allegorize as agent of holiness the ghirlandaio choir in the same church would yield a similar comparison but what we have to remember be that ghirlandaio paint these fresco in 1490 sixty-two year after masaccio 's death and masaccio show he how it be a pity that the light be so poor and that the fresco have not wear better but they force and dramatic vigor remain beyond doubt the upper scene on the left of the altar be very powerful : the roman tax collector have ask christ for a tribute and christ bid peter find the money in the mouth of a fish figure architecture landscape all be in right relation and the drama be move without restlessness this and the s peter preach and distribute alms be perhaps the best but the most popular undoubtedly be that below it finish many year after by filippino lippus -lrb- although there be expert to question this and even substitute he amorous father -rrb- in which s peter challenge by simon magus resuscitate a dead boy just as s zenobius use to do in the street of this city certain more modern touch such as the exquisite filippino would naturally have think of may be see here : the little girl behind the boy for instance who recall the child in that fresco by the same hand at s marium novellum in which s john resuscitate drusiana in this carmine fresco be many portrait of filippino 's contemporary include botticellus just as in the scene of the consecration of the carmine which masaccio paint in the cloister but which have almost perish he introduce brancaccus he employer brunelleschus donatello some of whose innovate work in stone he be do in paint giovannus de ' medicus and masolino the scanty remains of this fresco tell we that it must have be fine indeed masaccio die at the early age of twenty-six have suddenly disappear from florence leave certain work unfinished a strange portentous meteor in art the pittus side of the river be less interesting than the other but it have some very fascinating old and narrow street although they be less comfortable for foreigner to wander in than those for example about the borgo ss apostolus they be far dirtier from the pittus end of the ponte vecchio one can obtain a most charming walk turn to the leave as you leave the bridge under the arch make by cosimo 's passage and you be in the via de ' bardi the back of whose house on the river-side be so beautiful from the uffizus 's central arch as mr morley 's picture show at the end of the street be a archway under a large house go through this and you be at the foot of a steep stone hill it be really steep but never mind take it easily and rest half-way where the house on the left break and give a wonderful view of the city still climb you come to the best gate of all that be leave -- a true gate in be a inlet into a fortified city -- that of s giorgio high on the boboli hill by the fort the s giorgio gate have a s george kill a dragon in stone on its outside and the saint paint within donatello 's conception of he be follow by the artist parsing through you be in the country the fort and garden be on one side and villa on the other and a great hill-side be in front cover with crop do not go on but turn sharp to the left and follow the splendid city wall behind which for a long way be the garden of the villa karolath one of the choicest spot in florence occasionally toss its branch over the top this wall be immense all the way down to the porta s miniato and two of the old tower be still stand in they place upon it botticinus 's national gallery picture tell exactly how they look in they heyday ivy hang over grass and flower spring from the ancient stone and lizard run about underneath be olive-tree it be by the way in the via de ' bardus that george eliot 's romolum live for she be of the bardus family the story it may be remembered begin on the morning of lorenzo the magnificent 's death and end after the execution of savonarolum it be not a inspired romance and be remarkable almost equally for its psychological omission and the convenience of its coincidence but it be a excellent preparation for a first visit in youth to s marco and the palazzo vecchio while the presence in its somewhat naive page of certain florentine character make it agreeable to those who know something of the city and its history the painter piero di cosimo for example be here straight from vasarus so also be cronaca the architect savonarolum capparo the ironsmith and even machiavellus while bernardo del nero the gonfalonier whose death sentence savonarolum refuse to revise be romolum 's godfather the via guicciardinus which run from the foot of the via de ' bardus to the pittus be one of the narrowest and busiest florentine street with a undue proportion of fruit shop overflow to the pavement to give it gay color at no 24 be a stable with pillar and arch that would hold up a pyramid but this be no better than most of the old stable of florence which be all solid vaulted cavern of immense size and strength from the porta romana one may do many thing -- take the tram for example for the certosa of the val d'ema which be only some twenty minute distant or make a longer journey to impruneta where the dellum robbia be but just now let we walk or ride up the long wind viale macchiavellus which curve among the villa behind the boboli garden to the piazzale michelangelo and s miniato the piazzale michelangelo be one of the few modern tribute of florence to she illustrious maker the dante memorial opposite s croce be another together with the preservation of certain building with dante association in the heart of the city but as i have say more than once there be no piazza in florence and only one new street name after a medicus from the piazzale michelangelo you not only have a fine panoramic view of the city of this great man -- in its principal feature not so vastly different from the florence of he day although of course larger and with certain modern addition such as factory chimney railway line and so forth -- but you can see the remains of the fortification which he construct in 1529 and which keep the imperial troops at bay for nearly a year just across the river rise s croce where the great man be bury and beyond over the red roof the dome of the medicus chapel at s lorenzo show we the position of the biblioteca laurenziana and the new sacristy both build by he immediately below we be the church of s niccolo where he be say to have hide in 1529 when there be a hue and cry for he in the middle of this spacious plateau be a bronze reproduction of he david and it be good to see it from the cafe behind it rise head and shoulder above the highest apennine s miniato the church on the hill-top above the piazzale michelangelo deserve many visit one may not be too greatly attach to marble façades but this little temple defeat all prejudice by its radiance and perfection and to its extraordinary charm its situation add it crown the hill and in the late afternoon -- the ideal time to visit it -- be full in the eye of the sun bath in whose light the green and white façade with miracle of delicate intarsium be balm to the eye instead of be as marble so often be dazzling and cold on the way up we pass the fine church of s salvatore which cronaca of the palazzo vecchio and palazzo strozzus build and michelangelo admire and which be now secularize and pass through the gateway of michelangelo 's upper fortification s miniato be one of the oldest church of florence some of it eleventh century it have its name from minias a roman soldier who suffer martyrdom at florence under decius within one do not feel quite to be in a christian church the effect partly of the unusual color all gray green and gold and soft light tint as of bird ' bosom partly of the ceiling which have the bright hue of a russian toy partly of the forest of great gay column partly of the lovely and so richly decorate marble screen and partly of the absence of a transept the prevail feeling indeed be gentle gaiety and in the crypt this be intensify for it be just a joyful assemblage of dancing arch the church as a whole be beautiful and memorable enough but its detail be wonderful too from the niello pavement and the translucent marble window of the apse to the famous tomb of cardinal jacopo of portugal and the luca della robbia relief of the virtue this tomb be by antonio rossellino it be not quite of the rank of mino 's in the badium but it be a noble and beautiful thing mark in every inch of it by modest and exquisite thought vasarus say of antonio that he practice he art with such grace that he be value as something more than a man by those who know he who well-nigh adore he as a saint face it be a delightful annunciation by alessio baldovinettus in which the angel declare the news from a far greater distance than we be accustom to and the ceiling be make a abode of gladness by the blue and white figure -lrb- design by luca dellum robbium -rrb- of prudence and chastity moderation and fortitude for all of which quality it seem the cardinal be famous in short one can not be too glad that since he have to die death 's dart strike down this portuguese prelate while he be in rossellino 's and luca 's city no longer be preserve here the miraculous crucifix which standing in a little chapel in the wood on this spot bestow blessing and pardon -- by bend towards he -- upon s giovannus gualberto the founder of the vallombrosan order the crucifix be now in s trinita the saint be bear in 985 of noble stock and assume naturally the splendor and arrogance of he kind he brother hugo be murder in some affray giovannus take upon himself the duty of avenge the crime one good Friday he chance to meet near this place the assassin in so narrow a passage as to preclude any chance of escape and he be about to kill he when the man fall on he knee and implored mercy by the passion of christ who suffer on that very day add that christ have pray on the cross for he own murderer giovannus be so much impressed that he not only forgive the man but offer he he friendship enter then the chapel to pray and ask forgiveness of all he sin he be amaze to see the crucifix bend down as though acquiesce and blessing and this special mark of favor so work upon he that he become a monk himself shave he head for that purpose and defy he father 's rage and subsequently found the vallombrosan order he die in 1073 i have say something of the s croce habit and the s marium novellum habit but i think that when all be say the s miniato habit be the most important to acquire there be nothing else like it and the sense of height be so invigorating too at all time of the year it be beautiful but perhaps best in early spring when the highest mountain still have snow upon they and the neighbouring slope be cover with tender green and white fruit blossom and here the violet wistarium bloom and there the sombre crimson of the judas-tree behind and beside the church be a crowded city of the florentine dead reproduce to some extent the city of the florentine living in its closely packed habitation -- the detach palace for the rich and the great congery of cell for the poor -- more of which be be build all the time there be a certain melancholy interest in wander through these silent street peer through the window and recognize over the vault name famous in florence one learn quickly how bad modern mortuary architecture and sculpture can be but i notice one monument with some sincerity and unaffected grace : that to a charitable marchesa a friend of the poor at the foot of whose pedestal be a girl and baby do simply and well better perhaps to remain on the highest point and look at the city beneath one should try to be there before sunset and watch the apennine turn to a deeper and deeper indigo and the city grow dimmer and dimmer in the dusk florence be beautiful from every point of vantage but from none more beautiful than from this eminence as one reluctantly leave the church and pass again through michelangelo 's fortification gateway to descend one have frame in its portal a final lovely apennine scene historical chart of florence and europe 1296-1564 artist ' date 1300
